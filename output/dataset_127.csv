2767386,R v Basanovic and ors (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1085,"Judgment


	
	The deceased’s wife Suzana Mitrovic was in the witness box being asked questions about telephone conversations the deceased had the night before he was killed. The following evidence was given:
	


Q. Were you able to hear anything that Steve said during the conversation with Sam Cassaniti?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you hear him say?

A. Something to the effect of ""Fucking Frank, he's ringing me. Did you or did you not give him his money"".

Q. When Steve was talking to Sam, how did he sound?

A. Angry.

Q. After the conversation with Sam Cassaniti did you then have a conversation with Steve?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you remember him saying?

A. ""Fucking junkie cunt"".

KORN: I object to this, if your Honour please.


	
	As the transcript makes clear, objection was taken although the particular question had been answered. It was made clear, nevertheless, that the issue was a wider one which would involve the whole of the evidence of Sam Cassaniti who was the deceased’s accountant. The wider issue was the relevance of a debt allegedly owed by the deceased to Frank Bacic.
	
	
	Objection was also taken on the basis that the statement by the deceased was hearsay. However, the evidence is admissible notwithstanding it is hearsay by virtue of s 65(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) because the representation was made by a person who is not available to give evidence and the representation was made shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication or was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable.
	
	
	The argument concerning the relevance of the evidence about the debt widened into a criticism that the Crown had not identified in opening the relationship between the disputed debt and the joint criminal enterprise alleged against the accused to kill and to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	It was apparent from the Crown’s opening that the disputed debt was the background to explain why the accused attended at the deceased’s premises on 15 January 2013. The Crown opened that on the night before the shooting Frank Bacic telephoned the deceased and mentioned the outstanding money. Mr Bacic asked the deceased if he would be at work the following day.
	
	
	On the following day Mr Bacic arrived at the deceased’s premises with Wade Basanovic and two other persons. Mr Bacic went upstairs alone and exchanged words with the deceased. He went downstairs and then went back up again and spoke again to the deceased. The deceased then went downstairs where he had a conversation with Wade Basanovic and others. That conversation became heated. When the deceased returned to go back up to his office Wade Basanovic made the phone call to his father who arrived shortly afterwards.
	
	
	During the argument about the evidence which was objected to the Crown made it clear that the joint criminal enterprise was not to go to the deceased’s premises in relation to the debt. The Crown said that the joint criminal enterprise was the agreement to kill but the debt provided the background and the explanation for the presence of the accused at the deceased’s premises. The Crown said that the joint criminal enterprise came into play no later than when the phone call was made from Wade Basanovic to his father. It may have come into play at an earlier time, particularly because all of those involved and others were seen in the two vehicles that arrived at the deceased’s premises at the petrol station a little earlier.
	
	
	Mr Korn of counsel for Michael Basanovic argued that until the Crown made clear the relationship between the disputed debt and the joint criminal enterprise he was not in a position to know what needed to be cross examined about. In that way he said he was prejudiced. His submissions were largely supported by Mr Edwards of counsel for Wade Basanovic.
	
	
	Mr Terracini of senior counsel for Brian Brown said that if the Crown’s case was that the joint criminal enterprise came into existence shortly before the deceased was confronted then he would be objecting to any of the evidence about the disputed debt being admitted against Mr Brown because there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Brown was aware of the conversations about a debt owing to Mr Bacic, particularly when the Crown was not calling that witness.
	
	
	The principal matter for me to determine at the present time is the admissibility of the evidence of Mrs Mitrovic regarding the conversation she had with her husband the night before he was killed and the admissibility of Mr Cassaniti’s evidence concerning the debt owed to Mr Bacic. The objection is relevance.
	
	
	Mrs Mitrovic has, in any event, given evidence which was not objected to that Frank had rung about the money said to be owed. The evidence is clearly relevant because it provides the background to explain why the accused were present at the deceased’s premises on 15 January 2013. It is conceivable that the debt was being used as a ruse so that the accused and others could be assured that the deceased would be at his premises. It might, on the other hand, have been a legitimate enquiry by Mr Bacic but there may have been another purpose or the purpose for the accused going to the premises might have changed after the telephone conversation of the night before. At the present time there is sufficient, on the basis of the Crown’s opening, for the jury to infer that at least one purpose for the attendance of Mr Bacic and the accused at the deceased’s premises was the debt since Mr Bacic and the deceased had two conversations themselves after the various persons arrived at the deceased’s premises.
	
	
	The objections being made about the relationship between the disputed debt and the criminal enterprise are tending to confuse the motive that the accused might have had for being involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the formation of the enterprise itself. In the same way as motive is not an element of the offence of murder, neither is motive an essential feature to establish a joint criminal enterprise. The Crown is under no obligation to point to a motive for a joint criminal enterprise although an absence of a motive might weaken any inferences that are asked to be drawn from a joint criminal enterprise that does not rely on express arrangements.
	
	
	I do not consider that there is any unfairness arising from the Crown’s opening, particularly in the light of the clarification that was made during the course of argument yesterday and in what has been said by the Crown this morning.
	
	
	The evidence of Mrs Mitrovic and the evidence of Mr Cassaniti are admissible.

2767388,"Nguyen, Kathy v R [2015] NSWCCA 209","Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: The applicant, Kathy Nguyen, seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon her by the District Court (Blackmore DCJ) on 6 September 2013. On that date, in accordance with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, an aggregate sentence in respect of three prohibited drug offences was imposed of 11 years and 4 months imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years with an additional parole period of 3 years and 4 months. The aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant was backdated to commence on 19 April 2012, the date upon which she was arrested in Western Australia.
	
	
	The non-parole period of 8 years represents approximately 70.5% of the total aggregate term. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 18 April 2020.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to the following offences:
	


Count 1: Supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 3 August 2011 (s 25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment, standard non-parole period of 10 years).

Count 2: Supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 25 August 2011 (s 25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment, standard non-parole period of 10 years).

Count 3: Supply pseudoephedrine on 25 August 2011 (s 25(1) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty: 15 years).


	
	The sentencing judge indicated the sentences that would have been imposed, had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence, which were as follows:
	



	
	A total sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years with an additional term of 2 years 6 months (Count 1).
	
	
	A total sentence of 9 years imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years with an additional term of 3 years (Count 2).
	
	
	A fixed term of 2 years imprisonment (Count 3).
	


Ground of Appeal


	
	The ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant was in the following terms:
	


1)   The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance because there is a marked disparity between her sentence and the sentence imposed on a co-offender, Brendon Tran. The disparity is manifest in two ways:

a)   The starting point for the sentence imposed on the applicant was too high because it failed to properly reflect additional, objectively serious, offences committed by Tran and also failed to reflect the applicant’s more compelling subjective circumstances.

b)   The applicant received a utilitarian discount for her guilty plea of 12.5%. In contrast, Tran received a utilitarian discount for his guilty plea of 17.5%. The lesser discount on the applicant’s sentence was not explained by the sentencing judge and was not justified by any material difference in the proceedings.


	
	The applicant’s co-offender, Tran, was sentenced by Blackmore DCJ, along with another related offender, Lan Ngoc Ly. The sentence that was imposed on Tran is the basis relied upon for the applicant’s contention in this application in relation to disparity of sentences.
	


The Proceedings on Sentence


	
	The sentence proceedings took place on 9 August 2013. Agreed Facts (Exhibit A) were tendered which set out the relevant facts in relation to each of the offences.
	
	
	On 3 August 2011, the co-offender Tran and the applicant met in Sydney. Tran primarily resided in Perth but also had an apartment in Sydney. The conversations between Tran and the applicant were recorded by a listening device. The conversations are set out in detail in the Facts on Sentence. The conversations contemplated the supply and trafficking of prohibited drugs between Sydney and Perth. The outcome was that an agreement was reached that Tran would purchase half a kilogram of methylamphetamine and a sample of another drug from the applicant. Tran and the applicant discussed the business of selling and transporting the drugs, methods for contacting each other throughout the transaction and the use of “workers” to assist in the arrangement. The Facts on Sentence extracted parts of the recorded conversations between the applicant and Tran.
	
	
	The next day Tran was observed leaving his apartment in Sydney and travelling to the airport and boarding a plane to Perth. Subsequently 244.5 grams of N N-dimethylamphetamine was located in Tran’s Sydney apartment. Twenty-seven grams of the same drug was located in Tran’s Perth residence. A further 121.4 grams of methylamphetamine was located at Tran’s Perth residence. It was not disputed by the applicant that she had supplied the methylamphetamine to Tran.
	
	
	Tran again travelled to Sydney and met with Nguyen on 24 August 2011. Again, their conversations were recorded by a listening device. On this occasion Tran and the applicant discussed commercial quantities of high purity drugs to be sourced by the applicant and transported to Western Australia for supply by Tran.
	
	
	During this meeting Tran paid the applicant $240 000 cash in return for almost one kilogram of crystal methylamphetamine supplied by her. The applicant also supplied Tran with 89.3 grams of pseudoephedrine. At approximately 11pm a third person, Ly, arrived at Tran’s apartment. Tran and the applicant instructed Ly on how to conceal drugs on her person.
	
	
	The recorded conversations between the applicant and Tran demonstrate the role each of them was to play in the applicant’s supply of the methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine to Tran: Facts on Sentence at [16].
	
	
	The next morning Tran and Ly departed in a taxi to the airport. The taxi was intercepted by the police who searched Tran and Ly and found two bags of crystal methylamphetamine in Tran’s possession, as well as 89.3 grams of pseudoephedrine and other items. A number of sealed plastic bags containing crystal methylamphetamine were found strapped to Ly’s person. The combined weight of the methylamphetamine found on Tran and Ly was 977 grams.
	
	
	Both Tran and Ly were interviewed. Tran, in his ERISP, stated that the drug was supplied to him by the applicant to be transported to Perth.
	


Sentencing of Tran


	
	Tran was sentenced prior to the applicant by Blackmore DCJ, namely, on 31 May 2013 following his pleas of guilty. He was sentenced in respect of the following offences:
	



	
	Supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (977.7 grams) on 25 August 2011.
	
	
	Two counts of possession of prohibited weapons on 25 August 2011, being a .38 pistol and a sawn off shot-gun, each located by police after a search of his Haymarket unit.
	



	
	It is noted that Count 1 on the Tran indictment corresponded with Count 2 on the applicant’s indictment.
	
	
	As noted in the Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [27], the firearm offences in Counts 2 and 3 on the Tran indictment involved significant additional criminality which was not charged against the applicant.
	
	
	Tran additionally asked the Court to take into account three further offences of supplying prohibited drugs on a Form 1 on sentence. These offences were:
	



	
	Supplying a commercial quantity of N, N-Dimethylamphetamine (about 500 grams) on 3 August 2011.
	
	
	Supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) on 3 August 2011.
	
	
	Supplying a prohibited drug (89.3 grams of pseudoephedrine) on 26 August 2011.
	



	
	As also noted in the Outline of Submissions for the Applicant, each offence on the Form 1 involved conduct that was also charged against the applicant, although there were differences in the approach taken in respect of prosecutions. In that respect it was noted at [28] of the Outline of Submissions that:
	


“i)   Although there was some inconsistency in the quantities referred to, it appears that Offences 1 and 2 on the Form 1 correspond with Count 1 on the applicant’s indictment.

ii)   Offence 3 on the Form 1 corresponded with Count 3 on the applicant’s indictment.”


	
	In his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence in Tran’s case, his Honour observed at p 8 that “The Form 1 offences tend to prove that the offender is in fact a significant dealer in drugs…this offence is well above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences”.  His Honour found that the firearms offences were within the middle range of seriousness.
	
	
	His Honour turned to Tran’s subjective case which was said to be “limited”: ROS (Tran) before making the following observations at pp 7-8:
	


“This is the first offence for the offender. I note that there are pleas of guilty in the matter. Perhaps of more significance is the fact that the offender has signed an undertaking to give evidence against a co-offender. He has also given additional information to the police about that individual that led to her being charged and has resulted ultimately in a plea of guilty in her case. It is submitted that his assistance to authorities has been of the highest order. I have read the statements provided and considered the other evidence in the case with regard to this assistance. I do not propose to outline it in any more detail. It is assistance of a very high order.”


	
	His Honour determined that the appropriate starting point for Tran’s sentence was 14 years. He proceeded to impose an aggregate sentence on the basis of a combined 42.5% discount for Tran’s guilty pleas and assistance to authorities: ROS (Tran) at p 9. Tran was accordingly sentenced for a total 8 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years, 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years, 3 months.
	


Submissions on the Applicant’s Sentence


	
	During the sentence hearing, on the question of the applicant’s role in the offences, it was submitted on her behalf that she was “a middle-person”, whose role was above that of a courier but below that of a principal and whose role was certainly less than that of Mr Tran: T 9 August 2013 at p 4:25-30.
	
	
	For the Crown it was submitted that the applicant was to be seen as ‘an equal participant’ with Tran. It was submitted that:
	


“…They [Tran and the applicant] are to be seen as equals for these reasons. When you go through the details of what is said by Nguyen during the recorded messages on 3 and 4 August and 24 and 25 August, Tran is not calling the shots any more than Nguyen is, they are equals. Nguyen is the one who supplies the drugs, and if there is any question about whether she was procured or what level of procurement from Tran there existed on 3 August, there can be no question about that sort of thing from 24 and 25 August. Nguyen is in the thick of it as much as Tran, and for the purposes of what she is being sentenced on they are equals in the Crown’s submission” (T 9 August 2013 at p 7:25-35).


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. She had been interviewed by Mr Watson-Munro, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, who provided a report dated 12 June 2013 (Exhibit 1) which was tendered at the sentence hearing. Submissions were made on behalf of the applicant as to her subjective circumstances and particularly her drug and gambling problems on the basis of this report: T 9 August 2013 at pp 5-6, 9-10. Attention was drawn to the fact that the applicant was a single mother with three young children, that she was a first time offender and that there was evidence in the report of both a gambling addiction and a drug addiction: T 9 August 2013 at p 6. It was submitted that she had been in serious debt at the time of offending and that she had a very strong incentive to rehabilitate and not to re-offend: T 9 August 2013 at p 6. A letter from the applicant’s oldest son was also tendered at the sentence hearing and became Exhibit 2.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s subjective case, the Crown submitted that the report of Mr Watson-Munro could not mitigate the penalty to be imposed to any significant degree by reason of the diagnoses referred to in that report. In particular, the Crown observed the diagnoses of Major Depression, Anxiety Disorder, Substance Abuse Disorder and gambling addiction, could not be said to have had any bearing on the applicant’s decision to commit the offences: T 9 August 2013 at p 8.
	
	
	No submission was made by the Crown at the hearing as to the discount to be awarded for the plea of guilty.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The sentencing judge stated that the offences committed by the applicant were “very serious”: ROS at p 3.
	
	
	His Honour observed:
	


“… they demonstrate drug dealing at a high level, they involve the transportation of drugs over state lines. The quantities involved are also high. The facts reveal that the purity level of the drugs was high as well. All in all, the offender’s involvement in these offences shows that she was a major drug dealer and supplier of reasonably large quantities of drugs. The quantity of the supplies was such that they were above the middle range of seriousness for the two major offences. I note the pleas of guilty in both cases and therefore find that the standard non-parole period does not have to be applied here. However, the standard non-parole period remains as a guide to the sort of penalty that should be applied. The offender has no criminal record. She is entitled to some additional leniency on sentences, based on her prior good character.” (ROS at p 3).


	
	His Honour noted that the applicant was a 34 year old Vietnamese woman. At the time of the offences she was 32 years of age. She had three children, the eldest of whom was then 14 years.
	
	
	His Honour also had regard to other subjective factors. The applicant provided Mr Watson-Munro with a history that she had commenced using the drug “ice” as a means of combating her depression. She claimed in the history to him that she became involved in the enterprise in question of selling drugs as a result of her gambling debts. In addition, his Honour noted that she said that she had been offered $10,000 to become involved. His Honour in that respect observed:
	


“… to my mind, the facts of the case clearly put a lie to that statement. The offender was well and truly acquainted with the methodology of drug dealing, including the transporting of drugs. I do not know how she became involved initially, but however that was, she had by the time of these offences become a large-scale dealer in drugs.” (ROS at p 4)


	
	His Honour further observed that she had claimed that she had gambled to excess and used drugs but he considered that such factors:
	


“… must necessarily represent relatively minor considerations when dealing with offences of the seriousness of these particular offences. These offences are ones for which general deterrence requires significant sentences to be imposed.” (ROS at p 4)


	
	His Honour accepted that the offender was remorseful as to her offending. He observed that her three young children would be separated for many years to come. He accepted that her prospects of rehabilitation were good.
	
	
	The sentencing judge clearly turned his mind to the question of parity between the applicant and Mr Tran. He rejected the submission that her role in the relevant drug offences was less than that played by Mr Tran, stating that:
	


“… from my reading of the facts she was at least an equal player with Mr Tran in relation to these offences … In that regard, the role of the offender is comparable to that of Mr Tran.” (ROS at p 4)


	
	His Honour referred to the sentence he had imposed on Tran and noted that the starting point prior to applying discounts in relation to Tran had been 14 years imprisonment. This was in circumstances where Tran had been sentenced “for some additional matters of some seriousness” and had some matters dealt with on a Form 1: ROS at p 5.
	
	
	It was stated by His Honour in relation to the applicant that “…having regard to the facts of this case and taking into account Mr Tran’s sentence, had these matters gone to trial a sentence of at least 13 years’ imprisonment would have been applied”: ROS at p 5. Thirteen years was thus used as the starting point. His Honour indicated that the sentence was to be reduced by 12.5% to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the applicant’s plea of guilty: ROS at p 5.
	
	
	As the above discussion indicates, relevant factors in the applicant’s subjective case were taken into account by the sentencing judge, including in particular, on the finding made of special circumstances. Special circumstances were found by reason of the fact that it was the applicant’s first time in custody, prison was difficult for her and her children wanted her home as soon as possible. Additionally, she had a gambling addiction which it was considered might be amenable to treatment on release: ROS at p 5.
	
	
	His Honour emphasised again, at the conclusion of his Remarks, the very serious nature of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced: ROS at p 6.
	


Submissions on Appeal

Applicant’s Submissions


	
	The applicant’s submissions were based on what was contended to be a marked disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on her co-offender Tran.
	
	
	Mr D Jordan SC of counsel, who appeared in this Court with Mr D Barrow of counsel on behalf of the applicant, prepared a document which helpfully set out the relevant procedural history of the proceedings concerning the applicant and the proceedings concerning Tran. The document, as discussed below, is of assistance in relation to Ground 1(b).
	
	
	It was submitted for the applicant that it is clear that Tran was sentenced on the basis of a substantially greater level of criminal conduct than that of the applicant. Though Tran was not sentenced directly for the offences taken into account on the Form 1, it was observed that they must still have been taken into account in determining the sentence of Count 1 on Tran’s indictment. Given the seriousness of the Form 1 offences, this ought to have resulted in a significant increase in the sentence imposed for that principal offence: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [33]-[34]. Further, the applicant pointed to the seriousness of the firearms offences with which Tran was charged and submitted that the additional criminality of these offences must have been taken into account by the judge in determining his sentence: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [36].
	
	
	It was additionally submitted that the applicant’s subjective case was much more compelling than Tran’s, she having experienced social disadvantage, addiction problems which were said to have impaired her judgment and financial problems which were said to have motivated her criminal activity:  Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [38].
	
	
	It was submitted in the Applicant’s Outline of Submissions that:
	


“39.   The starting point for the sentence imposed on the applicant was 13 years, only one year less than the 14 year starting point for Tran’s sentence. In all of the circumstances, this one year difference does not properly reflect the significantly greater extent of Tran’s offending and the applicant’s more compelling subjective case.

40.   Consequently, the sentence imposed on the applicant involves marked disparity and gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant: Green & Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [30]-[32]; Yousif v R [2014] NSWCCA 180 at [26]-[28].”


	
	In oral submissions before this Court, Senior Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the comparison, for the purposes of parity, could not be “direct” because of the differences in the way the indictments against Tran and the applicant had been framed: T 28 April 2015 at pp 3-4. It was nonetheless submitted that Tran was being sentenced for “significant additional criminality” and, for that reason, the starting point for the sentence imposed on the applicant was too high.
	
	
	It was additionally submitted that:
	


“In the circumstances, accepting as we do, that it is not a direct comparison, accepting that the entirety of the applicant’s criminality was also dealt with for Tran and, in addition, there were two firearms offences which…his Honour indicates, were made more serious because they are firearms possessed by a drug dealer and which his Honour assessed at the mid-level of seriousness for those kinds of offences which attract a 14 year maximum penalty, when you take that matter into account, that significant additional criminality begins to give rise to a marked disparity and a justifiable sense of grievance” (T 28 April 2015 at p 5: 4-12.)


	
	It was submitted at the hearing that the applicant’s subjective case was stronger than Tran’s case “on any view”: T 28 April 2014 at p 6: 10-50.
	
	
	As to the difference in the sentencing judge’s approach to the discounts to be applied for pleas of guilty by the applicant and Tran, the applicant submitted that both offenders’ pleas were entered at relatively early stages in the proceedings. The following comparison was made in the Outline of Submissions for the Applicant:
	


“42   A period of around 1 year and 9 months elapsed from the time Tran was charged to the time he was sentenced. He pleaded guilty approximately 1 year and 2 months after he was charged.

43   For the applicant, around 1 year and 5 months passed from the time she was charged to the time she was sentenced. She indicated that she was pleading guilty approximately 8 months after she was charged.”


	
	It was submitted that the applicant should have at least received the same discount of 17.5% received by Tran for the value of her guilty pleas: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [45]. If there was a valid reason for a distinction in the discounts applied, it should have been the applicant whose discount was larger, given that the utilitarian value of her plea would have been of greater value: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [44].
	
	
	In oral submissions it was stated that:
	


“The justifiable sense of grievance is best founded in the absence of an explanation for what is, on the face of both remarks, a significant difference sounding in around about 6 months time in custody, by our calculations. That is not justified by the objective circumstances of the offence and, most importantly, with respect to his Honour, is not explained” (T 28 April 2015 at 12:15-20).


	
	It was also submitted for the applicant that the difference in the discounts afforded may have been an unfortunate oversight: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [44].
	


Crown Submissions


	
	In relation to Ground 1(a), which contends that the starting point for the sentences imposed by his Honour were too high, the Crown made four submissions as follows:
	



	
	That the applicant’s role was at least equal to that of Tran. It was noted that she was the supplier of the drugs and that she was, on the Agreed Facts, clearly able to supply Tran with “very significant amounts of drugs of very high purity”: Crown Written Submissions at [18].
	
	
	That the distinction between the applicant having each supply offence charged separately on her indictment and Tran having the benefit of the other supply related offences being placed on a Form 1 amounts to a relevant difference in the sentences of the co-offenders: Crown Written Submissions at [19].
	
	
	That the starting points could not have been too high, given that higher starting points were open ‘given the seriousness of the offending, the maximum penalties and the relevant standard non-parole periods as legislative guideposts.’ Higher starting points for the sentences were clearly contemplated by the sentencing judge who said that the starting points would be “at least” 14 years for Tran and “at least” 13 years for the applicant. It was also noted by the Crown that Mr Tran had appealed his sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal (Tran v R [2014] NSWCCA 85) where his sentence had been expressly found not to have been too high, with members of the Court observing that higher starting points would have been open: Crown Written Submissions at [20].
	
	
	That the subjective case advanced for the applicant at the sentencing hearing had been rejected by the sentencing judge. In the Crown’s Written Submissions at [21] it was argued:
	


“His Honour was plainly unimpressed with the arguments advanced by the applicant and repeated in this court that she had been ‘led into’ drug dealing at such a high level because of gambling and addiction in circumstances where she did not give evidence and where the agreed facts betrayed her deep involvement in and familiarity with large scale drug dealing.”


	
	In essence, the Crown’s submission was that there was a relevant difference in the criminality of the applicant compared to Mr Tran as a result of their different roles, and this difference had been appropriately reflected by the sentencing judge in the different starting points adopted: Crown Written Submissions at [27].
	
	
	In relation to Ground 1(b), of the Grounds of Appeal, concerning the differences in the discounts awarded to Tran and the applicant for their respective guilty pleas, the Crown submitted that that there is no presumption or entitlement to a particular discount following a plea of guilty, and that the decision in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 does not have the effect of creating such a presumption: Crown Written Submissions at [23] referring to Hallak v R [2014] NSWCCA 48 at [21]; R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at [28]; R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 113 at [12]; R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283 at [44] and Tuvunivono v R [2013] NSWCCA 176 at [60].
	
	
	The Crown emphasised the discretionary nature of the decision to afford a discount for a plea of guilty and submitted that a different discount being given to another offender, in circumstances where the other offender was charged with different offences, is not indicative of error in the exercise of that discretion. The Crown submitted that in light of the discretionary nature of the sentencing decision, the applicant’s approach to the question of what discount should have been awarded was “too mathematical”: Crown Written Submissions at [23]-[25].
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was relevant that Tran had entered his plea in the Local Court whereas the applicant did not enter her plea until she had been committed for trial: Crown Written Submissions at [23]-[25].
	
	
	In oral submissions for the Crown attention was drawn to the fact that the applicant’s pleas of guilty were indicated on 17 December 2012 and that this would have been either the last day of the law term or very close to the last day and that the trial had been scheduled to commence on 14 January 2013. It was submitted that, in practice, in those circumstances it would have been necessary for the Crown to have already prepared the matter for trial before the last day of the law term in 2012. As such, the utilitarian value of the plea was quite low, because the plea was not timely, and had not saved the prosecuting authority any work: T 28 April 2015 at 9.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Crown that it would be a curious result ‘if differences in the exercise of that discretion to a minimal degree…could be then relied upon to base a legitimate sense of grievance in a parity decision given there are other differences between the subjective cases of the offenders and of course differences as to timing of plea and an explanation of differences in the value of the plea that was given’: T 28 April 2015 at 11.
	
	
	During the hearing before this Court it was conceded that the submission as to Tran having entered his plea in the Local Court was not accurate and the sentencing judge may have, in fact, acted on an incorrect factual basis in that regard (T 28 April 2014 at p 2). The correct position was set out in oral submissions by Senior Counsel for the applicant as follows:
	


“(Tran) didn’t finally adhere to any plea in the Local Court until 2 November. The trial matter is actually listed for arraignment, you will see, on three occasions: 7 September, on 28 September and on 12 October. It’s well and truly in the trial list at that stage.

I think it’s a fair assessment to say that what’s occurring here is that a not guilty charge is being used as some leverage in terms of negotiations as to the formal final form of the charges and a deal ultimately as to an indictment which ultimately was certainly more charitable, without any disrespect to the prosecutor’s discretion…” (T 28 April 2015 at p 7:40-45)


	
	As earlier noted, the applicant handed up a “Procedural History” of both offenders at the hearing on 28 April 2015 which set out the relevant agreed dates. From that document it is apparent that Ms Nguyen was arrested on 19 April 2012 and indicated her intention to enter pleas of guilty on 17 December 2012, approximately 8 months later. This resulted in the January trial date being vacated. Mr Tran was arrested on 26 August 2011. On 19 July 2012 he entered pleas of guilty to the firearms offences and three supply offences approximately 11 months later. However he maintained a plea of not guilty to the charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (which related to the events of 3-4 August 2011) until 2 November 2012.
	


Consideration

Ground 1(a)


	
	The parity principle in sentencing is well-established. In essence, the rule is as stated in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 where it was said at 623 per Dawson J that:
	


“any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.”


	
	In Lowe at 609, Gibbs CJ observed that:
	


“it is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account.”


	
	It is plain from the Remarks on Sentence as discussed above that in determining the sentence to be imposed on the applicant his Honour gave specific consideration to the question of parity of sentence as between Tran and the applicant. As his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence record, he identified the comparative roles of both in relation to the drug charges and made a finding, after hearing submissions on the issue, that so far as those offences were concerned, the roles of the two were at least equal. On that basis, if the indictments had been limited to the drug offences a question of disparity may possibly have arisen.
	
	
	However, the fact that Tran was being sentenced for additional offences, and had some offences included on a Form 1 rather than on his indictment, means that a straightforward comparison is not possible. The Form 1 offences, of course, were to be brought into account in accordance with accepted principles: Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42], [66].
	
	
	The sentencing judge determined that it was appropriate for the starting point in relation to the applicant to be one year less than the starting point for Tran’s sentence. In reaching this conclusion there was a range of competing considerations to be evaluated and balanced in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. These included the objective seriousness of the offences, the seriousness of the Form 1 offences on Tran’s indictment, and the fact that they were being charged on a Form 1 rather than on the indictment, the relative strengths of each offenders’ subjective cases and the additional criminality of Tran, as compared to the applicant, as a result of the firearms offences.
	
	
	The fact that the charges brought against Tran and the applicant were not identical does not, of course, necessarily displace the application of the principal of parity: Green v The Queen [2011] 244 CLR 462 at [30]. In Green the following observations were made at [30] as to the principle in such cases:
	


“Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognized in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a Court of Criminal Appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle.”


	
	Accordingly, in the present case what the sentencing judge was required to determine was not simply a case in which there was a difference in the charges against the applicant and her co-offender Tran, but rather a case that involved the exercise of the prosecutorial decision to proceed with some charges on a Form 1 in Tran’s case rather than on an indictment. Additionally, the firearm offences with which Tran was charged were, on the evidence, entirely separate from the conduct of the applicant.
	
	
	Taking into account the sentencing judge’s findings, and the variations in the offences charged, I do not consider there exists a basis for a justifiable sense of grievance as to the disparity in the starting points determined for the sentences ultimately imposed on the applicant and Tran. There are a number of factors which could have justified the fact that the applicant’s starting point was only one year less than Tran’s, including the method of charging the offences on a Form 1 in Tran’s case and his Honour’s explicit rejection of aspects of the applicant’s subjective case which may have otherwise been more compelling. I note, as well, that the material on the applicant’s drug, alcohol, psychological history was restricted to the account in Mr Watson-Munro's report of 12 June 2013 (at p 3), the applicant not having given evidence at the sentence hearing. No error, in my opinion, has been established in the way in which the sentencing judge approached the exercise of his sentencing discretion.
	


Ground 1(b)


	
	Given the absence of reasons expressed in the Remarks of Sentence, the basis on which the sentencing judge differentiated between the discount afforded to Tran of 17.5% for what was referred to as a “late” plea of guilty and the discount of 12.5% afforded to the applicant is unknown. It is clear from the manner in which the ground of appeal has been framed that it is the disparity arising between the discounts which is said to give rise to appellable error.
	
	
	Mr Jordan submitted that when the procedural history of each set of proceedings involving Tran and the applicant were examined, overall, the applicant’s guilty pleas were at least of equivalent utilitarian value. He submitted that they were indicated more quickly and indicated without the qualification of an ongoing charge negotiation, which it was submitted had occurred in the proceedings concerning Tran.
	
	
	Mr Jordan submitted that there was no justifiable basis for the applicant to receive a lesser discount for the utilitarian value of her guilty pleas than Tran. The difference in the discount, in particular the lesser discount determined for the applicant, could not be explained, it was submitted, by reference to the history of the proceedings. His Honour, it was stated, simply referred to the figure of 12.5% without explaining the discount when in the circumstances a clear explanation was required for the lesser discount. Without it, it was submitted, the parity principle, directed towards the appearance of equal justice, was said to apply.
	
	
	The Crown submissions on this point have been detailed above at [54]-[58].
	
	
	The procedural history in relation to Tran in terms of the time that elapsed between the date of charge and his pleas of guilty does not, on analysis, in my opinion, indicate that Tran’s position warranted a more favourable exercise of discretion (17.5%) over the position of the applicant (12%).
	


(a) As to the applicant, Nguyen:


	
	The period between date of charge (22 April 2012) and date when she was committed for trial to the District Court (23 July 2012) was quite short, approximately 3 months.
	
	
	The period from date of charge to date when guilty pleas were indicated (17 December 2012) was a period of approximately 8 months. The period from date of charge to date of formal entry of guilty pleas on 12 April 2013, was a period of approximately 12 months.
	


(b) As to the Co-Offender Tran:


	
	The period between date of charge (26 August 2011) and his pleas of not guilty to the charge of supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 3-4 August 2011 and his guilty pleas to two firearm offences and one offence of supply not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine on 26 August 2011 was approximately 11 months.
	
	
	Guilty pleas to all three charges (including on a Form 1 supply prohibited drug N, N, Dimethylamphetamine in not less than the commercial quantity on 3 August 2011) were entered by Tran on 2 November 2012, a period of approximately 1 year 5 months from date of charge.
	



	
	The applicant’s guilty pleas indicated within about 8 months after she was charged resulted in an estimated three-week trial due to have commenced on 14 January 2013, being vacated on about 17 December 2012. The timeline of the applicant’s procedural history from the date of charge was considerably shorter than that of Tran. As discussed above, there appears to have been some negotiation between Tran’s legal representatives and the Crown over a period of several months before guilty pleas to all charges were entered by him on 2 November 2012.
	
	
	At the sentence hearing there was quite limited discussion of the applicant’s entitlement to a discount for her guilty pleas. The transcript of 9 August 2013 records the following at pp 3-4:
	


“MARR:   Your Honour, there was a plea of guilty; late, but a plea of guilty, nonetheless, which is entitled to some discount. It was a plea in the District Court, a trial date had been set, I think for January this year, but that was vacated when new lawyers came into the matter, and then the plea of guilty was in April, I understand.

HIS HONOUR:   Well, according to the Crown facts, I don’t know if you’ve got it here, she indicated a plea of guilty. I think it says ‘he’, but I think that means ‘she’, ‘indicated a plea of guilty to the same indictment on the date of the trial on 14 January 2012. At that stage the matter was then listed for mention to settle the facts.’ I haven’t checked the file, I mean, I can have a look at the file, if you like?

MARR:   All right, my solicitor says when he came into it the Chief Judge vacated it on 17 December, so there was no trial in the end listed.

HIS HONOUR:   I checked it, it’s important, there could be a difference in percentages. Given this is likely to be a relatively long sentence, those percentages can add up to something significant. Yes, that’s right. There was an indication of plea on 17 December and the Chief Judge, as you said, vacated the trial date to 14 January, so, the Crown facts aren’t entirely correct.”


	
	The sentencing judge raised a question as to why a plea had not been entered at an earlier stage (at T 6) and at T 7 the following is recorded:
	


“HIS HONOUR:   Maybe the only issue was where could they identify the offender, but I would have thought they probably had photographs as well, I’ve no idea.

MARR:         They did, yes, they knew where she lived.

HIS HONOUR:    That’s a little bit hard to understand, but, anyway, she pleaded before trial, I’m prepared to find she’s entitled, probably, I think, to 12.5%, rather than 10%. If it had been on the date of trial, she wouldn’t have got more than 10%, maybe even less.”


	
	There does not appear to have been any further discussion of the applicant’s guilty pleas and the discount to be allowed for them. There was no discussion of the discount of 17.5% given to Tran, it having only been noted at T 6 by Mr Marr who appeared for the applicant that Tran received a significant discount for assistance.
	
	
	As observed in the applicant’s written submissions, the Crown made no submissions on the discount to be applied to the applicant’s pleas and it may have been that the difference in the discounts was an oversight which, unfortunately, was not brought to his Honour’s attention by either the applicant’s counsel or the Crown: Outline of Submissions for the Applicant at [44].
	
	
	Aside from the timing of the applicant’s guilty pleas approximately 8 months after she was charged with the subject offences, it may be noted, as stated in submissions at the hearing in this Court, that the Crown case very largely depended upon the telephone intercept material: T 28 April 2015 at p 9. On behalf of the Crown it was stated that a good deal of pre-trial preparation would have consisted of the preparation of transcripts: T 28 April 2015 at pp 9-10. As to when in relation to the date the applicant indicated that she would enter her guilty pleas, the Crown’s pre-trial preparation had been wholly or partially completed is unknown, a matter that has some relevance to the utilitarian value of the pleas. It is not something that this Court can speculate about in the absence of evidence. Additionally, the length of time devoted to the preparation of transcripts would, at least in part, depend upon the length of the conversations recorded. I note that “120 pages or more” of transcripts were referred to by Counsel for the applicant at a mention of the sentence proceedings on 14 June 2013: T 2. Whether such preparation work was also undertaken for the Crown case against Tran up to a particular point in the procedural history of these proceedings is unknown.
	
	
	There being no identifiable basis upon which the difference in the discounts (12.5% as against 17.5%) can be explained or justified, and no reasons having been stated in the Remarks on Sentence, I consider that there is a difference in sentencing of a kind that amounts to an unjustifiable disparity constituting a ground for intervention.
	
	
	In R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383, this Court emphasised that the range of discounts for the utilitarian value of a guilty plea does not create a presumption or entitlement to a particular discount to reflect the utilitarian value of such a plea. However, the parity principle may have application where, as in this case, a co-offender has received a discount of 17.5% whilst another has received a lower discount (12.5%), and no reasons were provided which explain the disparity and there is no evident explanation or justification for the difference. In such circumstances the disparity may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	A comparison of the relevant facts in this case, and the absence of reasons by the sentencing judge, in my opinion, establishes an unjustifiable disparity requiring this Court to intervene in order to increase the discount for the applicant’s guilty plea from 12.5% to 17.5%. It will accordingly be necessary to set aside the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant and to resentence her upon the same basis as determined by the sentencing judge but applying to it the abovementioned discount of 17.5%. Applying a discount of 17.5% to the starting point of 13 years results in a sentence of 10 years, 8 months and 21 days. In my opinion this sentence should be rounded up to 10 years and 9 months so that the discount applied does not exceed 17.5% (as would be the case if the 21 days were excluded.)
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	The applicant be granted leave to appeal.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed upon the applicant by the Sydney District Court on 6 September 2013, be set aside.
	
	
	The applicant be re-sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 10 years and 9 months, to include a non-parole period of 7 years 7 months, to commence on 19 April 2012 and to expire on 18 November 2019 and a parole period of 3 years 2 months to commence on 19 November 2019 and to expire on 18 January 2023.
	
	
	The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible to parole will be 19 November 2019.
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Hall J.

2767391,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 10) [2015] NSWSC 1067,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	Roger Caleb Rogerson and Glen Patrick McNamara have each pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging:
	



	
	the murder of Jamie Gao (“the deceased”) on 20 May 2014; and
	
	
	the supply, on the same day, of a prohibited drug, namely 2.78 kilograms of methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug.
	



	
	By notice of motion dated 31 July 2015 the Crown has made application that in the course of the trial of the two accused a view be held, pursuant to s. 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), of various locations where, on the Crown case, relevant events took place. The notice of motion is supported by an affidavit Karl Robert Prince, a solicitor employed by the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Prince is instructing the Crown Prosecutor in the trial.
	


THE CROWN CASE


	
	In order to place the application in its proper context it is necessary to set out the relevance, to the Crown case, of those locations which it is proposed will be viewed. In this regard, the Crown case statement filed in the proceedings details the following events on 20 May 2014 which was the day on which it is alleged that the deceased was murdered:
	


17.   During the morning of 20 May 2014 McNAMARA was in telephone contact with ROGERSON.

18.   At approximately 11.37am McNAMARA used a payphone in the Cronulla mall to telephone the deceased. The Crown will allege that this was to confirm a meeting later that day when the deceased would supply the three kilograms of methylamphetamine.

19.   At approximately 12.04pm the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX drove in to the underground car park of the Cote D’Azur apartments. The vehicle exited the car park at 12.10pm.

20.   At approximately 1.16pm ROGERSON arrived at rent a Space, Padstow driving his silver Ford Falcon station wagon, registration AF70SR. McNAMARA was seated in the passenger seat at the time.

21.   ROGERSON parked in the vicinity of storage shed 803 and both he and McNAMARA walked to, and then entered, storage shed 803. McNAMARA was wearing a hooded jumper and was carrying something under his arm as he walked. At approximately 1.25pm ROGERSON and McNAMARA drove away in ROGERSON’s vehicle.

22.   At approximately 1.33pm the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX was driven along Arab Road, Padstow. The vehicle parked on the northern side of Arab Road near, and facing, Davies Road. The Crown will allege that this vehicle was driven by McNAMARA.

23.   Moments after the white Ford Falcon drove on Arab Road, the silver Ford Falcon station wagon, registration AF70SR owned by ROGERSON drove on Arab Road and performed a u-turn outside Mick’s Meats and parked on the street outside that business’s car park.

24.   At approximately 1.39pm the deceased’s white Nissan Sylvia vehicle, registration BW043W arrived in Arab Road, Padstow. The deceased was driving the vehicle and CHAN and FUNG were passengers.

25.   As the deceased drove on Arab Road, ROGERSON moved his vehicle from outside Mick’s Meats and parked in the car park of that business. The deceased parked in the space vacated by ROGERSON.

26.   The deceased got out of his vehicle carrying a black back pack and walked to the white Ford Falcon, registration BV67PX which the Crown alleges was driven by McNAMARA. The deceased got in to the vehicle, while CHAN and FUNG remained with the deceased’s vehicle. The Crown will allege that the backpack carried by the deceased contained the three kilograms of methylamphetamine that the deceased intended to supply to McNAMARA.

27.   ROGERSON exited the Mick’s meats car park in his silver Ford Falcon station wagon, registration AF70SR and followed the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX containing the deceased and McNAMARA along Arab Road and on to Davies Road.

28.   At approximately 1.42pm the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX driven by McNAMARA and containing the deceased, arrived at Rent a Space, Padstow.

29.   McNAMARA parked the vehicle outside storage shed 803. McNAMARA opened the roller door to storage shed 803, and then opened the rear passenger door of the vehicle to allow the deceased to walk into the storage shed at approximately 1.45pm. McNAMARA closed the roller door when both he and the deceased were inside.

30.   At approximately 1.46pm ROGERSON’s silver Ford Falcon station wagon, registration AF70SR arrived outside storage shed 803. ROGERSON drove a lap around the complex then parked in an adjoining driveway.

31.   At approximately 1.49pm ROGERSON entered storage shed 803 and closed the roller door behind him.

32.   At approximately 1.58pm ROGERSON exited storage shed 803 and moved his vehicle to park outside storage shed 803, directly behind the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX. He then re-entered the storage shed and closed the roller door.

33.   The Crown will allege that the deceased was killed some time between entering the storage shed with McNAMARA at 1.45pm, and ROGERSON exiting the storage shed to move his vehicle at 1.58pm.

34.   At approximately 2.03pm McNAMARA emerged from the storage shed. He was no longer wearing the hooded jumper that he had been wearing when he arrived with the deceased. Instead, McNAMARA was wearing a pink t-shirt.

35.   At approximately 2.09pm McNAMARA exited the storage shed and removed an empty silver surf board cover from the rear of the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX. He then re-entered the storage shed.

36.   At approximately 2.18pm McNAMARA and ROGERSON dragged the silver surf board cover from the storage shed and loaded it in to the rear of the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX. The Crown will allege that the silver surf board cover contained the body of the deceased. Both McNAMARA and ROGERSON placed a number of office chairs from inside the storage shed on top of the silver surfboard cover in the rear of the vehicle.

37.   At 2.22pm ROGERSON and McNAMARA got in to their respective cars and drove out of Rent a Space.

38.   At approximately 3.00pm McNAMARA and ROGERSON arrived at the Cote D’Azur apartments in Cronulla in the white Ford Falcon Station wagon, registration BV67PX, and entered the underground car park. The vehicle also contained the body of the deceased inside the silver surfboard cover, and also the methylamphetamine that the deceased had brought to the meeting with McNAMARA.

39.   CCTV footage from within the lifts at the Cote D’Azur apartments shows McNAMARA in a lift at approximately 3.12pm wearing a pink t-shirt and carrying rope. The Crown will allege that this is the same pink t-shirt that McNAMARA was wearing at Rent a Space earlier in the afternoon.

40.   At about 4.00pm that afternoon McNAMARA and ROGERSON left the Cote D’Azur apartments in the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX and drove to Kennards Hire, Taren Point.

41.   At Kennards Hire, Taren Point, McNAMARA and ROGERSON hired a chain block. This was paid for using McNAMARA’s credit card.

42.   At about 4.50pm the white Ford Falcon station wagon, registration BV67PX returned to the … apartments at Cronulla and entered the underground car park.

43.   CCTV footage from inside the lift at the Cote D’Azur apartments shows McNAMARA and ROGERSON together getting in to a lift on the basement level at approximately 6.24pm.

44.   During the afternoon and evening of 20 May 2014, friends of the deceased became increasingly concerned for his welfare. They attempted to locate the deceased without success. The deceased’s mobile phone, wallet and passport were in his vehicle, which was still parked in Arab Road, Padstow, where CHAN and FUNG were waiting for the deceased to return.

(5) This section does not apply in relation to the inspection of an exhibit by the court or, if there is a jury, by the jury.

CONSIDERATION


	
	Before making an order that a view take place, I must firstly be satisfied of each of the matters set out in s. 53(2). In that respect, I am satisfied that each of the accused will be represented by counsel at the view. I will also be present, along with the jury.
	
	
	In determining whether to make an order that a view be held I am also required to take into account (to the extent that they apply to a view, as opposed to a demonstration or experiment) the matters in s. 53(3)(c) to (e) inclusive.
	
	
	Firstly, in terms of s. 53(3)(a), the accused will not be present themselves but will be represented by Counsel.
	
	
	Secondly, in terms of s. 53(3)(b), the significance of the areas which will be viewed will be evident from those passages of the Crown case statement set out at [3] above. I am satisfied that a view of those areas will assist the jury in understanding the evidence of the events which are said to have taken place on the day of the deceased’s death.
	
	
	Thirdly, in terms of s. 53(3)(c), no submission has been made to me that a view might operate in a way which is unfairly prejudicial to either of the accused, nor has it been suggested that a view might be misleading, confusing or the cause of an undue waste of time.
	
	
	Fourthly, s. 53(3)(d) is expressed to apply only to a demonstration and is therefore not relevant.
	
	
	Fifthly, in terms of s. 53(3)(e), although the affidavit of Mr Prince discloses that storage shed 803 is now empty and no longer contains any of the items of furniture that were inside it at the time of relevant events (see in particular the Crown case statement at [36]) it has not been suggested to me that this constitutes a material alteration which would render a view of no assistance or which, worse still, might render a view unfairly prejudicial to one or both of the accused.
	
	
	In light of these matters, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to conduct the view.
	
	
	In the circumstances, and for the purposes of the conduct of the view, I propose to adopt the guidelines set out by Priest JA (with whom Maxwell P and Weinberg JA agreed) in Ha v R [2014] VSCA 335 at [31]-[34]:
	


“[31] Where a judge in a criminal trial is satisfied in accordance with s 53 of the Evidence Act 2008 that there ought be a view of a premises, place or thing, it may be desirable to swear a “shewer“ (or “shower“) to show the jury the place or thing to be inspected. (Indeed, it has been this Court’s experience that it is a common, although not invariable, practice to swear or affirm a shower; and, in any event, jury keepers have always been sworn for the purpose of the view.) It will be necessary, of course, for the judge and jury to be present, and for the parties be given a reasonable opportunity to be present; and it will be desirable for the jury to be accompanied by a keeper or keepers. A record of what occurred should be kept. This may be achieved by arranging for a video to be made by an appropriate person (without, of course, identifying the jurors); or by causing a shorthand note to be made, which is later read into the trial transcript; or by the judge making, or arranging for, some form of summary to be made, which is later read into the transcript. (This is particularly important, of course, if the view involves a witness giving evidence of some matter whilst the view is conducted.) At the very least, the judge, upon returning to court, should — with any necessary input from counsel — describe what occurred with moderate detail. The degree of detail will, of course, be dictated by the particular circumstances.

[32] The judge’s summary must, of necessity, be confined to what took place — where the jury were taken, which places or things they inspected and from what vantage points. In contradistinction to the position in a trial by judge alone, it will not be necessary for the judge to include any of his or her own conclusions as to what was observable. (One reason for the judge’s reluctance in the present case was a proper concern not to be “directing the jury about what they actually saw“). The summary should also include any questions of substance asked by jurors in the course of the view, together with the judge’s answers. Preferably, the procedure for dealing with such questions should be discussed with counsel before the view commences. And as with other questions asked by the jury in the course of the trial, it may be necessary to invite submissions from counsel before providing an answer.

[33] There is much to be said for the guidance to be found in the New South Wales Bench Book:

It is normal to nominate a person, often the Officer in Charge of the investigation, to be the shower for the purposes of indicating relevant aspects of the scene to the jury during the view in accordance with the evidence given in court.

“A transcript should be made of the view. It is suggested that the police be asked to take a video recording of the view, if practicable, so that it can later be tendered in evidence. The recording should be made so as not to disclose members of the jury, but to record what is said by the shower and, if possible, any questions asked by the jury and the answers given by the shower.”

The preferable course in relation to questions asked by the jury is for them to be put in writing and then vetted by the judge, in consultation with counsel if necessary, prior to being asked of the shower by the judge.

It is usual to swear the court attendants who accompany the jury to and from the view prior to departing from the court. This is to ensure that no person is allowed to communicate with the jury except at the view in the presence of the judge. It is also usual to swear the shower.

[34] Unless steps are taken to record what occurred during a view or inspection, an appellate court may be deprived of the opportunity of properly exercising the task of appellate review. Whether or not one accepts that the right to appellate review is a feature of the right to a fair trial itself, nonetheless it is the duty of a trial judge to ensure that an adequate record is made of significant events so that this Court is capable of carrying out its functions and powers.”


	
	I note that the parties have previously been referred to this decision and that the Crown has submitted the guidelines set out by Priest JA ought be followed. No contrary submission has been advanced by counsel for either of the accused.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the forgoing reasons, I order that during the course of the trial, at a time and date agreed upon by the parties, an inspection be conducted pursuant to s. 53 of the Act of those locations set out in Annexure A to the affidavit of Karl Robert Prince affirmed on 31 July 2015.

		15 June 2016",2015-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767392,Bassal v R [2015] NSWDC 257,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Michael Bassal appeals against the making of an apprehended domestic violence order. The basis for the order was a magistrate’s finding that he said certain words over the telephone when speaking to his ex-wife. To put the words in context I need to explain a bit about what had earlier occurred.
	
	
	The appellant and his ex-wife were involved in Family Court proceedings. The children of the relationship had a good relationship with their father, the appellant, and orders were such that he had regular access, including access over school holidays. In defiance of Family Court orders his ex-wife moved both herself and, more importantly, the children, to Newcastle from where they were living in Sydney. This, not surprisingly, caused some upset in the mind of the appellant. It was in this context that he was alleged to have said to his ex-wife over the telephone “I’m going to send somebody up there. I swear to God if I get the girls back you’ll never see them again”.
	
	
	Mr Preece, who appeared for the appellant in the Local Court and appears for him today, conceded, at least in the Local Court, that if those words were said, then the apprehended violence order was justified. His dispute, if I can call it that, was whether those words were said or whether the magistrate could be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that they were said.
	
	
	I am not so sure that I should act on that concession. The words “I’m going to send somebody up there” when made in connection with “I swear to God if I get the girls back you’ll never see them again” are perhaps capable of being interpreted as “I’m going to send someone up there to return the children to Sydney where they should be living in compliance with Family Court orders”.
	
	
	I myself have some doubts as to whether those words are sufficient to justify a reasonable fear in the appellant’s ex-wife of a personal violence offence.
	
	
	I need not actually resolve this because I am satisfied that the appeal should be allowed for other reasons. I have already mentioned that the appellant’s ex-wife moved the children to Newcastle in defiance of Family Court orders. She wanted to enrol them in a local school but the school would not accept their enrolment unless one of two conditions were satisfied: firstly, that both parents signed the enrolment form; or if that was not possible, the children would still be enrolled if an apprehended violence order was in force. Quite clearly, the appellant was not going to sign any enrolment form which would have his children enrolled in a school in Newcastle when the Family Court required that they live in Sydney and so a current AVO was the only way in which the appellant’s ex-wife could enrol the children in a Newcastle school. This provides a powerful motive for her to make a false allegation against the appellant.
	
	
	I fully appreciate that the magistrate had opportunities which are denied me, in particular to see the witnesses as they gave their evidence. However it does not appear to me that the magistrate regarded as important any appearance of either witness in the witness box or took into account their demeanour while giving evidence. At least his Honour did not say so and, had that been a significant factor in his decision, I would have expected him to say so.
	
	
	There are some matters capable of being relied on by the Crown. Firstly, the appellant ultimately agreed with the proposition that he had left a voicemail on his wife’s mobile phone in which he said “Give us a call you slag”. (He said that the reason the voicemail was transcribed as “Give us a call you slut” was because of some technical error in converting voice to text but whether the word was “slut” or “slag” does not really matter.) The Crown argues that that is consistent with a man who would say to his wife over the telephone on another occasion “I’m going to send somebody up there I swear to God if I get the girls back you’ll never see them again”.
	
	
	The Crown’s argument should be accepted but it should not be given too much weight. There is a significant difference between abusing someone, especially in the context of her having breached Family Court orders, and making a threat involving the commission of a personal violence offence.
	
	
	Another aspect of this voicemail message is worthy of note. At one stage in the Local Court proceedings Mr Preece put to the complainant that that message simply did not exist. In other words he put a positive assertion to the complainant that she was lying when she said the message existed. Consistent with Mr Preece’s obligations and duties as a barrister, I would not have expected him to have put that positive proposition unless his instructions were such that the message was a fabrication.
	
	
	I am prepared therefore to use that circumstance as suggesting that the appellant must have been less than frank with Mr Preece at the time of the Local Court proceedings. The bar rules which govern Mr Preece’s behaviour would not have allowed him to have put that positive question in the absence of instructions which justified that question being put.
	
	
	On the other hand, this finding is somewhat balanced by the finding I am prepared to make the other way. It appears that in a letter prepared by the complainant’s former solicitor reference was made to the appellant having threatened to kill his ex-wife at some stage. The complainant denied ever having made such a statement to her former solicitor. I would not have expected her former solicitor to make such a serious allegation in a letter unless there was good reason for doing so. So when it comes to questions of what the parties told their lawyers, it is effectively a draw.
	
	
	I have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, even assuming that the relevant words justify the making of an AVO, the words were in fact said. In circumstances where there was a powerful motive on the part of the complainant to enrol her children at a Newcastle school, in circumstances where she was in breach of Family Court orders and clearly regarded her position as being improved if an AVO was made, I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the words were in fact said. I repeat, even if the words were said, I have some doubts as to whether I would have found that they justified the making of an AVO in the first place.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed and the AVO is quashed.

2767395,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 11) [2015] NSWSC 1066,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	Roger Caleb Rogerson (“Rogerson”) and Glen Patrick McNamara (“McNamara”) have previously pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging:
	



	
	the murder of Jamie Gao (“the deceased”) on 20 May 2014; and
	
	
	the supply, on the same day, of a prohibited drug, namely 2.78 kilograms of methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug.
	



	
	On 5 June 2015 the Crown presented an amended indictment which, as against Rogerson, pleaded (as an alternative to the first count) a count alleging an offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder. Rogerson has pleaded not guilty to that alternative count.
	
	
	On 28 July 2015 I made an order discharging the jury: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 8) [2015] NSWSC 1036. The trial is now listed to commence on 18 August 2015.
	
	
	A number of subpoenas have been issued on behalf of each of the accused. One such subpoena, issued on the application of the accused McNamara, was directed to Mr Charles Moschoudis, who was formerly a barrister and who now practices as a solicitor. Mr Moschoudis produced a large volume of material in response to the subpoena served on him, some of which was referable to his earlier representation of Lok Chun Lam (“Lam”). At the time of producing that material, Mr Moschoudis indicated to the Registrar that a claim for privilege was made in respect of (inter alia) the material pertaining to Lam. Counsel for McNamara foreshadowed a challenge to that claim. Ultimately however, the challenge made was limited to discreet aspects of a statement made by Lam to the police. I have, however, set out below a number of other circumstances which arose before that point was reached.
	


THE CROWN CASE


	
	A Crown Case Statement has been filed in the proceedings, the terms of which have been set out in full in a number of previous judgments. Whilst I do not propose to repeat that statement in full, the following matters are relevant for present purposes.
	
	
	As part of its case against the two accused, the Crown alleges that in January 2014 the deceased was an associate of Lam. At that time, Lam and his brother Chun Kit Lam (“Chun”) had been charged with offences against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). A Mr Ly, solicitor, acted for Lam and Chun. Ms Diane Elston, also a solicitor, was employed by Mr Ly.
	
	
	Mr Ly briefed Mr Moschoudis to advise, and appear for, Lam. In the course of preparing Lam’s case, McNamara was engaged (apparently by Mr Ly but seemingly on the recommendation of Mr Moschoudis) as a private investigator to assist with obtaining statements. Ultimately, Lam and Chun each pleaded guilty to various offences. Each was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Subsequent appeals against the asserted severity of their respective sentences were dismissed: Lam v R; Lam v R [2015] NSWCCA 87.
	
	
	On the Crown case, it was through these connections that the deceased came to meet McNamara. As I understand it, the Crown will lead evidence from both Lam and Chun for the purposes of establishing (inter alia) the association between the deceased and McNamara in the period leading up to the deceased’s death. The Crown will allege that after they were introduced to each other, the deceased and McNamara became involved in negotiations for the purchase, by McNamara, of a large quantity of methylamphetamine from the deceased. It is the Crown case that on 20 May 2014, the deceased was shot by one or other of the accused when delivering to them approximately 2.7 kilograms of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	I should also note that when the issue of client legal privilege was first raised, counsel for McNamara was proceeding on the assumption that Mr Moschoudis had been retained to appear for both Lam and Chun. It is clear from the evidence given by Mr Moschoudis (T358 L45 - T359 L5) that this was not so, and that his retainer was only in respect of Lam. In these circumstances, and to the extent that counsel provided me with material relating to Chun, he accepted that such material was not relevant to the issue I have been asked to determine.
	
	
	Finally, I note that Ms Jasmine Lau, solicitor, now acts for Lam and Chun. In April 2014 Ms Lau took instructions from the deceased in what she described in a statement to police as a “legal matter”. As detailed further below, Ms Lau was given the opportunity to make submissions to me in relation to the present issue on two occasions, firstly on 24 July 2015 (at which time Lam and Chun were present in Court via AVL) and again following final submissions on 3 August 2015. No substantive submissions were made by Ms Lau on either occasion.
	


THE SUBPOENA TO MR MOSCHOUDIS


	
	On 9 July 2015, a subpoena was issued to Mr Moschoudis, attached to which was a schedule in the following terms:
	


1.   A copy of all records, entries, references, documents, file notes (handwritten or typed), statements, reports and any other documentation (both audio/visual material) including all billing documents, payment files, cost agreements and invoices relating all matters involving Lok Chun Lam.

2.   A copy of all records, entries, references, documents, file notes (handwritten or typed), statements, reports and any other documentation (both audio/visual material) including all billing documents, payment files, cost agreements and invoices relating all matters involving Kit Chun Lam.

3.   A copy of all records, entries, references, documents, file notes (handwritten or typed), statements, reports and any other documentation (both audio/visual material) including all billing documents, payment files, cost agreements and invoices relating all matters involving Glen McNamara.

4.   A copy of all records, entries, references, documents, file notes (handwritten or typed), statements, reports and any other documentation (both audio/visual material) including all billing documents, payment files, cost agreements and invoices relating all matters involving Jamie Gao.


	
	Although the schedule to the Subpoena was, to say the least, drafted in wide terms (as evidenced by the repeated use of the phrase “relating to all matters involving…”) there was no application to set it aside.
	
	
	Mr Moschoudis produced a large volume of material in response to the Subpoena. In a covering letter which accompanied the material, he advised the Registrar (inter alia) that a claim for privilege was made in respect of material which was so marked. The documents over which such a claim was made may be generally described as follows:

E - ENVELOPES

1.   4 Separate envelopes marked “Voldean P/L - privilege claimed”.


	
	Before proceeding further, a number of matters should be noted.
	
	
	Firstly, it will be evident from the description of the material set out above that I have inspected it. That course is permitted by s. 133 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). In taking that course I was mindful of those authorities which stress the importance of evidence being put before the Court, in a proper form, disclosing the basis of the claim for privilege. Those same authorities caution against the Court being asked to fill gaps in such evidence by inspecting documents, the contents of which are not disclosed to the other parties: Ensham Resources Pty Limited v AIOI Insurance Co. Limited [2012] FCAFC 191 at [111] per Buchanan J; Bailey v Director-General, Dept. of Land and Water Conservation (2009) 74 NSWLR 333; [2009] NSWCA 100 at [57] per Tobias JA (Allsop P and Hodgson JA agreeing). Regrettably, and to put it bluntly, I was given no alternative in the present case other than to take the course that I did. Beyond asserting a claim for privilege on behalf of both of her clients over the entirety of the material (as it related to them) which was produced by Mr Moschoudis , Ms Lau placed no evidence whatsoever before the Court to substantiate that claim. Moreover, and despite being given two opportunities to do so, Ms Lau made no substantive submissions in support of the claim which was made. In any event, it should be noted that no party submitted to me that I should not inspect the documents.
	
	
	Secondly, in respect of the material produced pertaining to Voldean Pty Limited (“Voldean”) (Item E at [13] above) I was informed by Mr Moschoudis when he appeared before me on 21 July 2015 that Mr Lu, Solicitor, acted for that company. Mr Lu previously acted for McNamara in these proceedings. In these circumstances, upon his confirmation that he acted for Voldean, Mr Lu was given the opportunity to obtain instructions as to whether any claim for privilege was made. He subsequently informed the court that no claim was made and upon being so informed, I made an order granting the parties access to that material.
	
	
	Thirdly, having examined the material I formed the view that a great deal of it appeared to emanate from completely unrelated proceedings and, as such, was irrelevant to any issue in McNamara’s trial. The material in this category comprised:
	



	
	the entirety of that in (A) (Box 1 of 4); and
	
	
	the entirety of that in (D) (Box 4 of 4).
	



	
	When I initially raised this matter with counsel for McNamara, I was informed that the relevance of the material stemmed from the fact that it related to the prosecution of other persons where McNamara had been retained by those persons as a private investigator. Even on that basis, its relevance seemed tenuous but as no objection had been taken to its production, I did not pursue the matter further at that point. However, in circumstances where no reference was made to this material at any stage of the hearing of the present matter, I again raised with counsel for McNamara the question of its relevance. On that occasion, counsel conceded that the material had no relevance to the present proceedings. Access to that material has therefore not been granted.
	
	
	Fourthly, I formed the view that there was also a great deal of material produced which was not capable of attracting a claim for client legal privilege. The following material fell into that category:
	



	
	B (Box 2 of 4) items (2)-(4)
	
	
	C (Box 3 of 4) items (2)-(6)
	



	
	I made my preliminary views in this regard known to Ms Lau, and I explained to her why it was that material of that kind, at least at a prima facie level, would not attract a claim for privilege. In the absence of any submission being made by Ms Lau to the contrary, I made an order granting the parties access to that material.
	
	
	Fifthly, and as a consequence of my examination of the material, I formed the view that the documents in B (Box 2 of 4) Item 1 and C (Box 3 of 4) Item 1 was material of a kind which was at least capable of attracting the claim for privilege which was made. The basis on which I formed that view will be evident from my shorthand description of the material. The parties have not been given access to that material. The challenge which was ultimately made by counsel for McNamara to the claim for privilege did not extend beyond particular extracts of a statement made by Lam to the police.
	


THE EVIDENCE


	
	Counsel for McNamara tendered a folder of documents which became Ex. 1. Besides the statements of Lam and Chun, that folder contained:
	



	
	a statement of Ms Lau dated 22 May 2014;
	
	
	statement of Justin McLannen dated 16 January 2015;
	
	
	a summary of a telephone conversation to which Chun Kit Lam was party when he was in custody;
	
	
	a summary of recorded conversations to which Chun Lok Lam was party when he was in custody;
	
	
	material produced by the Department of Corrective Services recording visits to each of Lam and his brother whilst in custody.
	



	
	As a consequence of the matter to which I referred at [9], much of the material contained in Ex. 1 was ultimately of little or no relevance. In the course of the evidence of Mr Moschoudis (to which I have referred in more detail below) counsel for McNamara tendered various emails which also became part of Ex. 1. Documents relating to assistance provided to Lam by the police also formed part of Ex. 1.
	


The email sent by Ms Lau on 4 June 2015


	
	Within the material produced by Mr Moschoudis was an email of 4 June 2015 sent by Ms Lau to Mr Prince and Ms Gauld, both of whom are solicitors instructing the Crown Prosecutor. That email also became part of Ex. 1. I had previously been made aware by the Crown of the existence and content of this document, which was headed:
	


“Re: Waiver of client legal privilege by Chun Lok Lam and possibly Chun Kit Lam.”


	
	Although the email was one in respect of which a claim for privilege was asserted, it will be evident from its contents that no such claim could possibly be established. The email is in the following terms:
	


“Dear Kate,

It was great talking to you yesterday.

The Lam brothers have advised me that they agree to waive their rights to legal privilege with Mr Charles Moschoudis of counsel only. This waiver is limited in that it would only allow Mr Charles Moschoudis of counsel to provide a statement to police for the investigation of the alleged murder of Jamie Gao on 20 May 2014 in particular to those meetings between the Lams and Mr Moschoudis where Glen McNamara, Jamie Gao or Roger Rogerson were present or discussed.

This is subject to the wordings of the actual waiver that the Lam brothers will be signing.

	Ms Lau was not called to give evidence on the present application. However, she did appear before me on 24 July 2015 at which time the following exchange took place concerning the content of that email:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Notwithstanding what is in that email communication, your position, as you indicated it to me the other day and as you have indicated it to me now, is that your clients claim privilege, as it were, without qualification, over the entirety of the documents produced by Mr Moschoudis as might fall within the provisions of ss 118 and 119, is that right?

LAU: Yes. The claim is maintained if that is your Honour's question. The waiver was initially given on a conditional basis and with the understanding that an actual written waiver will be prepared. Also, that was with the intention of facilitating the police to obtain a statement from the previous legal representative, Charles Moschoudis. I understand Mr Moschoudis has said that he will not provide a statement, even if waiver was provided, and my instruction is that they would no longer agree to give that waiver.

HIS HONOUR: So your position is that irrespective of what that email might have said, events have overtaken us and your position is as you have articulated it to me today and on the previous occasion?

LAU: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Do you wish to say anything further?

LAU: No, your Honour.”

The evidence of Mr Moschoudis


	
	Also tendered as part of Ex. 1 was an unsigned statement prepared in the name of Mr Moschoudis dated 25 June 2014. In the course of giving evidence before me on 3 August 2015 Mr Moschoudis explained (commencing at T357 L25) that this statement was prepared by the police and not by him. Under the heading “Introduction to Chun Lok Lam” the statement records the following (at [8]):
	


“I represented an (sic) acted for Lok in these criminal proceedings. As a result I briefed Glen McNamara as an investigator to gather evidence (privilege) which may assist Lok during his court proceedings. During the ensuing months whilst acting for Lok I had him attend my chambers on a couple (sic) occasions to discuss his case.”


	
	When asked what he intended by the insertion of the word “privilege” in that paragraph Mr Moschoudis responded (at T360 L5-6):
	


“I didn’t put “privilege” and I didn’t write those and some of the propositions there aren’t necessarily accurate. It was a police officer who did that.”


	
	I then asked Mr Moschoudis (commencing at T360 L32) which part(s) of the contents of paragraph 8 may not be accurate:
	


“Q. Could I go back to paragraph 8?

A. Yes, your Honour.

Q. You said, I think, that there was some contents of that paragraph which may or may not be accurate. I take it the first sentence that you represented and acted for Lok Lam in criminal proceedings is correct?

A. Yes, your Honour.

Q. Is it correct to say that as a consequence of being retained you briefed Mr McNamara as an investigator?

A. I didn't brief him per se. I recommended Mr McNamara as the investigator to the instructing solicitor. I didn't brief Mr McNamara directly. It was the instructing solicitor that I introduced, your Honour.

Q. Is the last sentence correct, that Mr McNamara attended your chambers on a couple of occasions to discuss the case?

A. Yes, your Honour. I don't remember how many occasions but there were a number of occasions, yes.”


	
	Mr Moschoudis confirmed that he sent the Brief of Evidence in relation to Lam’s prosecution to McNamara. He also confirmed (at T361 L8-10) that there were various email exchanges between he and McNamara concerning investigations that McNamara would carry out. Mr Moschoudis (at T361 L14-15) could not recall proposing that McNamara conduct interviews with co-accused. He did recall “a particular individual” who had not been charged (T361 L14-19) but was unable to recall his name (T361 L25-26).
	
	
	Mr Moschoudis was taken to a number of emails, to some of which he was a party, and which now form part of Ex 1. On 27 January 2014, Mr Moschoudis wrote to McNamara and said:
	


“Dear Glen,

I hope you had a great weekend.

I am emailing to you eleven emails containing the entire brief, including fact sheet and intercepts.

Thanks mate.”


	
	McNamara responded on the same day:
	


“Hi Charles.

Thanks. I’ll send a draft statement to you soon. Please review.

Regards

Glen”


	
	On 28 January 2014 Mr Moschoudis again wrote to McNamara:
	


“Dear Glen,

I hope this email finds you well.

A couple of things:

1. Thank you for the statement you emailed to me;

2. It appears the email I sent through yesterday were not successful, so I am re-sending them again now;

1.   I am preparing two affidavits this morning that have to be sent out ASAP;

2.   Could you please confirm once you have received all 11 emails please in above matter.

3.   I shall ring you later today.

4.   I am seeing Mr Lam later this morning taking instructions in relation to his matter.

Kind regards

Charles Moschoudis”


	
	On 29 January 2014, Ms Elston wrote to McNamara in the following terms:
	


“Dear Glen,

Could you please take a statement from Brian Wrench from Murphy Lawyers. They are situated at 185 Elisabeth Street Sydney.

The statement will be in relation to and confirming the facts in the statement of Justin McLennan’s surrounding his attendance at the AFP on 14 January 2013.

Regards,

Diane Elston”

(amendment in original)


	
	On 30 January 2014 McNamara wrote to Bryan Wrench, a solicitor who acted for a Justin McLannen from whom McNamara was apparently trying to obtain a statement to assist Lam’s case. The email from McNamara to Mr Wrench was in the following terms:
	


“Bryan, thank you for calling me back. I apologise about the lack of notice.

Andrew Li (sic) solicitor instructs me regarding Chun Lok Lam and Chun Kit Lam. The Lam brothers are charged with “supply commercial quantity” x 2 – Amphetamine Heroin.

The Lam brothers identified Justin McLennen (sic) as one of their associates. They say that Justin was requested to present himself for questioning at the AFP on or about 14 January 2014. The Lam brothers were unable to specify to me the nature of Justin’s interview with the AFP.

I interviewed Justin this week, he provided a statement to me. The features of his statement are his denial to AFP of the Lam brothers being engaged in any illegal drug supply activity. Justin alleges the AFP officer – Amy Knox threatened him with imprisonment if he did not change his version and/or write out a statement implicating the Lam brothers as drug suppliers.

Justin advised at this point a Lawyer came in (you ??). Justin says that soon after he was allowed to leave without the AFP preferring any criminal charges against him.

Justin alleged as he left Ms Knox is alleged to have threatened him with words to the effect of “I am going to arrest you soon”.

My instructions from Andrew Li (sic) are to approach you and ask for your comments in relation to the allegations in Justin’s statement. I appreciate your assistance. I am happy to chat over phone if it is suitable to you.”


	
	On 31 January 2014 Mr Moschoudis again wrote to McNamara:
	


“Dear Glen,

I hope this email finds you well.

My computer has died so I have had to get another one, and it has taken a little bit of time to get up and running again.

Could you please advise:

1. Whether Justin has signed his statement, if so could you please email me a copy of same please;

2. Could you also please advise whether a statement has been taken from Bryan Wrench, as I may need to use it on Monday.

Thanks mate.

Kind regards,

Charles”


	
	Mr Moschoudis was unable to recall (at T362 L20-26) whether it was he or his instructing solicitor, Mr Ly, who in fact retained McNamara. It would appear from McNamara’s email of 30 January 2014 that it was Mr Ly. Mr Moschoudis recalled receiving a statement from McNamara in the name of Mr McLannen but could not recall whether it was signed or unsigned (T363 L16-25). He had no recollection of being aware that Mr Wrench had been approached to assist.
	
	
	In terms of his own statement, Mr Moschoudis confirmed (at T367 L38) that he was provided with a draft. He then gave the following evidence (commencing at T367 L41):
	


“Q. After you were provided with the draft, what happened next as far as you were concerned?

A. I was asked to complete the statement.

Q. What did you say?

A. And I rejected that.

Q. On what basis?

A. On the basis that there were issues of privilege in my mind and there is a rule which escapes me at the moment, it is a bar rule, that refers to matters that may not assist one's client or former client and that was the basis of not making the statement.”


	
	It would appear that Mr Moschoudis had in mind Rules (108) and (109) of the NSW Barristers Rules. As at January 2014 those rules were in the following terms:
	


CONFIDENTIALITY & CONFLICTS 

108. A barrister must not disclose (except as compelled by law) or use in any way confidential information obtained by the barrister in the course of practice

concerning any person to whom the barrister owes some duty or obligation to keep such information confidential unless or until:

(a) the information is later obtained by the barrister from another person who is not bound by the confidentiality owed by the barrister to the first person and who does not give the information confidentially to the barrister; or

(b) the person has consented to the barrister disclosing or using the information generally or on specific terms.

109. A barrister must not disclose (except as compelled by law) or use confidential information under Rule 108(b) in any way other than as permitted by the specific terms of the person’s consent.”


	
	Mr Moschoudis confirmed (commencing at T368 L32) that when asked by the police to provide a statement he did not consider that he still acted for Lam. However, he made it clear that he continued to consider himself bound to observe the confidentiality of communications which had passed between them (T368 L39-42).
	
	
	Finally, in relation to McNamara’s retention to assist in Lam’s case, Mr Moschoudis gave the following evidence (commencing at T373 L49):
	


Q. Can I take you back to the original introduction of Mr McNamara into the investigation part of the defence. As I understand your statement, you had conversations with Mr Lam about the advisability of having Glen, a private investigator, do researches for the defence?

A. There was ‑ I had a conversation with Mr Lam in relation to utilising Mr McNamara's services to advance his case, yes.

Q. Did you tell Mr Lam anything about his privilege vis‑à‑vis legal professional privilege as a result of having an investigator act according to instructions?

HIS HONOUR

Q. If you did, don't tell us what you said but did you have any conversation within those terms?

A. Not that I recall at this stage.”

The statements of Lam


	
	Two statements of Lam dated 20 June 2014 and 10 February 2015 form part of Ex. A although only the first of those statement is relevant. Ultimately, counsel limited his argument to four separate paragraphs of Lam’s first statement, the contents of which, it was submitted, established a waiver of privilege by Lam. The first was paragraph (15):
	


“15. Around December 2013, our solicitor, Adam LY, had received all the paperwork from the police in relation to our matter and I decided that we should go to trial. As a result of this, Adam organised Charles MOSCHOUDIS as our barrister, however I was having some difficulties in understanding all the paperwork and what Adam was talking about so 1 spoke with Jamie GAO about helping to translate for me as I was aware he could speak both Cantonese and English very well.”


	
	Although reliance was initially placed on this paragraph, no submissions were ultimately made in respect of its contents. In my view there is nothing contained in that paragraph which amounts to a waiver of privilege.
	
	
	Secondly, counsel relied upon paragraph 16:
	


16.1 recall on the first occasion when I met Charles it was in his chambers. Jamie and a guy named Jonathon were also there and we all spoke about my case. I think Jonathon worked with Charles as his assistant. I recall that Charles said to me that we should get some statements from the co-accused, which would then help the case against Kit and I. However, I remember that Charles explained that it would not be good for these statements to be taken by a solicitor so he recommended a guy named Glen to do this for us. Charles told me that Glen was a good friend of his and was also an ex-cop (my emphasis).


	
	Thirdly, counsel relied upon paragraph 17:
	


17. While I don't recall the exact date, I believe sometime around the beginning of January 2014,1 had another meeting with Charles at his chambers. On this occasion Jamie came with me and I think Jonathon may have also been there with Charles. This is when I first met Glen. I recall that Charles initially spoke with Glen about my case, after which Glen introduced himself to me and told me that he was willing to help in my case. Jamie was interpreting this into Cantonese so I could understand more easily what was being said (my emphasis).


	
	Finally, counsel relied upon paragraph 32:
	


32. About a week after this meeting I met Glen, Jamie, Charles and Adam at the Meridian Hotel Hurstville. I remember that day was a Saturday morning. That day we spoke about my case and I decided that I wanted to plead guilty to my charges. Glen didn't speak to me on this day. I was talking to Charles and Adam while Glen and Jamie were talking to each other. After this day I didn't see or speak to Glen again (my emphasis).


	
	In each case, counsel placed particular reliance upon the emphasised passages. Ultimately, counsel did not address me in relation to the balance of any of the material contained in Ex 1.
	


THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS


	
	Division 1 of Part 3.10 of the Act deals with client legal privilege. Section 117 relevantly defines (inter alia) the following:
	


""confidential communication"" means a communication made in such circumstances that, when it was made:

(a) the person who made it, or

(b) the person to whom it was made,

was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law. 

""confidential document"" means a document prepared in such circumstances that, when it was prepared:

(a) the person who prepared it, or

(b) the person for whom it was prepared,

was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law. 


	
	Section 118 of the Act is in the following terms:
	


118 Legal advice

Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of:

(a) a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer, or

(b) a confidential communication made between 2 or more lawyers acting for the client, or

(c) the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) prepared by the client, lawyer or another person,

for the dominant purpose of the lawyer, or one or more of the lawyers, providing legal advice to the client.


	
	Section 119 is in the following terms:
	


119 Litigation

Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of:

(a) a confidential communication between the client and another person, or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person, that was made, or

(b) the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was prepared,

for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceeding, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been, a party.


	
	Of particular relevance for present purposes are the provisions of s. 122:
	


122 Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters 

(1) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the consent of the client or party concerned.

(2) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence because it would result in a disclosure of a kind referred to in section 118, 119 or 120.

(3) Without limiting subsection (2), a client or party is taken to have so acted if:

(a) the client or party knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the substance of the evidence to another person, or

(b) the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client or party.

(4) The reference in subsection (3) (a) to a knowing and voluntary disclosure does not include a reference to a disclosure by a person who was, at the time of the disclosure, an employee or agent of the client or party, or of a lawyer of the client or party, unless the employee or agent was authorised by the client, party or lawyer to make the disclosure.

(5) A client or party is not taken to have acted in a manner inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence merely because:

(a) the substance of the evidence has been disclosed:

(i) in the course of making a confidential communication or preparing a confidential document, or

(ii) as a result of duress or deception, or

(iii) under compulsion of law, or

(iv) if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding an office under, an Australian law-to the Minister, or the Minister of the Commonwealth, the State or Territory, administering the law, or part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held, or

(b) of a disclosure by a client to another person if the disclosure concerns a matter in relation to which the same lawyer is providing, or is to provide, professional legal services to both the client and the other person, or

(c) of a disclosure to a person with whom the client or party had, at the time of the disclosure, a common interest relating to the proceeding or an anticipated or pending proceeding in an Australian court or a foreign court.

(6) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a document that a witness has used to try to revive the witness’s memory about a fact or opinion or has used as mentioned in section 32 (Attempts to revive memory in court) or 33 (Evidence given by police officers).

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions on behalf of McNamara


	
	Counsel for the accused McNamara made it clear that in asserting that privilege had been waived in each of the instances relied upon he was not (to use his words) “pressing for a complete tearing apart of legal professional privilege”. In other words counsel did not suggest that if I found that there was some evidence of waiver in any of the specific instances relied upon, I should conclude that there had been a complete waiver of privilege in respect of what would otherwise be communications between Lam and his lawyers.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that it was not open to Lam to seek to maintain privilege over communications with his lawyers in circumstances where he had specifically referred to such communications when making a statement to the police. In each of the instances upon which he relied, counsel submitted that Lam had divulged the substance of the relevant communications, and that in doing so he had acted in a manner inconsistent with raising an objection to such evidence being adduced. Counsel submitted that it was relevant that in providing a statement to the police, Lam had acted deliberately as opposed to inadvertently, and had been motivated by the promise of assistance which was held out to him by the police.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that the real issue was whether or not there was any conduct on the part of Lam which amounted to a waiver of privilege. It was submitted, in effect, that the high water mark in this regard was that part of paragraph (16) of Lam’s statement upon which counsel for McNamara relied. The Crown submitted that if I concluded that this part of the statement amounted to a waiver of privilege, then any waiver would be restricted to the matters disclosed.
	
	
	However, the Crown submitted that none of the parts of Lam’s statement relied upon by counsel for McNamara satisfied the applicable test. It was submitted that although, in each case, Lam had disclosed the fact of communications with Mr Moschoudis, he had not disclosed their substance. The Crown further submitted that the fact that McNamara had been engaged as part of Lam’s “legal team” had little or no bearing on the question of waiver.
	


THE RELVANT PRINCIPLES


	
	Sections 118 and 119 of the Act operate to preclude the admission of confidential communications and confidential documents into evidence in certain defined circumstances. In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australis Media Holdings (1997) 41 NSWLR 277 McLelland CJ in Eq concluded (at 280) that the provisions of the Act applied derivatively to claims for privilege in ancillary process. A similar approach was adopted in Adelaide Steamship Co Limited v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360, as well as in Akins v Abigroup Limited (1998) 43 NSWLR 539 (both cited by Gzell J in Chen v City Convenience Leasing Pty Limited (formerly known as City Convenience Stores Pty Limited) [2005] NSWCA 297 at [26]). Although that approach was rejected by the High Court in ESSO Australia Resources Limited V Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at [23], the position in NSW, as a consequence of the combined operation of Part 75 Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, Schedule 3 to the Supreme Court Act 1970 and Part 1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, is that the Act (as opposed to the common law) applies in circumstances such as the present.
	
	
	The onus of proving that privilege has been lost lies on the party who makes that assertion: New South Wales v Betfair Pty Limited [2009] FCAFC 160; (2009) 261 ALR 311 at [54] per the Court (Kenny, Stone and Middleton JJ).
	
	
	The submissions of counsel for McNamara centered upon the provisions of s. 122 of the Act. As a consequence, the real issue in the present case, arising from the provisions of s. 122(2) and (3), is whether in making his statement and disclosing those matters upon which counsel relied, Lam acted in a way which was inconsistent with an objection to the evidence being adduced on the basis that it would result in the disclosure of a confidential communication.
	
	
	The fact that the circumstances in which privilege may be lost under the Act are not identical to the position at common law necessitates adherence to the language of s. 122. In Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; (1999) 201 CLR 1 the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) said (at [28]-[29], citations omitted):
	


“[28] At common law, a person who would otherwise be entitled to the benefit of legal professional privilege may waive the privilege. It has been observed that “waiver” is a vague term, used in many senses, and that it often requires further definition according to the context. Legal professional privilege exists to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyer and client. It is the client who is entitled to the benefit of such confidentiality, and who may relinquish that entitlement. It is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality which effects a waiver of the privilege. Examples include disclosure by a client of the client's version of a communication with a lawyer, which entitles the lawyer to give his or her account of the communication, or the institution of proceedings for professional negligence against a lawyer, in which the lawyer's evidence as to advice given to the client will be received.

[29] Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is “imputed by operation of law”. This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege. … What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.”


	
	Similarly, in Osland v Secretary Department of Justice [2008] HCA 37; (2008) 234 CLR 275 the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Heydon and Kiefel JJ) said (at [49], citations omitted):
	


[49] Whether, in a given context, a limited disclosure of the existence, and the effect, of legal advice is inconsistent with maintaining confidentiality in the terms of advice will depend upon the circumstances of the case. … questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree. It should be added that we are here concerned with the common law principle of waiver, not with the application of s. 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which, … has the effect that privilege may be lost in circumstances which are not identical to the circumstances in which privilege may be lost at common law.”


	
	That said, it has also been observed that there is little difference between the position at common law and the position under s. 122: Fort Dodge Australia Pty Limited v Nature Vet Pty Limited [2002] FCA 501 at [10] per Hely J, citing Garratt’s Limited v Thanga Thangathurai [2002] NSWSC 93 per Bergin J (as her Honour then was) at [51].
	
	
	Whether there has been a disclosure of the substance of the evidence within the meaning of s. 122(3) will involve a question of degree. A distinction is to be drawn between a reference to the fact of advice given (or a communication made) and the disclosure of the content or substance of that advice or communication, although the balance of authority favours the view that an express or implied summary of legal advice received amounts to a disclosure of the substance of that advice: Fenwick v Wambo Coal Pty Limited (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 353 at [12] per White J.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	Before considering the competing submissions of the parties it is necessary for me to make three preliminary observations.
	
	
	The first concerns the email forwarded by Ms Lau to the Crown’s instructing solicitor (set out at [25] above). Ultimately, counsel for McNamara made no specific submission in relation to what conclusions I should reach in respect of that document but I should record the fact that in my view, the document does not amount to a waiver of privilege attaching to confidential communications between Mr Moschoudis and Lam. Although the terms of the email are somewhat oblique, it is apparent that any waiver was expressed to be conditional upon its terms being reduced to writing and signed by Lam. Those terms were never determined, and no document was ever signed.
	
	
	Secondly, and although counsel for McNamara ultimately stepped away from the proposition, the mere retention of McNamara could not of itself, in my view, constitute conduct which was inconsistent with the maintenance of client legal privilege. There is no evidence of precisely what McNamara was told about Lam’s case.
	
	
	Thirdly, the evidence of Ms Moschoudis has, in my view, limited bearing upon the present issue. In particular in my view, nothing emerged from the evidence given by Mr Moschoudis which has any bearing upon those parts of the statement of Lam which were said to amount to a waiver.
	
	
	I turn then to consider the particular aspects of Lam’s statement upon which counsel relied.
	
	
	Firstly, I am satisfied that the terms of paragraph (16) of Lam’s statement amount to a disclosure of the substance of advice given to him by Mr Moschoudis regarding the issue of obtaining statements from other persons which would assist his case. Lam did not merely make reference to the fact that advice was received. He voluntarily disclosed, to a police officer, the substance and detail of the advice that he was given. That disclosure is inconsistent with seeking to maintain privilege over such communications.
	
	
	However, I am not satisfied that this is the position in respect of the contents of paragraph 17. The reference to having a discussion “about my case” discloses nothing more than the fact of a discussion. It does not disclose the substance of the discussion, nor does it amount to an implied summary of what was discussed.
	
	
	In respect of the contents of paragraph (32), the effect of counsel’s submission was that in disclosing the fact that he had decided to enter a plea of guilty to the charges against him, Lam had disclosed the “end result” of the advice he had received, and had therefore waived privilege in relation to it. Relevantly, in Fenwick (supra) White J observed (at [13]) that there have been instances in which disclosure of the conclusion of legal advice has been treated as the disclosure of its substance, even though the reasoning itself is not disclosed. In the present case however Lam made no reference to the advice that he received. He merely referred to the fact that there had been a discussion about his case, and then stated that he had decided to plead guilty.
	
	
	For the reasons I have already expressed, Lam’s various references to speaking about his case do not disclose the substance of any advice he received. Further, in disclosing his decision to plead guilty, Lam did not, expressly or impliedly, link that decision to any advice he had received in a way which might support a conclusion that the disclosure of his decision should be treated as the disclosure of the advice. Lam disclosed no more than the fact of his decision to plead guilty. In doing so, he made no reference to any advice he had been given in that respect.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	For the forgoing reasons, I am satisfied that no privilege attaches to those matters disclosed by Lam in paragraph (16) of his statement of 20 June 2014.

Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts, which can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	On the morning of 6 December 2014, Mr Shiddiquzzaman used a computer connected to the Internet to book three seats for air travel from Perth to Sydney in the names of Moses BANGURA, Prince BHOPAL and Mathew JACOBS on a Virgin Australia flight departing Perth on 8 December 2014. Mr Shiddiquzzaman used a MasterCard in his name to pay for the booking and recorded a Virgin Velocity frequent flyer number belonging to Mr Thorne.
	
	
	On 7 December 2014, Mr Thorne used his mobile telephone to contact Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd (Flight Centre) to confirm the bookings, but was informed that the direct flight from Perth to Sydney had been cancelled. At that time the three tickets in the false names were reissued for two Virgin Australia flights, being a flight from Perth to Brisbane with a connecting flight from Brisbane to Sydney, both departing on 8 December 2014.
	
	
	On 7 December 2014, boarding passes were printed for the two Virgin Australia flights in the names of Moses BANGURA, Prince BHOPAL and Mathew JACOBS.
	
	
	At about 7.17am (AWST) on 8 December 2014, Mr Shiddiquzzaman presented the boarding pass in the name of Prince BHOPAL, Mr Thorne presented the boarding pass in the name of Mathew JACOBS and the co-offender Omer Abdirahman Issak presented the boarding pass on the name of Moses BANGURA to Virgin Australia staff at Perth Airport. They then boarded the flight and travelled from Perth to Brisbane on flight VA 463.
	
	
	At about 2.30pm (AEST) on 8 December 2014, Mr Shiddiquzzaman presented the boarding pass in the name of Prince BHOPAL, Mr Thorne presented the boarding pass in the name of Mathew JACOBS and the co-offender Omer Abdirahman Issak presented the boarding pass on the name of Moses BANGURA to Virgin Australia staff at Brisbane Airport. They then boarded the flight and travelled from Brisbane to Sydney on flight VA 958.
	
	
	On 8 December 2014, Virgin Australia security staff notified the Australian Federal Police Joint Counter Terrorism Team (AFP JCTT) of the travel by the three men. The AFP then began an investigation by reviewing CCTV footage from Brisbane Airport and by checking the passenger booking information.
	
	
	On 12 December 2014, Mr Shiddiquzzaman was arrested when he arrived at Perth Airport on a flight from Sydney. A search of his baggage located a Virgin Australia boarding pass issued in the name of Mathew JACOBS and the MasterCard that was used to pay for the Internet booking.
	
	
	On 13 December 2014 the AFP executed a search warrant at Mr Shiddiquzzaman’s home in Perth and located a number of computers. At that time, Mr Shiddiquzzaman made admissions that he paid for the flights and said that Mr Thorne printed the boarding passes from a computer. Mr Shiddiquzzaman was unable to travel to Bangladesh on 14 December 2014 with his family as a result of the charges before the Court.
	
	
	On 13 January 2015, Mr Shiddiquzzaman participated in a record of interview, during which he said that:
	



	
	he booked the flights for himself, Mr Thorne and the co-offender;
	
	
	he used his MasterCard;
	
	
	he boarded the flights with the others using fictitious names;
	
	
	he did it “just for fun…to see if it works and it did. We checked in online and it worked. We heard from someone else that it does work and so we just tried it out for fun”; and
	
	
	he believed that boarding commercial flights using fictitious names was commonly done.
	



	
	On 15 January 2015, the AFP executed a search warrant at Mr Thorne’s home in Sydney and located a Virgin Velocity frequent Flyer card in the name of Mr Thorne, bearing the frequent flyer number entered in the Internet booking made by Mr Shiddiquzzaman on 6 December 2014. At that time, Mr Thorne made the following admissions:
	



	
	that he travelled on the Virgin Australia flights from Perth to Brisbane and Brisbane to Sydney on 8 December 2014;
	
	
	that the flights were booked under false names as Mr Shiddiquzzaman did not want people to know he was travelling with Mr Thorne because of Mr Thorne’s high profile in the media; and
	
	
	that the mobile telephone used to contact Flight Centre on 7 December 2014 was subscribed to him.
	



	
	At the time of the alleged offences, Perth Domestic Airport and Brisbane Airport were constitutional airports and Virgin Australia flights VA 463 and VA 958 were constitutional flights starting and ending in Australia.
	


Criminal antecedents


	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman has no prior convictions.
	
	
	Mr Thorne has one prior traffic conviction. On 9 July 2014, he was convicted of Unlicensed Driving in the Fremantle Magistrates Court, fined the sum of $200 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver’s licence for a period of three months. I consider that prior conviction to be irrelevant to my consideration of this matter.
	


Pre-Sentence Reports


	
	Pre-Sentence reports in the form of a Sentencing Options Assessments were prepared by a Community Corrections Officer in relation to both offenders.
	


Mr Shiddiquzzaman’s subjective case


	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman tendered on the appeal:
	



	
	a number of character references;
	
	
	a report of Wajma Ebrahimi, his treating Clinical Psychologist dated 3 August 2015; and
	
	
	a report of Thea Gumbert-Jourjon, Psychologist dated 31 July 2015 that was prepared at the request of his solicitor for the purposes of the appeal;
	
	
	an undated letter from Associate Professor Anne Aly of Curtin University.
	



	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman’s subjective material can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman was born in Tokyo to Bangladeshi parents. He is the eldest of four children. He lived in Bangladesh until emigrating to Australia with his family in about 1999, when he was four years old The family settled in Perth. His parents were devout Muslims and the family returned to Bangladesh between 2004 and 2009 in order to provide the children with an appropriate religious and cultural education. The family returned to Australia in 2009 when he was 13 years old. In 2012 his father returned to work in Bangladesh where he continues to be a Professor of Environmental Science at Kuhnla University. In 2013 Mr Shiddiquzzaman became an Australian citizen.
	
	
	He is presently 19 years of age. He completed his secondary education in Perth in 2012. In 2013 the enrolled in a Bachelor of Biomedical Science and a Bachelor of a Molecular Biology at Murdoch University. In 2014 he transferred to Curtin University. He has deferred his university course for the 2015 year. His intention is to continue his education at Curtin University and to graduate.
	
	
	He played soccer at high school. Since leaving high school he has practised his faith, and supported other young men from his community in the transition to tertiary education. During high school and his first year of university he has held a number of casual jobs.
	
	
	On 6 June 2015 he sought treatment from his general practitioner for symptoms of depression related to the unknown outcome of these proceedings. He was given a Mental Health Care Plan and referred to Wajma Ebrahimi a Clinical Psychologist for counselling. He attended for counselling on two occasions being, 6 June 2015 and 1 August 2015.
	
	
	On 14 July 2015 when he was assessed by Ms Gumbert-Jourjon, he completed a number of psychological tests and presented from the results of those tests as severely depressed, anxious and stressed. The precursor for all of Mr Shiddiquzzaman’s feelings of distress was the uncertain outcome of these proceedings and the affect that the outcome would have on his future.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman contends that his compliance with the bail conditions imposed on him pending the hearing of this appeal, is demonstrative of his suitability to be rehabilitated within the community.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman wishes to return to Western Australia at the conclusion of these proceedings to continue his tertiary education and to be near his family.
	


Mr Thorne’s subjective case


	
	Mr Thorne tendered on the appeal:
	



	
	a number of character references;
	
	
	an application to the University Admissions Centre dated 5 February 2015;
	
	
	a letter from the University Admissions Centre dated 28 July 2015 informing Mr Thorne that he was unsuccessful in the applications he had made to it for enrolment in tertiary education courses;
	
	
	a letter from Wajma Ebrahimi, Clinical Psychologist to his General Practitioner Dr Silva dated 10 February 2015;
	
	
	a report of Wajma Ebrahimi, his treating Clinical Psychologist dated 3 August 2015
	
	
	a report of Dr Liu, Sonographer dated 27 July 2015;
	
	
	a report of Thea Gumbert-Jourjon, Psychologist dated 31 July 2015 that was prepared at the request of his solicitor for the purposes of the appeal;
	
	
	a Medical Certificate from Dr Theresa Wong dated 4 August 2015 certifying him fit to undertake community service work; and
	
	
	an undated letter from Associate Professor Anne Aly of Curtin University.
	



	
	Mr Thorne’s subjective case can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	He was born in Perth. His father was Aboriginal and his mother was an Australian citizen of Singaporean descent. He had one older brother from his parent’s relationship. His parents separated when he was an infant and he was raised by his mother and his step-father. They had 6 children from their relationship.
	
	
	Mr Thorne was the victim of domestic violence at the hands of his step-father. Mr Thorne was raised in the Islamic faith and was largely home schooled by his mother. In about 1999 when Mr Thorne was 10 years old the family moved to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. He did well in secondary school but his step-father’s physical abuse escalated and he and his elder brother were forced to leave home at age 17. Mr Thorne completed his final high school examinations whilst working part-time to support himself and his brother. He achieved excellent results in his final examinations and was offered a scholarship to undertake a Bachelor of Finance at Prince Sultan University in Riyadh.
	
	
	During his second year of university, his elder brother was arrested at their home and subsequently incarcerated. Mr Thorne did not know the basis on which his brother had been arrested and did not know where he was being held. Mr Thorne’s brother remained in custody for nearly 4 years. Mr Thorne conducted research into the rights of prisoners and became more politically active in the year or two following his brother’s arrest.
	
	
	His mother separated from his stepfather and returned to Australia. At about this time Mr Thorne obtained employment and commenced a relationship with a woman who he had planned to marry.
	
	
	In early 2013, towards the end of his final year of university, Mr Thorne participated in a protest and was arrested. He was detained and held for approximately 4 months and subjected to extremely poor conditions including inadequate food and sanitation. It was very frightened for his safety at this time. As a result of his detention Mr Thorne missed his university exams and was unable to complete his degree. He lost his employment and his fiancee’s family ended the engagement.
	
	
	In mid-2013 Mr Thorne was released from custody and deported to Australia. He began to reside with his mother and half siblings in Perth. At this time he started to attract quite a bit of media attention as his brother was a political prisoner. He became involved in activism in Australia and was regularly invited to give talks on religion and politics.
	
	
	Mr Thorne attempted to complete his degree at Curtin University in early 2014 but found it difficult to re-engage with his studies. At around this time he reported that he was subject to increasing attention from ASIO and he became aware that many of his friends were being interviewed in relation to his activities. In about mid-2014 he participated in a 4-5 hour interview with ASIO officers, with a view to having them deal with him directly, rather than with his family and friends.
	
	
	At about this time he began to receive death threats and hate mail both online and physically sent to his family home. Mr Thorne discontinued his university studies out of fear for his safety and reported the threats to police. He decided to move to Sydney where he had friends and could participate in a larger Islamic community.
	
	
	He is currently 26 years of age. He is married and resides with his wife, her 3 children and Mr Shiddiquzzaman. He works as a labourer and casually as an Arabic language teacher. Mr Thorne and his wife are expecting their first child in about March 2016.
	
	
	In about 2011 Mr Thorne slipped a spinal disc during martial arts training. He also injured his knee playing soccer in 2012. His ability to complete physical work is limited to some extent.
	
	
	In January 2015, Mr Thorne was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder by his general practitioner Dr Silva and referred to Wajma Ebrahimi, Clinical Psychologist for counselling. He has subsequently attended a total of 10 counselling sessions. The concerns expressed to the clinical psychologist by Mr Thorne relate to outcome of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 8 May 2015 Dr Olav Neilsen, Psychiatrist, opined in a report that Mr Thorne did not meet the criteria for diagnosis with any psychiatric disorder. However Dr Nielsen believed that Mr Thorne was experiencing some difficulties with mood and functioning as a result of the current charges, including anxiety and poor sleep.
	
	
	The psychological testing of Mr Thorne by Thea Gumbert-Jourjon on 16 July 2015 did not report any abnormal findings of significance.
	
	
	Mr Thorne contends that his compliance with the bail conditions imposed on him pending the hearing of this appeal, is demonstrative of his suitability to be rehabilitated within the community.
	
	
	Mr Thorne intends in the future to re-enrol into tertiary education.
	


Consideration


	
	As these are Commonwealth offences, the procedural requirements and penalty options for sentencing are set out in Part IB Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act).
	
	
	Section 16A(1) of the Act requires that the Court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. The court must take into account such of the matters as are set out in section 16A(2) of the Act as are relevant and known to the Court. The list of factors in section 16A(2) of the Act is not exhaustive and common law principles apply to the sentencing of federal offenders, Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [15].
	
	
	The phrase “known to the court” does not require the formal proof of matters before they can be taken into account in sentencing, Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629.
	


Objective circumstances of the offences


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	Both of the offences being considered by the Court involve dishonesty.
	
	
	The offenders committed the offences with the intention of avoiding coming under notice of the authorities when travelling within Australia. Mr Shiddiquzzaman reported that intention to the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report and Ms Gumbert-Jourjon. Mr Thorne reported that intention to the Community Corrections Officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report, to his treating Clinical Psychologist and Ms Gumbert-Jourjon.
	
	
	The offenders sought to avoid coming to the notice of the authorities when they knew that their activities were of interest to the authorities. At the time of the offences, according to what they both told Ms Gumbert-Jourjon they had already both been interviewed by ASIO officers in connection with Mr Thorne’s activities. There is no evidence before me as to what those activities were and it is not appropriate for me to speculate as to what they might have been or why they were of interest to ASIO.
	
	
	The intention of the offenders had the effect of subverting one of the purposes of the prohibition contemplated by the offence, which was the promotion of security of air travel.
	
	
	On the material before me I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was Mr Thorne’s idea to commit the offences and he stood to gain the most from travelling incognito. The offences involved some degree of planning; albeit that planning was unsophisticated.
	
	
	I do not accept that Mr Shiddiquzzaman committed the offences “just for fun”.
	
	
	I do not accept that Mr Thorne was motivated to commit the offences to avoid media attention. Whilst I accept that Mr Thorne had been the subject of media attention, presumably as a result of his activities, and he wanted to leave Perth, I do not understand how he could have reasonably believed that if he travelled from Perth to Sydney using his own identity that the media would have been alerted to his movements.
	
	
	The fact that the offenders took two flights and have thereby been charged with two counts of the section 376.3(2) offence arose from Virgin Australia’s decision to cancel the direct flight from Perth to Sydney on 8 December 2014. This was a matter of which the offenders had no control.
	


Deterrence


	
	General deterrence is not a matter specifically referred to in section 16A(2) of the Act, but it is so obviously relevant to sentencing that it must be considered, Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174 at [12].
	
	
	It is a very significant factor in sentencing these two offenders. One of the main purposes of punishment is to protect the public from the commission of crime by making it clear to the offender and other persons intending to commit similar crimes that they will meet with severe punishment.
	
	
	Since about 2002 the security arrangements at airports and relating to air travel have been significantly strengthened. A common feature of that security has been the provision of photograph identification as a pre-condition of air travel. In recent times these requirements have been relaxed for domestic air travel, presumably in an effort to reduce the costs associated with it. The community are expected to be able to put trust in those persons who use carriage services to book air travel and to print boarding passes to use their true identity. In breaching that trust, the offenders caused significant concern or the risk of such concern in the community for the safety of air travel.
	
	
	Specific deterrence is expressly provided for in section 16A(2)(j) of the Act. There is a need for specific deterrence in dealing with Mr Shiddiquzzaman. The need for specific deterrence is more significant in dealing with Mr Thorne as he has not fully accepted responsibility for his actions.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman expressed to Ms Gumbert-Jourjon that he accepts responsibility for his involvement in the offences and I accept that he has shown some contrition. Mr Thorne stated to Ms Ms Gumbert-Jourjon that “I’ve done something wrong, but I feel I was forced into it. He expressed remorse to one of his referees, but in the context that he felt pressured into the offending behaviour. I accept that he has shown some small amount of contrition.
	
	
	The offenders entered an early plea of guilty. For Commonwealth offences, the Court must consider the offender’s willingness to facilitate course of justice and not the utilitarian value of the plea; Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339 at [14]. In assessing the willingness of an offender to facilitate course of justice the strength of the Crown case against the offender is a relevant consideration. That enquiry may reveal whether the plea was a recognition of the inevitable or truly motivated by willingness to facilitate course of justice, Lee v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 123 at [58]. In this matter the Crown case was a strong one, but I also take into account that the guilty plea has saved witnesses from giving evidence at trial and that is a part of facilitating the course of justice. According both offenders are entitled to a discount on the sentence imposed by reference to their pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The offenders were both previously persons of good character.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman is quite young at age 19 and but for these offences he would have continued his university studies in Perth this year. His first contact with Mr Thorne was in July 2014 when he attended a series of talks presented by Mr Thorne. On 8 December 2014 he travelled with Mr Thorne to Sydney for a holiday, intending to return to Perth, whereas Mr Thorne intended to relocate to Sydney for a longer period. I am satisfied that Mr Shiddiquzzaman’s involvement in these criminal offences was as a follower and not a leader. He has no physical restrictions and the concerns for his mental health are directly related to the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty of the outcome of these proceedings. He has excellent prospects for rehabilitation, particularly if he can return to Perth where he has the support of his family.
	
	
	Mr Thorne is 26 years of age, recently married and expecting his first child in March 2016. He is presently working as a labourer as his tertiary education has been interrupted by a complicated series of events occurring in his life. He has recently had attempted to enrolling in other tertiary courses but that has not been successful. He is undecided as to whether he will remain in Sydney returned to Perth. He has some physical restrictions that will probably make work as a labourer difficult for the long term. He does not have any significant mental condition other than experiencing some difficulties with mood and functioning as a result of the current charges. He has some prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Both offenders rely on an offer of support from Associate Professor Anne Aly of Curtin University. Associate Professor Aly is the founding chair of a non- government organisation that works with young people to address issues of violent extremism in Australia and the region. She has offered each of the offenders an opportunity to participate in a structured mentoring program that is based at Curtin University in Perth. That program would be of particular benefit to Mr Shiddiquzzaman as he intends to return to Perth as soon as possible. As to whether the program could be of benefit to Mr Thorne would depend on where he intends to reside with his family in the future. It has been suggested that Mr Thorne could make monthly visits to Perth to be part of the mentoring program, whilst living in Sydney, but I think that is unlikely to occur as it would involve considerable cost that could not be met by Mr Thorne.
	


Parity


	
	The co-offender was charged with two counts of take a flight with a ticket obtained by use of carriage service with false identification, contrary to section 376.3(2) Criminal Code (Cth). He was dealt with by Magistrate Hawkins on 22 May 2015 after entering pleas of guilty. He had a record involving minor traffic matters that was irrelevant to the Magistrate’s determination. He was 22 years of age and enrolled at university. He made admissions and accepted responsibility for his actions which were denounced by his family. The magistrate accepted that he had been foolish and had not played any part in the booking of the tickets in false names. The magistrate imposed a community-based order for a period of 12 months on the basis that the co-offender was supervised and required to participate in programs as directed.
	
	
	The parity principle is an aspect of the systemic objectives of consistency and equality before the law-the treatment of like cases like, and different cases differently, Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [28]. The principle is to be applied at first instance and on appeal.
	
	
	There is no rule of law which requires co-offender is to be given the same sentence for the same offence even if no distinction can be drawn between them. Obviously with the circumstances of each offender with his involvement in the offence are different than different sentences may be called for but justice should be even-handed. Any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not to be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done, Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 606 at 623.
	
	
	Disparity may be justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise, Green at [31]-[32].
	
	
	I have had regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender. I have come to a different conclusion on penalty to that imposed by the magistrate on the co-offender, by reference to his age his excellent prospects for rehabilitation and his lesser involvement in the offences.
	
	
	I have had regard to section 17A(1) of the Act and I am satisfied that after having considered all other available sentences that no other sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances of these cases. The reasons for this decision are that in these cases:
	



	
	the offences committed are objectively serious;
	
	
	there is a significant need for general deterrence;
	
	
	there is a need for specific deterrence;
	
	
	there is a need for denunciation of the offending conduct; and shipped
	
	
	that whilst the subjective considerations relating to each of the offenders are persuasive they are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the Court to ensure that they are given a punishment of appropriate severity.
	


Penalty - Mr Shiddiquzzaman


	
	Section 20AB of the Act and clause 6 Crimes Regulations 1990 provide that an Intensive Corrections Order is available as a sentencing alternative for federal offenders.
	
	
	The Court has considered section 17A(1) of the Act and is satisfied for the reasons given that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and that the sentence will be for a period of no more than 2 years.
	
	
	It is appropriate in the case of Mr Shiddiquzzaman to consider an alternative to full-time imprisonment, because of his age, his prospects for rehabilitation and his role in the offences.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman is referred for assessment as to his suitability for an Intensive Corrections Order as a means of serving the sentence.
	
	
	Mr Shiddiquzzaman is directed to report to the Bankstown Community Corrections Office in person on or before 4.00pm on 13 August 2015. His appeal is adjourned part heard before me to 6 October 2015.
	


Penalty – Mr Thorne


	
	The Court has considered section 17A(1) of the Act and is satisfied for the reasons given that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate, and that the sentence will be for a period of no more than 2 years.
	
	
	However, the alternative to full-time imprisonment of either an Intensive Corrections Order or a Home Detention Order should not be invoked in Mr Thorne’s case because of the need for general and specific deterrence, his age, his lack of acceptance of responsibility for his actions and his superior role in the offending conduct. Mr Thorne’s prospects for rehabilitation will be improved by providing for a longer than normal period of the sentence to be subject to a recognizance release order.
	
	
	Taking into account all of those matters I make the following orders:
	



	
	Mr Throne’s appeal against the severity of his sentence is allowed;
	
	
	I set aside the penalty imposed by the Magistrate and in lieu thereof:
	



	
	in relation to each of the offences contrary to section 376.3(2) Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 months to date from today and expire on 5 November 2015 and are to be served concurrently;
	
	
	in relation to the offence contrary to section 376.3(1) Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 months to commence from 6 September 2015 and I make a recognizance release order that he be released after 3 months of that term on 5 December 2015.

2767397,R v Moore [2015] NSWSC 1262,"EX TEMPORE Judgment (REVISED)


	
	Luke Moore makes a release application under the provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW) as amended by the Bail Amendment Act 2014 (NSW). He was convicted by a jury in Goulburn of two offences after a trial which concluded on 19 February 2015. Those are offences of dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception and dealing with the proceeds of crime. The applicant was taken into custody shortly after the jury returned its verdicts and was subsequently sentenced by the Trial Judge, Judge Norrish SC, to a total sentence of four and a half years with a non-parole period of two years and three months. The non-parole period will expire on 17 May 2017.
	
	
	The application first came before me in the bail list on 21 July 2015. Due to the obvious complexity of the matter and the busyness of the list, the matter was adjourned in order to obtain a date when the Court could hear the application. On 23 July 2015 I listed the matter for hearing today. Neither the solicitor nor the Crown Prosecutor who appeared for the Crown at the trial was available to appear and the Crown is represented today by Mr Lee.
	
	
	Because the application follows the applicant's conviction and sentence on indictment, the provisions of s 22 of the Bail Act apply. That section requires the applicant to establish that there are ""special or exceptional circumstances"" that justify a decision to grant bail. The content and operation of that section was considered in El Hilli v Melville [2015] NSWCCA 146. That case was also a case involving allegations of large scale fraudulent conduct and involved unrepresented litigants. However, there are very few other comparisons when one analyses the relevant circumstances of each case.
	
	
	As I said in El Hilli, the requirement for an applicant for bail pending appeal to establish special or exceptional circumstances is one of long-standing and has been considered by single judges of the High Court of Australia in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction as well as by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the context of s 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 - see the cases collected in El Hilli at [17] and the analysis of those cases from [18] to [26].
	
	
	I also said that the provision in sub-s 22(2); whereby the requirement to show cause in relation to certain offences and circumstances is supplanted by the special or exceptional circumstances test, suggest that the special or exceptional circumstance test is at least as onerous as the show cause requirement. I probably did not go far enough. It is a more onerous test. [1] 
	
	
	The applicant in the present case relies on a combination of circumstances to establish that there are special or exceptional circumstances: El Hilli at [29] and the comments of Johnson J in R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499 at [20] when considering the question of exceptional circumstances under the 1978 Act in a murder case.
	
	
	The factors relied upon here include a number of matters which are relevant to the questions that would arise under ss 17 to 19 of the Bail Act, that is, a consideration of ""bail concerns"" and ""unacceptable risk"". None of those matters either individually or in combination would constitute special or exceptional circumstances for the purpose of s 22. However, the applicant relies on them in combination with the length of time that he will remain in custody pending his appeal, relative to the length of the non-parole period and what he submits to be the reasonable prospects that his appeal will be successful.
	
	
	Those latter two factors are typically central to an assessment of any case where appeal bail is sought and special or exceptional circumstances need to be established. The Crown very fairly concedes that the application of s 17, 18 and 19 would not lead me to the conclusion that there are unacceptable risks in the present case. From this I infer that absent the provisions in s 22, the Crown would not oppose bail. However, the Crown submits firmly that nothing that has been put to me today satisfies the requirements of s 22 or meet the description special of exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	In making that submission Mr Lee concedes that he is hamstrung to a degree by the fact that he did not appear in the proceedings at first instance and is not in a position to meet a number of legal arguments made on behalf of the applicant. He declined the opportunity to seek an adjournment of the application to allow him more time to consider those submissions. He took the entirely appropriate position that there is on the record a conviction by a jury arising from a trial in which the directions of law are not flagrantly or patently incorrect.
	
	
	I have been provided with what I take to be the original police facts sheet which sets out with reasonable clarity the circumstances of the alleged offending as well as the summing-up delivered by Judge Norrish on 18 and 19 February.
	
	
	The facts disclosed in those documents establish that the applicant opened a bank account in March 2010 with the St George Bank. He used his own name and personal details and there is no suggestion that his action in opening that account was attended with any deceptive conduct. At that time he held an account described as a ""Margin Lending Account"" with the same bank. As a result, the new bank account ""was loaded with and subject to the same conditions as the Margin Lending Account"".
	
	
	One of those conditions which carried over from the Margin Lending Account was the allocation of what was described as ""RO Status"". ""RO"" refers to Relationship Officer and the process seems to be that where an account was overdrawn or where the bank customer sought to take the account into overdraft, or further into overdraft, the matter was referred through the bank's normal credit approval systems to the Relationship Officer.
	
	
	It seems to have been common ground at the trial that the bank’s system broke down and as a result the applicant was able to overdraw the account to a very substantial degree. Between 21 December 2011 and 13 July 2012 a total of one million seven hundred and eighty nine thousand dollars had been obtained or credited to a PayPal account which was operated by the applicant.
	
	
	I interpolate here that if the Relationship Officer failed to respond to an overdraft request the bank's system was to allow the overdraft to proceed. There were a number, perhaps fifty withdrawals, or overdraws between the period of December 2011 and July of 2012. By that latter date the applicant had acquired a lifestyle of some luxury. He had acquired, amongst other things, a six-metre boat, a Maserati sedan, an Alfa Romeo sedan, a collection of valuable paintings, numerous items described as ""memorabilia"" and various items of jewellery. Those items were the subject to a second charge being a charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime.
	
	
	The thrust of the submissions made by the applicant, and it seems a substantial part of the case he conducted at trial, was that there was no positive or active deception of the bank. He tendered a newspaper article in which an officer of the bank was quoted as saying that the matter was a ""one off"" incident of ""human error"".
	
	
	At the hearing of the bail application, Mr Lee submitted that the deception was overdrawing the account to such a substantial degree in circumstances where the applicant had no intention to repay the money. The learned Trial Judge described the deception in his summing-up to the jury in the following way:
	


“The Crown says that the deception was exercised by the accused because he had no authority - now I know that has been referred to by counsel for the accused - but he had no authority to overdraw the account and overdraw the account to the extent of which the account was overdrawn"".


	
	The learned Trial Judge went on to direct the jury that the deception;
	


“may be intentional or recklessly practised by the accused and that the Crown had submitted that he may have initially been reckless in the sense that he did not appreciate the extent to which he could overdraw the account but as time went on he must have acted intentionally as is evidenced by, the Crown says, by the significant sums of money that he eventually drew down from the account"".


	
	The judge went on to direct the jury as to the element that the act and the deception to be dishonest and his Honour said:
	


“To act dishonestly in this context means to be dishonest to the standards of ordinary people and it must be known by the accused to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people. You, the jury, are ordinary members of the community. That is not meant in a condescending way. You are representatives of the community and you are able to judge what the standards of ordinary people in our community are"".


	
	His Honour also directed the jury in relation to the elements of dishonesty and deception as follows:
	


""It does not have to relate to all of the transactions that are particularized in exhibit A but it must be established in relation to transactions that are evidenced in exhibit A between those two dates"".


	
	In relation to the second count his Honour directed the jury that it would not arise unless the jury was satisfied that the offence alleged in count one had been established beyond reasonable doubt. For that reason, the contest at trial and indeed before me on the bail application has focused on the deception count.
	
	
	The applicant made a number of points in relation to the matter, some of which appear to me to be devoid of merit. For example, the applicant submitted, in effect, that the Trial Judge had erroneously conflated the two elements of deception and dishonesty. My perusal of the Judge's summing-up suggests that this did not happen.
	
	
	The applicant also sought to make an argument that might be described as one of “selective prosecution”. In other words, he drew my attention to cases where people who had been overpaid by a bank or who have overdrawn accounts with banks had not been subject to criminal prosecution. In particular, he referred to the decision of the Federal Court in Westpac Banking Corporation v Ollis (2007) FCA 1194 and Shields v The New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 309. Those two cases related to the same person (Mr Ollis), who had engaged in conduct that might generally be thought to be quite similar to that of the applicant in the present case. He had drawn on accounts knowing or allegedly knowing that he was not entitled to do so to a very substantial degree. It seems that the amount in question was around eleven million dollars. The applicant points out - and I have no reason to doubt it - that Mr Ollis was not charged with any criminal offending in spite of the fact that Mr Ollis' conduct was more flagrant than that of the applicant both in terms of the amount in consequence of the bank's error and the nature of the deception which was said, in that case, to be clearer. I note, on the other hand, that there was some suggestion that Mr Ollis may have had an intention to repay the money (although the applicant tells me that he did not concede at trial an absence of intention to repay the money).
	
	
	Even accepting all of that to be so, the fact that one person is charged whilst another is not is not a basis under New South Wales law to impeach the conviction of the person who was charged. This even applies as between co-offenders. Both police and prosecuting authorities are provided with a lively discretion as to who is and who is not to be charged. I am unable to see merit in this aspect of the applicant's proposed appeal.
	
	
	The applicant also made reference to what he described as the sanctity of the contract and the concept of a privity of contract between him and the St George Bank. As far as I could follow, the applicant was contending that the nature of the contract or relationship between him and the bank was such as to exclude a third party such as the New South Wales Police Force or the Director of Public Prosecutions from imposing sanctions and, in particular, criminal sanctions.
	
	
	He submitted that the sanctions for breach of contract were civil remedies only. I take this to be, in part, a reliance on the law of consent. In any event, and however one puts it, the proposition need only to be stated to be rejected. There is no substance to this assertion.
	
	
	The applicant also sought to establish that his conduct could not amount to theft or larceny at law, and took me to cases such as Ilich v R (1987) 162 CLR 110 and R v Potisk (1973) 6 SASR 389. On my quick perusal of those cases, they seemed to involve a single transaction, which distinguishes them to a very large degree from the circumstances which prevailed here.
	
	
	In any event, in the case of Shields v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 309, Beazley JA, as her Honour then was, considered the question of whether the conduct there could amount to larceny and concluded that, indeed, it could.
	


“47. The Court, after referring to the “interesting argument” advanced on behalf of the appellant, stated at 132 [4]:

“… The fact that the Bank programmed the machine in a way that facilitated the commission of a fraud by a person holding a card did not mean that the Bank consented to the withdrawal of money by a person who had no account with the Bank. It is not suggested that any person, having the authority of the Bank to consent to the particular transaction, did so. The machine could not give the Bank's consent in fact and there is no principle of law that requires it to be treated as though it were a person with authority to decide and consent. The proper inference to be drawn from the facts is that the Bank consented to the withdrawal of up to $200 by a card-holder who presented his card and supplied his personal identification number, only if the card-holder had an account which was current. It would be quite unreal to infer that the Bank consented to the withdrawal by a card-holder whose account had been closed. The conditions of use of the card supplied by the Bank to its customers support the conclusion that no such inference can be drawn.”

48. This case is no different. The contents of the Westpac investigation report included information that Ollis knew the conditions of the operation of the ATR facility. He knew the collections area of the bank had placed a ban on his personal account responding to the ATR facility. He also knew that due to a “computer glitch” that ban was not recognised by the ATR facility and he decided to take advantage of that failure and continue to draw on the account in an amount totalling almost $11m.

49. Although the Westpac investigation report indicated that Ollis intended at some stage to repay the funds that he had withdrawn, he did not intend to repay the moneys that he withdrew on each occasion. Rather, he intended to repay other moneys so as to replenish his account. In my opinion, all the elements to constitute the offence of larceny have been alleged in one form or another in its report. The material, therefore, provided a sufficient basis upon which Mr Spark could form the suspicion to which he deposed in his affidavit. In other words, there were reasonable grounds upon which Mr Spark could form a suspicion that Ollis had engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities as required by s 10 of the Act.”


	
	The applicant also took me to Kennison v Daire (1986) 160 CLR 129. That case involved a customer using an ATM, in circumstances where a glitch in the system allowed him to take money that was not his. It was put on his behalf that the bank had thereby consented. The High Court rejected that submission. In any event, much of the fundamental basis of this submission does not apply to the offence with which the applicant was actually convicted, a point made in footnote 99 of an article referred to in the course of submissions by the applicant: see Steel, “Problematic and Unnecessary? Issues with the use of the Theft Offence to Protect Intangible Property” (2008) 30 Sydney Law Review 575 at 589.
	
	
	Mr Moore also contended that his case was not properly presented at the trial and, indeed, that he was incompetently represented there. I accept the Crown submission that the material available to me at this stage, which is very limited, means that it would be quite irresponsible of me to make any finding adverse to counsel in relation to that matter. I do note, however, that that submission will be advanced by the applicant on the appeal.
	
	
	A real conundrum in the present case arises from the fact that the applicant appears unrepresented not through any choice of his own but as a result of the failure of the Legal Aid Commission to provide him with representation. That is not meant as a criticism of the Commission. The circumstance in which that occurred arise as a result of circumstance beyond the Commission or the applicant's control.
	
	
	When the matter was first mentioned in the bail list, the solicitors then present from the Commission indicated to me that they did not appear for the applicant. It was also indicated that he was privately represented on the appeal. The applicant informed me that he had retained a private solicitor and a private barrister, but that they were acting in the case on an assignment or an assigned grant of legal aid. He nominated his solicitor, and I had my Associate make contact with the solicitor in the period of the adjournment. The solicitor replied in the following terms:
	


“I have been assigned Mr Moore's matter by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales. It is a limited grant to obtain an advice on merit in relation to a proposed CCA all grounds appeal. Mr Stratton SC has been briefed.

At this stage my office is awaiting the trial transcript, et cetera, as we did not act for Mr Moore previously. As an aside, I have been informed that some trial transcript will never be available due to a transcription error.

The policy of the Legal Aid Commission, as I understand it, is for the Commission's in-house solicitors to appear in all legally aided bail applications.”


	
	The solicitor went on to say that he regretted that he did not act on the bail application and could not further assist the Court. He said that he would attend if directed to do so. I elected not to direct him to attend.
	
	
	It will be seen that as at the date of that email to my Associate, which was 21 July 2015, the full transcript of the trial remained outstanding. Indeed, when the matter came on this morning Mr Lee indicated that the DPP is unable at this stage to obtain a copy of the Trial Judge's remarks on sentence. In the result, senior counsel is not yet in a position to provide any advice and, accordingly, the matter has proceeded without formal grounds of appeal even having been formulated. That is a most unusual circumstance. Ordinarily, when a matter attracts the provisions of s 22 (and s 30AA before it), an applicant would present to the Court with the grounds of appeal clearly stated, and preferably with written submissions in support or, if appropriate, the advice from counsel upon which the grounds are based. That has not happened in this case for the reason that senior counsel is yet to be briefed with the transcripts which are not now, and may never be, available.
	
	
	Whilst the factual circumstances of the offending is not, as I have recounted them above, unduly complicated, it was a trial that lasted in the District Court for some time and involved a significant amount of documentation. The questions of principle that Mr Moore seeks to agitate are difficult, complex and in some cases fundamental. I anticipate that even when all of the material is available, it would take senior counsel, in the course of a busy practice, some time to arrive at his opinion.
	
	
	Accordingly, in the most unusual circumstances that here prevail, and given the delay which is already in the order of 6 months since Mr Moore was convicted and taken into custody, I propose to proceed with the bail application in spite of the absence of formal grounds of appeal. This should not be seen as a precedent, and arises through the peculiar and almost unique circumstances of this case. Ordinarily, it will be incumbent upon an applicant to establish, by reference to grounds of appeal and submissions, even in draft form, what arguments are to be advanced in the Court of Criminal Appeal and whether those arguments have any real merit.
	
	
	However, even though I will proceed with the application, it places the applicant in the difficult position of attempting to establish the merit of his case in the absence of any grounds. Indeed, it places me in the position where I cannot realistically come to any concluded or informed view as to the merit or prospects of the proposed appeal.
	
	
	However, I have come to the conclusion that the case is an unusual one. Indeed, the nature of the deception here asserted is most unlike the majority of cases of fraud. That is not to say that the Crown case was not established beyond reasonable doubt, or that there was any error in the trial that will operate to vitiate the verdicts. Mr Lee, with admirable candour and fairness, conceded that ""it is an unusual case"" and that it is not a ""run of the mill fraud case"".
	
	
	In view of the questions which arise as to the precise nature of the deception that the accused is alleged to have perpetrated, considerations around his intention, that is whether it was deliberate or reckless, and the parts of the summing-up that suggested the jury may not be satisfied in relation to all of the transactions referred to in annexure A, I have concluded that Mr Moore's appeal may enjoy some prospects of success. That is a very guarded assessment, and it is necessarily so in view of the limited nature of the material available.
	
	
	If that was all that Mr Moore relied on, I would not be able to find that there are special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail. However, there are a number of other matters which are relevant to that question, most important of which is the likely length of time that he will spend in custody pending the outcome of his appeal. It is necessary to make an estimate of that, even though the information upon which that estimate is made is imperfect and incomplete. But it seems to me that it is unlikely that the grounds of appeal and written submissions will be filed in the next month or so, given the other commitments of senior counsel who retains the brief. It may also be, as Mr Moore speculates in argument, that the notice of intention to appeal, which currently is due to expire in November, may be extended further. Much will turn on when the material from the trial is available to the solicitors. Assuming that the submissions were filed promptly thereafter, the likely appeal date would be in the first half of next year.
	
	
	It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which Mr Moore will have his appeal dealt with to finality before the expiration of a period of at least one year, since he was taken into custody following the jury's verdict. Indeed, it may be even longer than that. In any event, given that his non-parole period is 2 years and 3 months, it is likely that he will have served up to, or in excess of, half of that period before his appeal is dealt with. That is a significant factor and one to which I give substantial weight in considering the question under s 22.
	
	
	The other matters upon which Mr Moore relies are matters that are relevant to any other or normal bail application and would not, as I have already said, amount to special or exceptional circumstances in and of themselves. However, they are also relevant to the accumulation of circumstances upon which Mr Moore relies.
	
	
	The Crown concedes, as it must, that he has very little on his criminal history. When one takes out the matters on the bail report which were withdrawn or dismissed, it seems that there is just one offence of failing to leave premises when asked to do so, for which he was placed on a 12 month good behaviour bond without the recording of a conviction. Otherwise, it seems he has no previous offences. He certainly has no history of violence.
	
	
	Further, and this was the basis of the Crown's very fair concession that it is not a case where there are unacceptable risks for the purpose of s 19 of the Act, Mr Moore was on bail from 13 December 2013 until 19 February 2015. In that period, he complied with extremely onerous bail conditions for the first 4 to 6 months. When those conditions were varied and made less stringent he continued to comply. Significantly, he attended his trial even when the possibility of conviction and the inevitability of a gaol sentence loomed as the trial progressed. The trial judge allowed him to have bail when he adjourned the summing-up from 18 to 19 February 2015.
	
	
	Mr Moore also refers to the fact that his mother has a degenerative back ailment which causes her a significant disability. Further, she (that is the mother) has the care of Mr Moore's younger brother, who is only eight years of age, and Mr Moore's presence in the family home would be of some assistance to her. I reiterate that none of these matters of themselves would constitute special or exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	I have found the application a difficult one to resolve. It is particularly difficult to assess the prospects of success of the appeal, although what is clear is that for a case of fraud it has some unusual features. The absence of any risks, along with the length of time that he is likely to be in custody awaiting his appeal, combined with those unusual factual circumstances have ultimately persuaded me that there are special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail.
	
	
	In dealing with the question of special or exceptional circumstances, I have considered many of the matters that are relevant to bail concerns under s 17 and unacceptable risks under s 19.
	
	
	There is little doubt that the circumstance in which Mr Moore now finds himself is such that there must be a risk of flight, to some degree.
	
	
	However, I do not find that there is a bail concern in relation to him committing serious offences while on bail. His criminal history does not support such a conclusion. And the offences here committed were, whilst repetitive, opportunistic and the result of an error made by the bank. That circumstance is unlikely to repeat itself. It seems that the likelihood that he will commit further offences whilst on bail is but a minimal one.
	
	
	I am unable to identify any bail concern relating to his interfering with witnesses, or causing harm to any individual member of the community or the community at large.
	
	
	So that the only bail concern is that he will fail to appear. That is, of course, a significant matter, but it is one that can be met by the imposition of similarly strict bail condition as those to which he was subjected during the period of adjournment or remand leading up to the trial.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to grant the release application and allow conditional bail.
	
	
	Bail is granted on the following conditions
	



	
	To be of good behaviour.
	
	
	To report to [REDACTED] Police Station twice daily between the hours of 8am and 10am and 4pm and 6pm.
	
	
	To live at [REDACTED].
	
	
	To appear at the Court of Criminal Appeal on such date that his appeal is listed for hearing.
	
	
	To prosecute his appeal with expedition.
	
	
	Not to take any illegal or prescription drugs (other than a drug prescribed to the applicant by a doctor).
	
	
	The applicant is not to be absent from the address at which he is required to live between the hours of 7 pm and 7 am except in the case of a medical emergency.
	
	
	Not to apply for any new passport or travel document.
	
	
	Not to go within 500m of any point of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia.
	
	
	The applicant is to enter into an agreement without security under which he agrees to forfeit $5,000 if he fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	One acceptable person is to deposit acceptable security as security for the payment of $ 10,000 which he agrees to forfeit if the applicant fails to appear before court in accordance with the bail acknowledgment.
	
	
	To present himself at the front door at the direction of any police officer to confirm compliance with the curfew condition. Such direction may only be given by a police officer who believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so, having regard to the rights of other occupants of the premises to peace and privacy.

		01 September 2015",2015-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767402,A103 v R [2015] NSWCCA 210,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: A103 seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to four offences of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation in each case was that the offences were committed in company. The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 20 years. A standard non-parole period of five years applied.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant on count 1, the judge was asked to take into account 15 further offences on a Form 1 schedule. The judge sentenced the applicant as follows:
	


(a)   on counts 2 and 3, to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 14 August 2011 and expiring on 13 August 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 13 August 2016.

(b)   on count 4, to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 14 August 2013 and expiring on 13 August 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 13 August 2018.

(c)   on count 1 (the count on which the judge took into account the Form 1 matters), to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 14 August 2014 and expiring on 13 August 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 13 August 2021.


	
	The total sentence was accordingly a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 3 years.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on the strength of agreed facts. In summary, the four offences on the indictment involved the applicant together with a number of other offenders breaking into licensed premises, usually by smashing or forcing open a door or glass panel. In each case the offenders worked together to remove cigarette machines, automatic teller machines and in one instance a TAB machine. The offences involved the use of stolen vehicles which were subsequently damaged or destroyed. The amount of property stolen was substantial and significant damage was caused.
	
	
	The offences listed on the schedule to the Form 1 were 8 offences of stealing a motor vehicle, 5 offences of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, one offence of destroying property by fire and one offence of intimidation.
	
	
	The same judge sentenced each of the co-offenders.
	
	
	At the proceedings on sentence, the applicant’s representative argued that he should receive a discount of 25% for his pleas of guilty. There had been extensive negotiations in respect of a plea which commenced early during the proceedings in the local court. Following the withdrawal of other “very serious” related charges, the pleas were entered to the 4 counts on the indictment but that did not occur until arraignment in the District Court. The judge took the view that the pleas could not be regarded as having been entered at the earliest opportunity and allowed a discount of about 15%.
	
	
	The applicant represented himself in the appeal. At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, he provided an affidavit of assistance sworn by a very senior member of the NSW Police Force. It is not appropriate to recount the content of the affidavit. It is enough to observe that, since being sentenced, the applicant has provided important and substantial assistance to authorities. Had that occurred before the proceedings on sentence in the District Court, he would undoubtedly have received a substantial discount on that account. At this stage of the sentencing process, the affidavit is not relevant unless the Court comes to re-exercise the sentencing discretion under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The applicant relies on 7 grounds of appeal. Ground 3 to 7 allege specific errors on the part of the sentencing judge. Ground 1 is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Ground 2 complains that the sentencing judge failed to impose sentences that were in parity with those imposed on the applicant’s co-offenders. I am not persuaded that any of those specific alleged errors has been established. In my view, however, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In that circumstance, it is not necessary to deal with the parity ground. My reasons for reaching those conclusions are as follows.
	


Ground 3 – special circumstances


	
	Ground 3 is “the learned sentencing judge erred in making a finding of special circumstances on the basis of partially accumulated sentences but did not give effect to this finding by allowing only a 5% variation to the usual ratio”.
	
	
	The judge said:
	


When considering the issue of totality I am satisfied that partial accumulation is appropriate to properly reflect the criminality involved. In my view that fact of partial accumulation is also sufficient to make a finding of special circumstances and to the various statutory ratio [sic].


	
	It is clear that the words “to the various statutory ratio” should read “to vary the statutory ratio”.
	
	
	The reference to the statutory ratio is a reference to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides:
	


The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the Court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).


	
	The judge’s remarks should probably be understood to explain the adjustment to the statutory ratio in respect of each individual sentence passed rather than to the ratio of the balance of term to the total non-parole period. That would accord with a literal reading of the section and if that was his Honour’s approach it was, with respect, entirely correct.
	
	
	Even if his Honour intended to express an intention to impose a total sentence in which the balance of term was more than one-third of the total non-parole period, that is the result that was achieved (albeit by a small percentage). Application of the statutory ratio produces a non-parole period which is not less than 75% of the total sentence.  In the present case it was 70%. A finding of special circumstances does not create an entitlement to any particular adjustment to the ratio. No error is established by ground 3.
	


Ground 4 - remorse


	
	Ground 4 is:
	


The learned sentencing judge erred in placing no weight on the [applicant’s] remorse, indicated by virtue of pleas of guilty and the material contained in the report of the psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro dated 10 September 2012.


	
	Mr Watson-Munro’s report was exhibit 1 in the proceedings on sentence. The report included the following statement at page 5:
	


At examination Mr [A103] expressed considerable remorse for his actions which I believe to be genuine. I say this advisably on the basis of his improved mood state and judgment now that he has detoxified from crystal methylamphetamines.


	
	The judge made extensive reference to the report in his remarks on sentence, including quoting that part of Mr Watson-Munro’s opinion. The complaint appears to be that, since his Honour made no further reference to remorse, he did not have regard to that evidence, even though he took the trouble to set it out in his remarks on sentence. Although the judge was not obliged to accept the evidence, he appears to have done so. I do not think error is established by ground 4.
	


Ground 5 – role of the applicant


	
	Ground 5 is:
	


The learned sentencing judge erred by determining the [applicant] was a “major player” in these offences, notwithstanding that one of the co-offenders in his evidence indicated to the contrary.


	
	The judge did make a finding that the applicant was “a major player in the joint criminal enterprise with his co-offenders” (ROS, page 7). A finding in those terms was open on the agreed statement of facts. If one of the co-offenders gave evidence to the contrary at some point, that evidence was not given in the applicant’s proceedings on sentence. No error is established by ground 5.
	


Ground 6 - coercion


	
	Ground 6 is:
	


The learned sentencing judge erred by determining the [applicant] “coerced” others to commit the offences.


	
	There is no such finding in the remarks on sentence. This ground appears to be based upon a remark made by the sentencing judge during the proceedings on sentence when considering the issue of parity with one of the co-offenders. The judge said:
	


I think I might have seen a document which indicates that he [the co-offender] as under a degree of pressure and coercion to commit the offences.


	
	Those remarks do not suggest that the judge was satisfied to the requisite standard that the appellant coerced one of the co-offenders, nor is there any suggestion in the remarks on sentence that his Honour sentenced the applicant on that basis.
	
	
	No error is established by ground 6.
	


Ground 7 – periodic detention.


	
	Ground 7 is:
	


The learned sentencing judge erred by stating the [applicant] was on periodic detention at the time of the offences, when he was on an intensive correction order. This was a “significant point of difference” in determining the “level of discount”.


	
	The reference to a significant point of difference in determining the level of discount in that ground is obscure. It appears to have been intended to be an aspect of the parity argument. The applicant received the longest sentence of any of the co-offenders by a considerable margin. The closest sentence was that imposed on the co-offender, Mr H. In sentencing Mr H to a lesser sentence, the judge noted that there was little difference in their respective criminality (Mr H pleaded guilty to identical offences on the indictment and had 13 matters taken into account on a Form 1). The judge said in respect of Mr H:
	


However, a difference is clearly in respect of the level of discount that [Mr H] receives as a result of his early plea, and the other significant point of difference is that [the applicant] had committed the various offences whilst he was subject to serving a sentence of periodic detention.


	
	The true position was that the applicant was subject to an intensive correction order (not periodic detention) at the time of the offences. Accordingly, it appears that ground 7 is intended as an elaboration of the parity ground. It does not otherwise appear to assert specific error other than the factual error in the description of the sentence the applicant was serving at the time of the offences. That error was of little moment.
	
	
	Error is not established by ground 7.
	


Ground 1 – manifest excess


	
	Ground 1 is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	In Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [25], the High Court explained that, if specific error is not shown, the inquiry for this Court is whether the result embodied in the order is unreasonable or plainly unjust. In support of this ground, the applicant relied upon a table of cases drawn from the Public Defender’s sentencing tables. It was submitted that those cases demonstrate a discernible pattern of sentencing for offences of this type involving pleas of guilty and multiple offences. It was further submitted that, considering that pattern, the sentence that ought to have been imposed in the present case would be in the order of “an effective head sentence of about 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years, reflecting a finding of special circumstances”.
	
	
	Without endorsing a submission of such specificity, my consideration of the cases set out in the schedule has led me to conclude that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was well above the usual range. That of course does not establish error in itself.
	
	
	My conclusion that the sentence was unreasonable or unjust has been re-enforced by my reading of all of the remarks on sentence in respect of the co-offenders. I am not here considering the parity ground. But, having read each of the remarks on sentence in the order in which those sentences were passed, I have been left with the strong impression that, for the applicant, almost all of the evaluative judgments and discretionary determinations went against him whereas for his co-offenders many issues were determined more favourably.
	
	
	Having regard to the discount of 15% allowed for the applicant’s pleas of guilty, the starting point for the sentence imposed upon him was 11.1 years with a total non-parole period of 8.3 years. Although these were undoubtedly serious property offences, they were committed at night when the relevant premises were closed and did not involve violence against any person. The starting point was, in my respectful opinion, unduly severe.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am persuaded that the sentencing process miscarried and that it is necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh.
	
	
	The most significant consideration in that task is the affidavit of assistance. Having regard to the content of that affidavit, I consider that the applicant is entitled to a combined discount (together with the discount allowed for the plea) of about 40%.
	
	
	Having regard to the matters recited by the sentencing judge and in the additional evidence before this Court, I would impose an aggregate sentence with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 2 years. I would indicate that the sentences I would have imposed if not imposing an aggregate sentence (before the application of the combined discount) would have been in the order of those stated by the sentencing judge, the difference lying in the degree of accumulation.
	
	
	For those reasons, the orders I propose are:
	



	
	that leave to appeal be granted;
	
	
	that the appeal be allowed;
	
	
	that the sentences passed at first instance be quashed and, in lieu thereof, that the applicant be sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 14 August 2011 and expiring on 13 August 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 13 August 2017.

		10 August 2015",2015-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767422,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 13) [2015] NSWSC 1120,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	Earlier today I was made aware of an article which was published in the “Sunday Telegraph"" newspaper yesterday, Sunday 9 August 2015. At the commencement of the proceedings today I drew the attention of the Crown, and the attention of representatives of each of the accused, to the article. Before dealing with its contents it is appropriate for me to make some preliminary observations.
	
	
	Firstly, in a criminal trial any application or issue which raises a question of law is an application or issue which is dealt with in the absence of the jury. Since April of this year I have been hearing a series of such applications in these proceedings.
	
	
	Secondly, in doing so I have made it clear in open Court, on more than one occasion, that each of those applications is to be regarded as one made in the absence of the jury and that therefore there is to be no publication of the fact of any such application, the evidence adduced in respect of it, and the submissions made by the parties. I have made a specific suppression order in respect of each judgment I have delivered in respect of each application that I have determined.
	
	
	Thirdly, shortly prior to the commencement of the trial on 27 July last month, the Court’s Media Manager forwarded an email to approximately one hundred media outlets. Having noted the (then) scheduled commencement of the trial on 27 July 2015, the email went on to state (inter alia) the following:
	


""Since April of this year his Honour has heard a number of pre-trial applications made by one or other of the parties. As is always the case such applications are dealt with in the absence of the jury. As a consequence, and as his Honour has stated on a number of occasions, media reporting of:

1. the fact of any application;

2. the evidence adduced and submissions made in support of any application; and

3. His Honour's judgment in any application

is prohibited.

This will continue to be the case in relation to any matters heard and determined in the absence of the jury between now and the commencement of the trial. This will also be the case in relation to any application in the course of the trial which is dealt with in the absence of the jury.""


	
	The email proceeded to observe that specific orders had been made suppressing the publication of the various judgements which I had delivered in relation to those applications which had been determined up until that time. It was pointed out that a similar order would be made in relation to each and every judgment arising out of any application made in the absence of the jury at any time in the future. It was also pointed out that once verdicts in the trial had been returned, and subject to hearing any submissions from the parties, it was anticipated that the suppression orders attaching to those judgments would be revoked. It was made clear that at that time, but not at any time beforehand, media outlets would be at liberty to publish the content of any of those judgements. It is noteworthy that the author of the article in question was one of the persons to whom the email from the Media Manager was distributed.
	
	
	I pause to observe that thus far, the only suppression orders that I have made are those which attach to the judgments that I have delivered. However, for the reasons I have already stated, it has been made clear that, as is the case in any criminal trial, applications of the kind that I have been determining over the past several months are applications made in the absence of the jury. In that regard this trial is no different from any other criminal jury trial that is dealt with in this Court, or indeed in the District Court.
	
	
	Against that background, the article to which I previously referred was published yesterday under the heading:
	


""Legal Rows Continue Over Trial of Ex-Cops"".


	
	The author of the article is stated to be Brenden Hills. I do not propose to recite the entirety of the article. For present purposes it is sufficient for me to quote the opening four paragraphs which are in the following terms:
	


""Sydney's most hotly anticipated murder trial featuring former police officers Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara is mired in legal negotiations between the accused men and prosecutors.

The trial is set to go ahead on August 18 in the New South Wales Supreme Court, but there is an issue with part of the background of one of the accused men.

Lawyers for one of the accused want this information to be put to the jury, but this is being resisted by the other man's counsel.

Another matter under discussion is whether the two men should be granted separate trials.""


	
	I make a number of observations in relation to those paragraphs in the article.
	
	
	Firstly, the suggestion that issues are ""mired in legal negotiations between the accused men and prosecutors"" is, of itself, an inapposite description of the proceedings which are taking place. Applications are being made and I am determining them. There is no process of “negotiation” at all.
	
	
	Secondly, the reference to ""part of the background of one of the accused men"" along with the reference to ""lawyers for one of the accused [wanting] this information to be put to the jury"" is a reference to applications I heard last week as to the admissibility of evidence of what is said to be McNamara’s bad character. That is an issue about which I will be delivering judgment tomorrow. It will be self-evident that such applications were made in the absence of the jury. It will be equally self-evident that they are caught not only by the observations that I have made in open Court on more than one occasion, but by the terms of the email that was sent to media outlets some weeks ago to which I previously referred.
	
	
	Thirdly, and in circumstances where they were made in the absence of the jury, the fact that such applications were the subject of publication is bad enough. What is said in the fourth paragraph of the article concerning the issue of separate trials is simply wrong. I have already heard and determined an application, made by each of the accused, for a separate trial. The further reference to the issue of a separate trial was made on the last occasion by counsel for McNamara, who indicated nothing more than the fact that there was a possibility that McNamara’s earlier application for a separate trial would be re-agitated. To state that the issue of separate trials is ""under discussion"" is patently incorrect. Even if this was the case, publication of that fact would be prohibited.
	
	
	Finally, the necessity to ensure that each of the accused in this matter has a fair trial is so obvious that it needs no comment. In my view, the contents of the article have the capacity to jeopardise that right. The contents are such as to come perilously close to constituting a contempt of Court.
	
	
	In the circumstances, and so there can be no doubt about the position, I propose to make a further order which will suppress publication of the fact of:
	



	
	any application which is made in the absence of the jury;
	
	
	the evidence adduced in relation to that application; and
	
	
	the submissions of the parties in relation to that application.
	



	
	That, along with the suppression order that I propose to continue to make in relation to any judgment which I deliver, will hopefully make it clear to those who apparently do not otherwise understand, that there is to be no publication of anything whatsoever which is dealt with in the absence of the jury. As I have said, prohibiting publication of applications made in the absence of the jury in a case such as this is unremarkable. It is the case with any trial. I am at a loss to comprehend why it is thought that the present trial should be any different. What is remarkable is that I should be required to make an order in the terms that I propose. There should be no need to do so. However in order to preserve the rights of both accused to a fair trial, and in order to ensure that there is no further publication of articles detailing proceedings in the absence of the jury, I am left with no other choice.
	
	
	Once the order is made I will direct the court's Media Manager to disseminate it to all media outlets. I will also direct that once this judgment is available, it be forwarded directly to Mr Hills, in the hope that he will take greater care with the content of his articles about the trial from this point onwards. I will also direct that this judgment be forwarded to Mr Hills’ superiors, and to his legal counsel.

		15 June 2016",2015-08-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767426,AGIUS v R [2015] NSWCCA 200,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant, Mr Agius, was an expatriate Australian accountant practicing in Vanuatu at the firm Moore Stephens. He was charged, along with three accountants employed at the Australian firm, Owen T Daniel & Co (OTD), with two counts of conspiracy. First, conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth, contrary to ss 86(1) and 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Second, conspiracy to dishonestly cause a loss or deliberately cause a risk of loss to the Commonwealth, knowing or believing that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of loss occurring, contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The conspiracy alleged was an agreement to defraud the Tax Commissioner of tax revenue by concealing the true taxable incomes of clients of OTD and dishonestly depriving the Commonwealth of, or jeopardising its right to, income tax, or causing a loss or risk of loss of income tax.

The conspiracy was effected by means of a scheme promoted by and/or on behalf of Mr Agius, carried out through the OTD accountants. The evidence at trial revealed that for each of OTD’s clients involved in the scheme, there was a flow of funds out of the client’s business to overseas companies, in respect of which false claims for tax deductions were made. The funds then flowed back to the client’s business and/or its directors as loans, in respect of which false claims for interest were also made on a number of occasions. Further, for three of the clients, sham insurance arrangements were created, in respect of which tax deductions were claimed.

Many of the witnesses at the trial gave evidence that the appellant had explained the scheme to them, had drawn diagrams to illustrate the flow of funds and was present at meetings at which the scheme was discussed. The evidence also demonstrated that the appellant executed a number of documents in connection with the scheme.

On 31 July 2012, a jury convicted Mr Agius and one of the alleged co-conspirators, Mr Zerafa, on both counts of conspiracy. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to 4 years and 5 months imprisonment in respect of the first count, 4 years 6 months imprisonment in respect of the second count and a fixed single non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months.

Mr Agius appealed his conviction and sentence. The main issues on appeal were:

Whether the trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury: to acquit the appellant; that the Crown must prove that the appellant was involved in filing false tax returns; that certain evidence may be unreliable; that two clients may have been involved in another conspiracy; clearly identifying the knowledge, belief or intent said to render the relevant conduct dishonest.

Whether the trial judge erred in directing the jury: on the involvement of the OTD clients who were witnesses; on the co-accused giving evidence; linking Moore Stephens to the scheme and the appellant to Moore Stephens.

Whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by evidence.

Whether the sentencing judge erred in: assessing the objective seriousness of the offence; imposing an unjustifiably disparite sentence on the appellant, compared to Mr Zerafa; imposing a sentence which was manifestly excessive.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, RA Hulme and Bellew JJ agreeing), dismissing the conviction and sentencing appeal:

Whether the trial judge erred by failing to make certain directions to the jury

(i) Section 86(1) of the Crimes Act and s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code are continuing offences. In order to prove the requisite ‘state of affairs’, The Crown only needs to prove that the accused and one other party to the conspiracy participated in an agreement to commit the offences in s 29D Crimes Act or s 135.4(5) Criminal Code, respectively. [962], [964] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

R v LK [2010] HCA 17; 241 CLR 177; Agius v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; 248 CLR 601, applied

(ii) A conspiratorial agreement has three stages which must be distinguished, first, making or formation, second, performance or implementation, third, discharge or termination. In general, the offence is complete at the first stage, when the agreement is made. Under the Criminal Code, the offence is not complete until an overt act is performed. [971] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Saffron v The Queen (1988) 17 NSWLR 395; Director of Public Prosecutions v Doot (1973) AC 807; Agius v The Queen [2013] HCA 27; 248 CLR 601, applied

(iii) The trial judge did not err by failing to direct the jury to acquit the appellant as there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could conclude that the conspiracy as particularised, as distinct from separate conspiracies, was entered into by the appellant and that he participated in the conspiracy during the conspiracy period. [973]-[991] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Saffron v The Queen (1988) 17 NSWLR 395; Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207, considered

(iv) The trial judge did not err by failing to direct the jury that the Crown needed to prove that the appellant was involved in filing false tax returns as the agreement alleged was that the scheme was promoted by the appellant and implemented by the OTD accountants. [997]-[998] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

(v) The purpose of s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act is to ensure that the jury is alerted to facts that may adversely affect the weight to be given to evidence. A warning is required if, without it, the jury may not be aware of a particular fact which affected the reliability of evidence. [1023] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; 151 A Crim R 166, applied

(vi) The trial judge’s directions on unreliability were not erroneous as they were adequate to deal with the matters in s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act and it was open to her Honour to conclude that it was not necessary to indicate that certain evidence was unreliable. [1022]-[1023] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Brown v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 69, distinguished

(vii) The trial judge did not err in failing to direct the jury that two clients may have been part of a previous tax minimisation scheme as there was no evidence on this. [1045] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

(viii) The trial judge’s directions on the requisite dishonest belief of the appellant were not erroneous as her Honour identified the requisite belief rendering the agreement dishonest and encapsulated the facts on which the jury had to decide if the appellant had this belief, namely, that OTD’s clients were making claims for deductions not incurred. [1060] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Peters v The Queen [1998] HCA 7; 192 CLR 493; Macleod v The Queen [2003] HCA 24; 214 CLR 230, considered

Whether the trial judge erred by making certain directions to the jury

(i) The trial judge did not err in directing the jury on the involvement of the directors as the directors had admitted involvement in the fraud and the direction was necessary to ensure that the jury was aware that their evidence should be treated with caution. [1027] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

(ii) The trial judge did not err in directing the jury regarding the evidence of the co-accused as this direction did not compliment them for giving evidence or suggest that the appellant’s failure to give evidence was because he believed he was guilty of the offence charged. [1035] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25; 205 CLR 50, considered

(iii) The trial judge’s direction referring to Moore Stephens was not unnecessary or prejudicial as there was a large body of evidence linking Moore Stephens to the scheme and indicating that the appellant was a partner of Moore Stephens and that a significant part of the scheme’s operation was carried out through employees of Moore Stephens. [1066]-[1068] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by evidence

(i) In determining whether a verdict should be set aside as unreasonable, the Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence. If, after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt and the benefit of the jury of having seen and heard witnesses, the Court is left in doubt as to the verdict’s reasonableness, this doubt, in most cases, is a doubt the jury should have experienced. For a verdict to be unreasonable, it is not enough that a review of the evidence only shows that it was possible for the jury to have reached a different outcome, the jury must have had a reasonable doubt. [1000]-[1001] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559, applied

(ii) The verdict was not unreasonable as the evidence disclosed an extremely strong case against the appellant. The agreement the subject of the conspiracy could be inferred from the appellant’s promotion of the scheme, the steps carried out by him to establish the overseas structure and his participation during the course of the scheme. [1002]-[1010] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

The sentencing appeal

(i) A sentencing judge does not have to sentence on the basis of a view of the facts most favourable to the offender. This is subject to the constraints that the findings are not inconsistent with the jury’s verdict and must be made beyond reasonable doubt. [1100] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; 209 CLR 1; R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, applied

(ii) The sentencing judge did not err in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence as it was open to find that the appellant’s offence was close to the worst type of offence of this nature. [1104] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

(iii) The court will interfere with a sentence on the ground of disparity between the sentence imposed on an accused and a co-accused when it considers that the disparity gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, assessed by objective criteria. The court should not intervene when the disparity is justified by a difference between co-offenders’ criminal history, general character and the part each played in the criminal conduct. [1120] (Bathurst CJ); [1144] (RA Hulme J); [1145] (Bellew J)

(iv) The difference in sentences imposed on the appellant and Mr Zerafa did not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance as the appellants offending was in the worst class of its kind, unlike Mr Zerafa’s, and he played a far more significant role in promoting and implementing the scheme.

(v) The sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive as the offence: had continued over at least eight years, providing a mechanism by which eight companies were able to defraud the revenue of significant amounts of tax; was of a serious nature and of a type that had a corrosive effect on society; was in the worst class of its kind; and there was a need for punishment and general deterrence.

(vi) Sentences imposed in other cases can and should provide a yardstick for sentencing judges against which to measure a proposed sentence. However, care must be taken in having regard to these cases and the history of the range of sentences does not establish the correct range or the upper and lower limits of the range.

Judgment

BATHURST CJ: 

INTRODUCTION


	
	The appellant, Robert Francis Agius (Mr Agius) and three others, Carol Abibadra (Ms Abibadra), Deborah Judith Jandagi (Ms Jandagi) and Kevin Zerafa (Mr Zerafa) were charged on indictment presented on 27 February 2012 with two counts of conspiracy.
	
	
	The first count was that between about 1 January 1997 and about 23 May 2001, they conspired with each other and with Owen Trevor Daniel (Mr Daniel) to defraud the Commonwealth, contrary to s 86(1) and s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	The second count was that between about 24 May 2001 and about 23 October 2006, they conspired with each other and with Mr Daniel to dishonestly cause a loss or deliberately cause a risk of loss to a third person, namely, the Commonwealth, knowing or believing that the loss would occur or that there was a substantial risk of loss occurring, contrary to s 135.4(5) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).
	
	
	Following a five month trial, on 31 July 2012, Mr Agius and one of the alleged co-conspirators, Mr Zerafa, were convicted on both counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in respect of the other two co-accused.
	
	
	On the first count, Mr Agius was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 5 months, commencing on 31 July 2012 and expiring on 30 December 2016. On the second count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, commencing on 31 December 2016 and expiring on 30 June 2021. The sentencing judge fixed a single non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months, expiring on 30 March 2019.
	


Particulars of the alleged conspiracy


	
	Because of the nature of the matters raised in the appeal, it is necessary to set out in some detail the particulars of the conspiracy and the overt acts alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	The particulars supplied by the Crown extended for some 850 pages. However, the principal allegations as they appear from that document can be summarised as set out below.
	
	
	The conspiracy alleged was an agreement made between about 1 January 1997 and about 10 April 2008 to defraud the Federal Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) of tax revenue by dishonestly concealing the true taxable incomes of corporate and individual clients of Owen T Daniel & Co Burwood (OTD) by a scheme promoted by and/or on behalf of Mr Agius (the scheme) through Mr Daniel, who died on 7 February 2006, Mr Zerafa, Ms Jandagi and Ms Abibadra. The alleged co-conspirators with Mr Agius all worked with Mr Daniel at OTD. For convenience, they are referred to as the OTD accountants.
	
	
	It was alleged that Mr Agius and the OTD accountants agreed to defraud the Commonwealth by agreeing to dishonestly deprive the Commonwealth of, or to jeopardise the Commonwealth’s entitlement to, income tax, or dishonestly cause a loss or risk of loss to the Commonwealth of income tax. The means by which the agreement was alleged to be effected was by Mr Daniel and/or Mr Zerafa and/or Ms Jandagi and/or Ms Abibadra concealing from, and failing to declare to, the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO), the true taxable incomes of corporate and individual clients of OTD by implementing a scheme promoted by and/or on behalf of Mr Agius.
	
	
	It will be noted from these particulars that it was not alleged that Mr Agius participated in the actual implementation of the fraud. Rather, it was alleged that the OTD accountants implemented the scheme which was promoted by him.
	
	
	The effect of the scheme was particularised as, first, falsely inflating the expenses of the companies, thus reducing their taxable income. It was also alleged that the scheme had the effect of disguising income coming into Australia as loans, thus depriving the Commissioner of income tax payable on this dividend income, or exposing the Commissioner to the risk of that deprivation.
	
	
	Mr Agius was described in the particulars as an expatriate Australian accountant practising in Vanuatu in the firm Moore Stephens, which later changed its name to PKF Vanuatu, Chartered Accountants & Business Advisers (PKF Vanuatu).
	
	
	The agreement was alleged to have been formed in Sydney some time between 1 January 1997 and 1 May 1997. It was alleged that the original parties to the agreement were at least Mr Agius and Mr Daniel. It was alleged that the other co-conspirators joined the conspiracy at times between 1997 and 2000.
	
	
	It was alleged that the corporate and individual clients of OTD which utilised the scheme during the course of the conspiracy were: Anscott Pty Ltd (Anscott) and its officers, Barbara Ruth Leimroth (Ms Leimroth) and Horst Reinhard Leimroth (Mr Leimroth); Australian Safety Specialists Pty Ltd (ASS) and its officers, Phillip Waller (P Waller) and David Waller (D Waller); Bemawell Pty Ltd (Bemawell) and its officer James Gerard O’Rourke (Mr O’Rourke); Different Solutions Pty Ltd (Different) and its officer, Clarissa Elizabeth Mattingly; Gladesville Bridge Marina Pty Ltd (GBM) and its officers, Phillip Barry Southcombe (Mr Southcombe) and Eva Maria Southcombe (Ms Southcombe); Hunter Civil & Hire Pty Ltd (HCH), Daley Labour Pty Ltd (Daley Labour) and Hydro-Magda Pty Ltd (Hydro-Magda) and their officers, Geoffrey Clive Daley (Mr Daley), David Allan Pritchard (Mr Pritchard) and Mark Patrick Bennett (Mr Bennett); Jiess Building & Carpentry Services Pty Ltd (Jiess) and its officer Glyn Morgan Jones (Mr Jones); Kylood Pty Ltd (Kylood) and Hilisa Pty Ltd (Hilisa) and their officer, Anthony Joseph Luis Hilli (Mr Hilli); Pacific Computing & Innovation Pty Ltd (Pacific Computing) and its officer, Stephen Victor Hawkins; PHY Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd (PHY) and its officers, Paul Boutros Mereb and Youssef Saadallah Mereb; Outboard World Pty Ltd (Outboard World) and its officer, Michael Joseph Calleija; and Tara Consulting Pty Ltd (Tara) and its officer, Margaret ‘Collette’ McKenna (Ms McKenna). These companies are collectively referred to as the Australian companies. As the trial developed, evidence was not led of the utilisation of the scheme by Different, Pacific Computing, PHY and Outboard World or their respective officers.
	
	
	The scheme was particularised as being implemented by a number of steps. As it will be necessary to deal with the factual allegations in some detail later in this judgment, it is only necessary to provide a broad outline of these steps.
	



	
	Step 1 – Monies that the Australian companies utilised for the scheme were transferred by or on behalf of those companies to one of a number of New Zealand bank accounts controlled by Mr Agius which had been set up in the names of different corporate entities. All of the bank accounts were with the Auckland branch of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ Bank).
	
	
	Step 2 – In most instances, within a short period of time, Mr Agius, through PKF Vanuatu, transferred, or caused to be transferred, the monies received into one of the New Zealand accounts, less amounts retained by Mr Agius as fees and commissions, to another of the New Zealand accounts.
	
	
	Step 3 – In most instances, within a short period of time, Mr Agius, through PKF Vanuatu, transferred, or caused to be transferred, the amounts of money referred to in Step 2 into the bank accounts of certain of the Australian companies, their officers, or in one instance, to the officers of an Australian company by cash payments.
	
	
	Step 4 – The officers of the Australian companies then either retained the money in their personal bank accounts or transferred the money to the bank accounts of the Australian company, purportedly as a repayment of a shareholders loan.
	



	
	It was alleged that the scheme involved the creation of nominee companies in Vanuatu on behalf of each of the Australian companies, with names that were deliberately different from the Australian companies, in order to assist PKF Vanuatu to conceal their accounting for the monies transferred in Steps 1-3. It was also alleged that in order to falsely substantiate the appearance of payments made during the ordinary course of business, with respect to the monies transferred in Step 1, documents were created by or on behalf of Mr Agius, through PKF Vanuatu, to pretend that such transfers were for services such as management and consultancy fees, insurance premiums or loan interest, including invoices for the cost of such services. It was also alleged to have involved the creation of false loan documentation in order to pretend that monies coming back to Australia from New Zealand were loans from foreign lenders. Such loan monies were not assessable income.
	
	
	Finally, the scheme was said to have involved the preparation and lodgement of false tax returns. As I have indicated, it was not alleged that Mr Agius participated in this particular overt act.
	


The case presented at trial


	
	It is convenient to deal separately with the case presented at trial in respect of each company said to have utilised the scheme and their respective officers. In respect of each such company, a statement of facts was agreed upon and the officers gave evidence.
	


1   ASS

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	The involvement of ASS in the scheme covered the period from the 1998 financial year to the 2005 financial year.
	
	
	In the 1998 financial year, ASS transferred amounts of AUD $40,025 and $20,025 to an account with ANZ Bank in Auckland, held in the name of Billbury Pty Ltd (the Billbury account). Of the first amount, $32,000 was transferred from the Billbury account into an ANZ Bank account in the name of Uniton Pty Ltd (the Uniton account), of which $31,961.66 was transferred to ASS. The whole of the latter amount was transferred from the Billbury account to the Uniton account and $19,961.81 was transferred back to ASS.
	
	
	No tax deductions relevant to the proceedings were claimed in that year. However, accrued expenses of $150,000, recorded in the unaudited accounts as costs of goods sold, was said to relate to Billbury expenses. The transfers from Uniton to ASS were recorded in the unaudited accounts as “Uniton Ltd (Loan)”.
	
	
	The transactions in the 1999 financial year followed a similar pattern. Money was transferred by ASS to Billbury by six transactions, the whole or a greater part of the funds the subject of each transfer was transferred from the Billbury account to the Uniton account and the bulk of the funds were then transferred back to ASS. Of the money transferred to Billbury, $400,150 was recorded as management and consulting fees. The accounts also recorded the payments from Uniton to ASS as loans from Uniton to ASS and recorded $14,660 as an interest expense, of which $14,200 was said to relate to Uniton. The amounts of $400,150 and $14,660 were claimed as deductible expenses in the 1999 ASS tax return.
	
	
	The transactions in the 2000 financial year were a little more complex. As was previously the case, a series of transactions took place by which monies in Australian dollars were transferred from ASS to the Billbury account. These funds appear to have been paid into the Uniton account and, after some relatively small deductions, transferred to ASS. In addition, one transfer of $12,805 was made by ASS directly into the Uniton account. In addition to these transactions, three transfers in United States dollars were made. Of these transfers, one was made into the Uniton account and one was made into the Billbury account. The third was made into an account of a Vanuatu company, International Finance Trust Company Ltd (IFTC), with the ANZ Bank in Vanuatu (the IFTC Vanuatu account). These payments did not flow back to ASS in the year in question.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for the 2000 financial year, $500,000 of the $504,504 “Management and Consulting” fees was said to relate to the claimed Billbury expenses. This amount, along with $57,994, said to be “Interest expenses” in respect of the Uniton loan, was claimed as a deduction in the 2000 tax return.
	
	
	The transactions for the 2001 financial year followed a slightly different pattern. As in the previous years, ASS transferred funds in Australia dollars into the Billbury account. In addition, one transfer of $52,194.24 was made by ASS directly into the Uniton account.
	
	
	As in the previous years, the monies paid into the Billbury account were paid, with some small deductions, into the Uniton account. The bulk of these funds were paid to ASS. However, in respect of one transaction, $204,885 was paid into an account operated by P Waller and D Waller (collectively, the Wallers) with the National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) in Sydney (the Waller account). This money was subsequently transferred by them to ASS.
	
	
	In addition, ASS made three transfers in United States dollars. Two were to the Billbury account and one was to an account held by IFTC with the ANZ Bank in Auckland (the IFTC account). The money the subject of these transactions did not flow back to ASS or the Wallers in the 2001 financial year.
	
	
	A figure of $550,000 was included in the prepared profit and loss statement for ASS as management and consulting fees. In the unaudited accounts, they were recorded as relating to Billbury. A further $150,000 was recorded in the unaudited accounts as “May & June Management Fees” which had been accrued but not paid for. The profit and loss statement ultimately included in the unaudited accounts showed $700,000 as management and consulting fees relating to Billbury and interest expenses of $122,127 relating to Uniton. These amounts were claimed as deductions in the 2001 tax return.
	
	
	The flow of funds in the 2002 financial year was similar to that which occurred in the 2001 financial year. ASS, by a series of transactions, transferred money into the Billbury account. After some small deductions, the funds were transferred out of that account into the Uniton account. In respect of two of these transactions, the funds were transferred to ASS, after a further small deduction. In respect of the other transfers into the Uniton account, the funds were transferred to the Waller account.
	
	
	In addition, an amount of $109,939.99 was transferred directly by ASS into the Uniton account. This amount was paid back to ASS with another transaction, subject to small deductions.
	
	
	Following receipt of the funds by the Wallers, they paid them to ASS, subject to rounding adjustments.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for the 2002 financial year, amounts totalling $706,520 were recorded under management and consulting fees. Of this amount, $360,605 was recorded against the description “Billbury” as professional fees/marketing, $109,914.99 was originally described as loan interest but was subsequently recorded as management fees, whilst $236,000 was recorded as product insurance. These amounts recorded as management fees formed part of a total of $715,073 described as management fees which were claimed as tax deductions in this financial year.
	
	
	In addition, an amount of $192,400 was claimed as a deduction as interest related to Uniton.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, ASS, in a series of Australian dollar transactions, caused money to be deposited into the Billbury account. After small deductions, these funds were paid into the Uniton account. One of the deductions, an amount of $5,308.82, was paid into the IFTC account. ASS also made one direct transfer of funds, totalling $173,220.62, to the Uniton account.
	
	
	After deductions, the amounts which were transferred to the Uniton account were transferred to the Waller account. One of the deductions, an amount of $18,400, was paid into the IFTC account. After minor adjustments, the funds transferred to the Waller account were transferred to ASS.
	
	
	In addition, ASS, by three United States dollar transactions and one Australian dollar transaction, transferred funds into the IFTC account. None of the monies transferred into that account flowed to ASS in the 2003 financial year.
	
	
	In this financial year, payments from ASS to Billbury totalling $300,000 were recorded as management and consulting fees. The sum of $265,327 was recorded as an accrued interest expense. The agreed statement of facts stated that this expense related to Uniton.
	
	
	The amounts of $300,000, $265,327 and $94,515 (the latter amount recorded as an accrued insurance expense) were claimed as tax deductions for the 2003 financial year.
	
	
	The flow of funds for the 2004 financial year followed a similar pattern to previous years, but was more complex. By four separate Australian dollar transactions, ASS transferred funds into the Billbury account. The funds from two of these transactions, subject to small deductions, were paid into the Uniton account. These funds, subject to some further small deductions, one of which was paid into the IFTC account (an amount of $341.47), were paid into the Waller account. Although it is not clear how much, it appears that at least part of these amounts was transferred back to ASS.
	
	
	The other two transactions by which funds were transferred to the Billbury account each involved an amount of $50,000. These amounts, subject to small deductions, were transferred to an account with the ANZ Bank in the name of Edgecumbe Finance Ltd (Edgecumbe Finance), a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland (the Edgecumbe account). This money was subsequently paid into the Waller account. It appears that one of these transactions was transferred back to ASS, however, it is not clear whether the other transaction was.
	
	
	In addition to the monies transferred to Billbury, three Australian dollar transfers of $238,794.17, $86,000 and $60,030 were made by ASS into the Uniton account. These amounts, subject to deductions amounting to $32,581, $341.47 of which was transferred to the IFTC account, were paid into the Waller account.
	
	
	Finally, an amount of $94,515 was transferred by ASS into an account with the ANZ Bank in the name of Lime Street Commercial & General Insurance Ltd (Lime Street) (the Lime account). This amount, subject to a deduction of $2,938.50, was transferred to Uniton and subsequently, subject to a small deduction, to the Waller account. It is not clear if it was transferred back to ASS.
	
	
	Of the total funds paid into the Waller account, $742,961, the majority, $427,464, was transferred back to the ASS account. In addition, $30,000 was transferred from the Waller account into a NAB account operated by Worldwide Sales and Imports (Worldwide account). It was noted in the agreed statement of facts that this was an account operated by the Wallers.
	
	
	In the prepared accounts for that year, $295,454.55 was recorded under the marketing ledger as Billbury expenses on a cash basis. This amount was claimed as a deduction in the 2004 financial year.
	
	
	An amount of $298,732.30, made up of $297,009.73 (Uniton interest less withholding tax) and $1,722.57 (Edgecumbe Finance interest less withholding tax), was claimed in the tax return as interest expenses.
	
	
	The sum of $94,515 was recorded in the accounts as insurance expenses to Lime Street.
	
	
	No relevant tax deductions were claimed in the 2005 financial year, although the flow of funds showed a similar pattern.
	
	
	ASS made four Australian dollar transfers in that year. The first, an amount of $100,000, was paid into the Billbury account. These funds, subject to a small deduction, were transferred into the Uniton account. From this account, subject to small deductions, they were transferred to the Waller account and ultimately $85,000 was repaid to ASS.
	
	
	The second transfer of $100,000 was paid into the Lime account. Of that amount, $96,909.06 was transferred into the Uniton account. Subsequently, $10,000 was paid back into the Lime account. The balance, subject to a small deduction, was transferred to the Waller account.
	
	
	The third transfer of $297,009.73 was paid directly into the Uniton account. It was subsequently transferred in two tranches to the Waller account and thereafter, it was paid back to ASS in two tranches, with a deduction of $100,000.
	
	
	The fourth transfer of $1,722.57 was paid into the Edgecumbe account. It was not transferred out of that account in the 2005 financial year.
	
	
	In addition, three transfers were made out of the Worldwide account. The first of $150,000 was to the Billbury account. Subject to some small deductions, these funds were transferred to the Uniton account. Subsequently, the funds were transferred to the Waller account and then to ASS.
	
	
	The second transfer of $249,500 was transferred into the Lime account. These funds, after deduction of $7,575.98, were transferred to an account held by Uniton with the Bank of New Zealand (the Uniton BNZ account). Subject to some deductions, these funds were then transferred to the Waller account and subsequently back to ASS.
	
	
	The third transfer of $103,000 was made to Lime Street. Of this amount, $90,000 was transferred to the Uniton account and, after a small deduction, to the Waller account.
	
	
	There were also two further transfers made from the Uniton account to the IFTC account, one of $4,000 and one of $29,700. None of the monies transferred into the IFTC account flowed back to ASS in the 2005 financial year.
	


b The evidence of Mr Phillip Waller


	
	P Waller gave evidence that he first met Mr Daniel in January or February 1998. He said that after that meeting, he and D Waller decided to appoint OTD as their accountants. He stated that he remembered Mr Daniel saying at that meeting that he could help minimise their tax.
	
	
	P Waller gave evidence that he recalled that some time after that meeting, perhaps a couple of weeks later, Mr Daniel contacted him and D Waller and said that he would like to introduce them to a Mr Agius from a company in Vanuatu who could help with their tax. P Waller said that he met Mr Agius with Mr Daniel within a month or two thereafter, before 30 June 1998. He said that at the meeting, Mr Agius explained how his company, Moore Stephens, in Vanuatu, could help them. He said that Mr Agius explained that Moore Stephens was an international financing company/accounting company and explained how he could help them in other areas such as in Hong Kong, where ASS did a lot of dealings in purchasing products. P Waller gave evidence that Mr Agius told them how ASS and the Wallers could benefit by using a couple of companies that he had set up, one of them being Billbury. He stated that Mr Agius explained how ASS could get a false invoice sent from Billbury in England. He said that Mr Agius told the Wallers that after the money had been sent around the world, a company called Uniton would set up a loan and that that company would lend to the Wallers personally, so that there would be a cash flow for their business. P Waller described this as “basically we were getting a false invoice, paying it and then drawing down a false loan.” He said that Mr Agius told them that they would have more documents than necessary to cover any audits or any questions that the taxman would ask them.
	
	
	P Waller said that as a result, he and D Waller signed documents for a $1 million loan with Uniton. He said that Mr Agius and Mr Daniel explained that the loan would not be paid back, but interest would be paid on the loan yearly. He said that this in fact occurred.
	
	
	P Waller said that he recalled receiving an interest bill from Uniton in the sum of $200,000. He said that he and Ms Abibadra, an OTD accountant with whom he worked, worked out that this was part of the scheme for reducing profits, as by sending off the extra few bills, the loan was being legitimised. P Waller was also shown Uniton invoices of $173,195.62 for interest in the 2002 financial year and $297,009.73 for interest in the 2004 financial year. He said that the position with these invoices was the same as the earlier invoices.
	
	
	P Waller said that during the course of the meeting with Mr Agius, Mr Agius drew a round circle highlighting what would occur. He said that the diagram basically showed the profits from ASS, with an arrow going up to Billbury, then an arrow down to Uniton and then an arrow back to the Waller account. P Waller drew a diagram which reflected his recollection of the document.
	
	
	That diagram showed ASS profit flowing to the ANZ Bank in New Zealand as a result of a Billbury invoice, then flowing to Uniton and subsequently back into the Waller account. P Waller said that originally, he and Ms Abibadra would work out what the profits were for the business for the month and then would transfer that information to a Ms Kelly Fawcett (Ms Fawcett), who worked for Moore Stephens in Vanuatu. P Waller said that Mr Agius mentioned in the original meeting that Ms Fawcett would be the contact in Vanuatu and that she was the contact that they had in fact predominantly used over the years. He described that the system was that if, for example, there was a $40,000 payment that ASS was going to pay to Billbury, that $40,000 would be drawn down on Uniton through Ms Fawcett within four to five days. He said that Ms Fawcett would then send the money back through another account in New Zealand into their personal account in Australia.
	
	
	P Waller said that he recalled that there was a start up fee of $8,000 to cover all of the paperwork. He recalled Mr Daniel and Mr Agius saying, “there will be plenty of paperwork. You will be well covered. It’s well worth the $8,000”.
	
	
	P Waller gave evidence that he asked what should be done if the tax office did an audit. He said that Mr Agius responded, “There won’t be a problem, you’ll have plenty of paperwork and they’d only be fishing if it did come in.” P Waller gave evidence that at one stage, Mr Agius told him and D Waller that he (Mr Agius) had a number of clients in Australia participating in the same scheme and that the scheme had been successful for many years.
	
	
	P Waller said that subsequently, he called Mr Daniel and said that he was happy to go ahead and for him (Mr Daniel) to start the paperwork.
	
	
	P Waller gave evidence that ASS dealt with IFTC on a number of occasions. He was referring to a document on the letterhead of that company dated 10 June 1998, relating to a remittance of $40,000 into the Billbury account on 8 June. The document directed the ANZ Bank to transmit $8,000 into the IFTC account. P Waller gave evidence that the $40,000 came from ASS and the $8,000 was a bill for setting up the paperwork. He said that he did not have anything to do with Ms Fiona McConachie (Ms McConachie), who signed the document. It should be noted that the document was also signed by Mr Agius.
	
	
	P Waller gave evidence that in about April 2004, he had a meeting with Mr Agius in ASS’s office in Seven Hills. He said that Mr Agius came in to discuss the loan with Uniton, which had reached its peak of $3 million, and that it was necessary to find another avenue for reducing overseas tax.
	
	
	P Waller gave evidence that the $3 million borrowed was part of the scheme whereby a fictitious loan had been set up which was just a way of getting the money back to the Wallers as a loan, so the interest payments on the loan were also tax deductions. He said that ASS never got any part of the $1 million or $3 million into its own hands from any overseas lender.
	
	
	P Waller said that at the meeting, Mr Agius said that he had agreed to purchase an insurance company called Lime Street Insurance. He said that Mr Agius told him that the idea “was to look at ways of insuring something that you would not normally insure with a normal insurance company”. He said that at the time of that meeting, Mr Agius had not secured Lime Street but, some time later, he came back and said, “We’ve now secured Lime Street and we can go ahead”, and documentation came over and monies were paid to Billbury.
	
	
	P Waller said that as far as he was concerned, Lime Street was Mr Agius. He said that after he got the insurance documentation, he fairly quickly paid the initial amount for the insurance, $300,000. He said that he could not recall whether anything was done to get the bulk of the $300,000 back into the Waller account.
	
	
	P Waller said that he first heard the name Edgecumbe Finance when he received two inward payments from that company into the Waller account. He said that Ms Abibadra told him that she contacted Vanuatu and spoke to Moore Stephens and was told that there was a mistake and the money that was previously sent to pay a Billbury bill should have come back as a Uniton credit but came back as an Edgecumbe Finance credit instead. He said that she said that the only way to fix this was to arrange the documentation for $150,000 to cover a new loan.
	
	
	P Waller was shown an invoice from Edgecumbe Finance, dated 30 June 2004, to the Wallers, claiming a net amount of interest of $1,722.57. When asked whether he had any recollection of Edgecumbe Finance, he stated that that was the company that the Wallers had received incorrect loan documents for and new documents were drawn up under Edgecumbe Finance. He stated that the Wallers never received a loan from Edgecumbe Finance and did not owe Edgecumbe Finance any interest on any loans. He was also shown an Edgecumbe Finance letter dated 9 February 2004, purporting to be a loan facility agreement, together with a guarantee and indemnity. He said that he did not think there was any real purpose for the document.
	
	
	P Waller was shown a Billbury invoice dated 27 January 1998, recording a fee for professional marketing and consulting services. He said that Billbury did not provide any of the services set out in the invoice and that it was never intended that they be provided.
	
	
	P Waller said that most of the money paid to Billbury came back into the Waller account.
	
	
	P Waller was also shown two invoices dated 17 August 1999 and 25 August 1999, both relating to work done for a company, Lincoln Investments Ltd. The first was from Moore Stephens and the second from IFTC. The second was signed by Mr Agius. He stated that on receipt of these invoices, he rang Ms Abibadra and asked what Lincoln Investments was all about. He said that she informed him that she did not have a clue and told him just to pay the bills.
	
	
	P Waller was shown the profit and loss statement for ASS as at 30 June 1999. He referred to the management and consulting fees shown as an expense in that profit and loss statement and said that 99% of those expenses were not genuine business expenses, something he knew at the time. He stated that he knew that ASS’s tax return for the 1999 financial year contained false claims for deductions and false descriptions of non-existent expenses.
	
	
	P Waller was asked about the loan draw downs and interest payments made to Uniton. He stated that this had nothing to do with the Billbury accounts, rather, it was a second bite of the cherry, namely, interest payments. He was referred to an invoice from Uniton dated 30 June 2001, saying that there was an amount of $109,914.99 interest payable. He said that ASS was not indebted to Uniton for that amount. In relation to his own tax returns for that period, he stated that there were certain things in it, such as Billbury and personal loans that were not truthful. He said that Ms Abibadra was responsible for the preparation of his personal tax returns.
	
	
	P Waller was shown a further invoice for $50,000 from Billbury for carrying out a marketing survey in China. He said that it was not genuine. He was also shown another invoice from Billbury for $25,000 relating to the performance of the marketing survey in China with additional matters relating to high visibility personal protective safety clothing. He said that Billbury did not provide any services of that nature to ASS.
	
	
	P Waller said that in the latter part of 2001, he went to Vanuatu for a holiday, as Mr Daniel told him that it would be a good idea to make the arrangements look legitimate.
	
	
	P Waller was referred to a letter addressed to him dated 1 July 2003 from Lime Street, relating to a recent application for Key Man Insurance and enclosing a certificate of cover. The letter was signed by Mr Agius. Attached to the letter was a certificate of cover. P Waller identified the signature witnessing the affixing of the common seal of Lime Street as that of Mr Agius.
	
	
	P Waller said that the bulk of the money paid as insurance premiums came back to the Waller account. He said that to his recollection, it all came back, except for maybe a $25 bank charge. P Waller was also shown the policy and again identified the signature of the witness to the affixing of the common seal as being that of Mr Agius.
	
	
	P Waller was also asked about an interview he had with the ATO in April 2005. He said that in September 2004, Mr Daniel indicated that the ATO was requesting certain documents regarding Billbury and Uniton. He said that the night before the audit meeting with the ATO, he had what he described as a role play or a run through with D Waller, Mr Daniel, Ms Abibadra and Mr Zerafa, to go through questions that the ATO could possibly ask. He said that either Mr Daniel or Mr Zerafa would ask questions such as, “Where did you first meet Robert Agius?”. He said that he was told that the last thing he was supposed to say was “In Owen T Daniel’s office”. He said that it was ultimately decided that he would be better off just mentioning that he met Mr Agius in his old employer’s office and that he knocked on the door peddling his wares and offering offshore tax advice.
	
	
	P Waller said that he had a contact, a Mr Dennis Turner (Mr Turner), who worked in London in the same business as ASS and had spent many years building up distributor clients from China and around the world. He said that at the meeting, it was decided that Mr Turner was a good person to use as a deflector to the ATO, to say that ASS had a contact in England by the name of Mr Turner who was employed by Billbury. He said that the participants at the pre-audit meeting built a story around this. In cross-examination, Mr Zerafa denied that he attended this meeting.
	
	
	P Waller confirmed that Mr Turner had nothing to do with Billbury.
	
	
	P Waller said that at the subsequent meeting with the ATO on 12 April 2005, the lead auditor told him that there was no such company as Billbury. As a result, he walked out of the meeting and telephoned Mr Agius in Vanuatu and Mr Agius said, “Get to the fax machine now, I’ll send you the registration paperwork Billbury”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, P Waller accepted that the first meeting with Mr Daniel may have been on 17 March 1998, not January or February. He accepted, after being referred to his diary notes, that the meeting at which he was introduced to Mr Agius may have taken place on 27 March 1998 and that Mr Daniel contacted him to arrange for that meeting.
	
	
	He repeated his evidence that it was explained to him that Mr Agius worked with an international accounting firm, Moore Stephens, and that Mr Agius explained that the proposed arrangements involved offshore transactions and that he would provide the necessary documents to satisfy the ATO.
	
	
	So far as Ms Fawcett was concerned, P Waller acknowledged that his original evidence was incorrect and that it was around 2000 or 2001 when he started to contact her.
	
	
	In cross-examination by counsel for Ms Abibadra, P Waller acknowledged that the first interest bill received from Uniton was in the sum of $202, the second in the sum of $14,200, the third in the sum of $52,194, the fourth in the sum of $109,914 and the fifth, for the financial year ending June 2002, in the sum of $173,195. He accepted that his evidence in chief regarding an interest bill of $200,000 may have related to his first request for a drawdown from the Uniton loan on 12 April 2002 and that he may have been referring to the interest invoice from Uniton for the financial year ending June 2003 in the sum of $238,794.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, P Waller stated that when he first met Mr Daniel, he (Mr Daniel) said that he could help him minimise tax. P Waller acknowledged that at that stage, there was no suggestion that the tax minimisation might become part of an illegal scheme.
	
	
	P Waller acknowledged that it was intended that money would be sent offshore in exchange for, or in response to, an invoice from Billbury and that the amount to be sent offshore would match the amount claimed. He said that that happened every time money was sent offshore and that he did not send money to Billbury when there was no invoice.
	
	
	In cross-examination, P Waller was shown four invoices from Billbury which predated any conversation between him and Mr Agius. He said that the invoices themselves were back dated and denied that it was a baseless allegation that Mr Aguis was involved in the scheme to set up false invoices.
	
	
	P Waller acknowledged that he concurred in taking out the Lime Street insurance policies without inquiring whether cheaper policies could be taken out elsewhere. He stated, in that context, that “We were not paying for the insurance we said we were paying for”.
	
	
	In relation to the 1998 financial year, P Waller acknowledged that ASS sent about $60,000 to Billbury. It was pointed out to him in cross-examination that there were invoices in that year totalling $150,000. He agreed that this was inconsistent with his evidence that in respect of each payment, there was a corresponding invoice. P Waller stated that he could only assume that the invoices were backdated.
	
	
	P Waller agreed that in that year, $150,000 was claimed as an accrued expense. He said that he could not explain why there were only invoices to the value of $60,000. He stated that he did not authorise Mr Daniel or anyone in his employ to send any internal accounting documents to Vanuatu.
	
	
	In that context, it was suggested to P Waller that the invoices did not come from overseas but were in fact created by OTD. P Waller said that he could not answer that question.
	
	
	P Waller was asked similar questions concerning the 2001 financial year. It was pointed out to him that there was $550,000 paid to Billbury and invoices totalling $700,000. He said that he could not explain how that happened and that he also could not explain why there were no invoices which matched the transfers to Billbury in that year. It was suggested to him that the likely explanation was that the invoices were created by Mr Daniel. P Waller stated that he did not believe that to be the case.
	
	
	P Waller was cross-examined in a similar fashion in relation to the 2004 financial year and again acknowledged that he could not identify any invoices which matched the transfers to Billbury in that year.
	
	
	In relation to the 2005 financial year, P Waller acknowledged that there was no invoice to support the payment of $150,000 from the Worldwide account to Billbury in that year. It was again put to him that the likelihood was that the invoices were created by OTD when the ATO started to investigate. He stated again that he did not know who made the invoices and assumed that the invoices were coming from Vanuatu.
	
	
	P Waller was also cross-examined about research and development claims made by ASS. He said that it was possible that he told the tax auditor that research by Billbury formed part of the claim for research and development. He acknowledged that the claim for research and development was entirely fraudulent and that, to the extent that he had stated that Billbury was involved, that was a lie.
	
	
	P Waller also acknowledged that he deliberately misled the tax investigator, Mr Mark O’Flynn (Mr O’Flynn), by telling him that Mr Daniel had nothing to do with the research and development claim. He acknowledged that the claim for around $600,000 was fraudulent and had nothing to do with Mr Agius. P Waller was also cross-examined about the claim for accrued expenses relating to Lime Street in the 2003 financial year. He acknowledged that while he had stated that he first heard about Lime Street in April 2004, he had made a claim for it in his 2003 tax return. He explained the discrepancy as involving “creative accounting”.
	


c The evidence of Mr David Waller


	
	D Waller stated that he was a director of ASS between 1997 and November 2005. He gave evidence that he met Mr Daniel in early 1998 and that OTD was retained as the accountants for ASS in early 1998.
	
	
	D Waller gave evidence that a few months thereafter he met Mr Agius. At this meeting, D Waller stated that they discussed ASS, including the nature of the business and future growth expectations. He said that Mr Agius gave a presentation and told him and P Waller that Moore Stephens was an accounting business that looked after firms similar to ASS by minimising their tax.
	
	
	D Waller said that he was told that Moore Stephens were located in Vanuatu. He said that Mr Agius talked about an offshore company structure that his firm controlled. D Waller said that Mr Agius stated that he (Mr Agius), or the Vanuatu company, would provide an invoice for services rendered, which would be recorded in the ASS accounts as a business expense. Mr Agius then explained that the funds would be transferred back to pay for those expenses and that the Wallers would receive these funds as a loan, which they would never have to repay.
	
	
	D Waller gave evidence that Mr Agius drew a diagram showing the cash flow. In the course of his evidence, D Waller drew a diagram which he said was similar to that shown to him by Mr Agius. The diagram was in similar form to that drawn by P Waller and showed money flowing from ASS to Billbury via an ANZ Bank account to Uniton and then back to ASS.
	
	
	D Waller said that he recalled Mr Agius speaking about Billbury and Uniton and a New Zealand bank account. He said that he recalled discussions about the ATO and how the transaction would be explained if they made inquiries. He gave evidence that it was mentioned that Moore Stephens had a few clients minimising their tax in this way and that they had no previous issues with the ATO. He said that Mr Agius had said that all of the documents would be provided if the ATO were to contact him or P Waller in relation to an audit.
	
	
	D Waller gave evidence that he recalled being told at the meeting that the initial charge would be $8,000. D Waller said that he had no personal role in relation to any of the payments which were made by ASS to New Zealand or any dealings in that context with anyone at OTD.
	
	
	D Waller said that at some stage, he came to hear of a company named Lime Street. He said that P Waller had told him that he had had a meeting with Mr Agius in which Lime Street was brought up. He said that Lime Street was providing ASS with an insurance policy and that D Waller was being insured for Key Man Insurance. He gave evidence that, similar to Billbury, it was a fictitious company that was providing ASS with an invoice for which ASS would pay and would then receive the funds back. He stated that he had never heard of Key Man Insurance.
	
	
	D Waller was shown an invoice from Billbury addressed to ASS dated 3 June 1998. He said that none of the work described in that invoice was carried out by Billbury on behalf of ASS.
	
	
	D Waller said that he did not have any knowledge of the manner in which the monies paid out of ASS to the ANZ Bank in Auckland subsequently came back and found their way into his personal tax returns.
	
	
	D Waller said that he was made aware that the ATO was proposing to conduct an audit into ASS. He said that he was made aware of this by P Waller and that there was a meeting concerning the audit in the office of OTD the day before the audit meeting with the ATO was to take place. He said that the only information that he had prior to the meeting at OTD was that P Waller had told him “the guys at Owen T Daniel’s would like to discuss the audit”.
	
	
	He remembered that at the meeting, people were role playing in relation to the type of questions that might be asked and the types of answers which should be given. He said that some of the suggested answers were untrue.
	
	
	D Waller gave evidence that he did not have a lot of input in the meeting, which was chaired by P Waller, who was the one answering all of the questions. He said that the answers given by P Waller were untruthful so far as they related to Billbury and Uniton.
	
	
	D Waller was asked whether he knew Mr Turner. He said that he did and that because of the work that Mr Turner had been doing in relation to research of products, Mr Daniel thought it would be a good idea to use his name as the person working for them from Billbury. He said that the research work done by Mr Turner had nothing to do with either Billbury, Uniton or Lime Street.
	
	
	D Waller was shown notices of demand from Uniton and Edgecumbe Finance demanding the repayment of loans. He said that no money was owed by him to either Uniton or Edgecumbe Finance.
	
	
	In cross-examination, D Waller repeated his evidence that Mr Agius explained to him that Moore Stephens was an international accounting firm that helped clients similar to ASS to minimise their tax, that the proposed arrangements would involve offshore transactions and that he (Mr Agius) would provide the necessary documents for tax purposes.
	


d The evidence of Mr Mark O’Flynn


	
	At the relevant time, Mr O’Flynn was an officer of the ATO. He was responsible for conducting the audit into the taxation affairs of ASS and the Wallers. He gave evidence that during the course of an interview that he had with the Wallers, P Waller indicated that Billbury carried out consulting work in finding products, factories and markets in Europe and China. Mr O’Flynn said that P Waller told him that Mr Turner spoke constantly with D Waller in relation to Billbury. He said that P Waller also said that when he first contacted Mr Agius regarding a loan, Uniton offered a facility. He said that P Waller told him that he contacted Mr Agius because he could not get a business loan in Australia.
	
	
	Mr O’Flynn also said that P Waller told him that the Wallers initially took out a personal loan of $1 million and intended to increase this to $4 million. He said that he was told that there was no security for the loan, just personal guarantees and that the funds were paid into a personal bank account.
	
	
	Mr O’Flynn said that P Waller told him that both Billbury and Uniton had the same principal, Robert Agius.
	


2 GBM

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	In 1983, the directors of GBM, Mr and Ms Southcombe (collectively, the Southcombes), engaged OTD as their and GBM’s accountants and tax agents on an ongoing basis.
	
	
	The agreed statement of facts states that Mr Agius was not involved in the preparation of the GBM accounts or in the preparation and lodgement of income tax returns for GBM or the Southcombes.
	
	
	In 1997, prior to receipt of funds from any New Zealand accounts, the unaudited accounts of GBM recorded $328,000 as accrued management and consulting fees. These fees were claimed as expenses in the 1997 GBM tax return.
	
	
	The accounts for 1997 recorded an unsecured loan in an amount of $210,588. This amount was recorded on documents prepared by Ms Southcombe as “Uniton/Security Life Nominees Ltd”.
	
	
	In 1998, GBM made eight transfers out of an account held by it with Colonial State Bank (GBM A/c No 1) into the Billbury account. The total value of the transfers was $328,280. Each of the transfers, rounded down to the nearest hundred, was transferred into the Uniton account. Subsequently, subject to some small deductions, and one deduction of $8021.34, they were transferred back to the GBM A/c No 1.
	
	
	Each of the outgoing payments was recorded in the accounts as management and consulting fees, being payments for fees previously accrued.
	
	
	In the 1998 unaudited accounts, $250,000 was recorded as management and consulting fees, with a corresponding entry under unsecured loans. The incoming amounts from Uniton, totalling $284,709.26, were recorded as unsecured loans. The total closing balance of the unsecured loans shown in the accounts was $745,297, made up of the 1997 unsecured loan of $210,588 plus the amounts of $250,000 and $284,709.26.
	
	
	The $250,000 management and consulting fees were claimed as expenses in the 1998 tax return for GBM.
	
	
	In the 1999 financial year, six transactions, in similar form to those in the 1998 financial year, took place. The total amount transferred out of the GBM A/c No 1 in these transactions was $250,210.
	
	
	The unaudited accounts for GBM recorded $250,000 of the money paid out in the 1999 financial year as management and consulting fees. An additional $50,000 was also recorded as management and consulting fees and a corresponding entry was made in the accounts as a loan.
	
	
	The sum of $300,000, being the total amount referred to in par 128 above, formed part of the total management and consulting fees of $320,747, claimed as expenses in the GBM 1999 income tax return.
	
	
	The incoming payments from the Uniton account were recorded as unsecured loans. The closing balance of loans recorded in the name of Uniton was $1,079,666. In the income tax return for the 1999 financial year, GBM claimed $39,884 as interest expenses. This was described in the ledger as “Vanuatu interest”.
	
	
	In the 2000 financial year, similar transactions took place. Seven transfers were made out of the GBM A/c No 1 to the Billbury account. The total value of these transfers was $300,210. The amounts received in respect of four of the transfers were paid into the Uniton account and then, subject to small deductions, paid back into the GBM A/c No 1. The other two transfers were transferred to the IFTC account and from there, subject to small deductions, paid into the GBM A/c No 1.
	
	
	In addition, one transfer of $35,694.51 was made out of the GBM A/c No 1 directly into the Uniton account and then, subject to small deductions, back into the GBM A/c No 1.
	
	
	In the same year, GBM made a United States dollar transfer of $1,300 into the IFTC account.
	
	
	In that year, $119,974, described as interest expenses, was claimed by GBM as a tax deduction. It was made up of $41,933.20, recorded as interest paid to non-residents, $68,302, recorded as an accrued interest expense and $9,679.82, recorded as “Int Fin Trust Co US $5503.03”.
	
	
	The closing balance for unsecured loans in the unaudited accounts was $1,094,834.45.
	
	
	In 2001, two transfers were made from the GBM A/c No 1 to the Uniton account. The amount of the first transfer, with a small deduction, was paid out of this account into the GBM A/c No 1 four days later. The second transfer was transferred from the Uniton account into an account operated by a company, Security Life Nominees Ltd (Security Life), with the ANZ Bank in New Zealand (the Security Life account). On the same day, the money was transferred, with a small deduction, into the GBM A/c No 1.
	
	
	In addition, a transfer was made from the GBM A/c No 1 directly to the Security Life account. Three days later, this transfer, with a small deduction, was transferred to the GBM A/c No 1.
	
	
	In the same year, a United States dollar transfer of $3,453.25 was paid into the IFTC account.
	
	
	In its tax return for the 2001 financial year, GBM claimed $91,451 as interest expenses. This was said to be made up of what was described as $45,845.77 interest to Uniton and $50,605 interest to Security Life.
	
	
	In the accounts, the funds from Uniton and Security Life which flowed into the GBM A/c No 1 account were described as loan draw downs. The closing balance for unsecured loans stated in the accounts was $1,245,223.
	
	
	There were two transfers made by GBM in the 2002 financial year. These were made out of an account of GBM with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (GBM A/c No 2). The first was made into the IFTC account and the second was made into the Security Life account. The latter transfer, with a small deduction, was transferred back to the GBM A/c No 2.
	
	
	In this financial year, a tax deduction of $137,200 for interest expenses was claimed in the tax return lodged by GBM. This was made up of amounts referred to in two Security Life invoices.
	
	
	The funds flowing back to GBM from Security Life were described as unsecured loans.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, six transfers, totalling $271,473.04, were made from the GBM A/c No 2 to the Security Life account. The first of these, with a small deduction, was transferred back to the GBM A/c No. 2.
	
	
	The other five transfers, with small deductions, were transferred from the Security Life account into the IFTC account. The second and third transfers, with an addition of some $900, were then combined and transferred into the Edgecumbe account and then into an account with the NAB in the name of Robert and Pauline Agius (the Agius account). These funds, subject to a small deduction, were then transferred to a Ms Ingrid Algie (Ms Algie), Ms Southcombe’s sister (AB 17/7895). The monies the subject of the fourth, fifth and sixth transfers were not transferred out of the Security Life account in the year in question.
	
	
	In the 2003 tax return, $116,208 was claimed as interest expenses.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, four transfers were made out of the GBM A/c No 2 into the Security Life account. The total amount transferred was $185,112. Subject to small deductions, these transfers were paid into the IFTC account. The first three of these transfers, totalling $129,870.47, were then combined with three transfers made to the IFTC account in the 2003 financial year, amounting to $164,787.21 and, subject to a deduction of $4,657.68, were transferred into an account with the Westpac Banking Corporation entitled “Des Last Pty Ltd t/a Gladesville Bridge Yacht Sales” (Des Last account). This account was operated by Ms Southcombe.
	
	
	The fourth transfer was in an amount of $55,028. Of this amount, subject to small deductions by Security Life, $19,415 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account. After a small deduction, these funds were transferred into an account with the CBA entitled “Fit for a King” (the Fit for a King account), operated by Mr Arthur Isbester (Mr Isbester).
	
	
	In that year, an amount of $112,070.24 was claimed as interest expenses.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with the flow of funds in the 2005-2007 financial years together. In the 2005 financial year, three transfers were made from the GBM A/c No 2 into the Security Life account.
	
	
	The first and second of these transfers were each in an amount of $55,028. These monies were transferred together, subject to a small deduction, in the same year into the Edgecumbe account. Thereafter, in the same year, after a deduction of $9,870.46, the money was transferred into the Fit for a King account.
	
	
	The third transfer, which took place on 16 June 2005, was in an amount of $891,196.37. Of this amount, $285,330.46 was transferred into the IFTC account on 22 December 2006. On 3 April 2007, a portion of this transfer, $100,015, was transferred into the Edgecumbe account and thereafter, on the same day, into an account with the ANZ Bank entitled “Impressive Concepts Account” (the Impressive Concepts account), operated by Mr Isbester. On 14 June 2007, a further portion of $219,000 was transferred from the IFTC account into the Impressive Concepts account.
	
	
	The balance of the third transfer was paid from the Security Life account into the Edgecumbe account between 27 September 2005 and 22 December 2006. In the same period, funds totalling $600,000 were paid out of the Edgecumbe account into the Fit for a King account.
	
	
	In the 2005 financial year, a tax deduction of $41,510 was claimed for interest expenses. No relevant deductions were claimed in the subsequent years.
	


b The evidence of Ms Eva Maria Southcombe


	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that she met Mr Daniel around 1982 or 1983 and that he had acted as her and her husband’s accountant for many years.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that she looked after the office arrangements, the office staff and all of the paperwork for GBM. She said that she also supplied tax information to GBM’s accountant. She said that her husband looked after the outdoor staff, the maintenance of GBM’s marina and the work that was conducted on the boats for GBM and that he was also involved in the brokerage business.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that around March 1998, Mr Daniel told her that he had a very good friend, Robert Agius, who he believed could be of value to her and her husband. She said that she subsequently met Mr Agius at the OTD office. She said that he was introduced by Mr Daniel as an expert in tax who worked in a very reputable worldwide company. Mr Daniel told her that Mr Agius would be very helpful to them and that a large number of clients used his assistance to minimise tax. There was a discussion of how tax minimisation may be available, but she said she did not understand it.
	
	
	She said that either Mr Daniel or Mr Agius told her at the meeting that Mr Agius was based in Vanuatu with a firm, Moore Stephens.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that she recalled asking whether there was any criminality involved in Mr Agius’ proposals and she was assured that there was not.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that she recalled that either Mr Daniel or Mr Agius mentioned that funds would be forwarded overseas and returned.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe identified a brochure she was given headed “Moore Stephens Vanuatu”. She said that she believed that she received the brochure at the first meeting.
	
	
	She recalled that after the meeting, either her or her husband telephoned Mr Daniel and said that they (the Southcombes and GBM) would go along with what was suggested “because it sounded like something that all the big companies seemed to do”. She said that she subsequently learnt from Ms Jandagi that OTD was communicating with both Mr Agius’ office and a company called Hamilton Holdings Pty Ltd (Hamilton Holdings) in order to set up the necessary paperwork.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that she thought that Hamilton Holdings was a company that could not be taxed and “it was a company I think that was sort of between Billbury and Uniton that sort of maintained accounts of monies et cetera.” She said that she knew that Hamilton Holdings was located in Vanuatu and that she received paperwork in relation to that company from OTD in May 1998.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to the recording in GBM’s accounts of $328,000 as forming part of the total management and consulting fees for the 1997 financial year (see par [123] above). She said that the figure was provided by Ms Jandagi who “worked out that figure from our taxes”.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to an email that she forwarded to Ms Jandagi in May 1988. She acknowledged that the 1997 tax return had been lodged by the time of that email. She said that the $328,000 was paid by GBM by June 1998 and that the claim for the tax deduction was made by Ms Jandagi.
	
	
	She said that at the time she wrote the email, she did not understand what was happening in the process or whether there was a time urgency in forwarding the funds. It was only when she received a response to the email that she realised that it was urgent.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to an email forwarded to her by Ms Jandagi on 1 June 1998. The email stated that Hamilton Holdings could not be associated with Ms Southcombe in any way and the Southcombes could not be directors or shareholders of the company. Ms Southcombe said that she thought this was very strange but that she was told it was a vehicle that was set up by Mr Agius for his purposes. She said that she could not be certain whether she was told that by Mr Agius or Ms Jandagi.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to a handwritten diagram which she said she received in a meeting with Mr Daniel and Mr Agius. She said that the meeting was subsequent to the first meeting and occurred because she and her husband did not understand the process and wanted to know how the scheme was structured. The diagram showed a box with arrows indicating invoices from Billbury and loans from Uniton. Ms Southcombe that said she was told that the box represented GBM and that the diagram indicated invoices going to Billbury, cash being paid to Billbury and loans from Uniton. When asked about the word “invoice” on the diagram, she said that she was told by Mr Agius that “they would be providing us with invoices”. She said that Mr Agius also told her that the invoices would be management and services invoices from Billbury. She said that she understood that the total scheme was for tax minimisation and was part of Robert Agius’ tax minimisation scheme.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that at the time the payment of $328,000 was made, GBM had not received any invoices and that invoices were only received in the latter part of 2000 from Billbury.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that in February 1999, she was told by Mr Agius that Mr John Warmington (Mr Warmington) of Moore Stephens Vanuatu would be the contact person for her, her husband and their companies.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was asked about loan interest payments to Uniton. She said that she would receive statements and there would be interest payments noted on the statements. She was shown an invoice which referred to a draw down facility of $1 million, the invoice being for $39,893.83. She said that when she received the invoices, she would arrange for a payment of that amount by GBM. She said that GBM had not received a payment of $1 million from Uniton.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said the payments which came from Uniton as a loan were approximately the same amounts as payments which had gone out to Billbury.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that at some stage, she raised her concerns with Mr Agius about her lack of understanding of payments coming from Uniton in May 2000. She said that “we stopped the invoices” when the loan amount was close to $1 million on the balance sheet. She said that she initially raised the matter with Ms Jandagi and, subsequent to that, had a number of face-to-face meetings with Mr Agius in OTD’s offices. She said that initially, those meetings were in the presence of Ms Jandagi, but in 2005, Mr Zerafa attended.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe also indicated that she was concerned about not receiving invoices from Billbury. She referred to an email written by her to Ms Jandagi on 7 December 1998, in which she said that Mr Agius had told her in July that he had virtually finished the invoices they had requested. In the email, she also complained that since then, she had referred to four emails that she had sent to Mr Agius in relation to the invoices, without any response at all.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence concerning a further email that she sent to Ms Jandagi on 3 March 1999 following up on her email of 7 December 1998. She indicated that she had emailed Mr Agius nine times requesting invoices in relation to the funds transferred to Billbury in the 1998 financial year. She stated in that email that those requests had been going on for nine months and that it was “Absolutely ridiculous” and this was “no way to have an association or have things work.”
	
	
	Ms Southcombe indicated that by 2000, “we” (presumably the Southcombes and GBM) had had enough and did not wish to be involved in the scheme any more or have the Uniton loan on the balance sheet. She said that Ms Jandagi told her that all of the other clients were happy with the scheme and did not want to get out of it, that she did not know how GBM could get out of the scheme and that the best thing that could be done was to minimise their involvement. She said that the only thing done in that particular year was to pay $17,000 in interest because she did not want the balance on the loan on the balance sheet to keep escalating. She said that after the 2001 financial year, there were more interest payments made because there was no alternative but to continue to pay them as there was no way out of the loan.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that after that time, they decided to try and get rid of the loan by paying it off and making payments towards the principal of the loan to reduce it. In that context, she said that the funds that they were sending overseas, in her mind, were not for a tax deduction, but were to get out of the loan, because the tax deduction was only on the interest, not the principal. She said that the payments went into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
	
	
	She also said that she had meetings with Mr Agius and Ms Jandagi to try and get some of the money back. She said that it was a difficult situation. She said that Mr Jandagi suggested that it could come back through the OTD trust account and that she requested this to occur. However, she said that Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa decided that this was inappropriate. Ms Southcombe gave evidence that on 23 September 2003, she received an email from Mr Agius concerning the proposal to transfer funds back to GBM through the OTD trust account. The email stated that if questioned, she could not hope to hide behind the OTD trust account as “they [OTD] have to disclose”.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that in a conversation that she had with Ms Jandagi in 2003, Ms Jandagi said that there was another way to get the funds back from Vanuatu and that a number of clients had debit cards. She said that Ms Jandagi told her that the system was that Mr Agius would arrange for funds to go onto a debit card and that clients could then go each week and get cash out using the debit card. She said that GBM did not proceed with that course.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that Mr Agius suggested that GBM open a marina in Vanuatu but that they were not interested. She said that she owed her sister some money and in desperation, she contacted Mr Agius to see whether she could get a cheque from him to give to her sister and Mr Agius agreed. She said it was for $71,000, which was deducted from the loan. Ms Southcombe was shown a cheque in the sum of $71,071.93 in favour of Ms Algie. She said that Ms Algie was her sister and identified the signature on that cheque as that of Mr Agius. She said that she got the cheque by mail from Vanuatu.
	
	
	She said that in mid to late 2003, Mr Agius suggested that another means of getting the money back was to jointly buy a boat. Mr Agius forwarded half of the money for the purchase of the boat and Ms Southcombe put in the other half and, when the boat was sold, the Southcombes retained the full funds. Ms Southcombe said that $290,000 came back via the boat method and she received a payment from Mr Agius in the sum of $280,000. She said that the boat was bought for $580,000 and $280,000 was received from Mr Agius. She said that Mr Agius “was never a part of the boat”. She stated it was a facade to get back some of the money that had been sent overseas.
	
	
	To support the facade, Ms Southcombe said that she wrote to Mr Agius, referring to the purchase, and received a handwritten reply from him which, so far as relevant, said “Thanks I’ve looked up the website and agree the boat is a dream. I’m counting out my pennies now”. Ms Southcombe said that the purpose of the arrangement was that Mr Agius would pretend to be a half-owner and send the money. He suggested sending a fax, outlining the boat and making it sound as though they were friendly and knew each other.
	
	
	She also said that she was told that another means of getting the money back involved receiving cash payments (see below).
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to an email of 22 May 2000 from Mr Warmington. She said that the reference in the email to instructions having been issued on that day was to arrange for an amount of $20,000, which had been paid over by GBM, to be transferred back. She said that those funds, in large measure, were returned.
	
	
	In an email written by Ms Southcombe to Mr Agius on 3 December 1999, Ms Southcombe inquired as to whether it would be satisfactory to pay an IFTC account in Australian dollars. She said that, at the time, her understanding was that IFTC was an entity, which came under Moore Stephens and was associated with Mr Agius, which forwarded accounts for services to them.
	
	
	In answer to questions from the trial judge as to the reason that Ms Southcombe felt it was necessary to repay the loan, she said that the accountants made her feel like it was a genuine debt and that it was treated like a real loan. She agreed, however, that she had never received a loan, saying that she received sums of money that came back to her from the money GBM sent overseas, which were added to the principal of the loan, and that was the reason the loan increased on the balance sheet. She said that it looked very real when she looked at the balance sheet. She also said, without nominating a particular date, that she came to a realisation that the scheme was wrong and wished to get out of it. She said that “we” were always told by Mr Agius and Mr Daniel that they would never call on the loan. She said that she had real loans and knew that the only way to reduce the loan was to pay the principal, so GBM was making payments to the principal, for which there was no tax benefit. She said, however, that monies that were repaid were in the main returned “but not through our bank account”.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that in about November 2000, she became aware of the company Security Life. She said that she was informed by Mr Agius and Ms Jandagi that the paperwork for the Uniton loan only went to $1 million and that therefore they needed to refinance it with another company, Security Life. She said that Mr Agius did the paperwork and organised the change.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was shown a loan facility offer dated 1 November 2000 from Security Life addressed to the directors of GBM. She said that she recalled receiving the document and that she and her husband witnessed the affixing of the common seal of GBM and Ms McConachie signed on behalf of Security Life. Ms McConachie was employed by Moore Stephens.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to a draw down notice, headed “Drawdown 1”, referring to a request for a drawdown of $973,800 from the loan facility and advising that that money had been paid into the Uniton account as requested. She said that she had never given such instructions. She made similar comments in relation to subsequent draw down notices, described as Drawdowns No 2, 3 and 4. She was referred to the reference to penalty interest in Drawdown 4 and said that that item just seemed to appear on the invoices.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to seven Billbury invoices covering the period from 31 December 1996 to 30 June 1997. She said that she did not receive them on the dates they bore, but that they first came to her in the latter half of 2000. She said that they came together from Mr Agius directly. She said that the invoices matched payments that GBM had made to the Billbury account. She was also referred to the services described on the invoices and said that GBM had not received services of that kind.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that she had had a meeting with Mr Agius, Ms Jandagi and her husband at OTD’s office on 15 March 2004. She said that the reason for the meeting was that contracts had been exchanged on the sale of the Marina in January 2004 but that there was still a huge loan on the balance sheet. She said that it was at that meeting that Mr Agius suggested things like establishing a marine business or building a marina in Vanuatu. However, nothing was sorted out at the meeting.
	
	
	On 15 March 2005, Ms Southcombe emailed Mr Agius, referring to a meeting that she had had with Ms Jandagi and indicating that they would like to make the interest payments for 2004 on the GBM loan. She requested the necessary invoices. She received a response from Mr Agius that he was arranging invoices “as we speak”.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that she had further meeting with Mr Agius around the week of 11 April 2005. She recalled that Mr Zerafa was present at that meeting and he and Mr Agius told her and her husband that the only way that repayment of the loan could be managed was if it was paid out by forwarding $800,000 into the New Zealand account. She said that that happened and it allowed GBM to be wound-up because all debts had been repaid. She said that the payment was made into the Security Life account. In that context, she was referred to an email from Mr Agius of 13 June 2005, in which he stated that he believed she was doing the right thing paying back the loan.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that in the second half of 2005 she met with Mr Agius in Sydney on a number of occasions. She said that on those occasions, he repaid monies that had been sent over as the payments on the principal of the loan. She said that the monies were in cash between $30,000 and $50,000. She estimated that they were paid over $500,000 in total.
	
	
	She said that the payments originally came from Mr Agius and then from a man he described as a very good friend of his, Mr Isbester. She said that the majority of the payments came from Mr Isbester.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that the payments made by Mr Agius were made to her at her Drummoyne home or in a park adjacent to that home. She said that Mr Agius first spoke to her about Mr Isbester in mid-2005, saying that he was a very good friend and as he (Mr Agius) was coming less to Australia, he could organise the funds to be returned through Mr Isbester. She said that she met Mr Isbester in the park near her Drummoyne home. Thereafter, Mr Isbester came to Drummoyne from time to time and gave her cash in amounts of around $20,000.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that to enable that procedure to take place, Mr Agius made up a pro forma letter to be signed by her. She referred to an example of that letter dated 17 February 2006. The letter said “I authorise Robert Agius to send $130,000.00 (one hundred and thirty thousand dollars) to the account designated by Robert Agius”. She said that from the second half of June 2006 and going forward, the general situation that occurred for the delivery of further amounts of cash was that authorities would be forwarded to Ms Fawcett for Mr Agius and then Mr Agius would organise the funds to be forwarded to Mr Isbester, who would then go to their home and give them the payments.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that towards the end of 2006, she met with Ms Jandagi and a Mr Andrew Hager at a cafe near the offices of OTD. At that meeting, Ms Jandagi told her that OTD had been visited by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), who took a number of files, including a GBM file. Thereafter, she tried to contact Ms Jandagi on numerous occasions but was unable to do so.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe gave evidence that in late 2006, as a result of being unable to speak to Ms Jandagi, she contacted Mr Isbester and told him that she needed to speak to Mr Agius, as they did not know what was happening. She said that Mr Isbester told her that Mr Agius was in Sydney and Mr Isbester organised for her and her husband to meet Mr Agius in a cafe in the Sutherland area.
	
	
	She said that she and her husband met Mr Agius at the cafe and told him of their meeting with Ms Jandagi and of being informed that the AFP had visited the OTD office and taken files. She said that Mr Agius told them that they had nothing to worry about because the loan had been paid back. She said that after that meeting, she never had another face-to-face meeting with Mr Agius.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that she and her husband did not get back all the money that she believed should come back from overseas. She said that in April 2007 she asked Mr Isbester if he could contact Mr Agius and forward some funds back to them. She said that Mr Isbester showed her an email to Mr Agius which he said related to the request. The email referred to a tip on a racehorse. Ms Southcombe explained that the reference in the email to 100/1 meant that Mr Isbester wanted $100,000 and the signatures “E” and “P” stood for Eva and Phillip Southcombe.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe said that in May 2007, Mr Isbester informed her that he had received $219,000 from Mr Agius. She said that she and her husband did not receive any of the money and stated “he still did owe us other funds which then very slowly trickled to nothing”.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to a demand addressed to the directors of GBM from Security Life demanding payment of $258,697.16. She said, without objection, that her husband contacted Mr Isbester and questioned the notice. Mr Isbester informed him that he would contact Mr Agius and find out what the notice was about. Thereafter, she was informed by Mr Isbester that Mr Agius had said that he had sent this particular notice to all of his clients to give some authenticity to the loans that they all had and as GBM had paid out the loan, it should be discarded.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Ms Southcombe acknowledged that until the incident giving rise to the proceedings, she believed that Mr Daniel was an honourable man and a skilled accountant. She said that she had a long and trusted history with him and that if it were not for Mr Daniel, GBM would not have entered into the tax scheme. She said that Mr Daniel introduced them to Mr Agius and said that he was a tax expert and someone they definitely should listen to who would assist them on tax matters. She acknowledged that if a tax matter arose that needed advice, Mr Daniel was the one she went to.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was asked about her conception of the scheme at the beginning and said that it was at the second meeting, when Mr Agius drew a diagram, that she got a little bit of an understanding.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was challenged as to her evidence that she received the Moore Stephens brochure from Mr Agius at her first meeting with him. It was pointed out that the brochure indicated that Mr Agius had a Master of Business Administration degree which was not conferred upon him until 1999. In that context, she reiterated that she thought she was given the brochure at the first meeting, stating that it was a long time ago. She said that if she did not receive it at the first meeting, she received it at another meeting with him. She was asked if she thought that it might have been given to her by Mr Daniel and she said no, it was given to her by Mr Agius.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was asked in cross-examination about the $328,000 claimed as part of the total expenses for the 1997 tax return. It was suggested to her that the tax return making this claim was lodged before she met Mr Agius. She denied this, stating that there was no way that the figure of $328,000 was worked out prior to meeting him.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was referred to a record of unsecured loans to GBM prepared by her which showed unsecured loans in an amount of $210,588. It was suggested to her that this had something to do with another tax scheme. She denied this. It was pointed out to her that the unsecured loan account, as at 30 June 1997 had a figure of $210,988, with a notation “GBM debt to Security Life Nominees Nil” and then a difference of $210,588. She accepted that the document formed part of the accounting process of GBM but could not explain the entry $210,588 as per the tax return. It was suggested to her that it was indicative of some sort of tax scheme involving GBM and OTD which was in existence long before she knew Mr Agius. She denied this.
	
	
	It should be noted that the document on which she was cross-examined purported to be a summary of unsecured loans up to 30 June 2003. As such, it was plainly created after Ms Southcombe had met Mr Agius. Further, the nil balance as at 30 June 1997 against Security Life indicated, consistently with her evidence, that no loan had been made to GBM at that time.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was cross-examined about the $328,000 paid to Billbury, in particular, why that payment appeared in the 1997 tax return. It was suggested to her that the payment was made before she met Mr Agius. She rejected that, saying that she had to have met him before that for the $328,000 to be paid.
	
	
	It was suggested to Ms Southcombe that Mr Agius did not send her any Billbury invoices. She denied this. She was shown a Billbury invoice addressed to a company, Moderne Art Printing Co Pty Ltd (Moderne Art). It was suggested to her that it was a pro forma invoice which came from her house. She said that she did not recognise it and that she did not produce the Billbury invoice. She also said that she never had an interest in a business called Moderne Art.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe acknowledged that the invoices from Billbury were in existence when her house was searched by the AFP. She said that she was not present for the search. She was referred to a record of interview dated 18 June 2008 in which it was recorded that her solicitor (Mr Hodges) had discussed with the accountant and liquidator whether they had any of GBM’s records or documents and recorded that there were none in existence. The record of interview also recorded Mr Hodges stating that he was not sure whether it was the director, the accountant or the liquidator who had destroyed all of the records a few months after the company’s liquidation. Ms Southcombe denied that she gave instructions to her solicitor to supply this information.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr Agius suggested to Ms Southcombe that Mr Isbester gave her funds to enable her to make a payment in respect of the outstanding loan. She denied this. She also denied that Mr Agius told her that it would be difficult to arrange for her to receive further monies from Vanuatu.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe denied the suggestion that when she, her husband, Mr Agius and Mr Isbester went to the park at Drummoyne, she had a private conversation with Mr Isbester in which she agreed to give him interest free loans from time to time. She said that there was only one meeting in the park and that was when Mr Agius introduced her and her husband to Mr Isbester. Ms Southcombe also rejected the suggestion that Mr Agius was not present at the meeting at a cafe in Sutherland.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe agreed that she did not mention anything to Mr Warmington about wanting to cease involvement with Mr Agius. It was suggested to her that she never said anything to Ms Jandagi about this at that time. She said that she thought that she did say this to Ms Jandagi some time in the 2000/2001 financial year. It was suggested to her that Ms Jandagi did not tell her that none of the other clients wished to cease involvement in the scheme and GBM should minimise their involvement. She denied this.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Southcombe stated that it was Mr Agius who made all of the suggestions about how to get the money back. She said, however, that Ms Jandagi did mention payments through the trust account of OTD. In that context, Ms Southcombe said that in the year 2000, she was more concerned about getting out of the scheme than getting the money back. She said that the latter concern came later, when they started making payments towards the principal of the loan. It was suggested to Ms Southcombe that there was no discussion in June 2003 as to how to retrieve monies. She rejected this. However, she said that she was dealing directly with Mr Agius regarding the return of monies.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe accepted that after making the payments in 2005, she did not raise any difficulties about retrieving monies with Ms Jandagi. She agreed that the funds were not being recorded in the books of GBM and that it was just cash that she was receiving.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was cross-examined by counsel for Ms Jandagi as to the meeting which took place after the AFP had seized files from the offices of OTD. It was suggested to her that Ms Jandagi did not say that she had nothing to worry about as the loan had been repaid. It was also suggested to her that Mr Hagar was not present at the meeting, contrary to her statement. She rejected this. It was put to her that she had said that Mr Hagar was present because she (Ms Southcombe) was aware of Ms Jandagi’s connection with him and she thought that it would give her statement some credibility. She rejected this proposition.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe also denied that she never had any discussion with Ms Jandagi about the provision of a debit card.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr Zerafa asked Ms Southcombe about the transfer of $891,196.37, recorded in the agreed statement of facts as having been made on 16 June 2005: see par [152] above. She agreed that she understood that this payment was made to repay the loans. She stated that Mr Agius paid back monies owed to GBM prior to that payment, citing as an example the $71,000 paid to her sister and the $290,000 for the half share of the boat. She said that after that, there were still monies owing to them and Mr Agius paid them that money, but the majority of the money from the payout of the loan was paid back through Mr Isbester.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe was also referred in that context to the payment to the Fit for a King account and payments by Edgecumbe Finance to Mr Isbester. She said that she was not sure of the identity of the account into which monies flowed back to Mr Isbester and said that she had nothing to do with Edgecumbe Finance. She acknowledged, having regard to the time that money was transferred back to the Fit for a King account, that the transactions must have been contemplated earlier than she had said in her evidence. She denied that this meant that her evidence was confused.
	
	
	In that context, she repeated her evidence that funds were coming back to them and that the first way was the cheque to her sister and then the half share of the boat. She said that it was only after that had occurred that Mr Isbester was introduced.
	
	
	Ms Southcombe agreed that the arrangement with Mr Isbester was strange. She denied however that she believed that Mr Isbester was simply washing money through his business to have cash delivered to her.
	
	
	In further cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Ms Southcombe was asked about a document which she agreed was a transaction audit trail dated 30 June 1997. She was asked, by reference to a code which she acknowledged related to management and consulting fees, whether that was a document created by her on 23 July 1997 to explain the fees. She responded that she did not print off audit trails but that it may have been something done in the accountant’s office. She denied that the document made nonsense of her claim that the $328,000 payment was conceived in March 1998 and that she was simply telling lies when she asserted this.
	
	
	It was put to Ms Southcombe by senior counsel for Mr Agius that the repayment of the loan indicated that, in her view, it was binding and enforceable. She denied this, saying that the loan was not a legal loan but was rather a scheme devised by Mr Agius which created difficulties because of the way it was managed. She said that she was told that it would be forgiven and it was not forgiven. She said that Mr Agius said that GBM had no option but to pay out the loan, although she agreed that in hindsight she should have obtained legal advice.
	
	
	In re-examination, Ms Southcombe identified the transactions which, excluding components of $35 in each case, amounted to the $328,000, paid to Billbury in the 1998 financial year.
	


c The evidence of Mr Phillip Southcombe


	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that he commenced using the services of OTD in about 1983.
	
	
	He said that his role in relation to GBM was looking after outside activities, while his wife looked after the office activities.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that in March 1988, Mr Agius was introduced to him and his wife by Mr Daniel as an accountant from Moore Stephens in Vanuatu. He said that Mr Agius was portrayed as a bit of an expert on accounting and taxation matters and someone who might be able to help them minimise their tax. He said that he was given this information by Mr Daniel.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that Mr Daniel initially told him and Ms Southcombe that Mr Agius was involved in some schemes to minimise tax and that a number of his clients were taking advantage of the schemes and also that a lot of well-known larger businesses in Australia were involved in similar schemes.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that at that meeting, Mr Agius outlined to some degree how the scheme worked, although it seemed a little bit confusing to him at the time. However, he recalled that Mr Agius said that it involved establishing a company overseas through his Vanuatu company, that bills for work would be sent to them and payment for that work would be paid by them, they would claim interest on those payments and they would have an on-flow of tax advantage from this involvement.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe identified the Moore Stephens brochure (referred to at par [161] above) as having been given to the Southcombes at the meeting.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that he and Ms Southcombe agreed to go ahead with the scheme and, some time after the initial meeting, they received paperwork in regard to a new company that was to be set up. He was referred to a letter from OTD to the directors of GBM dated 20 May 1998 enclosing a certificate of incorporation of Hamilton Holdings and said that that was a document which accompanied the letter.
	
	
	He was also referred to an invoice from IFTC for fees in relation to Hamilton Holdings and said that he saw it in relation to the establishment of the latter company.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that he and Ms Southcombe had another meeting at the offices of OTD with Mr Daniel and Mr Agius a couple of months after the first meeting. He said that he recalled that at that meeting, Mr Agius drew a diagram identifying how the scheme worked. He was shown the diagram, to which I have referred in par [168] above, and said that Mr Agius told him, referring to the diagram, that the scheme involved receiving invoices from Billbury for work done on behalf of GBM and paying those invoices. He said that then, there was “a bit of a money-go-round which still left me a little bit confused and we were to claim taxation advantages as to the payments that were being made”. Mr Southcombe said that his understanding was that the invoices were not for work actually performed by Billbury and that the loan from Uniton referred to in the diagram was not a genuine loan.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that his understanding was that the last payment GBM made to Billbury was in the 2000 financial year, although payments thereafter were being made to overseas bank accounts. He said that he thought that the payments made after 2000 related to interest on the loan, but there were payments made on the principal some time after. He stated that GBM had a loan with Security Life and an initial loan with Uniton for a figure of up to $1 million. He stated that they were then told they had to get another loan for $1,500,000, because they had exceeded the first loan. He said that the Security Life loan, like the Uniton loan, was not a genuine loan. He said that he was told that both loans would be forgiven.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that he and Ms Southcombe came to a definite view that they had made a mistake by entering into the scheme and that they did not want to continue. He said that he attended meetings with OTD in relation to removing GBM from the scheme. He said he remembered one particular meeting where both Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa were present. He said that in a meeting which he thought took place in 2005, he was told that the only way out of the scheme was to pay out the principal of the loan.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that before this meeting, there was another meeting that he and Ms Southcombe had with Ms Jandagi. He thought that this meeting was also in 2005. He said that he remembered being advised at that meeting that the interest payments on the loan had to be made and that it was shortly after that that he and Ms Southcombe were told by Mr Zerafa and Mr Agius that they had to pay out the loan to get out of the scheme. He said that there were other meetings which he could not recall, but said that he remembered that from 2000 to 2005, he and Ms Southcombe made it clear that they wanted to get out of the scheme.
	
	
	In regard to the question of the return of money after payment of the principal, Mr Southcombe said that he remembered a discussion about obtaining a debit card as a means of getting the money back, but it was not proceeded with. He also described the transaction by which a boat was bought with Mr Agius “and half of the payment for the boat was returned to us when the boat was sold”. His description of this transaction was in similar terms to that of Ms Southcombe. Mr Southcombe confirmed that the principal of $900,000 was paid a month after the meeting with Mr Agius and Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe described the method by which money was returned following the repayment of the principal. He said that Mr Agius was delivering money to the Southcombes about every one and a half months.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that when he received the money directly from Mr Agius, it was usually handed over in the park beside his house at Drummoyne. The amount paid each time was between $40,000 and $50,000 in Australian dollar notes. He said that this arrangement went on for quite a while but that Mr Agius said that he was coming to Australia less often and that he would make alternate means of getting the money to them. He said that it was shortly thereafter that Mr Agius introduced him to Mr Isbester.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that he and Ms Southcombe accepted that Mr Isbester could be the courier for the money deliveries and that for about three years he delivered money to them. He said that the amount varied. “It was usually about $20,000, but over a period it started to dwindle quite significantly”. He said that he first met Mr Isbester in the park next to their Drummoyne house and then, after the Southcombes moved to Hunters Hill, Mr Isbester came to their house and, during a short period after that, he arranged to meet Mr Southcombe in a car park in Hunters Hill.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe recalled being told that the OTD offices had been visited by the AFP. He said that he and Ms Southcombe were asked to meet Ms Jandagi at OTD. He said that when they got to the office, they were told that Ms Jandagi was at a cafe up the road and they went and met her there. He said that he and Ms Southcombe met Ms Jandagi and Mr Hagar at the cafe. He said that they were told by Ms Jandagi that she was visited by the AFP and that they had taken a number of files, including those of GBM and Mr Hagar, but that she thought that the Southcombes did not have any problems because they had paid out the loans.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that following that meeting, he contacted Mr Isbester and told him that the OTD offices had been visited by the AFP and that he and Ms Southcombe would like to speak to Mr Agius. Mr Isbester said that Mr Agius was in Sydney at the time and later that day they met him with Mr Isbester and Mr Isbester’s wife in a cafe near Hurstville.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that during that meeting, the Southcombes told Mr Agius that OTD had been visited by the AFP and that they were very concerned that a number of files had been taken, including theirs and Mr Hagar’s. Mr Agius said that he did not know Mr Hagar and that Mr Hagar was not involved in the scheme involving Mr Agius. Mr Southcombe said that Mr Agius said that he did not think that they had any problems because their loan was repaid and not to worry about it. Mr Southcombe said that this was the last time he saw Mr Agius.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that the arrangement with Mr Isbester continued, but as the Southcombe’s were mindful that the AFP had become involved, the meeting took place under the pretext that they were to deal with arrangements for a 60th birthday party to be catered for by Mr Isbester.
	
	
	Mr Isbester confirmed that he received a notice of demand from Security Life in an envelope with a Port Villa postmark. He said that the money the subject of the demand was not owed to Security Life.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that in November 2007, he spoke with his solicitor to two AFP officers, Federal Agents Scott Miller and Anthony Fox, and informed them of his arrangements to meet with Mr Isbester. He referred to a meeting with Mr Isbester on 8 January 2007, at which Mr Isbester handed him an envelope which he said contained $3,000. He also said that he recalled Mr Isbester saying that the tax status of Vanuatu was vitally important to the economy of the country and he believed that the government would not assist the AFP in allowing anything to interrupt that relationship. The meeting was observed by officers of the AFP.
	
	
	A similar meeting took place on 22 January 2008, when Mr Isbester handed over further funds. This meeting was also observed by officers of the AFP.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe gave evidence that in a subsequent conversation with Mr Isbester, he told him that they (the Southcombes) were extremely concerned about the non-return of money that they were supposed to be getting and that he (Mr Isbester) “had well over $200,000 of our money and we were getting it in dribs and drabs”. He said that he told Mr Isbester that he wanted to speak to Mr Agius.
	
	
	Following this, Mr Isbester said that he had a conversation with Mr Agius from his solicitor’s office. That conversation was recorded by the AFP. He said that during the conversation, he recalled Mr Agius saying that he would contact Mr Isbester and get back to him, but he did not. He said that he subsequently contacted Mr Agius on 31 March 2008, who said that he had met Mr Isbester on 29 March and that Mr Isbester had agreed to make payments but they would be only small. He said that he received one further hand over of money on 9 April 2008 in an amount of $5,000, which was handed over to the AFP.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Mr Southcombe affirmed that he received the Moore Stephens brochure at the first meeting. As with Ms Southcombe, it was suggested to him that this was not possible as the brochure referred to Mr Agius obtaining a Master of Business Administration degree, which was only obtained in 1999. Mr Southcombe said that notwithstanding, he and Ms Southcombe were given a document similar to that, even if it was not the same. He rejected the suggestion that the brochure was not supplied in 1998 but rather given to him later by Mr Daniel.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe said that he had never heard of, or had an interest in, a business called Moderne Art. He was shown the pro forma invoice from Billbury addressed to that company and stated that he did not know that it was found in his house or, if it was, how it got there.
	
	
	In cross-examination, it was suggested to Mr Southcombe that Mr Agius did not say that the loan would be forgiven or not enforced. He denied this.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe was also asked about the instructions given to Mr Hodges, to which I have referred in par [212] above. He said that he did not give those instructions but that he just gave a general instruction to assist the ATO and the AFP in their investigation and make full restitution of any monies owed to the ATO. He said that he did not recall giving any direction or instruction that the directors, accountants or liquidators had destroyed the company’s records. He could not offer any explanation as to why the Billbury invoices were not seized when the warrant was executed at his home. Mr Southcombe said that there could well have been destruction of documents following the liquidation of GBM because when the business was sold, his home was at the place of business and when they left the premises, they destroyed a lot of what they regarded as unwarranted or unnecessary records.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe acknowledged that he gave the Moore Stephen brochure to the AFP after it was kept in his home for about nine years. He stated that it appeared to be the same document that Mr Agius presented to him.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe rejected the suggestion that Mr Agius was not present at the meeting at the cafe at Hurstville.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe acknowledged in cross-examination that were it not for Mr Daniel, he would not have contemplated entering into the scheme and that he relied on Mr Daniel and his advice in relation to it.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe was asked in cross-examination about his concern in recovering the money. He said that he believed that the $900,000 used to pay out the loan was GBM’s money as there was no tax or financial benefit whatsoever. He rejected the proposition that the loan was legally binding, saying that he paid the fictitious loan because his wife was mentally unwell and the Southcombes were desperate to get out of the scheme and were told that this was the only way to do so. He accepted that the urgency attached to getting out of the scheme did not arise from any financial problem.
	
	
	In cross-examination by counsel for Ms Jandagi, Mr Southcombe said that it was made clear at various meetings at the office of OTD that he and Ms Southcombe wished to get out of the scheme and that they were told that no other clients had wanted to do that and that there was no exit strategy in place. He rejected the suggestion that Ms Jandagi did not tell him that one exit strategy was the use of a debit card.
	
	
	It was suggested to Mr Southcombe that it was not Mr Hagar who was with Ms Jandagi when the meeting at the cafe near OTD’s offices took place but rather Mr Zerafa. Mr Southcombe said that it was possible that Mr Zerafa was there, but Mr Hagar was also there.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr Zerafa cross-examined Mr Southcombe on the meeting in May 2005 which dealt with the exit strategy. He suggested that Mr Agius was not there but rather that the meeting involved Mr Zerafa and Ms Jandagi. Mr Southcombe said that he recalled Mr Agius being present.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe acknowledged that the scheme had been working efficiently throughout 1999 and 2000, in that payments had gone offshore and money had come back as a loan. He acknowledged that this continued in 2001, but notwithstanding, he and Ms Southcombe were not happy with the arrangement and had realised that they had made a mistake in becoming involved. He was asked why, if there was a letter forgiving the loan, he needed to embark on the process of paying it. He responded that that was what they were told to do. He said that he did not ever see a letter forgiving the loan but said that he was told about it by Ms Southcombe.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe agreed that the arrangement for being paid in cash by Mr Agius had been in existence prior to the May 2005 meeting. He denied that he went to some lengths not to tell the accountants at OTD about the amounts of cash which were received back from Mr Agius.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe denied that the arrangement in which cash was received back was a private arrangement between him, Mr Agius and Mr Isbester to get back significant quantities of cash, which he did not want to reveal with his accountants. He said that he was not aware that the arrangement with Mr Isbester was that there would be a payment from overseas into his business, Fit for a King. He said that all that he was told was that he was being given money by Mr Agius. He said that he did not know what Mr Isbester was doing with money which he received from Mr Agius which was not paid over to him. He was asked whether he was aware that what was occurring was simply a naked form of money laundering or washing money through Mr Isbester’s business. He repeated that all he was aware of was that Mr Isbester was a conduit through which Mr Agius was sending them money.
	
	
	Mr Southcombe denied that the reason he did not tell Ms Jandagi and Mr Zerafa about the cash system was because he knew that they would not approve of it. He agreed that he received over half a million dollars in cash.
	
	
	Finally, it was put to Mr Southcombe that he would not have entered into the arrangements if he thought they were dishonest. He responded that that was probably right.
	


d The evidence of Federal Agent Seidel


	
	Federal Agent Seidel gave evidence of surveillance operations carried out on meetings between Mr Southcombe and Mr Isbester. I have set out details of those meetings above, including Mr Southcombe’s evidence of intercepted telephone conversations. A number of those telephone conversations were between Mr Isbester and Mr Agius concerning transfers of funds. In addition, there was a conversation between Mr Isbester and Ms Southcombe of 18 December 2007, in which Ms Southcombe complained about Mr Isbester letting her down.
	
	
	The lawfully intercepted telephone recordings included a conversation between Mr Southcombe and Mr Agius on 28 March 2008, when Mr Southcombe complained to Mr Agius about the return of money from Mr Isbester. Mr Southcombe indicated to Mr Agius that some $209,000 had not been returned. Mr Agius said that he would discuss the matter with Mr Isbester, saying that all that he could do was to speak to him. Mr Southcombe was recorded as telling Mr Agius that the payments started off as being $30,000 to $40,000 at a time, and everything seemed to be going quite smoothly, but that after that, Mr Isbester broke commitments.
	


3 Tara

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	Ms McKenna, the sole director of Tara, engaged OTD to act for her and Tara as accountants and tax agents in 1997.
	
	
	It was acknowledged in the agreed statement of facts that Mr Agius was not involved in the preparation of unaudited accounts for Tara or in the preparation and lodgement of Tara’s or Ms McKenna’s income tax returns.
	
	
	Neither Ms McKenna nor Tara were involved in transfers of funds to or from New Zealand in the 1998 or 1999 financial years. However, $40,000 management and consulting expenses were claimed as a tax deduction for the 1998 financial year and $50,000 was claimed in respect of such expenses for the 1999 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2000 financial year, six transfers were made out of an account operated by Tara with the CBA (the Tara account) into the Billbury account, totalling $77,650. Some portion of these funds was then transferred into the Security Life account and subsequently, $68,830.89 was transferred back into the Tara account.
	
	
	The transfers out of the Tara account were recorded as management and consulting expenses. These expenses were claimed as a deduction in Tara’s tax return for the 2000 financial year.
	
	
	The money returned to the Tara account was recorded in the accounts as shareholders’ loans.
	
	
	In the 2001 financial year, there were three transactions out of the Tara account, all on the same day.
	
	
	The first of these transfers, an amount of $20,026.10, was paid into the Billbury account. The bulk of the funds were transferred into the Security Life account and, of these funds, in the 2002 financial year, $19,990 was paid into an account in the name of Ms McKenna with the CBA (the McKenna account). Of these funds, $12,500 was transferred back to the Tara account.
	
	
	The other two transfers were to the IFTC account and the Security Life account. No further transfers of these funds appears to have taken place during the financial year in question.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for Tara for the 2001 financial year, $60,000 was recorded under management and consulting fees, with a corresponding entry under other creditors. This $60,000 was claimed as a deduction by Tara in its tax return for the 2001 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2002 financial year, four transfers were made out of the Tara account into the Billbury account. The bulk of these funds was transferred into the Security Life account and then, with some adjustments, into the McKenna account. The total amount transferred out of the Tara account was $82,957.30 and the amount which flowed back to the McKenna account as a result of these transfers totalled $88,950. However, $6,542.54 was transferred from the McKenna account back into the Security Life account. Of the money transferred into the McKenna account from these transfers, $43,700 was transferred back to the Tara account.
	
	
	In the Tara unaudited accounts, the transfers out of the Tara account were recorded as management and consulting expenses. In respect of these amounts, $70,000 was claimed as a deduction in Tara’s 2002 tax return.
	
	
	The transfers from the McKenna account to the Tara account were described as shareholders’ loans.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, two transfers of $25,026.10 were made from the Tara account into the Billbury account. Of the first transfer, $22,119.54 was transferred to the Security Life account and $2,797.98 was transferred to the IFTC account. Of the second transfer, $24,908.25 was transferred to the Security Life account.
	
	
	In addition, a further transfer of $12,148.68 was made from the Tara account directly into the Security Life account. The bulk of the funds transferred into the Security Life account, with small deductions, was transferred into the McKenna account in the year in question. These transfers from the Security Life account to the McKenna account totalled $58,800. In the 2003 financial year, $18,000 was transferred back into the Tara account.
	
	
	In addition, Ms McKenna made a payment of $2,045.45 out of her MasterCard account to Mr Agius’ firm in Vanuatu.
	
	
	In that year, two of the outgoing transactions were recorded as management and consulting expenses. A tax deduction for $75,000 was claimed in respect of these expenses in the 2003 tax return lodged by Tara.
	
	
	The incoming payments from the McKenna account to the Tara account were recorded as a decrease in shareholders’ loans.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, two transactions were made from the Tara account into the Billbury account. The first of the transfers, with a small deduction, was paid into the Security Life account. The second transfer totalled $35,028. Of this amount, $32,273.83 was paid into the Security Life account and $2,602.74 was paid into the IFTC account. A third transfer of $19,917.46 was made by Tara directly into the Security Life account.
	
	
	The total amount received by Security Life as a result of these transfers was $82,083.71. Of this amount, $40,000 was transferred into the IFTC account, $10,000 into the McKenna account and $13,925 to the account of Ms Anne McKenna, Ms McKenna’s sister, a resident of the Republic of Ireland.
	
	
	In the same year, $40,000 was transferred from the IFTC account into the McKenna account.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, $15,000 was transferred from the McKenna account back into the Tara account.
	
	
	In that year, Ms McKenna also made three payments from her MasterCard account to Mr Agius’ firm in Vanuatu.
	
	
	No relevant tax deductions were claimed in the 2004 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2005 financial year, two transfers, totalling $51,656, were made out of the Tara account into the Billbury account. From this account, $4,230.13 was transferred into the IFTC account and $46,710.66 was transferred into the Security Life account. From the Security Life account, $47,700 was transferred into the McKenna account and $16,025 was transferred to another Irish relative of Ms McKenna, a Ms Deidre McKenna.
	
	
	In the 2005 financial year, $20,000 was transferred from the McKenna account back into the Tara account.
	
	
	No relevant tax deduction was claimed in the 2005 financial year. The incoming payment from the McKenna account to the Tara account was recorded as a decrease in shareholder’s liability to Tara.
	


b The evidence of Ms Margaret ‘Colette’ McKenna


	
	Ms McKenna gave evidence that she was the sole director, secretary and shareholder of Tara.
	
	
	Ms McKenna stated that she first went to OTD in late 1998, where she met Mr Daniel and Mr Zerafa. Ms McKenna said that at the first meeting that she had with Mr Daniel and Mr Zerafa, she asked them how she could reduce her tax and Mr Daniel drew a diagram of the way she could do so. She was shown a diagram and she identified it as the diagram Mr Daniel drew up for her when he was describing how she could reduce tax and the way he was going to set things up. She referred to the words “your company” in the box in the middle of the diagram and pointed to references to “UK”, “US” and “Van”. She said that “Van” stood for Vanuatu. She said that as Mr Daniel drew the diagram, he explained that with various different invoices, it was possible to send money overseas and, in that way, to reduce tax.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that Mr Daniel explained how the scheme was supposed to work, but that she never really understood what it was about. She said that he assured her that “everything was above board, that it was clearly legal and that the tax office knew about the way this actually worked”. She said that at a subsequent meeting, held only between her and Mr Zerafa, Mr Zerafa mentioned a Lebanese man that the ATO had audited and found did not have to pay any extra tax.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that at the first meeting, she was told that Mr Agius was involved and ran the scheme out of Vanuatu. She was told that Mr Agius was Australian and would not do anything illegal because he came in and out of the country on business quite frequently and came over for the rugby season.
	
	
	She subsequently clarified her evidence by saying that the time at which the diagram was drawn up was at the second meeting that she had at OTD.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was referred to the diagram and to the amount of $8,000 appearing alongside the box “Van”. She said that she thought that the amount of $8,000 was set up costs, stating that she believed that she was told that by Mr Daniel.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that after the meeting at which the diagram was drawn, she agreed to go ahead and she had another meeting with Mr Zerafa who explained the documentation that needed to be put in place. She said that she thought that she missed a lot of what they explained because she did not realise they had to set up a company in Vanuatu, which Mr Zerafa did.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that at that meeting with Mr Zerafa, she was shown a loan document from another company to indicate the way that the scheme would be set up. She remembered that the loan document was for $1 million and she was told that the loan was to enable funds to be returned to Australia into either Tara’s bank account or her own account.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown a facsimile dated 9 July 1999 from Mr Zerafa marked for the attention of Mr Agius which commenced “A client by the name of Tara Consulting Pty Limited would like to have set up an offshore company and loan facility. Could you please arrange for this and have all documents sent to our office. We would also like a facility to set [sic] as a personal loan to the sole director/shareholder (Colette McKenna).”
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she did not know that this communication had been sent, nor did she know that the new company would be called Network Industries Pty Ltd (Network Industries).
	
	
	Ms McKenna was referred to the statement in the facsimile that “$40,000 overseas creditors have been included in the 1997/98 accounts” and that invoices for this amount needed to be issued on a quarterly basis. She said that in July 1999, she did not know anything about the details of any invoices or amounts necessary for her to be in the scheme.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she told Mr Zerafa that she did not mind what the company which was to be set up for her was to be called. She said that Mr Zerafa came up with the name Capel Holdings. She said that she became aware that a company named Capel Holdings Pty Ltd had been incorporated overseas, although she was not aware of that at the time. She was not aware of a company called Network Industries being incorporated.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown an email from Mr Zerafa to her dated 21 July 1999 indicating that the Billbury account was the account to which funds should be transferred and stating that the initial amount to be transferred was $15,000, which she may now transfer, and that there would be two further transfers of $12,500. The email stated that she should advise Mr Agius when the transfer had been completed. She said that she thought Billbury was the company set up in England for management fees. She said that she was told that either by Mr Daniel or Mr Zerafa. She said she transferred the initial amount of $15,000 and the two subsequent transfers of $12,500. She said that she was aware the Billbury bank account was in New Zealand.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown a letter to her from Security Life dated 30 July 1999 relating to a one million dollar loan facility. She stated that she did not receive the documents enclosed with that letter.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she recalled the company IFTC. She said that they sent her bills, which she paid, and she identified IFTC invoices, which she said were the $8,000 set up fees to set up the scheme.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was referred to an Australian dollar facility agreement with Security Life dated 30 July 1999, which she acknowledged was signed by her. She said that it was signed by her in 2004 after the tax audit of Tara had started. She was asked if she received any money from Security Life and she said that she received money back from IFTC, but some of the transfers may have had Security Life on them. She said that she never met any person from Security Life.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that her understanding of the loan facility agreement was that it was required for the tax audit. She said that she knew that there was a loan involved, but said that she thought that Mr Daniel and Mr Zerafa were setting up something which was within the tax laws. She said that she never received the loan or ever worked out for herself how much the repayments should be, saying that Mr Zerafa told her how much was needed to be transferred for the year.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she became aware that the company Capel Holdings was going to be set up in about 1999. She said that she was not given a reason why that company was being set up. She said that she was charged fees in addition to the $8,000 setup fees in respect of Capel Holdings.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she had a motor vehicle accident in August 2000 and for at least a year after that, she did not send any money overseas. She said that after that period, Mr Zerafa told her that she needed to continue making overseas payments. She said that from that period, she was told the total amount to be paid each year, which was around $50,000 to $70,000 in some years. She said that depending on her cash flow position she decided the amount of individual payments, to make up a particular total.
	
	
	Ms McKenna indicated that when making the individual instalments she wanted to get them back as soon as possible. She said that the money usually came back to her personally by payment into her bank account.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that at some point, she became aware, from Mr Zerafa, that the ATO wanted to conduct an interview about Tara. She said that before the ATO interview, she was approached by Mr Daniel with a brochure to do with PKF Vanuatu. She said that Mr Daniel told her that if anything was asked about the scheme, she was to say that she got the brochure on a plane and that Mr Agius had set it up for her. She said that this was untrue, she had not got a brochure and had never been to Vanuatu. She said that before that time, she had never heard of PKF Vanuatu.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that up to that time, as far as she was concerned, Mr Agius had not been her contact for Billbury, but rather it had been Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	In relation to the interview with the ATO, she said that she was asked how she first came to be involved with Billbury and she said that she told the tax officer, untruthfully, that she had heard about it from England. She said that she that was not asked anything about Vanuatu.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that it was after that meeting that the loan document with Security Nominees was produced for her to sign and invoices were generated to support the management funds. She identified the loan facility agreement dated 30 July 1999 as the one provided to her to sign and said that she left it with Mr Zerafa. She said that no one else apart from Mr Zerafa was present when she signed it.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was asked about the services said to be provided to Tara in the Billbury invoices. She said that in effect, none of those services were provided, saying that she first saw the invoices in 2004.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she was asked by Mr Zerafa to write a document to support the proposition that Billbury had provided her with services. She was shown a document entitled “IP Multicast Design and Addressing Report” which stated “Prepared by Billbury Ltd for Tara Consulting Pty Ltd”. She said that it was not prepared by Billbury, but it was prepared by her. She said that she gave the document to Mr Zerafa. She said that a revised version was probably given to him in or around October 2004 and that the ATO had it at the second meeting which took place with her.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that she met Mr Agius in 2005. She said that she believed the meeting took place after the second tax audit meeting. She said that she recalled that Mr Zerafa had said that Mr Agius would be able to assist with the audit and explain tax matters and things of that nature.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that Mr Zerafa and Mr Daniel were at the meeting that she had with Mr Agius. She said that she ended up confused at that meeting because Mr Agius did not give her any tax advice regarding the audit. She said that he was “rather aggressive and wanted an invoice paid”. She said that she did not know why he wanted an invoice paid because as far as she knew, she did not owe any money. The invoice was for approximately $4,000. She said that previous to that, she had transferred money and $4,000 had been taken out as fees before the money came back.
	
	
	She said that Mr Agius had a paper invoice at the meeting and the name on the invoice was “International Finance”.
	
	
	Ms McKenna said that the upshot of the meeting was that she said that she was not paying the invoice because she did know why she had to.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was then asked about a number of invoices from Security Life, which she said she paid. She denied, however, that she had a loan of $1 million from that company. She stated that the funds she paid out to Billbury in New Zealand came back from Security Life into her account.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was asked about the MasterCard payments referred to in the agreed statement of facts (see pars [285], [292] above). She said that she made those payments as a result of being sent a credit card authorisation form. She said that the forms came from IFTC. She said that she dealt with Ms Fawcett through IFTC, but did not deal with anybody at Moore Stephens itself.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown a letter from Billbury addressed to the directors of Tara confirming the valued consultancy agreement. She said that she never made a request to Billbury for the services described in the letter and never requested that a letter of that nature be sent to her. She said that she did not think that the letter was ever actually sent to her.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was also shown a consultancy agreement between Tara and Billbury, which she acknowledged she had signed. She said that she signed it at the same time as she signed the loan agreement with Security Life. She said that Billbury did not provide Tara with any of the services described in the consultancy agreement.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown two other consultancy agreements, one commencing on 1 July 2000 and the other on 1 July 2001. She recalled that she got them all at the same time from Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	So far as Capel Holdings was concerned, Ms McKenna was referred to an email of 12 May 2005, enclosing an invoice for renewal fees and stating that if she wished to maintain registration of the company, she needed to let IFTC know by 30 June 2005. She said that she did not keep the company registered in Vanuatu. She said that she never understood the connection that she had with Capel Holdings.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown a notice of demand from Security Life, demanding $58,033.15 for outstanding loan monies including interest. She said that as far as she was concerned, she did not owe Security Life any money and she gave the document to her lawyer.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was shown a letter dated 27 July 2004, addressed to a Mr Walter Vun, a special investigator with the ATO, and signed by her. The letter gave details of the Security Life loan and interest payments made and stated that the facility was arranged by Mr Agius, a partner of Moore Stephens. She said that Mr Zerafa prepared the letter. In his evidence, Mr Zerafa said that the letter was drafted by Mr Daniel. In cross-examination, he stated that it was correct, in his understanding, that Mr Agius arranged the facility.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Ms McKenna acknowledged that she only saw Mr Agius once and that was in 2005. She acknowledged that he did not give her any advice about tax matters.
	
	
	Ms McKenna acknowledged that in the financial year ending 30 June 1998, she made a false claim for a deduction of $40,000. She admitted that she sent no money overseas in that year. She rejected the proposition that her 1998 tax return was lodged before her meeting with Mr Daniel.
	
	
	Ms McKenna acknowledged that she also made a false claim for a deduction in the 1999 financial year in the sum of $50,000. Again, she admitted that she did not send that money overseas and she said that she did not understand it “that’s the way Kevin [Mr Zerafa] did the books”.
	
	
	Ms McKenna acknowledged that she was very much influenced by Mr Daniel and Mr Zerafa over the years. She was referred to her evidence concerning Mr Daniel drawing a diagram and acknowledged that in her statement to the AFP, she made no mention of Mr Agius.
	
	
	It was put to her that the first time that Mr Agius’ name appeared in a statement was in her statement to the police on 20 April 2010, in which she said that Mr Daniel told her that “Robert Agius set up the scheme and he runs it from Vanuatu.” She did not have an answer as to why she did not include that in her former statements. She denied that it was to try and get herself out of trouble, although she acknowledged that it was after she gave an undertaking to assist the AFP.
	
	
	Ms McKenna acknowledged that Mr Daniel asked her to lie about the origin of the tax scheme and Mr Agius’ involvement. She was referred to her answer in her examination that Mr Daniel told her to say that she got the brochure on a plane and that Robert Agius had set it up for her and that, in fact, she had not got a brochure and had never been to Vanuatu.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was cross-examined on the fact that there was a false loan document which was backdated and signed by her, a false technical report which was prepared by her and a request by Mr Daniel to tell lies about Mr Agius. She acknowledged that the Security Life loan agreement was prepared for the purpose of the tax audit, saying that it was given to her to sign by Mr Zerafa. She acknowledged that its purpose was to mislead the tax investigators. She was then asked whether this was designed to deflect attention from OTD and she said she would take the cross-examiner’s word for it. She agreed that she was being asked to lie about Mr Agius in order to advance Mr Daniel’s position with the tax office.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was asked about the Billbury invoices. She said that she saw a few of them in 2000 and a lot more of them in 2004. She acknowledged that on each occasion, they were given to her by Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	Finally, in cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Ms McKenna again acknowledged that she entered into the transactions because she trusted Mr Daniel and acted on his advice. She agreed that she was asked to lie about Mr Agius in relation to her receipt of the brochure and contact with Billbury.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Zerafa, Ms McKenna was referred to a letter addressed to her dated 18 August 1999 from OTD, enclosing a letter of offer relating to the $1 million loan facility. She was asked whether Mr Daniel sent her that document on 18 August 1999. She stated that the only document she remembered was the one from 2004, which she signed. It was put to her that it was possible that Mr Daniel sent a copy of the letter to her earlier and asked her to sign it and she had not done so. She responded that she did not remember.
	
	
	She was further asked whether the loan agreement came to her and her accountant’s attention at the time of the audits in 2004 and 2005 and had not been signed and she was asked to sign it. She stated that she remembered signing it in 2004. She did not know whether the signature “F McConachie” was on the document when she signed it and accepted that it was possible that the signature was there since the document was first produced in 1999.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was asked further questions about the involvement of Mr Daniel. She said that he explained the scheme to her originally but, after that, she dealt with Mr Zerafa, although Mr Daniel came to the second audit meeting.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was asked further questions about the diagram that she had said Mr Daniel drew for her at the meeting at the end of 1998. Referring to the diagram, she said that she understood that in the centre of it there was a reference to Tara and that funds headed to New Zealand and then travelled to Vanuatu and then the United States. She said that the reference to Vanuatu was not there because of the involvement of a Vanuatuan entity, but because they (presumably Mr Daniel) mentioned Vanuatu and spoke about Mr Agius. She said that she did not understand from the outset that a company in Vanuatu would be set up.
	
	
	Ms McKenna agreed that it was possible that on 1 March 1999, she attended a meeting with Mr Daniel and Mr Zerafa for the purpose of finalising the tax returns and accounts for Tara for the 1998 financial year. She said that she could not guarantee the date, although she knew that she had a meeting with Mr Zerafa and Mr Daniel where Mr Daniel explained the diagram.
	
	
	Ms McKenna was further cross-examined about the meeting that she had with Mr Agius in December 2005 at which he demanded that some outstanding invoices be paid. She said that she thought that she went to the interview to get tax advice, but she did not receive any. She said that she did not know what the invoices were for and she did not pay any more of them.
	


c The evidence of Mr Michael Dalby


	
	Mr Michael Dalby (Mr Dalby) was a retired taxation officer who, at the time of his employment with the ATO, was allocated to the tax audit of Tara and Ms McKenna. He said that on 28 October 2004, he received material from Mr Zerafa in connection with the audit. That material provided details of Billbury, including an address at Bath Avon in England with a contact, Simon Agius.
	
	
	Mr Dalby stated that in the second audit interview with Ms McKenna on 22 March 2005, he asked Ms McKenna how she came to get invoices from Billbury. He said that she stated that she had heard about that company by word of mouth and that she had never visited their office in Bath. She said that she had always dealt with Mr Agius and had not used Billbury as an advisor until she came to Australia.
	
	
	Mr Dalby said that at the audit meeting, he asked Ms McKenna about the deposits in her personal bank accounts from IFTC, which roughly equalled the Tara payments to Billbury. He stated that she said that this was arranged by Mr Agius and she paid interest to Security Life.
	


4 Kylood and Hilisa

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	Mr Hili was the director of both Kylood and Hilisa.
	
	
	OTD were the accountants and tax agents for Kylood and Hilisa. The retainer by which OTD was engaged included the preparation of unaudited accounts and the preparation and lodgement of tax returns for each company.
	
	
	Mr Agius was not involved in the preparation of the unaudited accounts or the preparation and lodgement of the tax returns for each company.
	
	
	In 2001, neither Kylood nor Hilisa participated in transactions involving any flow of funds between Australia and New Zealand. However, the Kylood unaudited accounts recorded $220,000 as accrued management and consulting fees. This formed part of the deductible expenses claimed in that company’s tax return for the 2001 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2002 financial year, eleven transfers were made out of an account operated by Kylood with the NAB (the Kylood account) to a New Zealand account with the ANZ Bank in the name of Centurion Technology and Marketing Inc (Centurion) (the Centurion account). The total value of the transfers was $460,275. Of this amount, $4,876 was transferred into the IFTC account, while $454,237.12 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account. Of this latter amount, $446,075 was transferred into an account with the NAB in the name of Mr Hili (the A Hili account). From this account, $448,200 was transferred back to the Kylood account. The reason for a greater amount being transferred out of the A Hili account into the Kylood account than had flowed into the A Hili account from the Edgecumbe account was not explained in the agreed statement of facts.
	
	
	The unaudited accounts for the 2002 financial year recorded a figure of $255,000 as management and consulting fees. This was made up of $430,000, representing the total of the outgoing payments from the Kylood account, plus a fee of $45,000, less $220,000, being the reversal of the accrued management and consulting fees shown in the 2001 accounts indicating that fees of $220,000 had been paid.
	
	
	The unaudited accounts also referred to the amount of $7,851.97 as interest paid on a loan. This amount was recorded under shareholders’ loans.
	
	
	The amounts of $255,000 and $7,851.97 were claimed as deductions in the Kylood 2002 tax return.
	
	
	The transfers into the Kylood account, with one exception, were recorded under shareholders’ loans.
	
	
	It should be noted that although Hilisa did not participate in any similar transactions in the year in question, its accounts recorded the sum of $55,000 as management and consulting fees. This amount was claimed as a tax deduction in Hilisa’s tax return for the 2002 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, Kylood made one transfer of $45,025 to the Centurion account. Subject to a small deduction, this amount was transferred to the Edgecumbe account, and then, subject to another small deduction, to the A Hili account.
	
	
	Hilisa operated an account with the NAB (the Hilisa account). In the 2003 financial year, two transfers were made out of this account into the Centurion account, which, subject to small deductions, were subsequently transferred into the Edgecumbe account and then the A Hili account. In addition, one transfer of $7,097.71 was made from the Hilisa account directly into the Edgecumbe account. Subject to a small deduction, this amount was then transferred into the A Hili account.
	
	
	The total amount received by A Hili account as a result of these transfers was $96,450. Subsequently, in the 2002 financial year, $110,000 was transferred form the A Hili account into the Hilisa account.
	
	
	In that year, $2,050.17 was also transferred from the Hilisa account into the IFTC account.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts of Hilisa for the 2003 financial year, $65,000 was recorded as management and consulting fees. The unaudited accounts also recorded the $7,091.71, the subject of the direct transfer to the Edgecumbe account (less a bank fee), as interest. Each of the management and consulting fees and the interest payment were claimed as deductible expenses in the Hilisa tax return for the 2003 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, a single transfer of $5,500 was made from the Hilisa account to the IFTC account. There were no relevant tax consequences in that year.
	


b The evidence of Mr Anthony Joseph Luis Hili


	
	Mr Hili gave evidence that from about 26 November 1987, he operated Kylood. He agreed that the company was deregistered in February 2003 but before that, he had caused Hilisa to be incorporated on 15 January 2002.
	
	
	Mr Hili indicated that the Kylood’s business was, among other things, a contract painting company and that he also had involvement in a company named Comex Building Pty Ltd (Comex), together with Mr Jones. He said that Mr Jones was also a director of that company, as was a Mr Bennett.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that when Comex was trading, it was trading in the building construction field. He said that Hilisa was still operating.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he started to use OTD as accountants in about 1981. He said that he met a Mr Daniel and, from the early 1980s through to the end of that decade, Mr Daniel worked for him and his companies. He said that he did not get business advice from Mr Daniel in that period.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he continued to use OTD throughout the 1990’s. He agreed that in 1997, and other years, there was a general period of the year when he went to OTD for the purpose of having the annual tax returns prepared.
	
	
	Mr Hili agreed that in early 1997, and on other occasions, he raised the subject of the amount of tax he was paying. He recalled that Mr Daniel told him about the idea of using an offshore entity to “kind of send money overseas and reduce your tax liability in that way.” He said that there was a general discussion as to where the money was to be sent, saying that it may be Ireland or New Zealand or maybe Vanuatu.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that this proposal was raised with him in 1997 and that he was not interested. He said that he recalled that Mr Daniel drew a rough diagram and said, indicating to the diagram, “you send the money here to New Zealand it will go here and then there and then back to Australia”. He said that he did not go into the arrangement at that stage because he did not quite understand it and if he did not understand a matter he normally did not sign up for it.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that Mr Daniel raised the same proposal in 1998 and he rejected it again.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that in 1998 or 1999, he introduced Mr Jones to Mr Daniel at a meeting at which there was a discussion about tax arrangements. He said that at that meeting, Mr Daniel put forward the same proposal.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he recalled that at that meeting, Mr Jones asked about the legality of the scheme asking, “Is it legal? What if we get audited”. He said that Mr Daniel was very confident, saying, “No worries, if we get audited we’ve got all of the documentation”. He said that Mr Daniel said that he had documentation to back up the scheme so “if we were looked at it was all kosher”. Mr Hili said that by the end of that meeting, his understanding of the scheme was that “we would send some money to New Zealand and later it would come back”. He said that he thought the money being sent to New Zealand was “like a loan or something” and that the money sent over was interest on the loan. He stated that that was all he could really remember. He said that the way they understood it was that “we had a loan for a million dollars or whatever overseas and we were paying interest on the loan and it’s like a tax deduction, something like that”.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that after the meeting he, Mr Jones and their co-director in Comex, Mr Bennett, agreed to go into the scheme. He said that after that, he recalled Mr Daniel telling Mr Zerafa and Ms Abibadra that he and Mr Jones would join the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that thereafter, he thought that Ms Abibadra contacted him by phone and said that he, Mr Jones and Mr Bennett had to come in to sign some paperwork. He said that a week or so thereafter, they attended the office of OTD and saw either Mr Daniel or Ms Abibadra. He was asked to recall what the paperwork was and said that it was “stuff to do with the scheme”. He said that each of them had their own individual offshore companies and they had to sign something to do with that and to do with the offshore loan. He stated that at the time, he understood that the purpose of the overseas companies was to facilitate the transfer of funds. He said that he did not read the documents, he trusted Mr Daniel and he signed them. He said that either Mr Daniel or Ms Abibadra said that they would be in touch with an amount to send, that Mr Daniel would come up with a figure and someone would ring on his behalf.
	
	
	Mr Hili agreed that the essence of what was said was that the money would be sent from his company’s account to an overseas company’s account and he would get a company tax deduction. Then, the money would come back to him and be paid into his personal account in the form of a loan, so he would not have to pay tax on it. He said that if it was Ms Abibadra who gave him the papers to sign, then she said something along those lines.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that a couple of weeks thereafter, Ms Abibadra rang him on his mobile and told him a figure to send, an account number and a reference number. He said that from memory, the amount was a high figure and he told Ms Abibadra that he did not have that amount of money, saying, “that’s too much in one hit” and she told him that he could send it in smaller amounts.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he wrote the details on a business card. He was shown the business card, which had a figure of $30,000 on it. He said that he could not say specifically that someone said that he should send $30,000, but he may have offered to send that amount. He said that he thought the original amount was a lot more than that but he said he could send $30,000 at a time.
	
	
	Mr Hili identified the bank account that he wrote on the business card as the ANZ Bank, Auckland, New Zealand, Centurion Technology and Marketing Inc. He confirmed that that this information was given to him by Ms Abibadra.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that after the phone conversation, he would have sent the money out of the Kylood account. He said that he gave the details of his personal account to OTD, likely to Ms Abibadra.
	
	
	Mr Hili was asked again about the conversation that he had with Ms Abibadra and noted that it was ten years ago, but he did remember that the amount he had to send over was too large and he could not send it over in one hit. He stated that someone told him “Yeah, you can just, so long as it adds up to that figure so you can send over what you want but you wouldn’t want to send over five grand at a time, it would take you too long. You’d have to be there every week sending money over”. He said that he sent the money over in $25,000 or $30,000 lots. He said that he was told that he could do that as long as it added up to $150,000 or $200,000, whatever it was at the time.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that when he first sent monies overseas, he did not have any idea of who Centurion was. He said that he had no idea what it did and it had never supplied Kylood, Hilisa or him with any products or services. He said that Centurion was his offshore entity, so it could not have given any services per se. He said that he assumed that it was located in New Zealand, but he was never told by anyone at OTD what function Centurion carried out.
	
	
	In relation to the $30,000 that Mr Hili caused to be paid overseas, he said that he transferred that amount from his personal account to his company account, and then it went offshore, and that was the reason it came back into his personal account.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he recalled IFTC, saying that he got bills from them which he paid. He said that he heard about Edgecumbe Finance at about the same time as he heard of IFTC, saying that he probably received a bill or correspondence from them. He said that initially, he did not know why IFTC was billing Kylood.
	
	
	It was drawn to Mr Hili’s attention that Kylood sent $460,000 overseas between 15 January and 19 June 2002. He said that he must have been told to send that amount by Ms Abibadra, as the money dealings were initially with her.
	
	
	Mr Hili confirmed that in 2002, all of the payments came out of Kylood, but by 2003, there were some payments out of Hilisa.
	
	
	Mr Hili was asked about the $220,000 management and consulting fee disclosed in the income and expense statement for Kylood for the 2001 financial year. He said that it had something to do with the scheme and that none of his companies received any management and consulting services from overseas. Mr Hili was asked whether he knew, when he and his company were involved in the scheme, that the year by year totalling of overseas expenses would end in the Kylood tax return for each year as a deductible expense. He said that he knew this in the first instance, but he did not know that they were spread over a couple of tax periods, because he only sent the money over in one year period. He then stated that he knew that part of the overseas payments ended up as deductible expenses for the 2003 financial year. He subsequently stated that he did not know who made the decision as to how the total of overseas payments would be divided up into different yearly tax returns.
	
	
	Mr Hili was shown a guarantee and indemnity dated 15 January 2002 in favour of Edgecumbe Finance. He stated that he may have signed it, but that he would not have read it in its entirety. He said that he did not have any knowledge at the time of the reason he would be giving a guarantee and indemnity to Edgecumbe Finance. He said that it all had to do with the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he recalled going to the OTD office with Mr Jones and signing some documents. He said that Mr Daniel was probably there at the time and possibly also Mr Zerafa. He was asked whether he knew why he or his companies were paying money to Edgecumbe Finance, which was recorded as interest payments. He said that it all had to do with the scheme but he did not know how it affected the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Hili was taken to the ledger report for Kylood for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002. He was directed to amounts of $30,025 shown on the ledger alongside the name Billbury. He said that this had something to do with the scheme and that Billbury was an offshore entity. He did not know how Billbury fitted into the scheme and said that he could not remember if he received any invoices from that company. He agreed that none of his companies ever made any payments to Billbury.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that he never had any contact or discussion with persons outside of Australia in connection with the scheme. He said that IFTC would have got his bank details from the offices of OTD because the money was to be returned into his account. He said that he only heard the name IFTC later in the scheme’s years.
	
	
	Mr Hili was referred to documents from Edgecumbe Finance recording loan drawdowns. He said that he never got the money the subject of these loan drawdowns, that he did not owe Edgecumbe Finance $1 million and that this was all part of the scheme. Mr Hili was shown a statement from Edgecumbe Finance dated 30 June 2003 addressed to him claiming interest payable of $47,121.72 for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. He said that neither he nor his companies paid that bill. He said that although he knew that monies came back into his personal account, he did not know they came from Edgecumbe Finance, just that the money had come back. Mr Hili was also shown an invoice from Edgecumbe Finance dated 30 June 2004 claiming interest due for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. He said that if he was asked the same questions about that invoice as he was for the invoice for the previous year, his answers would be the same.
	
	
	Mr Hili was shown a document dated 17 September 2003 headed “Message 0503”, expressed to be “from Kevin … To Mike”, inquiring of Mike whether he had printed out the Centurion invoice for Kylood. Mr Hili said that he did not know who Mike was and he had no knowledge of what the Centurion invoice related to. The document in question was apparently retrieved from the office of OTD.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that in about mid-2004, he and Mr Jones had a discussion about their continued involvement in the scheme. He said that they had received a letter from the ATO asking to explain a few things and they thought that they would try to fix it up. He said that his and Mr Jones’ initial response was to tell Mr Daniel that they did not want to be in the scheme anymore and whatever they had done had to be fixed up, “like reverse it or whatever”. He said that they gave Mr Daniel this instruction at a meeting at the OTD office at which Mr Daniel, and possibly Mr Zerafa, was present.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that at the meeting, he told Mr Daniel that they did not want to be in the scheme anymore and “that it looks really bodgie”. He said that he told Mr Daniel to get them out. He said that at the time, he and Mr Jones needed to ascertain their tax position and the amounts which had been given to them. He said that either Mr Daniel or Mr Zerafa said that if he got out of the scheme, he would have to pay a lot of tax. He said that the amount was $150,000 or something. Mr Hili said that Mr Jones did not say very much but rather let him do the talking.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that no explanation was given to him as to why he would be up for a lot of tax if he got out of the scheme. He was shown a document in his handwriting and identified that as notes he took of the amounts he was told at the meeting. The document showed figures alongside Comex, Hilisia/Hili and Jeiss/Jones of $55,000, $44,000 and $45,000, respectively, totalling $144,000. He said that those figures were given to him by either Mr Daniel or Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that at the end of the meeting, both he and Mr Jones wanted out of the scheme. He said that as far as he knew, nothing was done subsequent to the meeting to get them out.
	
	
	Mr Hili was shown a draft letter to a Mr Abdo Dirani (Mr Dirani) of the ATO dated 28 October 2004, a further draft of the same day and a letter written to Mr Dirani on that day. He said that the second draft was prepared by him and had the words “Attention: Kevin Zerafa” written on it because he wanted Mr Zerafa to look at it. He said that he would probably have faxed it to OTD’s office and then sent it off to the ATO. The letter denied any offshore dealings in Vanuatu or otherwise. Mr Hili said that he regarded the statements that he had no offshore assets and was not a shareholder in any international business companies as accurate, although he recognised that he may have been a director of a company in Vanuatu.
	
	
	Mr Hili was referred to a letter written by him to Mr Dirani of the ATO on 17 April 2004. The letter enclosed what were described as personal guarantee documents for security against his loan with Edgecumbe Finance. He said that the letter was not drafted by him and that at the time it was written, he did not consider that he had any genuine loan from Edgecumbe Finance. He was also asked about his answer to the question about the advantages in using Edgecumbe Finance instead of an Australian bank. His response was that it was very difficult to obtain development funds for builders from Australian banks as they required property assets over which to take a first mortgage over and Edgecumbe Finance did not. He said that this answer was untrue.
	
	
	Mr Hili also said that the statement in the letter that he had had discussions in Sydney with Mr Agius, a partner in Moore Stephens, who said that he could arrange offshore finance using personal guarantees, was also untrue. He said that at the time of writing the letter, he had not met Mr Agius nor, to his knowledge, had Mr Jones.
	
	
	Mr Hili said that near the end of November 2006, he was contacted by someone from OTD to attend a meeting. He said that he went with Mr Jones and, from memory, they met Mr Zerafa and Ms Abibadra. He said the meeting was something to do with a raid carried out by the AFP. He said that his recollection was that Mr Zerafa may have said that. He said that he learnt that some of his files had been taken, Mr Hili asked whether it had anything to do with the Vanuatu scheme and this question was not answered. He said that there was no reference to the scheme at the meeting and that he mentioned the scheme, but Mr Zerafa and Ms Abibadra did not say anything about the scheme, “like there was no scheme”. He said that Mr Zerafa said that maybe he or Mr Jones should take legal advice. He said that Ms Abibadra may have said that she did not know much about the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Hili was then asked to refresh his recollection by reference to a statement he had made to the AFP in November 2008. He then said that although it was a long time ago, he recalled Mr Zerafa saying “Its Owen’s fault”. He said that he might have asked, “What did they take? Have we got something to be worried about”, and was told, “Better just get legal advice”. He said that the statement assisted him in recalling that Mr Jones said “Do we need to be worried at all”. He also recalled Mr Jones asking Mr Zerafa whether he was serious or not when he said that they were okay with the tax department, because all of this related back to the tax department. He said that his recollection was that Mr Zerafa did not say anything in response.
	
	
	Mr Hili was referred to a notice of demand from Edgecumbe Finance dated 2 May 2007, demanding payment of $106,576.18. He said that when he received it, he referred it to one of his solicitors and did not pay the amount demanded.
	
	
	Mr Hili was shown an email from Mr Agius to his solicitor, a Ms Felicity Black, dated 7 May 2007, apparently written in connection with the notice of demand. The email, which is indicative of the involvement of Mr Agius in the scheme, is in the following terms:
	


“I have been asked by Edgecumbe Finance and International Finance Trust Co to handle this matter. I am carrying out this assignment for a fee. There is a letter of explanation being drafted at the moment explaining the position of Edgecumbe. Needless to say at this stage there is no record of any correspondence from either gentleman that they wished to change any arrangements. So as to make the letter complete and give the full position and background if this letter or any correspondence exists, please send a copy by return to me. In any case unless your firm is willing to come to some arrangement to pay outstanding debts and loans then I have been advised correspondence and debt collection procedures against the two gentlemen will continue. I find it amusing to that extreme that you feel that your clients can just walk away from legal obligations that they agreed and signed up for. There are ways of dealing with this matter, but to pretend they do not exist is not one that anyone, especially you as a lawyer, should contemplate. Kind Regards, Robert Agius.”


	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Mr Hili again acknowledged that the statement in his letter of 7 April 2004, that he had discussions with Mr Agius who said that he could obtain offshore finance using personal guarantees, was entirely false and that this statement had moved to a more prominent position in the letter than where it appeared in the draft.
	
	
	Mr Hili agreed in cross-examination that Mr Daniel had actively promoted the tax minimisation plan on four occasions. He agreed that $220,000 was claimed by Kylood in 2001 as a tax deduction, although transfers of money overseas did not begin until 15 January 2002. In those circumstances, he agreed that the process appeared to be that someone at OTD would record a false expense in the company’s books and after, that money would be transferred overseas.
	
	
	In cross-examination by counsel for Ms Abibadra, Mr Hili acknowledged that he had always found Mr Daniel to be a good and capable accountant and that he was comfortable with Mr Daniel looking after his taxation affairs. He acknowledged that as far as he was concerned, Ms Abibadra did not do his taxation work.
	
	
	Mr Hili acknowledged that it was fair to say that he did not really understand what was being proposed at meetings. He understood Centurion to be a company that was not his personal entity, but was “my contact over in New Zealand”. He did not know why another company, Miyuki Enterprises Pty Ltd, was set up, although he had a rough idea after the court case.
	
	
	Mr Hili acknowledged that Mr Daniel appeared very enthusiastic about the offshore arrangements and alluded to the fact that “it was the done thing and it was fine.” He said that he took that as meaning that the scheme was legal.
	
	
	Mr Hili agreed that a number of the transfers to the New Zealand account were made on the instructions of, or after discussions with Ms Lynda Meek, another employee of OTD, rather than Ms Abibadra. He accepted that in relation to the first deduction of $220,000, there was no money transferred. However, he denied the suggestion that Mr Daniel explained that such a deduction could be obtained, even though no money had been transferred.
	
	
	Mr Hili agreed that it was likely that the guarantee of the loan from Edgecumbe Finance was presented to him for his signature at the same time that he signed the tax return for 2001. In respect of the $220,000, Mr Hili agreed with the suggestion that it was recorded as an accrued liability for the 2001 financial year and paid in the subsequent year.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Zerafa, Mr Hili denied that he was told that neither Mr Daniel nor Mr Zerafa knew what had to be done overseas to get out of the scheme or that there was a proposal that he would meet with Mr Agius to consult with him as to what was needed to be done to get out of the scheme. He agreed, however, that when he told Mr Zerafa and Mr Daniel that he wanted to get out of the scheme, there was no opposition from either of them.
	
	
	Mr Hili denied that he believed that the legal obligations which he had purportedly entered into were binding and effective. He stated that the transactions were a sham from the beginning to the end. He said that if the arrangement with Edgecumbe Finance was a loan facility, he would have received a loan and he did not receive one. He denied that he drew down any funds.
	
	
	Mr Hili acknowledged that when he was told by Mr Zerafa to seek legal advice, he was not given any instructions as to what to say to his lawyers.
	


5 Jeiss

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	Mr Jones was the sole director of Jeiss.
	
	
	In 1999 or 2000, Mr Jones, on behalf of Jeiss, engaged OTD as both Jeiss’, and his own personal, accountants and tax agents. The retainer between OTD and Jeiss included the preparation of unaudited accounts and the preparation and lodgement of income tax returns.
	
	
	Mr Agius was not involved in the preparation of Jeiss’ unaudited accounts or the preparation and lodgement of its tax returns.
	
	
	In the 2000 financial year, no money was paid out of any Jeiss account to any New Zealand bank accounts. However, the unaudited accounts for that year recorded $110,000 as management and consulting fees. These expenses were claimed as a deduction in the 2000 tax return.
	
	
	In the 2001 financial year, $50,025 was transferred by Jeiss out of an account held by it with the NAB (the Jeiss account) into the Billbury account. Of this amount, $42,000 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account and $8,000 was transferred into the IFTC Vanuatu account. Of the money transferred to the Edgecumbe account, $39,600 was transferred to an account held by Mr Jones with the NAB (the Jones account).
	
	
	In the Jeiss unaudited accounts for the 2001 financial year, $154,000 was recorded as management and consulting fees and was claimed as a deductible expense in the 2001 tax return.
	
	
	The transfer of $50,025 was initially recorded as a shareholder loan but was subsequently recorded under the heading of “Other creditors”. Mr Jones did not record the amount he received as a result of the transaction as income in his income tax return for the 2001 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2002 financial year, there were three transfers of funds from the Jeiss account into the Billbury account. Subject to small deductions, these funds were transferred into the Edgecumbe account.
	
	
	In addition, Jeiss made two transfers of relatively small amounts into the Edgecumbe account and the IFTC account.
	
	
	Of the funds transferred into the Edgecumbe account, $150,200 was transferred into the Jones account. Of this amount, $150,000 was transferred back to the Jeiss account.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for 2002, $186,000 was recorded as management and consulting fees. $7,630 was included as interest payable to Edgecumbe Finance, being in part the transfer made directly into the Edgecumbe account from the Jeiss account, to which I have referred above. These amounts were claimed as deductions in the tax return for the 2002 financial year. The transfers from the Jeiss account to the Billbury account were recorded in Jeiss’ ledger and OTD’s hand-written journal as relating to previously accrued management and consulting expenses.
	
	
	The $150,000 transferred from the Jones account to the Jeiss account was recorded as shareholder loans. Mr Jones did not declare the amount he received as income in his 2002 income tax return.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, five transfers, totalling $210,134, were made from the Jeiss account into the Billbury account. In addition, a transfer of $6,289.66 was made from the Jeiss account into the Edgecumbe account.
	
	
	From the monies transferred into the Billbury account, $203,293.74 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account, whilst $4,200 was transferred into the IFTC account. Of the latter amount, $2,368.42 was transferred from the IFTC account into the Jones account.
	
	
	Of the money transferred into the Edgecumbe account, $206,500 was transferred into the Jones account. Of the money transferred into the Jones account, $150,000 was transferred back into the Jeiss account.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for the 2003 financial year, $65,000 was recorded as management and consulting fees and was claimed as a deduction in Jeiss’ 2003 income tax return. The transfer from Jeiss to Edgecumbe Finance was described as interest but no tax deduction was claimed.
	
	
	None of the monies paid into the Jones account were declared as income by Mr Jones in his income tax return for the 2003 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, $26,580.54 was transferred from the Jeiss account into the Edgecumbe account. Of this amount, $23,300 was transferred into the Jones account and $3,545.96 was transferred into the IFTC account. In addition, $2,243.33 was paid from the Jeiss account into the IFTC account.
	
	
	There were no relevant tax deductions claimed in that year.
	


b The evidence of Mr Glyn Morgan Jones


	
	In considering the evidence of Mr Jones, regard should be had to the evidence of Mr Hili, to which I have referred above.
	
	
	Mr Jones acknowledged that from 12 January 1996, he was the sole director of Jeiss. He said that the company was involved in building maintenance and painting. He said that he went to OTD because Mr Hili was already using Mr Daniel and, as they were working together, it was sensible to have the same accountant.
	
	
	Mr Jones recalled a meeting at OTD in the late 1990’s or the year 2000. He said that he, Mr Hili and Mr Bennett were present at the meeting, initially with Mr Daniel but after that, Mr Zerafa and Ms Abibadra came to the meeting. He said that at the meeting, they discussed tax matters. He said that at the meeting, Mr Daniel proposed a scheme and told him that it was a tax scheme to reduce tax to virtually nothing. He said that he recalled Mr Daniel saying that “he could send some money overseas and it would float around a whole stack of countries and it would come back here and could be claimed and you could reduce your tax.” He said that the countries named were New Zealand, Vanuatu and Ireland. Mr Jones said that he recalled the money was going to New Zealand. He said that he was told that they were paying for consulting fees and the money would come back as a drawdown on the loan.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that they questioned it because it sounded pretty risky. He said that Mr Daniel said that other people were doing it and that it was not a big deal. Mr Jones said that he recalled that the loan would be obtained through an Irish bank but that he could not remember much about that side of it.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he asked how well it would stand up if they were audited by the ATO and they were told it was fine, that plenty of people were doing it and that it was no big deal.
	
	
	He said that by the end of the meeting, he and Mr Hili and Mr Bennett had agreed to go into the scheme.
	
	
	In cross examination by senior counsel for Ms Abibadra, Mr Jones accepted that it was only after he had indicated to Mr Daniel that he would participate in the scheme were Mr Zerafa and Ms Abibadra called into the meeting.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that at the time of the meeting, he did not have an exact understanding of how New Zealand or the other overseas places fitted into the picture. In relation to New Zealand, he said that he knew that it was the place “where the money had to take the spin around the globe before it came back”. Mr Jones also said that nothing was said about fees at the meeting, but there were fees taken out before the transfers came back into his personal bank account.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that sometime after the meeting, Ms Abibadra contacted him and gave him the details of where to send the money and asked that once it was sent, to facsimile a copy of the overseas transfer to her. He was referred to a telegraphic transfer to the Billbury account and said that he got the information to make that transfer and its amount ($50,000) from Ms Abibadra.
	
	
	Mr Jones was also referred to an inwards transfer into his personal account for $39,585 by order of Edgecumbe Finance at a post box in Port Villa, Vanuatu. He said that before he got that document, he had not heard of Edgecumbe Finance and did not know who they were. He said that he just knew that it was money coming back to him.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he had never heard of a firm named Moore Stephens during the course of sending overseas payments, saying that the only company he knew of from the start was Billbury, which was the company to which he was sending money in New Zealand. He said that the name of Billbury was given to him by Ms Abibadra. He said that did not know what the company did and it did not provide any services to Jeiss. In particular, he said that he did not get any management and consulting services for Jeiss from any overseas entity. He said that he did not need management and consultancy services.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he could recall getting documents from IFTC. He was referred to an invoice from that company addressed to a company, Guns of America Ltd (Guns of America), at the OTD address. Mr Jones said that Guns of America was the name of the company that he was given. He said that when he received invoices from IFTC, he did not actually recall what they were for. He said that he just paid what he was told to pay.
	
	
	Mr Jones was also referred to an invoice for interest from Edgecumbe Finance dated 30 June 2001. The invoice referred to a drawdown facility of $1 million. Mr Jones said that he knew it was a phoney loan and that he did not draw $1 million down from Edgecumbe Finance as a loan.
	
	
	Mr Jones was referred to the Jeiss profit and loss account for the financial year ending 30 June 2000, showing management and consulting fees of $110,000. He said that they were falsely claimed consulting fees. He said that he did not know how the figure was arrived at.
	
	
	Mr Jones was referred to the income and expense statement for Jeiss for the period ending 30 June 2001. He was referred to the management and consulting fees in an amount of $154,000. He said that his evidence in respect of these fees was the same as his evidence in relation to the consulting fees of $110,000. Mr Jones said that he would have given the same answer in relation to the $186,000 management and consulting fees in the profit and loss statement for Jeiss for the year ending 30 June 2002.
	
	
	Mr Jones also said that he would have given the same answers in relation to the $65,000 management and consulting fees shown in the profit and loss statement for Jeiss in the year ending 30 June 2003, or any other amounts referable to such management and consultancy fees.
	
	
	Mr Jones was also asked about an entry in a document described as the Jeiss Building & Carpentry Services Pty Ltd Coding Report from 1 May 2002 to 31 May 2002, recording an entry of $100,000 alongside the words “Billbury Pty Ltd (see Carol)”. He said that he would give the same answer in relation to this payment to Billbury as he gave in relation to the previous payments.
	
	
	In relation to the $110,000 expenses claimed in the 2000 year, Mr Jones accepted the suggestion by counsel for Ms Abibadra that Mr Daniel had explained to him that “you could claim the deduction for $110,000 even though funds had not been sent offshore, but you would need to set up transfers offshore in the following tax year to make the figure up”.
	
	
	Mr Jones was again referred to money which came back into his personal account from Edgecumbe Finance. He said that he was not aware that those monies were not declared in his personal tax return for the particular year as assessable income. He said that he did not understand that the Edgecumbe Finance payments were loan drawdown payments.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he was concerned when he received the ATO letter dated 21 November 2003. He said that he asked Mr Zerafa about it and Mr Zerafa said not to worry about it, “it’s just a generic letter. I’ll prepare a response.” Mr Jones was referred to a response dated 16 December 2003 under his name stating that he had had dealings with an international finance company, Edgecumbe Finance, and setting out what were described as inward transactions. He said that the author was Mr Zerafa. The letter said that Edgecumbe Finance was a bank located in Dublin, Ireland. Mr Jones said that he had no knowledge that Edgecumbe was located in Dublin. Mr Jones said that he signed the letter and caused it to be sent off to the ATO on the instructions of Mr Zerafa.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he recalled a meeting at OTD on 19 April 2004. He said that he and Mr Hili came in to see OTD following receipt of a letter from the ATO saying that he and Mr Hili were at high risk of being audited. He said that he and Mr Hili went to OTD because they wanted to get the tax repaid, “all the money that we’d been ripping off, we wanted to correct it”. Mr Jones said that they were told that they would have to pay a fortune back in tax and that they said that they did not mind and they would do whatever was necessary to pay it back. He said that he subsequently received a payment plan from the ATO to pay about $5,000 per month over 12 months and he thought that he was paying off the tax avoided as a result of the scheme.
	
	
	Mr Jones was asked about a meeting that he had at the office at OTD with Mr Hili in November 2006. He recalled that either Ms Abibadra or Mr Zerafa said that they had been raided by the AFP and they were looking for all documents in relation to the scheme. Mr Jones said that either he or Mr Hili said that they thought they were square with the ATO and asked “is everything okay”. He said that there was no real reply to that. He said that they were told just to seek legal advice and also that most of the documents were shredded and not to worry about it, “It was mainly all Owen’s idea”.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Ms Abibadra, Mr Jones accepted that he could not be sure of the words that he used in the conversation in November 2006.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Mr Jones accepted that the plan was put to him by Mr Daniel and that there were no invoices received for management and consulting fees.
	


6 Bemawell

a The agreed statement of facts


	
	Mr O’Rourke was a director of Bemawell. He engaged OTD to act as the accountants and tax agents for Bemawell. The retainer included the preparation of unaudited accounts and the preparation and lodgement of income tax returns. It also included the preparation and lodgement of Mr O’Rourke’s personal tax returns.
	
	
	Mr Agius was not involved in the preparation of the unaudited accounts or preparation or lodgement of tax returns.
	
	
	In the 2003 financial year, transfers of $50,000 and $100,027 were made out of an account held by Bemawell with the St George Bank Ltd (the Bemawell account) into the Lime account. Of these amounts, a sum of $8,847.66 (partly converted into US dollars) was transferred into the IFTC account. A further $138,939.46 was paid into the Edgecumbe account. Of the latter amount, $138,764 was transferred from the Edgecumbe account to an account held by Mr O’Rourke with the St George Bank (the O’Rourke account). An amount of $136,000 was then transferred from the O’Rourke account back to the Bemawell account in transfers of $40,000 and $96,000, the latter transfer taking place after the end of the 2002/2003 financial year.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for Bemawell for the 2003 financial year, $100,000 was recorded as insurance expenses and $50,000 as fringe benefit expenses. These amounts were claimed as tax deductions in the tax return for that year.
	
	
	Both of the transfers made from the Bemawell account, in amounts of $50,000 and $100,000, were recorded as shareholder loans (from Bemawell to a shareholder). The incoming payment of $40,000 from the O’Rourke account to the Bemawell account was recorded as a shareholder loan to Bemawell.
	
	
	None of the monies which flowed into the O’Rourke account were declared as income in Mr O’Rourke’s 2003 income tax return.
	
	
	In the 2004 financial year, two transfers were made out of the Bemawell account into the Lime account, each in an amount of $75,027. The chart showing the flow of funds attached to the agreed statement of facts also refers to a payment in the 2003 financial year of $100,027, which ultimately resulted in a transfer of $96,000 out of the O’Rourke account into the Bemawell account in August 2003. I have dealt with this transaction in dealing with the flow of funds for the 2003 year.
	
	
	Of the two amounts transferred into the Lime account in the 2004 financial year, $12,041.04 was transferred into the IFTC account and $134,855.79 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account. Of the funds transferred into the Edgecumbe account, $134,712 was transferred into the O’Rourke account and subsequently $124,000 was transferred back into the Bemawell account.
	
	
	In the unaudited accounts for that year, the final balance of insurance expenses was recorded as $151,711. This amount incorporated the two transfers of $75,027 from the Bemawell account to the Lime account. This amount was claimed as a tax deduction in Bemawell’s tax return for the 2004 financial year.
	
	
	In the 2005 financial year, transfers were made out of three accounts operated by Bemawell. The first, in an amount of $75,000, was made out of an account with the St George Bank, known as the Bemawell 422 account, into the Lime account. Of this amount, $7,500 was transferred to the IFTC account and $65,200 into the Edgecumbe account. Of the latter amount, $65,131 was transferred into the O’Rourke account and thereafter transferred into the Bemawell account.
	
	
	The second transfer, in an amount of $12,529.36, was made out of another account with the St George Bank, known as the Bemawell P account, into the Security Life account. Of this amount, $12,503.19 was transferred to the Edgecumbe account. From these funds, $12,381 was transferred to the O’Rourke account and $10,000 was subsequently transferred into the Bemawell account.
	
	
	The third transfer involved the transfer of $75,000 from the Bemawell account into the Lime account. Of these funds, $72,723.76 was transferred to the Edgecumbe account in the 2006 financial year. Thereafter, $72,681 was transferred to the O’Rourke account. None of these funds appear to have been transferred back to the Bemawell account.
	
	
	In addition, a transfer of USD$481.21 was made from the O’Rourke account into the Edgecumbe account.
	
	
	The two transfers out of the Bemawell accounts of $75,000 were noted in the records of Bemawell as relating to insurance. An amount of $155,829 for insurance expenses was claimed as a tax deduction in Bemawell’s tax return for the 2005 financial year.
	
	
	None of the monies received by Mr O’Rourke were declared by him as income in that year.
	
	
	In the 2006 financial year, three transfers were made out of the Bemawell account into the Lime account. The total amount of these transfers was $250,000. In addition, a transfer of $23,404.47 was made from the Bemawell account into the Security Life account.
	
	
	From the monies transferred into the Lime account in the 2006 financial year, $234,073.51 was transferred into the Edgecumbe account and $10,000 was transferred into the IFTC account.
	
	
	Of the monies transferred into the Security Life account, $20,377.36 was transferred to the Edgecumbe account and $1,129.99 was transferred to the IFTC account.
	
	
	Thereafter, $326,705 was transferred from the Edgecumbe account to the O’Rourke account. Of that amount, $245,000 was transferred back to the Bemawell account.
	
	
	No relevant tax deductions were claimed in the 2006 financial year.
	


b The evidence of Mr James Gerard O’Rourke


	
	Mr O’Rourke gave evidence that from May 2000, he was the sole director of Bemawell and the sole signatory of its bank accounts. He said that he engaged OTD as Bemawell’s accountant for the 2003 financial year.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke gave evidence that he recalled going to the OTD office and meeting Mr Daniel and Mr Agius in mid-March 2003. He said that prior to that meeting Mr Daniel had asked him whether he wanted to save some tax.
	
	
	He said that to prior to meeting Mr Agius, Mr Daniel had not told him anything about Mr Agius and he could not remember if there had been any discussion about how tax could be reduced.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that during the meeting, Mr Agius drew a diagram showing how he could send money overseas and reduce his tax. He identified the diagram, which he said that Mr Agius wrote out in his presence.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that at the time, he did not have a great understanding of the proposal. He stated that “The fact was that another company was to be set up and it would be run that way; insurance policies.” He said that he was told by Mr Agius that the other company would be set up in Vanuatu. He said that by the end of the meeting, he was of the view that Mr Agius was in business with Mr Daniel and was based in Vanuatu.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to the letters “VAN” at the top right of the diagram below that, “NZ”, and the letters “OZ”. He stated that they stood for Vanuatu, New Zealand and Australia, respectively.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was also referred to three circles in the diagram. He identified the letters in the first one, “FC”, as finance company. However, he was unable to recall what the letters “CC” and “IC” in the centre and right circles, respectively, referred to. However, he indicated that “YC” referred to Bemawell.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to the drawing of a stick figure man on the diagram, a circle representing his company and the letters “OZ”. He identified that the words “set up” and “$8,000”, which appeared immediately below that notation, referred to the cost of setting up the new company. He said that the new company was the one that would be involved in sending the money to New Zealand and on to Vanuatu and then to Ireland and back to him. At that stage of his evidence, he was able to identify the circle with the letters “CC” as referring to consulting company.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke gave evidence that Mr Agius, referring to the diagram, said in broad terms that money would go to New Zealand, “Edgecumbe Trust perhaps”, and then on to Vanuatu. He said that he thought that Edgecumbe Finance was an Irish company. He said that bills would come from IFTC.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to the reference on the diagram to cash going from his company to the consulting company. He said that he assumed that this referred to money he sent to New Zealand for the insurance premium. He was also referred to the words “loan document” and said “That one would need to be set up to bring the money back”. He identified the money as money sent over to New Zealand “as for the insurance policy”, saying that he was given that information by Mr Agius.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that his understanding was that the money would come back as a loan to him from a company he thought was called Edgecumbe or Edgeware. He said that the amount that was to come back was the amount he sent, minus around 3%, or a certain figure for charges. He identified a business card which Mr Agius gave him when they met at Five Dock. Mr O’Rourke was referred to a fax to OTD with a handwritten date, 14 March 2003, on which there were certain handwritten notations. He was referred to a circle around a figure of $150,000 and said that it was in his handwriting and represented monies to be sent overseas. He said that the handwritten figure of $50,000 was a reference to the first instalment of that amount.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that the typed reference in the fax to MAM Holdings Ltd (MAM Holdings) being available was a reference to the company that was set up using the $8,000 payment. He stated that the reference to Centurion was, he thought, a reference to the company where the money was sent to set up that company. However, he said that further money did not go to Cenurion, it went to Lime Street.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that he was familiar with the name of the company Lime Street, stating that that was where he was told to send the money for the insurance policy in New Zealand. He said that the $50,000 referred to in the fax was part payment for the insurance premium on the policy.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to a certificate of cover for insurance dated 24 March 2003 from Lime Street in favour of Bemawell, said to be a consequential risk policy covering legal and other claims incurred in the course of the company’s business of placing posters in public places. He identified the signature at the foot of the certificate as that of Mr Agius. He said that he did not receive an actual insurance policy. He said that he understood that the reason that the period of insurance was from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003, while the certificate of cover was dated 24 March 2003, was to enable the premium to be claimed in the 2003 financial year. He said that he did not make any decision to take out the insurance for the risk referred to in the certificate, but said that that decision was made by Mr Agius.
	
	
	Following that evidence, Mr O’Rourke identified the reference “IC” in the circle on the diagram as relating to a company, IC Manning Insurance Co. He said that he remembered Mr Agius telling him at the meeting that he (presumably Bemawell) would send money to the insurance company, which would find its way back, through the finance company, to him. He said that Mr Agius told him that the money would go via Vanuatu, then continue to Ireland and back to him. Mr O’Rourke was referred to a letter from IFTC to him dated 28 May 2003 signed by Mr Agius. He explained that the statement in the letter that, “We did not know that funds had been received. Funds $42,000 returned to you”, referred to an inquiry he had made as to why funds had not come back.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was also referred to a letter dated 27 May 2003 from Edgecumbe Finance offering a loan facility of $500,000 to Bemawell. He said that he did not personally receive $500,000 from Edgecumbe Finance, but that monies came back over a few years, although he did not know the total. He said that the monies that were received back went into his bank account and were the same monies that had earlier been sent out to the Bemawell account. He stated that as far as he was concerned, it was not a real loan, recalling that in the discussion he had had with Mr Agius, he was told that this was the way the money would come back.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was asked further questions about the insurance policy. He said that he caused Bemawell to send money overseas as premium payments for the policy, but stated that if Bemawell made a claim, it was not going to get $500,000, if that was what the claim was worth. He said that the amount received would be a small amount of money, stating that he reached this understanding from Mr Agius. He acknowledged that after taking out setup costs, he received the bulk of the funds that Bemawell had transferred as payments for the insurance premium. In those circumstances, he stated that he did not think that he ever paid any genuine premium for the insurance policy and that if he ever had to make a claim, he would not expect to get anything out of it.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to a letter from Edgecumbe Finance to him relating to a request for a drawdown of $42,000 from the loan facility. He stated that he did not think he would ever have to pay back the $42,000. He said that the only time that he sought to contact Edgecumbe Finance was when they made a demand in 2006.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to the chart forming part of the agreed statement of facts which showed $100,027 going from Bemawell to Lime Street on 27 June 2003. He said that this amount was part of the premium payable for the insurance. He was referred to the fact that the chart showed $96,924.46 of this money going to Edgecumbe Finance and thereafter, $96,781 going into his account. He stated that the money was paid from his account into the Bemawell account in connection with Bemawell’s cash flow requirements at the time.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to a letter from IFTC to him dated 21 August 2003 signed by Mr Agius. The letter enclosed a certificate of cover for insurance of the same class as the previous certificate, the policy period being 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 and the amount of cover being $1 million. He acknowledged that the main difference was that it covered claims of $1 million rather than $500,000, otherwise, his earlier evidence applied. He said that he did not think that it was odd at the time that he had been paying an insurance premium for a policy period that had already passed, although he said that he did not have any real understanding of the insurance arrangement. He said that as far as he understood, MAM Holdings was just there for the purpose of the policy, although he did not understand what particular purpose it served.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that he paid the Edgecumbe Finance interest invoices as they came in, until the end. He acknowledged that Bemawell’s income tax return for the year ending 30 June 2003 made a false claim of $100,000 for insurance expenses.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was asked about a certificate of cover for insurance for the policy period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2003, covering the same risks as the preceding certificates of cover. He identified the signature on the certificate of cover as that of Mr Agius.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke stated that that certificate of cover came to him with a letter of 5 January 2004, after the policy period had expired. He did not have any explanation for the reason that this occurred.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to a letter of 6 January 2004 from Edgecumbe Finance referring to his request for a drawdown of $69,600 from his loan facility. He said that he did not make such a request but thought that it was just part of the procedure.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to the MAM Holdings financial statement for the year ending 30 June 2004. It referred to income said to have been derived by that company, in an amount of $250,000 for management fees. He stated that he did not know what those fees were.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke gave evidence of a conversation that he had had with Mr Zerafa in November 2006 or March 2007. He said that Mr Zerafa said that he and Mr O’Rourke should not speak inside the office because it might have listening devices, or words to that effect. He said that Mr Zerafa explained that the ATO had taken certain documents and that there would be no claim for overseas payments in that year.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that Mr Zerafa told him to get rid of whatever documents he had. He said that he did not do that. He was referred to Edgecumbe invoices of 26 March 2007 and stated that he was pretty certain that he did not pay those, but he paid the ones before that time.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke was referred to an email to him from Ms Fawcett of PKF Vanuatu stating that the balance of his retention funds was $23,041.40 and to his response of the same day that he did not require the facility any more. He said that at about that time, he endeavoured to contact Mr Agius and spoke to him on the phone. He said that his purpose in contacting Mr Agius was to ascertain how he would receive the retention funds back and said that Mr Agius told him he would have to think of a way to get them to him.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that he contacted Mr Agius because he had received a letter from Edgecumbe Finance stating that that company was going to take proceedings against him for not paying the interest. He said that Mr Agius told him that it was just a formal letter to make it appear legitimate and not to worry about it and he would think of a way to get the retention money to him. In that context, Mr O’Rourke was referred to a notice of demand from Edgecumbe Finance demanding payment of $72,797.81. He said that as far as he was concerned, he did not owe this money to Edgecumbe Finance.
	
	
	Mr O’Rourke said that after he spoke to Mr Agius, he did not make any subsequent endeavours to get the money back or endeavour to contact Mr Agius again.
	
	
	In cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Agius, Mr O’Rourke acknowledged that it was Mr Daniel who first approached him about a possible tax scheme. He acknowledged that thereafter, he regularly dealt with Mr Daniel in regard to his tax affairs and after Mr Daniel became unwell, he dealt with Mr Zerafa. He agreed that he only saw Mr Agius once between 2003 and 2006. Mr O’Rourke acknowledged that the only face-to-face conversation that he had had with Mr Agius was the one with Mr Daniel in 2003, which was “not too long, half an hour, less perhaps.” He was referred to his record of interview, where he said that Mr Agius was only there for five or 10 minutes and stated “That could be right”. Mr O’Rourke said that he was always positive that Mr Agius drew the diagram. He was referred in that context to his record of interview in",2015-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767446,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 12) [2015] NSWSC 1099,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	The joint trial of the accused commenced before me on 27 July 2015 and the opening address of the Crown Prosecutor concluded on 28 July 2015. An opening address was then made by counsel for the accused McNamara (“McNamara”) following which I made an order discharging the jury: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 8) [2015] NSWSC 1036. The trial is now due to commence on 18 August 2015.
	
	
	In the course of his opening address, counsel made a number of references to McNamara’s good character. On the assumption that evidence is given by McNamara consistent with counsel’s opening, the Crown has made an application for leave to cross-examine him on the basis of evidence going to bad character. On the further assumption that McNamara denies what is put to him in that respect, the Crown will then seek to lead a case in reply.
	
	
	Following the Crown’s application, counsel for the co-accused Rogerson (“Rogerson”) made an application for leave to cross-examine McNamara independently of, but in relation to the very same matters which are relied upon by, the Crown.
	
	
	The applications made by the Crown and counsel for Rogerson have been opposed by counsel for McNamara. All parties have asked that I make an advance ruling in respect of each application pursuant to s. 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	


THE OPENING ADDRESS BY COUNSEL FOR MCNAMARA


	
	Two particular passages of the opening address of counsel for McNamara give rise to the Crown’s application. The first commences at T54 L49 where counsel said the following:
	


“Mr McNamara, he puts himself to you, to this court, as a man of good character, as a man of no convictions for criminal conduct, as a man who left the Police Force honourably, unlike Mr Rogerson, we will be suggesting, who was sacked” (emphasis added).


	
	The second commences at T56 L17 where counsel said the following:
	


“That is, Mr McNamara had a representation (sic), a considerably good reputation, as a private investigator capable of working hard and thoroughly and expertly as an investigator. He had been a policeman some ten years, ten to fifteen years earlier, the subject matter of his first book.

You might be also told that as a result of his police work, 20 yards away from this building in Darlinghurst Detectives, that in his character he will put forward, the fact that he wore a wire while he was a policeman undercover and was responsible for the arrest of corrupt policemen and paedophiles and policemen who covered up for paedophiles and paedophiles who made drugs and paedophiles who filmed young children. That is part of his legacy as a policeman. 

Having left the Police Force he was put into witness protection from corrupt cops. He left Australia and went to another place, and they found him out but he came back to Australia and started a life here with his wife and raised two children and became a writer, became a private detective, that is a professional private detective doing professional work” (my emphasis).


	
	In seeking an advance ruling the parties have asked that I proceed on the assumption that when the trial commences, counsel for McNamara will open to the jury in essentially the same terms as outlined above, and that evidence will be given by McNamara consistent with that opening.
	


THE EVIDENCE RELIED UPON BY THE CROWN

The relevant background


	
	The evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of its application comes from two witnesses, Lok Lam (“Lam”) and Justin McLannen (“McLannen”). Before setting out that evidence, some background is required.
	
	
	As part of its case against the two accused, the Crown alleges that in January 2014 the deceased was an associate of Lam. At that time, Lam and his brother Chun Kit Lam (“Chun”) had been charged with offences against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). A Mr Ly, solicitor, acted for Lam and Chun. Ms Diane Elston, a solicitor, was employed by Mr Ly. There is evidence that from time to time the deceased acted as an interpreter at conferences between Lam and his lawyers.
	
	
	Mr Ly briefed Mr Charles Moschoudis, who then practiced as a barrister, to advise, and appear for, Lam. McNamara was retained (apparently by Mr Ly but seemingly on the recommendation of Mr Moschoudis) as a private investigator to assist with obtaining statements to assist Lam’s case. Ultimately, Lam and Chun each pleaded guilty to various offences. Each was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Subsequent appeals against the asserted severity of their respective sentences were dismissed: Lam v R; Lam v R [2015] NSWCCA 87.
	
	
	On the Crown case, it was through the connections I have outlined that the deceased came to meet McNamara. The Crown will lead evidence from both Lam and Chun for the purposes of establishing (inter alia) the nature and extent of the association between the deceased and McNamara in the period leading up to the deceased’s death. On the basis of other evidence which is more fully summarised in the Crown Case Statement, the Crown will further allege that after they were introduced to each other, the deceased and McNamara became involved in negotiations for the purchase, by McNamara, of a large quantity of methylamphetamine from the deceased. It is the Crown case that on 20 May 2014, the deceased was shot by one or other of the accused when delivering to them approximately 2.7 kilograms of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	Evidence before me on the present application establishes that in January 2014 McLannen was approached by Agent Amy Knox of the Australian Federal Police and was asked to make a statement concerning (inter alia) his knowledge of Lam. A draft (induced) statement in McLannen’s name was prepared by Agent Knox bearing a date of 15 January 2014. It was not signed. That statement outlines McLannen’s association with a person known as BJ Wang (“Wang”) and his offer to Wang to assist in the distribution of prohibited drugs. The statement contains a passing reference to meeting Lam on one occasion. There is evidence that a Mr Bryan Wrench (“Wrench”), solicitor, gave advice to McNamara in relation to the provision of that statement.
	
	
	To assist McNamara in his task of obtaining statements which would assist Lam, Mr Moschoudis sent McNamara a copy of the Brief of Evidence on 27 January 2014. McNamara replied on the same day telling Mr Moschoudis that he would “send a draft statement to (him) soon”. There was no indication in that reply as to the person from whom any such draft statement might be obtained. On 29 January 2014 Ms Elston wrote to McNamara about contacting Wrench. On the following day, McNamara wrote to Wrench in the following terms:
	


“Bryan, thank you for calling me back. I apologise about the lack of notice.

Andrew Li (sic) solicitor instructs me regarding Chun Lok Lam and Chun Kit Lam. The Lam brothers are charged with “supply commercial quantity” x 2 – Amphetamine Heroin.

The Lam brothers identified Justin McLennen (sic) as one of their associates. They say that Justin was requested to present himself for questioning at the AFP on or about 14 January 2014. The Lam brothers were unable to specify to me the nature of Justin’s interview with the AFP.

I interviewed Justin this week, he provided a statement to me. The features of his statement are his denial to AFP of the Lam brothers being engaged in any illegal drug supply activity. Justin alleges the AFP officer – Amy Knox threatened him with imprisonment if he did not change his version and/or write out a statement implicating the Lam brothers as drug suppliers.

Justin advised at this point a Lawyer came in (you ??). Justin says that soon after he was allowed to leave without the AFP preferring any criminal charges against him.

Justin alleged as he left Ms Knox is alleged to have threatened him with words to the effect of “I am going to arrest you soon”.

My instructions from Andrew Li (sic) are to approach you and ask for your comments in relation to the allegations in Justin’s statement. I appreciate your assistance. I am happy to chat over phone if it is suitable to you.”


	
	On 31 January 2014 Mr Moschoudis again wrote to McNamara and enquired:
	



	
	whether “Justin” had signed his statement; and
	
	
	whether a statement had been obtained from Wrench.
	



	
	It is clear from the evidence I have outlined that one of the potential witnesses from whom McNamara was asked to obtain a statement was McLannen. Significantly, according to his correspondence to Wrench of 30 January 2014, McNamara had, by that time, interviewed McLannen and a prepared a statement for his signature.
	
	
	It is against this background that I turn to consider the evidence upon which the Crown relies in support of the present application.
	


The evidence of Lam


	
	Lam has made two statements to police, although only that made on 20 June 2014 is relevant for present purposes. The Crown has identified the following parts of that statement as those upon which it relies, with particular emphasis being placed upon those parts in bold:
	


“26. Glen asked me if I would still be doing this kind of business after I am finished with this case. I took this to mean that he was referring to the drug business. I told him that I didn't want to be in gaol again. Glen said that he can teach me many things because he was an ex cop and that he knows how the police work. He told me he could teach how to not get followed by the cops. He would teach me how to not get arrested again. He talked about when you do drug deals there are some areas where the police can't follow you. I told him I was not interested anymore and that I just want to win my case and move back to Hong Kong. Glen was speaking to me in very simple English so I could understand him.

27. After this meeting with Glen; Jamie and I left and had lunch together. I told Jamie what Glen had spoken to me about. Jamie told me that Glen had said the same thing to him about how he can teach Jamie how not to get arrested.

28. The following week Glen again rang Jamie and asked him to get me to meet him at 5:00pm at the Meridian Hotel at Hurstville. I was running late and didn't get there till 6:30pm. Jamie and Glen had been there waiting for me from 5:00pm. I know this because they were calling me and messaging me wondering where I was. At this time my mobile number was 0454128923 and I used this number up until the time I went back into custody.

29. Glen told me he will get the statement for me to help with my case soon. He asked me if I had the money yet and I said no. Glen asked me about drugs again. He asked me if I had any drugs to sell as he had customers. He told me he deals with the Italian Mafia. I told him that I didn't have any drugs. Glen told me that he also has drugs and that he deals them. He said do I have any customers or not. I said no. I thought that Glen wanted to do some drug deals with me. He wanted to see if I can get drugs for him or if I wanted to buy drugs from him. I was very worried about Glen because he was an ex cop and I didn't know if I could trust him. I thought that he was trying to set me up and that he might be an undercover cop or something. Jamie was sitting listening to this conversation. I was there with Glen and Jamie for about 15 minutes. When I left Jamie and Glen were still at the hotel together. Jamie translated the entire conversation to me with Glen.

30. A few days after this meeting I met Glen and Jamie again at Hurstville near the train station. This meeting was for Glen and I to speak about adjourning my court matter. Glen said he had some ideas about how we could adjourn my case. He told me he could shoot me in the leg and then I could go to hospital for three months. I said no way was I going to get shot Glen was very serious about shooting me in the leg. He was not joking. He told me he could use a 2.2 bullets or something like that. He said the bullets are really small and it doesn't hurt. He asked me if I had the money for him so he could get the statement. I said I don't have any money for him. Glen said I need to get the money as soon as possible otherwise he wouldn't be able to help me.”

Other evidence relevant to that of Lam


	
	In light of submissions made on behalf of McNamara, it is necessary for me to make reference to some other evidence which is said to be relevant to the present application.
	
	
	In a statement made on 26 July 2015, Det. Lindsay outlined (commencing at (3)) that on 23 May 2014 he met with Jasmine Lau, solicitor, who had previously acted for the deceased and who was then acting for Lam and Chun in respect of their appeals against sentence (see [10] above). Ms Lau informed Det. Lindsay that Lam knew the deceased and that he and Chun “wished to speak to the police about his disappearance”. Det. Lindsay also stated that at that time Ms Lau “indicated that (Lam and his brother) were seeking assistance from police for their appeal process”. The statement says nothing further about assistance being given to Lam.
	
	
	On 16 June 2014 Det. Lindsay spoke with Lam and Chun, at which time they each indicated a willingness to provide a statement detailing their knowledge of, and association with, the deceased. Following this, Lam made his statement of 20 June 2014. The passages upon which the Crown relies in support of the present application will only become relevant if the application is granted, and will not otherwise be adduced. There are, however, other parts of the statement upon which the Crown will rely at the trial to establish the association between McNamara and the deceased.
	
	
	Det. Phillips made a statement on 26 July 2014 in which he stated (at (11)) that he was aware that Det. Lindsay had spoken with Ms Lau and that she had indicated that Lam and Chun proposed to lodge appeals against their sentences. Detective Phillips stated that he was also aware that Lam and his brother “may request assistance of police in this regard”. He went on to state the following (at [16]-[17]):
	


“16. On 26 March 2015 Detective Lindsay and I met with Mr David Clarke, Counsel representing the Lam brothers at that time, and had discussions with him regarding Letters of Assistance in relation to the Lam brothers. Mr Clarke indicated at that time he was awaiting the result of an appeal lodged with the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on behalf of the Lam brothers. Mr Clarke indicated a further appeal to the Governor of NSW was to be prepared if unsuccessful.

17. On 3 June 2015 I prepared Letters of Assistance for Chun Lok Lam and Chun Kit Lam. The Commander of the Robbery and Serious Crime Squad, Detective Acting Superintendent Sheehy, signed an affidavit supporting the Letters of Assistance. At the advice of Mr Clarke, the Letters of Assistance were addressed to the Governor of NSW.”


	
	I have been provided with an unsigned copy of an affidavit of Det. Ag. Supt. Sheehy. Annexed to that affidavit was an unsigned letter from Det. Phillips. It is evident that this material has been, or is intended to be, provided to the Governor of NSW in support of an application for a reduction in the sentences imposed upon Lam and his brother. Having outlined the circumstances in which Lam and Chun came to make their statements to police, the letter from Det. Phillips states the following:
	


“The evidence contained within the statements of the Lam brothers go towards issues critical in the case against the two accused, including the circumstances surrounding the deceased meeting the accused McNamara in early 2014. The evidence, in particular, of Chun Lok Lam is crucial in establishing the involvement of the accused in drug supply and ultimately the motive for the deceased’s murder. The information provided by both Lam’s (sic) is considered truthful and reliable.

The Lam brothers initiated contact with police regarding this matter and did so in a timely manner shortly after the date of the offence. The assistance of the Lam brothers and their likelihood of being required to give evidence at the trial of the accused McNamara and Rogerson is likely to result in them both having to be placed in protective custody thereby suffering harsher custodial conditions. There is a real risk of retribution against the Lam brothers as a result of their assistance. Not only in regard to their likely evidence against the accused McNamara and Rogerson but also there identification of another male who is suspected of having facilitated the supply of the drugs from Hong Kong.

It is noted that those involved in the murder of the deceased stood to gain a substantial sum of money from the offence and now face the prospect of life imprisonment. Accordingly, the motivation for revenge against those assisting their prosecution is strong.

It is respectfully requested that consideration be given to a reduction in the current sentences of Chun Lok Lam and Chun Kit Lam.”

The evidence of McLannen


	
	On 16 January 2015 McLannen made an induced statement to police in which he outlined his association with Wang, and disclosed the fact that he had sold prohibited drugs on Wang’s behalf. McLannen then proceeded (commencing at (15)) to detail a meeting that he had with McNamara in January 2014. For the purposes of the present application, the Crown relies upon McLannen’s account of that meeting, with particular emphasis being placed upon those parts of paragraphs (18) to (26] which are in bold. It is noted that the references to the person “Key” are references to Chun:
	


15. In January 2014 the AFP called me and I went in to see them. I met a Federal Agent called Amy KNOX and I was told the Lok and Key were locked up for drugs. Agent KNOX asked me to provide a statement against Lok and Key. I refused and called Jamie from outside the AFP building and asked him to get me a lawyer straight away. Jamie arranged for a lawyer who turned up later that afternoon and we left the AFP building without making a statement. I went back to the lawyer's office and discussed things with him before heading home. I never paid the lawyer any money and he never asked me for anything.

16. That same day I went and met Jamie in Hurstville and explained exactly what happened. I told Jamie that the AFP wanted me to give a statement about Lok and Key. Jamie asked me if I made the statement and I said no. He told me not to worry about it.

17. About a week later I was in Hurstville with my partner. We had planned to watch a movie and we were walking around window shopping. I received a call on my mobile from Jamie. I was surprised to see Jamie calling me as it's usually me calling him. Jamie asked me if I could meet him in Hurstville and I told him that I was already here. Jamie told me to meet him at Miss Saigon restaurant. This was a usual eating place for us when we use to hang out at Hurstville.

18. My partner and I walked to Miss Saigon and met Jamie. Jamie was with Terry WONG a female and another male who I didn't know. I asked Jamie what was going on and he said that Lok and Key's lawyer wanted to see me and he was on his way. We walked from Miss Saigon to the train station and waited outside the Priceline shop. We waited for about twenty minutes and my partner was getting anxious, I went down to Forrest Road to have a cigarette with Jamie and asked him what was going on. Jamie told me that this lawyer just wanted to have a word with me and asked to walk with him to his car because his mobile phone was in the car and we could call him and see where he was.

19. Jamie and I walked to his car that was parked in the Treacy Street car park next to the Karaoke bar. As Jamie went to call the lawyer he appeared in the car park. He said, ""Sorry I'm late-traffic"". I looked over and saw a Caucasian male (white guy), he was large and tubby with short shaved hair all over, maybe a number one. The male was wearing sunglasses and said ""since we are here we might as well talk here.""

20. The first thing the male said to me is, ""Don't be disrespectfully (sic) and take off your sunglasses."" He took out a black leather notebook and said, ""I am Lok and Key's lawyer and I want to ask you a few things."" I said ""Okay"". He said, ""Did you make a statement against Lok and Key?"" I said ""No"". He said, ""Do you know what happens to people who make statements?"" I said yes."" He said, ""Are you rat, what’s the go with the second name?"" I said, ""What second name?"" He looked into his notebook and said ""Steven."" I said, ""That's my brother in law.""

21. He asked me why I had that name and I didn't know that I did so I just told him it was the AFP'S fuck up. He then went on to say something along the lines of ""Do you know what happens to rats that snitch? They end up hanging themselves, when you give them enough rope the guilt kills them"". He said, ""If they don't know what to do with the rope you may have to give them a hand."" I took what he said to mean that he would kill me if I gave a statement.

22. He asked me for my mobile phone number and I saw him record it in his black notebook. His notebook was small and black possibly black leather, it looked like a small diary/notebook.

23. He told me that I had to supply a statement saying that I was only a ""hi"" ""by"" friend with Lok and Key. He said he would write up the statement and ring me to make arrangements to meet up and have me sign the statement.

24. I was shitting myself and agreed to what he said. He said to me, ""Do you know who I am?"" I said ""No"", he said ""I am an ex cop from Kings Cross, I was a bikie and I've seen things you could never imagine."" I just nodded my head and agreed with everything he was saying.

25. He said, ""Make sure you answer your phone tomorrow."" I said, ""Okay."" He shook my hand and he took a firm grip on my hand and said something along the lines of, ""Have you heard of the green dream?"" I said ""No"", he said, ""It's something that gets injected into you and you will go to sleep and never wake up"". As he held (sic) of my hand he used his other hand to make a gun gesture and was poking the gun he made out of his finger into the back of my palm very hard as he was telling me this. He looked at me and said something like ""I would be more than happy to deliver it (Green Dream)."" He was staring straight into my eyes and I was so scared. He said, ""I have done it in the past."" After he finished talking to me, he walked a couple of meters away with Jamie and they started talking to each other. I heard the white guy say ""Tie him up and stab him"", they were whispering to each other and Jamie was putting his hand over his mouth to cover what he was saying.

26. Jamie walked back and got his jacket out of his car we walked away, I looked back and the white guy was still standing in the car park looking towards us, I said to Jamie ""What the fuck was that?"" Jamie said, ""Nothing don't worry."" I was really scared, the white guy really intimidated me and threatened to kill me and when I heard him say 'tie him up and stab him' I wasn't sure if he was talking about me, it made me really paranoid and suspicious of Jamie.


	
	McLannen identified McNamara (by a series of photographs) as the male he described at paragraphs (19) and following of the statement.
	
	
	Following McNamara’s arrest a computer was seized from his premises. Bearing in mind the correspondence of 30 January 2014 between himself and Wrench (at [13] above), a document was downloaded from the computer which was headed:
	


“Statement of Justin McLennan (sic) in the matter of Commonwealth v Loc (sic) & others.”


	
	The statement, which was unsigned, was dated 27 January 2014 and was in the following terms (omitting formal parts):
	


“1. …

2. I am presently 20 years of age. My date of birth is 20th August 1993.

3. On or about 14 January 2014 I received a telephone call from a woman who identified herself as Federal Agent Amy Knox of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

4. During the telephone conversation agent Knox said to me, “Come to my office at Goulburn Street. I want to talk to you about some drug dealers you know”.

5. I was very scared because of this telephone call. I do not know any drug dealers. I did not know what to do from a legal perspective so on 14 January 2014 I met with Federal Agent Knox at the AFP Sydney Headquarters in Goulburn Street, Sydney. I made the decision to see Knox at AFP Headquarters because what Knox said to me on the phone was so unbelievable the AFP had made a mistake. I believed I could explain to Knox she had made a mistake or a mix up.

6. I met with Knox. I was taken to an interview room within the AFP building in Goulburn Street, Sydney.

7. Knox said to me, “Look at these guys”.

8. Knox showed me pictures of four men of Chinese appearance. Knox pointed to a picture of a man who has now been identified to me as Loc (sic). Knox said to me, ‘Loc (sic) is your boss. He tells you what to do, what drugs to sell and for how much. Give me the details’.

9. I said to Knox, ‘I don’t sell drugs. He doesn’t tell me what to do.’ As I said these words I pointed to the picture of Loc.

10. I said to Knox, “I don’t know anything about him or any of these other guys. They don’t sell drugs, I don’t sell drugs.” Knox said, “Yes you do. You’re a drug dealer too and Loc’s (sic) your boss”.

11. I said, “No he’s not. I’m not a drug dealer”.

12. Knox said, “if you don’t tell me what I want to know you won’t be leaving here today. Instead you’ll be going to straight into custody. I’ll make sure you do between 2 years and 5 years gaol.”

13. I said “I can’t lie and say something I don’t know. I have done nothing. These guys (indicating the photos) have done nothing that I know of”.

14. Knox appeared to be angry. She said, “wait here”. Knox left the room.

15. I sat in the interview room for a long time.

16. Knox came back in the room. I said, “I’ve done nothing. I want to go.” Knox said, “you can’t go. You’ve got to tell me about the guys in these photos.” This conversation repeated. I said to Knox, “I don’t know anything about any drug deals ever.”

17. Knox said, “If you’re scared we can protect. If you write down a statement for me about Loc (sic) being head of the group you’ll be safe. No one is going to kill you.

18. I said, “I am not writing any statement. No one is going to kill me because I don’t know anything about anyone being involved in selling drugs. Do I have to stay here or am I allowed to go home”.

19. Knox left the room again. I waited in the room.

20. After a period of time a lawyer named Brian Wrench came to the interview room to act as my legal representative. During my initial instructions to Mr Wrench I detailed the same conversations, which are contained in this statement. I complained that Knox had wanted me to invent a story that Loc (sic) and the other men in the photos were drug dealers.

21. Soon after my conversation with Mr Wrench I was allowed to leave the AFP building.

22. As I was leaving Knox said to me, “after we finish with Loc (sic) we are coming after you”.

23. I categorically deny being involved in the sale of illicit drugs with any individual or group.

24. I categorically deny having knowledge of any individual or group involved in the sale of illicit drugs.

25. I have read this statement and I agreed that its contents are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.”


	
	On 6 May 2015 McLannen made a second statement to police. Commencing at paragraph (3) he stated that he had been shown a copy of the statement found on McNamara’s computer. He went on to say (at [7]):
	


7. I read this statement and don't know where it came from or who provided it. The statement is not mine and was not provided by me. I can see that it is in my name however whoever typed it misspelt my surname, my surname is spelt McLannen not McLennan.

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS


	
	The present application for an advance ruling is made pursuant to s. 192A of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


192A Advance rulings and findings

Where a question arises in any proceedings, being a question about:

(a) the admissibility or use of evidence proposed to be adduced, or

(b) the operation of a provision of this Act or another law in relation to evidence proposed to be adduced, or

(c) the giving of leave, permission or direction under section 192,

the court may, if it considers it to be appropriate to do so, give a ruling or make a finding in relation to the question before the evidence is adduced in the proceedings.


	
	Part 3.8 of the Act deals with evidence of the character of an accused person:
	


109 Application

This Part applies only in a criminal proceeding.

110 Evidence about character of accused persons

(1) The hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced by a defendant to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is, either generally or in a particular respect, a person of good character.

(2) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is generally a person of good character has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not generally a person of good character.

(3) If evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that a defendant is a person of good character in a particular respect has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove (directly or by implication) that the defendant is not a person of good character in that respect.

111 Evidence about character of co-accused

(1) The hearsay rule and the tendency rule do not apply to evidence of a defendant’s character if:

(a) the evidence is evidence of an opinion about the defendant adduced by another defendant, and

(b) the person whose opinion it is has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, and

(c) the opinion is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.

(2) If such evidence has been admitted, the hearsay rule, the opinion rule and the tendency rule do not apply to evidence adduced to prove that that evidence should not be accepted.

112 Leave required to cross-examine about character of accused or co-accused

A defendant must not be cross-examined about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in this Part unless the court gives leave.


	
	In making the present determination, the provisions of s. 192 are also relevant:
	


192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms

(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d) the nature of the proceeding, and

(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.

THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES - THE APPLICATION BY THE CROWN


	
	In R v PKS (NSWCCA unreported 1 October 1998) the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Sully and Ireland JJ) set out a series of propositions relevant to the operation of Part 3.8 of the Act:
	


“1. The first thing that had to be decided by the accused and his legal representatives was whether, his good character not having been put in issue in the Crown case, it should be raised as an issue in his own case.

2. That decision needed to be taken in the light of the provisions of Pt3.8 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and in particular the provisions of s110 and s112 of that Act.

3. S110(1) gave the accused a clear choice. He could put in issue the proposition that he was ""generally a person of good character"". Alternatively, he could put in issue the proposition that he was ""in a particular respect a person of good character"".

4. In the event that he decided to put in issue that he was ""generally a person of good character"", the accused was vulnerable to an application by the Crown, and made pursuant to s112 of the Evidence Act, to cross-examine him so as to elicit that he had, in fact, prior convictions, albeit old ones, for offences of dishonesty.

5. If he decided to put in issue that he was ""in a particular respect a person of good character"", namely in respect of sexual misconduct with young children, whether his own children or the children of others, then the accused was not so vulnerable to cross-examination upon his old convictions for dishonesty. That was so because of the terms of s110(3) of the Evidence Act. Such a construction of s110(3) was adopted by Higgins J, of the Federal Court of Australia, in Gabriel v The Queen (unreported: Federal Court of Australia: Full Court, 25 June 1997).

In the light of what is stated in the foregoing propositions, counsel for the accused was entitled, in our opinion, to apply to the trial Judge for rulings on the questions:

(a) whether, if the accused gave evidence that he was ""generally a person of good character"", his Honour would refuse to permit cross-examination upon the previous offences of dishonesty, so refusing either by the method of refusing leave pursuant to s112 of the Evidence Act; or by the method of excluding such cross-examination in the exercise of the discretion conferred in that behalf by s137 of the Evidence Act; and

(b) whether, if the accused gave evidence that he was ""in a particular respect a person of good character"", namely in respect of sexual misconduct with young children, his Honour would uphold a submission that s110(3) of the Evidence Act did not permit cross-examination upon the previous offences of dishonesty.”


	
	Testimony which is said to raise an accused’s character must evince a conscious decision to intentionally and deliberately adduce evidence of positive good character: Huges (a Pseudonym) v R [2013] VSCA 338 at [23]-[24] per Priest JA (Coghlan JA and Lasry AJA agreeing); Gabriel v The Queen (FCA, 25 June 1997 unreported); R v Fuller (1994) 34 NSWLR 233 (at 236 per Hunt CJ at CL, Bruce and Dowd JJ agreeing). In the present case, given the terms in which counsel previously opened to the jury, and on the assumptions in [7] above, there is no issue that any evidence given by McNamara which was consistent with counsel’s opening would reflect the making of a conscious decision of the kind referred to in the authorities cited above.
	
	
	The provisions of s. 110 of the Act are generally consistent with common law principles in respect of an accused person raising prior good character in the course of proceedings. In R v Stalder (1981) 2 NSWLR 9 Street CJ traced the history of statutory provisions governing the admissibility of evidence of the character of an accused, before observing (at 15):
	


“It will be seen that from as far back as 1876 it has been part of thestatute law of New South Wales that evidence as to character of an accusedshall be received and dealt with as evidence on the question of guilt andthat evidence as to character may cover not only general repute buthabits, disposition and conduct. These prescriptions of the effect andscope of character evidence do not override the deeply rooted common lawprinciple precluding the Crown from calling evidence of bad charactersolely for the purpose of seeking to establish affirmatively as part of itscase in chief that the accused is a person of bad character and hencecould be regarded as more likely to have committed the crime with whichhe is charged.”


	
	His Honour referred to the judgment of the High Court in Attwood v R [1960] HCA 15; (1960) 102 CLR 353 in which the plurality (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar, Taylor and Menzies JJ) said (at 359-360):
	


“ ‘Bad character’ may be regarded as the contrary of good character. But as a separate and independent fact or matter it can be proved on a criminal trial only in answer to evidence adduced of the accused's good character. It is not excluded as irrelevant to proof of guilt. It is excluded as a matter of policy, policy deeply rooted in principle”.


	
	In Stalder (supra) Street CJ also observed (at 20) that the reluctance of the common law to allow evidence of bad character turned essentially upon a recognition of the unfairness to an accused which could result. In this regard, he referred to the judgment of Mason J (as his Honour then was) in Donnini v R [1972] HCA 71; (1972) 128 CLR 114 where his Honour said (at 144):
	


“It has always been accepted that the introduction of evidence of bad character is exceptional. The long standing policy of the law is against the reception of such evidence on the question of guilt. The section in making provision for cross-examination on prior convictions and bad character is making provision for the reception of that evidence in exceptional circumstances. In exercising the discretion it was for the learned judge to consider the prejudice which would be done to the applicant by reception of evidence of his prior convictions and his experience with drugs and the risk that they would excite the suspicion that the applicant was of restless and irresponsible character and to evaluate the advantage which the applicant might gain from the question put to Mrs Brading and the answer which she gave”.


	
	The effect of s. 110(1) of the Act is that an accused is provided with an opportunity to put in issue his good character generally, or his good character in a particular respect. Which of those two courses an accused person takes will largely determine the extent to which any leave might be granted under s. 110. In R v Zurita [2002] NSWCCA 22 Howie J (with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed) observed (at [14]) that the effect of s. 110(1) of the Act is to vary the common law attitude to evidence of good character from a position of “all or nothing”, to one of allowing an accused person to put forward that he or she is either generally, or in a particular respect, a person of good character.
	
	
	Having regard to the provisions of s. 110(3), if an accused’s good character is raised only in a particular respect, any evidence in rebuttal must be limited to that aspect of the accused’s character. In Bishop v R [2013] VSCA 273 Redlich JA observed (at [8]):
	


“[8] The phrase “in a particular respect” in s. 110 is described by Gans and Palmer as meaning “pertaining to a particular characteristic” such as for example, gentleness, generosity or good citizenship. But it may also relate to a particular context in which relevant conduct has taken place. Thus evidence may for example be adduced by work colleagues as to the defendant’s honesty in his employ or by his relatives as to his good parenting skills. The accused may call evidence which is specifically focussed upon good character relating to the charge or an absence of prior bad character with respect to the specific conduct the subject of the charge. Thus evidence of good character in a particular respect to counter allegations of sexual abuse has been admitted. In R v PKS, a case involving sexual offences against a minor, evidence of good character in respect of young children was admitted. In R v Zurita evidence of a lack of antecedent sexual offences was admitted.”


	
	In Huges (supra) Priest JA made the following observations regarding the provisions of s. 110 and s. 112 (at [20]):
	


“The effect of ss. 110(2) and (3), is that if the accused adduces evidence to prove, either directly or by implication, that the accused person is of good character generally or in a particular respect, the tendency rule and credibility rule (among others) do not apply to evidence to prove that the accused is not a person of good character generally or in that particular respect. Moreover, if it is sought to adduce the evidence of bad character through cross-examination, s. 112 provides that leave is required in order to cross-examine about evidence of a kind referred to — that is, that the accused is not of good character. The general discretions found in ss. 135 and 136 of the Act, to exclude, or to limit the use of, evidence which may be “unfairly prejudicial”, apply to evidence to rebut good character, as does the mandatory obligation in s. 137 to “refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused”. Further, when considering the grant of leave under ss 112, 192 of the Act is engaged. Therefore the judge, when considering whether to grant leave (or to grant it on “such terms as the court thinks fit”), must take into account “the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought”, and “the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party”.


	
	Later (at [26]) his Honour referred to the judgment of the plurality (Mason CJ, Brennan, Wilson and Dawson JJ) in Phillips v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 45 at 57-58 where it was observed that the discretion of a trial judge to permit the character of an accused to be attacked by reference to his bad character was one which is to be “sparingly and cautiously exercised.”
	
	
	The observation of Priest JA as to the requirement to take into account the matters in s. 192 of the Act in making a determination such as the present was consistent with the observations of Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Stanoevski v R [2001] HCA 4; (2001) 202 CLR 115 at [44]; 126-127. However, the considerations in s. 192 are not exhaustive. Questions of the weight and relevance of the evidence must also be considered: Stanoevski (supra) at [47]; 127.
	


THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES – THE APPLICATION BY ROGERSON


	
	The application made by Rogerson was made independently of that made by the Crown. The issues, and the applicable principles, differ as between the two applications.
	
	
	The principal issue arising from the application made on behalf of Rogerson is whether the evidence can be said to be relevant. In R v Gibb and McKenzie [1983] 2 VR 155 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Young CJ, Crockett and King JJ) observed (at 163):
	


“Speaking generally, although the Crown may be inhibited to some extent by the evidence it can lead, an accused should be allowed to lead in his defence, whether by way of calling witnesses, or by a statement from the dock or by way of the cross-examination of any witnesses called at the trial, any evidence which is relevant to his defence: see Lowery v R [1974] AC 85 at p. 102. A trial judge, however, retains a discretion to exclude such evidence in a proper case: R v Darrington and McGauley [1980] VR 353 at p. 385. But such an exercise of discretion will necessarily be rare. It is not to be exercised simply because one accused wishes to elicit evidence of the bad character of another accused” (emphasis added).


	
	Because there is more than one accused in the present trial, the test of relevance must be strictly applied: R v Bracewell (1979) 68 Cr App Rep 44. Evidence will be relevant if it tends to show that the version of the facts advanced by one accused is more probable than that advanced by another: Lowery v R [1974] AC 85 at 103.
	
	
	Further, and generally speaking, it is not relevant to enquire into an accused’s character, or to ask questions which tend to show that he has previously committed a criminal offence. The fact that an accused may have committed an offence on one occasion does not, in any way, show that he is likely to commit an offence on any subsequent occasion: R v Miller (1952) 36 Cr App Rep 169 at 171 per Devlin J.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions of the Crown   


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence of both Lam and McLannen disclosed matters which were fundamentally inconsistent with an assertion by McNamara that he is a person of good character. It was submitted, in particular, that the evidence of McLannen constituted “the complete antithesis of the image (McNamara) would leave to the jury”, such that if the Crown was denied the opportunity to cross-examine McNamara about, and then lead, such evidence, unfairness would result. The Crown went so far as to say that if the present application was refused “significant injustice to the fair prosecution” of the charges against McNamara would eventuate. In making these submissions, the Crown acknowledged the caution with the present issue must be approached (as to which see Phillips (supra) at [39] above). However, it was submitted that to permit McNamara to go to the jury in the way in which counsel had opened, without anything being put to the contrary, would be fundamentally unfair to the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown stressed the importance of the evidence in the terms of s. 192(2)(c) of the Act. It was submitted, in particular, that the evidence of McLannen about what had occurred between himself and McNamara was corroborated by the finding of the statement on McNamara’s computer, and that the contents of that statement were “in complete harmony” with what McLannen says that McNamara told him.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it was also necessary that I consider the weight and relevance of the evidence. It was submitted that in the circumstances I have outlined, the weight of the evidence of both witnesses was significant. Although the Crown appeared to accept that there may be a distinction in this regard between McLannen’s evidence and that of Lam (due to the availability of independent corroboration of the former) it was submitted that the evidence of Lam nevertheless carried significant weight because it indicated that McNamara had used his position as a private investigator to elicit contacts and sources in order to involve himself in the distribution of illegal drugs.
	


Submissions of behalf of McNamara


	
	Counsel for McNamara submitted that the Crown’s asserted importance of the evidence was “overrated” and that an assessment of such importance involved a consideration of its reliability. In this respect, counsel pointed to the fact that Lam had apparently made his statement without an interpreter, and in circumstances where his English was limited, and that these factors necessarily affected the reliability of his evidence. It was further submitted that Lam’s statement was entirely self-serving and was given “in hope of a reward for assistance”. It was also submitted that the statement exhibited a willingness, on the part of Lam, to “jump on the bandwagon of a ‘high profile’ and serious trial.”
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that the evidence of both witnesses would add unduly to the length of the hearing because its admission “may also require the ventilation of further issues”. It was submitted, in particular, that there would be a consequent necessity for the jury to focus on the evidence which may, in turn, distract them from their task.
	
	
	In terms of the evidence of McLannen, and when pressed for a response to the Crown’s submission that the finding of the draft statement on McNamara’s computer corroborated McLannen’s evidence, counsel for McNamara described the Crown as having advanced a “bootstraps” submission, before then saying (at T325 L11):
	


“It may be a response that I will keep up my sleeve because I have already said it, that is, that statement was prepared after a conference with Mr McLannen and the contents of it sent. But that is a matter for evidence. You can infer from its contents that at the request of lawyers, not on a frolic of his own, and that assumes that Mr McLannen did not have or give or sign the statement that was prepared with him, like with Amy Knox.”


	
	When I asked counsel whether he was suggesting that the existence of the statement which was found on McNamara’s computer had been disclosed to McLannen before he made his statement to police in January of this year, counsel replied:
	


“That is exactly what I would be saying”.


	
	It was further submitted that properly analysed, what was in fact said by McLannen involved “an implicit threat verbally on one single occasion”. It was submitted on this basis that the weight, and probative value, of the evidence were marginal at best.
	
	
	As to the application made on behalf of Rogerson, it was submitted that the underlying reason for such application was to enable Rogerson to draw an inference (in the case of Lam’s evidence) that McNamara was the type of person who wanted to be involved in drug dealing, and (in the case of McLannen’s evidence) that he was the kind of person who would “commit perjury”. It was submitted that neither matter was relevant in terms of s. 55 of the Act and that the arguments of counsel for Rogerson disclosed tendency reasoning which should be rejected.
	
	
	Finally, counsel foreshadowed that in the event that I came to the conclusion that Rogerson’s application should be granted, it was likely that McNamara would make a further application for a separate trial (a previous application having been refused: R v Rogerson, R v McNamara (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 965).
	


Submissions on behalf of Rogerson


	
	Counsel for Rogerson submitted that it was necessary to view his application in the context of a trial in which McNamara would not only seek to blame Rogerson for the deceased’s murder, but would, in doing so, assert serious (and uncharged) criminal conduct on the part of Rogerson. It was submitted that in these circumstances, what might otherwise be the expected limits of a so-called “cut throat” defence had been substantially extended, so as to permit the cross-examination of McNamara as to his character, independent of any position taken by the Crown.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the evidence of both Lam and McLannen was relevant to facts in issue, and that it accordingly met the test of relevance in s. 55 of the Act. It was submitted, in particular, that an “ultimate fact in issue” in the present case was the acceptance or rejection of any defence propounded by McNamara, and the acceptance or rejection of any evidence that he gave. It was submitted that given the width of s. 55 of the Act, the evidence of both Lam and McLannen was relevant to that issue. It was further submitted that the evidence, if accepted, established that McNamara was a “stand over man” and that this was also relevant to the question of whether his account of the relevant events was accepted.
	


CONSIDERATION

The application of the Crown


	
	I turn firstly to the provisions of s. 192 of the Act.
	
	
	In terms of s. 192(2)(a), the evidence of Lam and McLannen will obviously add to the length of the trial to some degree, both in terms of the Crown’s cross-examination of McNamara and having regard to a case in reply. However, the relevant consideration is whether the trial would be lengthened “unduly” or, in other words, whether it would be lengthened to an unwarranted or inordinate degree. In my view, this would not be the case.
	
	
	The evidence in each case is relatively confined. Indeed, counsel for McNamara specifically pointed out in the course of submissions that in the case of McLannen, the evidence is limited to a single incident. Even though the Crown’s cross-examination of McNamara, and the case in reply, would obviously lead to the trial being lengthened, I do not consider that it would do so unduly, in the sense that I have described. The “further issues” referred to by counsel for McNamara, the ventilation of which, it was said, would add to the length of the trial, have not been identified. Further, I am not persuaded that the evidence would add unduly to the length of the trial because of the possibility of the jury being distracted. This is particularly so in circumstances where, as discussed further at [66] below, the jury would, if the evidence were admitted, be given a number of specific directions. Finally, in terms of the suggested undue lengthening of the trial, it is relevant to note that irrespective of the outcome of the present application, Lam will be called for the Crown in its case to prove the nature and extent of the association between the deceased and McNamara. It might reasonably be expected that at that time, there will be some cross-examination of Lam going to matters of credit.
	
	
	As to s. 192(2)(b), I am necessarily mindful of the right of the accused to a fair trial. Equally however, there is force in the submission that if the Crown’s application was refused, the inaccurate picture of the accused’s character with which the jury might be left would be unfair to the Crown. Issues of fairness must obviously be considered with respect to both parties.
	
	
	As to s. 192(2)(c), the evidence in each case is of obvious importance. That importance stems, in part, from the fact that it is wholly inconsistent with the case put on behalf of the accused as to his good character. In Lam’s case, I do not regard the fact that the statement was made without an interpreter as something which lessens its importance. Moreover, and although there is evidence of some assistance being given to Lam by the police, the proposition that the hope of such assistance was Lam’s motivation for making his statements is not supported by the evidence. It is also relevant that the assistance which has been provided to Lam was provided a long time after he had made his statements.
	
	
	In terms of the evidence of McLannen, I do not accept the submission that the mere fact that the evidence is limited to a single episode of conduct is a factor which adversely affects its weight. This is particularly so in circumstances where the evidence is objectively corroborated. In that regard, and whilst emphasis was obviously placed upon the fact that a draft statement was found on McNamara’s computer, that is not the only evidence which supports McLannen’s account of what took place. In particular there is evidence which establishes that McNamara was retained on behalf of Lam to obtain statements from persons which might assist his case, and that McLannen was one such person. It is also evident from the correspondence I have previously set out that McNamara spoke to, and prepared a statement for, McLannen, at or around the time that McLannen says that McNamara spoke with him. Moreover, the contents of the draft statement found on McNamara’s computer are, generally speaking, consistent with McLannen’s account of what McNamara said to him.
	
	
	I have noted (at [50]-[51] above) the submission made on behalf of McNamara that the weight of McLannen’s evidence was lessened by the fact that at the time of making his first statement to the police in January 2015, he was aware of the existence and content of the draft document found on McNamara’s computer. There is nothing within the terms of McLannen’s first statement which suggests, expressly or impliedly, that this is so. Moreover, the contents of McLannen’s second statement made in May 2015, tend to suggest that it was not until that time that he was made aware of the existence of the draft.
	
	
	Further, I have also noted that when this issue was agitated in the course of submissions counsel for McNamara indicated that he was keeping his position “up his sleeve”, following which he impliedly suggested that Wrench had been given a copy of the draft found on McNamara’s computer, as a consequence of which McLannen knew of its contents prior to making his first statement. I am obviously left to determine the present application on the basis of the evidence which is put before me. There is no evidence that Wrench was given a copy of the draft statement, be it by McNamara or by anyone else. There is no evidence that he provided it to McLannen. There is also no evidence that he otherwise made McLannen aware of its contents.
	
	
	In terms of s. 192(2)(d), these proceedings concern the prosecution of McNamara for serious criminal offences. It is obviously necessary to bear in mind, as I do, McNamara’s right to a fair trial. It is also necessary to bear in mind those authorities to which I have referred, which make it clear that caution must be exercised in determining whether the Crown should be permitted to take this course. That said, it is obviously not the case that the discretion can never be exercised in favour of allowing an application of this nature made by the Crown.
	
	
	As to s. 192(2)(e), in the event that the Crown’s application is granted, the jury will be directed as to how the evidence relied upon by the Crown can (and cannot) be used. In particular, the jury will be directed (inter alia) that:
	



	
	if they do not accept that the accused is a person of good character, the evidence called by the Crown cannot be used to strengthen the Crown case;
	
	
	they must not reason, because of the evidence called by the Crown, that the accused is more likely to have committed either of the offences with which he has been charged;
	
	
	the Crown did not call that evidence, and does not rely upon it, to establish the guilt of the accused in respect of either offence;
	
	
	the evidence was led on the issue of the accused’s good character only;
	
	
	it would be improper to use the evidence relied upon by the Crown for any purpose other than the question of the accused’s good character;
	
	
	if, after considering the evidence, they find that the accused is not a person of good character, they cannot then decide that he is a person of bad character, and proceed to use that finding against him; and
	
	
	if they are not satisfied that the accused is a person of good character, the law requires them to put all considerations of character out of their minds in determining whether or not they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of either of the offences alleged against him.
	



	
	In my view, the considerations mandated by s. 192 weigh generally in favour of granting the Crown’s application. However, it was made plain in Stanoevski that those considerations are not exhaustive, and that factors such as the weight of the evidence, and its relevance, must also be taken into account. For the reasons already expressed, and from the point of view of the Crown’s application, the evidence is clearly relevant. There are factors which might affect its weight. In Lam’s case, those factors include the assistance which he appears to have been given by the police. In McLannen’s case, those factors include that his statement, which includes reference to his own drug dealing activities, was induced. That said, in all of the circumstances, I am not persuaded that any of these factors affect the weight of the evidence to such an extent that the Crown’s application should be refused.
	
	
	In the course of submissions counsel for McNamara took me, at some length, to the decision in Huges. He relied, in particular, on that part of judgment of Priest JA at [31] where his Honour said:
	


“When a comparison is made of the relative advantage to the defence case and concomitant damage to the prosecution case from the supposed evidence of good character, and regard is then had to the very great prejudice occasioned to the appellant by the cross-examination, it is plain that the proper exercise of discretion dictated that the cross-examination not be allowed.”


	
	In Huges, the appellant had been indicted on 17 charges of sexual offending against his biological daughters. Part of the evidence sought to be led by the Crown in respect of bad character concerned a violent rape (with which the appellant had not been charged) of one of those daughters. The observations of Priest JA at [31] must be viewed in that light. Coghlan JA observed (at [46]) that an application to rebut an assertion of general good character by leading evidence of uncharged acts from a complainant in the trial was “completely novel”. Those circumstances do not apply in the present case.
	
	
	Further, in Huges some significance was placed on the fact that the Crown had left the making of its application to cross-examine the appellant until the completion of his evidence in chief (Priest JA at [32]). In this respect Lasry AJA said (in a passage to which my attention was specifically drawn) at [51]:
	


“In this case, the prosecutor left making his application to the trial judge until after counsel for the appellant had opened the evidence he was about to lead and the evidence-in-chief of the appellant was completed. I do not understand that counsel for the appellant had any notice of the consequences of his opening and questioning until the application was made. Clearly by the time the prosecutor made his application, he had determined that he wished to cross-examine the appellant about, among other matters, the US incident and, in the likely event that the appellant denied the occurrence of that incident, lead evidence of it by way of rebuttal on the issue of character assuming the trial judge upheld the application. The significance of that occurring at that time of the trial and the dangers of it must have been obvious. Assuming the appellant denied the allegation in cross-examination, then evidence would be led in rebuttal after the defence case had closed with the jury understanding that something both unusual and dramatic had happened. That is what occurred and the evidence from the complainant about this inadmissible and dramatic event was the last thing the jury heard from the witness box. It is very likely that the jury were significantly influenced by what had occurred.”


	
	Again, a clear distinction can be drawn between those circumstances and the present case.
	
	
	Counsel for McNamara also relied on Lasry AJA’s observation that prejudice had arisen because the evidence in question was “the last thing the jury heard from the witness box”. That will be the position in every case in which an application such as the present is granted. Whilst it is obviously a relevant consideration, I am not persuaded that it operates, either of itself or in combination with those other factors upon which McNamara relied, to defeat the Crown’s application in the present case. The observations of Lasry AJA were obviously made in the context of the evidence that the court was considering at that time. For the reasons that I have already expressed, the position in the present case is quite different. Moreover, the jury will be directed at length as to how the evidence can be used.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, the relevant considerations weigh in favour of the Crown’s application being granted. That being so, I must then consider whether the evidence ought be excluded having regard to the provisions of s. 137 of the Act. In my view, for the reasons I have stated, the probative value of the evidence in each case, as to the limited issue of McNamara’s character, is high. The directions that I have outlined will ensure that it is made plain to the jury that the evidence is before them on a limited basis, and for a limited purpose. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there will be no danger of the evidence being misused in any way. For these reasons, the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to McNamara.
	
	
	Finally, I should note that it was submitted on behalf of McNamara that if the evidence of good character were limited to leading evidence of the fact that McNamara has no prior convictions, it would not be open to the Crown to lead any of the evidence at all. I do not accept that submission. The nature of the evidence relied upon by the Crown, if accepted, discloses criminal conduct on the part of McNamara.
	
	
	It follows that in my view, the Crown’s application for leave to cross-examine McNamara, and to lead a case in reply, should be allowed.
	


The application of the accused Rogerson


	
	The fundamental question to be resolved in determining the application made on behalf of Rogerson is whether the evidence is relevant. If it is not, then the application cannot succeed. I have previously outlined the submissions made by Mr Thomas as to the asserted relevance of the evidence. I am not able to accept those submissions for a number of reasons.
	
	
	In the response to the Crown case statement filed on behalf of Rogerson pursuant to s. 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) the following was stated:
	


“In relation to the charge of murder, the accused denies that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise with the co-accused to murder the deceased. The accused was not present in the storage shed when a firearm was allegedly discharged causing the death of the deceased. After the accused entered the storage shed the co-accused made representations to the accused concerning the circumstances in which the firearm was discharged causing the death of the deceased and which representations the accused believed to be true.

In relation to the alternative charge of accessory after the fact to murder (notified by the Crown by letter dated 1 June 2015) the accused denies that he was an accessory after the fact to murder of the deceased and says that his conduct after the death of the deceased was undertaken in reliance upon the representations of the co-accused concerning the circumstances of the death of the deceased and in the belief that the representations were true.

In relation to the charge of supply prohibited drug, the accused denies that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise with the co-accused for supply of the prohibited drug”.


	
	That response raises two issues, namely whether Rogerson:
	



	
	was party to a joint criminal enterprise to murder the deceased; and
	
	
	was party to a joint criminal enterprise to supply a prohibited drug.
	



	
	The evidence the subject of the present application does not bear upon either of those issues. Even if the evidence established that McNamara was a “stand over man”, that does not bear upon any identified fact in issue in the present trial. I have noted (at [43] above) that evidence will be relevant if it tends to show that the version of the facts advanced by one accused is more probable than that advanced by another: Lowery (supra). That proposition encapsulates one of the submissions advanced on behalf of Rogerson. However the evidence in the present case is not relevant to that issue. The present circumstances are clearly distinguishable from those in Lowery where the evidence in question went directly to the likelihood or otherwise of the appellant’s account being accepted.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I am not persuaded that the evidence is relevant to the issues identified on behalf of Rogerson and the application made on his behalf is refused.

2767475,Hollis v R [2015] NSWDC 352,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Magistrate Milledge on 10 October 2014 when her Honour was sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court. The orders which her Honour made concerned a series of offences which came before the Court on three different dates.
	
	
	On 19 July 2013, Magistrate Milledge, sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court, dealt with the appellant for six offences. The first offence was using a false document to obtain a financial advantage or to cause a disadvantage. The second offence was using a false document to obtain a financial advantage or to cause a disadvantage. The third offence was possessing identification information to commit or to facilitate the commission of an indictable offence. The fourth offence was using a false document to obtain a financial advantage or to cause a disadvantage. The fifth offence was using a false document to obtain a financial advantage or cause disadvantage. The final offence was another of possessing identification information to commit or to facilitate the commission of an indictable offence. In essence, her Honour imposed a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for a period of four years.
	
	
	The appellant appealed to this Court and her appeal came on for hearing before her Honour Judge Woodburne on 18 September 2013. My learned colleague allowed the appeal, reducing the duration of the s 9 bond to three years, commencing on 18 September 2013.
	
	
	The appellant appeared before Magistrate O’Brien in the Burwood Local Court on 5 August 2013. On that occasion she had been charged with possessing identification information to commit or to facilitate the commission of an indictable offence. That was the third occasion on which she had committed that offence. The learned Magistrate imposed a s 9 bond for a period of two years.
	
	
	On 10 October 2014 the appellant again appeared before Magistrate Milledge, sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court. On that occasion she was charged with having unlawfully obtained goods in her personal custody. Magistrate Milledge revoked the earlier s 9 bonds, and in respect of the offence she imposed a sentence of imprisonment of six months and passed concurrent sentences of six months imprisonment in respect of each of the offences which had been earlier dealt with by s 9 bonds.
	
	
	The appellant appealed to this Court from the orders directing that she be incarcerated for six months. Initially the appellant appealed against the conviction recorded by Magistrate Milledge on 10 October 2014, but the conviction appeal was not pursued.
	
	
	On 18 February 2015 the matter came before me. I indicated that I ought to impose a sentence of imprisonment of one year. Prior to making that indication, I gave the appellant a Parker warning. Nevertheless she wished to proceed with the appeal, bearing in mind that I also expressed the view that it was appropriate that such a sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community. I then referred the appellant for assessment as to her suitability for intensive correction in the community. Proceedings were adjourned until 24 April 2015.
	
	
	An ICO assessment report, bearing dated 20 April 2015, recommended that the appellant was unsuitable for an ICO at that time, but sought an adjournment for six weeks in order that further urinalysis be made. Urinalysis had been conducted between 18 February 2015 and 20 April 2015 and returned some positive results and some negative results.
	
	
	The matter could not proceed before me on 24 April 2015 because, firstly, the appellant was unwell and provided to the Court a medical certificate certifying her incapacity to attend Court. I also noted that Community Corrections sought a six week adjournment in order to conduct further urinalysis, and I had before me a report of a general practitioner indicating that psychiatric assessment of the appellant was required. I was also at that time without the remarks on sentence of my colleague, Judge Woodburne. The matter was then adjourned to 12 June. On 6 June the matter was mentioned before me and I adjourned the matter and set it down for hearing today. The reason for that adjournment was that the appellant was about to enter the St John of God Hospital to undergo a residential rehabilitation program to seek to treat her drug addiction.
	
	
	There is now before me an updated ICO assessment report indicating that the appellant is suitable for an intensive correction order. She completed an AOD residential rehabilitation program at St John of God Hospital on 13 July 2015. The appellant was interviewed on 27 July 2015 by Community Corrections and advised the interviewing officer, Mr Stevenson, that she had benefited from the support she had received whilst an inpatient and since completing the inpatient program. However, she did admit that her mental health and emotional issues had become problematic and she was now being seen by a treating psychiatrist who believed that she should undergo hospitalisation for her psychiatric condition. The urinalysis carried out on 27 July 2015 was found to be negative. A report made by Dr Maree Chanter, a consultant psychiatrist practising at the St John of God Medical Centre at Burwood, confirms that the appellant is an inpatient under her care in the anxiety and depression program, a three week inpatient program. The report from Dr Chanter confirms that the appellant successfully completed the AOD inpatient program and had benefited greatly from it. She has continued to attend the St John of God Hospital outpatient program for those who have undergone the AOD treatment program. However, it was decided that the appellant needed inpatient admission for her anxiety in order to give her greater management skills for her anxiety condition. The appellant is still undergoing that inpatient treatment although has been given leave to be in court today. It is anticipated that she will be discharged from that three week inpatient program next Thursday, 20 August 2015.
	
	
	The updated ICO assessment report indicates that the Burwood Community Corrections community service organiser has confirmed that the appellant can start an ICO once she has completed the current program at the St John of God Hospital. Neither the solicitor appearing for the Crown today, nor the solicitor appearing for the appellant today, object to or wish to make any further submissions about my imposing an ICO for a period of one year commencing on 20 August 2015. I shall do so.
	
	
	Before me are remarks on sentence made by Magistrate Milledge and by my colleague Judge Woodburne. Those remarks on sentence were addressed personally to her. It is not my practice to use the second person when imposing any sentence. In light of the “lectures” delivered to the appellant by my learned colleague and by Magistrate Milledge, it would avail little my repeating their “admonitions” to her. Suffice to say that I am gratified that we have reached the present position.
	
	
	The appellant is now drug free. She has undergone the three week residential program to wean her from her addiction to alcohol but, more importantly, other drugs, in particular crystal methamphetamine and her psychiatric illness has been the subject of treatment and when the treatment is completed life should be more comfortable for her.
	
	
	She has now been living at home with her parents for some time in a stable and caring environment. She has found herself a worthwhile business giving her employment and that business flourishes when she is able to attend to it. All that has stopped her attending to it are the need to undergo residential treatment courses for her drug addiction and for her mental illness. It is in the long term interests of the appellant, the community in general and the government that offenders rehabilitate themselves. Much crime in our community results from drug addiction. If the appellant stays off drugs, I am confident she will not offend again.
	
	
	However, I must point out to the appellant this is her last chance of staying off of drugs. The offences which she has committed in the past are serious. She has been “lectured” on that by Magistrate Milledge and by Judge Woodburne. I need only point this out: if the maximum penalties for each of the offences for which the appellant has been dealt in the Local Court were applied she would have been sentenced to eight and a half years imprisonment. A large number of the offence are indictable. If she had been dealt with in this Court for all her offences, and if the maximum penalties were applied, she would have been incarcerated for some 43 and a half years.
	
	
	If the appellant does not comply with the intensive corrections order, it will be revoked by the Commissioner for Corrective Services and there is no recourse to this Court or to any court. If the ICO is broken a week after it is imposed and is revoked by the Commissioner for Corrective Services, the appellant will spend the next 51 weeks in gaol. If she successfully completes the ICO but again offends, it would be almost impossible for any judicial officer not to impose a sentence of imprisonment if the offender again commits any serious criminal offence.
	
	
	I am gratified that we have reached the stage we have, but the offender must realise that she must maintain her abstinence from drugs, comply with the ICO and stay away from crime.
	
	
	For those reasons I allow each of the appeals. In respect of each of the offences for which the appellant currently stands for sentence, I order that the offender serve a sentence of one year’s imprisonment to be served by way of correction in the community. The intensive correction order will commence on Monday 24 August 2015.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Is the form of that order all right? We don’t have standard for ICOs?
	
	
	SERCOMBE: I think it’s suitable if your Honour makes the mandatory conditions or imposes the mandatory conditions, but may I raise--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: If they’re mandatory I don’t need to impose.
	
	
	SERCOMBE: Yes, your Honour. I just wish to raise one matter with your Honour and obviously a matter for your Honour's discretion, but I have a concern in relation to the penalty of the goods in custody offence given that the maximum penalty is six months imprisonment that there is a lengthy--
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, you’re right.
	
	
	CARROLL: Perhaps they could be concurrent intensive corrections orders.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes.
	
	
	In respect of the appeal from the sentence imposed by Magistrate Milledge on 10 October 2014 in respect of H54056876, the sentence is a period of six months imprisonment to be served by way of intensive corrections in the community. Each sentence is wholly concurrent.

		08 February 2016",2015-08-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767478,Likumbo Makasa v R [2015] NSWCCA 259,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I am of the view that the application for an extension of time to appeal from the conviction on the counts in question should be dismissed and I will indicate briefly my reasons for that view.
	
	
	By notice dated 29 January 2013, Mr Makasa has sought an extension of time in which to appeal against his conviction on 19 August 2009 of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child above 14 years and under the age of 16 years contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The proposed grounds of appeal broadly contend that Mr Makasa’s conviction on those three counts is unsafe and unsatisfactory and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. They include the contention that the conviction was obtained by a combination of incompetence and deception and that as a result a miscarriage of justice has occurred. It is contended that there were material irregularities, the nature of which has not been identified in any submissions by Mr Makasa in the course of the trial.
	
	
	Mr Makasa was represented at the trial. He is not represented on the present application. There has been no appearance by Mr Makasa this morning when the matter was listed for hearing of this application and the transcript will record the attempts that have been made to confirm that Mr Makasa is aware that the matter is listed for hearing on this day.
	


History of the present proceedings


	
	The history of the proceedings has been outlined in two affidavits sworn by Mr George Galanos, a solicitor who is the managing lawyer of the CCA unit from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Those affidavits have been sworn on 16 May 2014 and 4 June 2014 respectively. Mr Galanos deposes to the procedural history of the matter from February 2013 through to 4 June 2014. Ms Crown informs the Court that her instructions are that those affidavits have been served as well as the Crown submissions on Mr Makasa, although at least as at the date of the second of the two affidavits that affidavit had not been able to be served on Mr Makasa according to Mr Galanos.
	
	
	Mr Galanos’s affidavits reveal a history of adjournments of the proceedings in order to permit Mr Makasa to pursue his attempts to obtain legal representation and a number of occasions when there was no appearance by Mr Makasa when the matter was before the Court of Criminal Appeal’s Registrar.
	
	
	The relevant chronology may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The matter was first listed for mention before the Registrar on 28 February 2013. There was no appearance by Mr Makasa. Mr Galanos deposes that it was understood at this time that Mr Makasa was being held at the Villawood Detention Centre and would need to be contacted by telephone. Mr Makasa’s affidavit of 30 January 2013 filed with his notice of application in these proceedings disclosed his then address as the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. The matter was stood over to 14 March 2013.
	
	
	On 14 March 2013, the matter was in the call-over list before the Registrar. Mr Makasa appeared by way of a telephone call to his mobile telephone. An adjournment of two weeks was granted for him to obtain legal advice. Mr Galanos deposes that a Legal Aid lawyer was present at the call-over and indicated that she would post a Legal Aid application to Mr Makasa.
	
	
	On 28 March 2013, Mr Ahmad of counsel appeared as amicus and, among other things, sought an adjournment for an advice on merits to be obtained. The Legal Aid lawyer present at the call-over informed the Court that a Legal Aid application had been lodged by Mr Makasa. An adjournment was granted to 24 April 2013.
	
	
	On 24 April 2013, a Legal Aid lawyer was present at the call-over and advised the Registrar that no determination had yet been made regarding the application for Legal Aid. The matter was adjourned to 9 May 2013.
	
	
	On 9 May 2013, the Registrar was informed that legal aid had not been granted and the matter was stood over to 23 May 2013.
	
	
	On 23 May 2013, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of telephone call to his mobile phone. He confirmed he had been refused legal aid and said that he intended to write to the Law Society. An adjournment was granted to 20 June 2013.
	
	
	On 20 June 2013, Mr Makasa again appeared before the Registrar by way of a telephone call to his mobile phone and said that he had lodged an appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee against the refusal of legal aid. The matter was adjourned to 1 August 2013.
	
	
	On 1 August 2013, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of telephone call to his mobile phone and informed the Registrar that the Legal Aid Review Committee had yet to make a determination and that the review was expected to be resolved by 21 August 2013. The matter was adjourned to 29 August 2013.
	
	
	On 29 August 2013, the matter was in the Registrar’s call-over list. Attempts were made to ring Mr Makasa on his mobile phone without success. The matter was adjourned to 12 September 2013.
	
	
	On 12 September 2013, Mr Makasa appeared by way of telephone call to his mobile phone when the matter was again before the Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar. He said that the Legal Aid Review Committee had refused his application for legal aid and that he intended to write to the Bar Association. He informed the Registrar that he had not received any legal advice. A Ms Karen Psaltis from Legal Aid who was present at the call-over informed the Registrar that Mr Makasa had received advice. Mr Makasa sought an adjournment so that he could find someone to represent him. Ms Psaltis informed Mr Makasa that she would provide him with contact details for the Law Society pro bono scheme. The matter was adjourned to 10 October 2013.
	
	
	On 10 October 2013, the matter was in the Registrar’s call-over list. Attempts were made to ring Mr Makasa on his mobile without success. The matter was adjourned to 24 October 2013.
	
	
	On 24 October 2013, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of telephone call to his mobile phone. He informed the Registrar that he had contacted the pro bono scheme and forwarded his case to a “few people” but that no one was yet available. He also said he had made some contact with solicitors but had not received any reply. The matter was stood over to 21 November 2013.
	
	
	On 21 November 2013, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of telephone call to his mobile phone. He informed the Registrar that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had made a decision about the cancellation of his visa and that he was now released (presumably from the Villawood Detention Centre where he was being held at least as at February 2013). Mr Makasa said that a barrister would be assisting him with his appeal and that he needed to obtain advice from a legal firm. The matter was stood over to 19 December 2013.
	
	
	On 19 December 2013, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of telephone call to his mobile phone. He informed the Registrar that senior counsel was going to see if they could assist him and that his legal representative from the AAT proceedings was awaiting advice. The matter was stood over to 30 January 2014.
	
	
	On call-overs on both 30 January 2014 and 13 February 2014, attempts were made to ring Mr Makasa on his mobile phone without success. The matter was adjourned to 27 February 2014.
	
	
	On 27 February 2014, Mr Makasa appeared before the Registrar by way of a telephone call to his mobile phone. He said that he did not have any funds to pay for legal representation and that he would pursue a different avenue. He asked if the Court would provide him with representation and was informed that this was not possible. He asked for more time to obtain legal representation. The matter was adjourned to 27 March 2014.
	
	
	On 27 March 2014, attempts were made to ring Mr Makasa on his mobile phone without success during the call-over. The matter was adjourned to 10 April 2014.
	
	
	On 10 April 2014, there was no appearance by or on behalf of Mr Makasa during the call-over. Mr Galanos cannot recall if attempts were made to contact Mr Makasa on his mobile phone on that occasion. The matter was stood over to 8 May 2014.
	
	
	On 8 May 2014, there was again no appearance by Mr Makasa at call-over. The matter was stood over to 22 May 2014 and an application by the Crown for summary dismissal of the appeal was foreshadowed. That application was not pursued.
	
	
	On 22 May 2014, there was no appearance of Mr Makasa at the call-over. A call was placed to his mobile phone by the court officer. A male answered the phone. The Court of Criminal Appeal Registrar asked to speak to Mr Makasa; the male said that Mr Makasa was not available for approximately 15 minutes; and the Registrar asked for him to relay a message to Mr Makasa that he should ring the Registry in relation to this appeal. Mr Galanos deposes that, having heard Mr Makasa’s voice during prior telephone calls placed to him in earlier call-overs, he believes it was Mr Makasa who answered the call.
	
	
	At 11.30am on 27 May 2014, Mr Galanos telephoned Mr Makasa’s mobile phone and left a voicemail message informing him that he needed to serve some documents in relation to the appeal. At 12.15pm on 28 May 2014, Mr Galanos made a similar phone call and left a similar message. At 9.40am on 4 June 2014, Mr Galanos again rang Mr Makasa’s mobile phone and left a similar message, including that the matter was listed for mention on 5 June 2014. Mr Galanos deposed that he did not have information regarding Mr Makasa’s address and had been unable to serve him with a copy of that affidavit or with the application for summary dismissal. (As noted earlier the Court is informed that the Crown’s instructing solicitor’s instructions are that Mr Makasa has been served with the affidavits as well as submissions on this application).
	
	
	Most recently, on 12 March 2015, the matter was mentioned in the call-over list before Justice Hulme and listed for hearing on today’s date. Mr Makasa appeared in person at the call-over on 12 March 2015. An order was made on that occasion that he file written submissions by 17 July 2015. That order has not been complied with. The court officer has this morning at 10.10am rung Mr Makasa’s mobile phone and has left a message in relation to the listing of the appeal for hearing today. The court officer has also spoken to a barrister formerly appearing for Mr Makasa who has advised that he spoke with Mr Makasa last week and that Mr Makasa is aware that the matter is listed for hearing today.
	


Determination


	
	Given that the Court’s records indicate that Mr Makasa appeared at the call-over on 12 March 2015 when the matter was listed for hearing today, and the history of the matter which has been summarised, and the fact that for the reasons I will shortly give Mr Makasa’s application is doomed to failure, I consider it is appropriate to proceed with the matter in his absence.
	
	
	The Court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against Mr Makasa’s conviction in respect of the three counts in question (counts 8, 10 and 16) because Mr Makasa has already brought an appeal from another count which was contained in the same indictment (count 1) that being a count of aggravated sexual assault in respect of the same complainant. That appeal was heard on 6 August 2010 and resulted in Mr Makasa’s conviction in respect of the aggravated sexual assault charge being quashed. The case is reported in R v Tyrone Chishimba, Tyrone Chishimba v R; Likumbo Makasa v R, R v Likumbo Makasa; Mumbi Peter Mulenga v R, R v Mumbi Peter Mulenga (2010) NSWCCA 228. The outcome of the Court’s decision on that occasion was that Mr Makasa’s sentence for the three counts the subject of the present application was backdated and he was released from custody.
	
	
	In Morgan v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 80 Beazley P, with whom Hidden J and Harrison J agreed, considered the relevant legislation and relevant authorities, including R v Grierson (1933) 50 WN (NSW) 71, and held that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine more than one appeal from an indictment that contains multiple counts. Mr Makasa, in his affidavit sworn January 2013 and filed at the time of filing of his notice of application to extend the time for the filing of his appeal, acknowledges that he had legal advice at the time of his first appeal as to the prospects of a challenge to his conviction in respect of counts 8, 10 and 16.
	
	
	Though he there expressed bitter disappointment with that course of action he nevertheless appreciated that his then appeal was only brought in respect of the more serious conviction of aggravated sexual assault without consent contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Makasa’s affidavit does not deal with the reason for the delay in bringing the application for extension of time to appeal but in any event it is not necessary to consider this. The Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the conviction appeal Mr Makasa now seeks to bring. His application for an extension of time for the filing of an appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES: I agree with Ward JA and the orders her Honour proposes.

2767480,Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: Matthew Cowling pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Act. Following a short hearing before the primary judge on 3 October 2014, her Honour imposed, on 9 October 2014, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 5 months commencing on that day, a sentence which incorporated a reduction of 25% for the offender’s early guilty pleas. In accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), her Honour indicated that she would have imposed a sentence of 3 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years, for the sexual intercourse without consent count, and a head sentence of 16 months for the indecent assault count.
	
	
	Mr Cowling seeks leave to appeal against that sentence, pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). He relies upon two grounds, namely that: “(a) [h]er Honour erred in finding that the offences were aggravated by the applicant abusing a position of trust in relation to the victim, and (b) her Honour erred in finding that the assault was rendered more serious by the applicant’s ‘persistence in the face of the movements (the victim) made in opposition to the assault’”. It will be necessary later in these reasons to explain the facts underlying each of those grounds. For present purposes, it suffices to say that when the application for leave was heard, the Crown formally acknowledged that each of those two grounds had been made out. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave.
	
	
	The hearing on 3 October 2014 was relatively brief. The matter proceeded by way of statement of agreed facts, with neither the offender nor the victim giving testimonial evidence. (In these reasons, I follow the course taken in the Court below, and in submissions in this Court, and refer to the complainant as the victim.) Her Honour also had before her documentary material including a pre-sentence report tendered by the Crown and a psychological report tendered by the offender.
	


The circumstances of the offending


	
	On the evening of 4 December 2013, the offender was aged 22 and the victim was aged 20. The victim had known him for approximately five years and had been in a relationship with the offender’s best friend, Mr Laird. Although the couple had separated prior to the evening on which the offences occurred, they remained friends.
	
	
	On 4 December 2013, Mr Laird returned from a holiday in Cairns and was collected from the airport in Sydney and driven to Newcastle by the offender. During that journey, Mr Laird made arrangements to collect the victim from her home address, with a view to their returning to Mr Laird’s address in Charlestown, Newcastle to have some drinks. The offender and Mr Laird purchased a carton of beer and one bottle of pre-mixed bourbon and cola before collecting the victim from her home at around 11.30pm. After arriving at Mr Laird’s home, the three started drinking. The victim had only one drink (the pre-mixed bottle of bourbon and cola) throughout the night. The statement of agreed facts continued:
	


“9. Laird went to bed at approximately 3.30am the following morning. The victim and offender remained in the upstairs loungeroom and continued talking. The offender asked the victim a number of times whether she would sleep on the mattress in the spare bedroom. The victim was uncomfortable with the idea of staying in the spare bedroom, where the offender was also sleeping, and the victim told the offender she would remain on the lounge.

10. The victim eventually laid down on the lounge and told the offender she would catch an early bus home. The offender told the victim that he would give her a lift home later that morning. The offender said to the victim, ‘You look tired, just go to sleep’. The victim replied, ‘There’s no point going to sleep now. I’ll be more tired when I wake up’. The offender told the victim, ‘It’s better to get some sleep even if it’s just an hour or two. Just go to sleep’. The victim fell asleep.

11. The victim awoke to find the accused touching her bottom and rubbing her anus. The victim pretended to be asleep but moved slightly, hoping this would cause the offender to stop. The victim moved onto her back.

12. The offender put his hand down the victim’s pants and touched her vagina underneath her underpants.

13. The offender removed his hands from the victim’s underpants and pulled her legs apart by holding her ankles and calves. The victim closed her legs, but the offender again pulled them apart. The victim continued to pretend to be asleep.

14. The offender pulled the victim[’s] pants down to her mid-thigh, and then pulled her underpants to the side.

15. The offender licked the victim’s vagina in an up and down motion.

16. The offender pulled the victim’s pants down further and again pulled the victim’s legs apart, and then continued to lick the victim’s vagina.

17. The offender stopped and then lifted the victim’s top and lifted her bra, exposing her breasts, the offender then put his mouth over the victim’s breast and began to suck the victim’s breast. After a short period, the offender stopped, and pulled the victim’s shirt back down.

18. The offender also pulled the victim’s pants back up.

19. The offender tapped the victim on the chin and said, ‘Are you coming on the mattress’. The victim acted as though she didn’t realise what had occurred and replied, ‘No, I’m right’. The offender went to the spare bedroom.

20. The victim was shaking and scared. The victim sent some messages to her niece saying ‘I need you. I’m a mess. Don’t tell mum’. The victim also told Laird what had occurred before leaving the house, and contacting a friend, who then collected the victim from the McDonald’s restaurant at Charlestown. The victim immediately reported the matter to Charlestown Police.

21. The offender attended Toronto Police Station on 10 December 2013 and was arrested. The offender participated in an electronically recorded interview, and told Police that he had no memory of the offences and a limited memory of the evening.”

Both grounds of appeal are made out


	
	Both grounds of appeal are based on her Honour’s assessment of objective seriousness of the s 61I offence, at [20]-[35] of her remarks on sentence. First, her Honour rejected a submission that the pre-existing relationship of friendship tended to lessen the seriousness of the offence. Her Honour said:
	


“The fact that this assault occurred in the context of a social event amongst friends adds a layer of seriousness to the offender’s crimes in my view. [The victim] was at the home of her good friend, in his company and that of the offender, another friend. There was a relationship of trust between the three, demonstrated by the fact that Mr Laird was prepared to go to bed and leave his friends awake in the lounge room, and by [the victim’s] preparedness to go to sleep in the offender’s presence. Sleep necessarily involves a degree of vulnerability. Plainly, Mr Laird felt that his friends were safe in his absence, and [the victim] felt that she was safe to go to sleep even whilst the offender remained awake.

That the offender abused the trust of not just his friend Mr Laird, but more critically, the trust of [the victim], heightens the gravity of the crime and the offender’s moral culpability for it.”


	
	Her Honour also relied on the continuation of the assault after the complainant’s resistance, as indicative of its relative seriousness, as follows:
	


“Here, the act of cunnilingus must be viewed in the context of an assault which had commenced when the victim was asleep, which involved exposing her genitals and breasts, and which had continued on for some period, despite the attempts [the victim] made to cause the offender to stop, by moving her body, closing her legs and so on.”


	
	Her Honour then summarised this part of her analysis, in a passage which was plainly material to her assessment of objective seriousness, by stating:
	


“The breach of trust involved, and the offender’s persistence in the face of the movements [the victim] made in opposition to the assault, renders the act more serious.”


	
	In my view, the Crown’s concession of error in respect of both grounds was properly made. In relation to the first, the offender’s written submissions proceeded on the basis that although her Honour did not in terms use the language of the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of abusing “a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim”, her Honour’s remarks were to be read as if such a finding had been made. The Crown’s concession was based on the same reading.
	
	
	It is well-settled law that more must be established than a mere breach of trust in order for the statutory factor to be made out. In Karl Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [22], Howie J, with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J, said of the factor that:
	


“This aggravating factor is not made out simply because the victim trusted the offender for some reason or other[.] ... The relevant factor is that there was at the time of the offending a particular relationship between the offender and the victim that amounted to ‘a position of trust’. It is a special relationship existing between them and transcends the usual duty of care arising between persons in the community in their everyday contact or their business and social dealings.”

See further Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [52]-[54].


	
	Her Honour did not refer to s 21A(2)(k) in terms. Nor did her Honour use the language of the paragraph. No submission framed in terms of the paragraph was advanced by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. If her Honour’s language were to be read as amounting to a finding that that factor was made out, then plainly enough there would be error. However, on a fair reading of her Honour’s remarks, I would not regard her Honour as having found that statutory aggravating factor to have been established.
	
	
	On a fair reading of the sentencing remarks, I consider that her Honour was merely concluding that the fact that the offender and the complainant were friends and trusted each other meant that the offending conduct was objectively more serious. That reflected the Crown’s submission at sentencing (“Your Honour, there’s a significant breach of trust, breach of friendship here in these facts”). Nevertheless, that reasoning discloses error. The friendship between victim and offender supplied the occasion and the opportunity for the assaults. That is why the victim got into a car driven by the offender and travelled with him and her former partner to the latter’s house at 11.30 at night. But those circumstances did not increase the seriousness of the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	In relation to the second ground, her Honour’s findings were confined to the statement of agreed facts, and inferences flowing from that statement, which, if unfavourable to the offender, were required to be established beyond reasonable doubt:  R v Kirkland [2005] NSWCCA 130 at [13]-[16] (Hunt AJA, Grove and Hall JJ agreeing); SV v State of Western Australia [2014] WASCA 123 at [112] (Mazza JA, McLure P and Pullin JA agreeing); see also Olbrich v The Queen [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [27] citing R v Storey [1998] 1 VR 359 at 369. The statement of agreed facts established that the complainant “moved slightly” after being touched by the offender while pretending to be asleep (paragraph 11) and closed her legs after the offender had removed his hand from inside her underpants and had pulled her legs apart, again while pretending to be asleep (paragraph 13), after which he pulled down her pants (paragraph 14).
	
	
	Those facts are incapable of supporting a conclusion that the offender persisted “in the face of movements made by the complainant in opposition to the assault” rendering the act more serious. In order for that conclusion to affect the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, it was necessary to draw an inference as to the offender’s state of mind, namely, that the offender believed the victim was resisting him, or at least was recklessly indifferent as to whether that was the case. Otherwise there was merely an absence of consent. But the facts are silent as to the offender’s state of mind, and it cannot safely be inferred that the offender believed that he was persisting over her opposition, in circumstances where the victim continued to pretend to be asleep. This is not to be in any way critical of the victim adopting that course. She should never have been placed in a position where she had to choose between manifestly resisting the offender’s assaults, or pretending to sleep and hoping he would desist. But it was with respect wrong for her Honour to find that the offending conduct was more serious on the basis of what was contained in the agreed facts. The Crown correctly accepted that all that could be taken from the statement of agreed facts was that there was an absence of consent.
	
	
	For those reasons, I would accept the Crown’s concessions that both grounds of appeal are made out.    It falls to this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42], by identifying all the factors relevant to the sentence, discussing their significance and then making a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [26].
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The primary judge correctly regarded the objective gravity of the sexual assault as falling at the lower end of the range. It involved no violence or coercion or other threat or intimidation. The statement of agreed facts does not disclose how many seconds or minutes passed during which the assault took place, although its short duration (if that was what is was) would not ordinarily be regarded as a factor which reduced its objective seriousness: R v Daley [2010] NSWCCA 223 at [48].
	
	
	It is generally accepted that some forms of sexual assault may be regarded as less serious than others, although in every case what matters is the context in which the assault occurs: R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172; 187 A Crim R 152 at [26]; CS v R [2014] NSWCCA 229 at [44]; cf Ibbs v R (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 452. The offender’s acts of cunnilingus were, in the context in which they occurred, towards the lower end of the large range of conduct defined in s 61H to amount to “sexual intercourse”.
	
	
	The indecent assault (sucking the complainant’s breast) took place immediately after the sexual assault. Again, there was no violence or coercion or threat or intimidation. The offender withdrew to the spare bedroom after the complainant declined his invitation to join him there on the mattress.
	
	
	Her Honour did not explicitly ascribe a level of objective seriousness to the indecent assault, but once again, I would regard it as falling at the lower end of the range. Relevant to questions of accumulation, the only conclusion available to be drawn from the statement of agreed facts is that both offences were part of the same course of conduct as the sexual assault.
	
	
	In both cases, it is to be borne in mind that the complainant was left shaking and scared following the assaults on her, and took the steps referred to in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the statement of agreed facts set out above.
	


The offender’s subjective case


	
	No issue was taken with the summary given by the primary judge of the offender’s subjective circumstances, from which the following is drawn. (Much in turn comes from what is recorded in the report of the offender’s psychologist, Dr Nicholas, which was tendered without objection at the sentencing hearing.)
	
	
	The offender was born on 20 April 1991. His parents divorced when he was 3 years old. The offender’s custody was shared by his parents until he was aged 11 years. For the next 4 years the offender lived with his father. He said he was “kicked out of home” when he was 15 and moved between various refuge centres. At the same time he was expelled from school. The offender attempted year 10 at TAFE, but was unsuccessful.
	
	
	The offender said of that period, “My life was chaotic. I was self-harming and using pot and alcohol”. His forearms and, so Dr Nicholas was told, his thighs, revealed “train track” scars with multiple parallel lines which were the result of using razor type implements.
	
	
	The offender told Dr Nicholas that he had held a succession of casual and temporary jobs over the years, preferring to work rather than to receive social security. He lost his last position through taking prolonged leave, and applied to receive Newstart allowance.
	
	
	The offender has one daughter, aged 6 years old when he was sentenced, who was in her mother’s custody, but whom he had seen regularly. The breakdown of the offender’s relationship with the child’s mother when the offender was aged about 17 sent the offender spiralling into such heavy drug and alcohol use that he claims to have no memory of the three month period following his separation from his former partner.
	
	
	A subsequent relationship collapsed in early 2014 (after the offending conduct), leading to a four day binge on illicit drugs and alcohol. At the time of sentencing, the offender and his partner had reconciled as the offender had reduced his alcohol intake.
	
	
	The offender reported a similar blackout on the night of these offences to that he experienced at 17. He claimed to be “99% sure that I used pot” and “I was drinking pretty hard”. He said that he had no recollection of what had occurred on the evening, but said: “If I’ve done what they said I’ve done then I do feel bad about it”. Her Honour concluded, and I agree, that the offender’s guilty pleas provided some evidence of remorse for his crimes.
	
	
	The offender claimed that he understood the detrimental effects of his substance abuse, and that he had reduced his consumption of drugs and alcohol. There is some confirmation of that in comments made by the offender’s partner to the author of the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	In 2010 and 2011 the offender was subject to drug and alcohol counselling as a requirement of parole after serving a prison term for robbery. The pre-sentence report noted that the offender complied satisfactorily with the conditions of his parole. However, he was unable to maintain the progress he made, and slipped back into substance abuse. At around the same time as the robberies, the offender was also convicted of resisting officers in the execution of their duty and contravening an apprehended violence order.
	
	
	In May 2014, while awaiting sentencing for the offences the subject of this appeal, the offender was convicted of driving with high range PCA and negligent driving. He was disqualified from driving for two years, and was being supervised by the Probation and Parole Service as a condition of a s 9 bond imposed upon him.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report stated that the offender would benefit from a period of structured interventions under the supervision of Community Corrections. It recommended that the offender participate in a specialist sex offender program, either in the community or whilst in custody, in combination with drug and alcohol counselling and mental health treatment.
	
	
	Alcohol contributed to the offender’s crimes on 5 December 2013, just as it had to other destructive features of his life. The pre-sentence assessment stated:
	


“Mr Cowling appears to attribute his offending behaviour to alcohol use. He has a history of problematic alcohol and other drug use [including] alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy. He has a history of mental health intervention and has been prescribed various psychotropic medications in the past. Mr Cowling has a history of suicide ideation and has two past psychiatric admissions.”


	
	To similar effect, Dr Nicolas concluded:
	


“Mathew Cowling’s early adolescence precipitated ongoing severe dysfunction. He has a marked incapacity to sustain relationships which when lost result in significant emotional distress, unresolved grief and hopelessness. His addiction to alcohol and polysubstance abuse attests to this sense of hopelessness resulting in a cyclic process which supports and exacerbates his Psychological Injury. Matthew Cowling is at high risk of taking his own life.” (original emphasis)


	
	Dr Nicholas suggested a treatment plan to address the offender’s mental health diagnosis. He was of the view that the offender suffered from a chronic Adjustment Disorder of Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood and noted some psychotic features indicated by suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviours. He also expressed the view that the offender experienced a psychological injury “precipitating clinical depression and co-morbid severe anxiety”, following the offender’s history of depressive symptoms since he was 15 years.
	


The offender’s prospects of rehabilitation


	
	The matter that I have found most problematic is assessing the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The offender had been assessed by a government psychologist, following a review of the file but no direct interviews with the offender or his family, as “falling in the Moderate to High risk category relative to other male sexual offenders” (original emphasis). That assessment was then restated in the pre-sentence report as follows:
	


“According to the Level of Services Inventory – Revised actuarial risk/needs assessment tool, the offender is assessed as a medium / high risk of re-offending.” (sic, original emphasis)


	
	It is important to bear in mind what those emboldened words mean, and how they have been derived. That said, neither party directed submissions to the psychological assessment or the pre-sentence report, so that the following reflects views untested by argument.
	
	
	The psychological assessment was based upon a particular methodology (“Static-99R”). It fairly disclosed that that methodology had not been validated against New South Wales offenders. The offender’s score in respect of 10 simple questions was compared with scores of some 8,000 offenders from North America, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Denmark (the report stated that there was no reason to expect substantially different outcomes in New South Wales). The offender scored 5, from a maximum of 12, by reason of the facts that he was under 35, had not been in a live-in relationship for longer than 2 years, had a conviction for non-sexual violence, had four or more sentencing dates, and his victim was unrelated, known to him and female.
	
	
	That is to say, entirely irrelevant to the scoring and assessment of risk of re-offending was the offender’s alcohol and substance abuse which had been the occasion for his criminality throughout his life. That is what is meant, I infer, by the statement in the report that “individual characteristics that relate to recidivism rates will not have been explored”.
	
	
	The assessment stated that non-Australian offenders who had achieved the same score had recidivism rates of between 11% and 25% over 5 years, and between 23% and 36% over 10 years. That is to say, if the overseas population was comparable, then the most likely result (with a probability of between 64% and 77%) was that the offender would not reoffend in the next decade. The assessment made no attempt to reconcile its conclusion of “medium to high risk of re-offending” and the most likely result that there would be no reoffending over the next decade. The assessment gave prominence to what it regarded as a high relative risk of recidivism, and downplayed a relatively low absolute risk. It is easy to see how this could cause confusion. Indeed, the conflation of relative risk and absolute risk may explain the translation of the assessment of Mr Cowling as in the “Moderate to High risk category relative to other male sexual offenders” in the psychological assessment, to “the offender is assessed as a medium/high risk of reoffending” in the pre-sentence report.
	
	
	The assessment said that 7% of the overseas group scored 5, and only 11% scored more than 5. It was asserted:
	


“The recidivism rate of individuals convicted/charged with sexual offences with the same score as Mr Cowling would be expected to be 2.7 times that of the ‘typical’ sexual offender”.


	
	There is an illusory and potentially deceptive precision in that conclusion. Left unstated is what precisely a “typical” sexual offender is, perhaps for the good reason that it is impossible to do so, having regard to the width of conduct proscribed and the variety of ways in which such conduct could be perpetrated. The difficulties in identifying a “typical” offender are obviously exacerbated when data is pooled from overseas legal systems, which doubtless have different offences, different procedures for detection and prosecution, and different approaches to rehabilitation. I readily accept that the statement is meaningful as a matter of statistical analysis, but that does not mean that it translates into decisions relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Pre-sentence reports are important. They influence decisions made by busy judges which will have significant impacts upon the lives of offenders, those affected directly by their conduct, and the wider community. There is no reason why statistical analysis need play no part in an assessment of risk, especially if it were shown to be at least moderately predictive, and its limitations were borne in mind. Those limitations may be more or less significant depending on the particular case.
	
	
	Although her Honour referred without criticism to some of the conclusions from the “Static-99R” assessment, it would appear that her Honour shared, at least to an extent, my concerns about its utility and reliability. The primary judge was faced with a difficult assessment. Her Honour said:
	


“It is difficult to make any prediction as to the offender’s future prospects with confidence in its accuracy. If the offender’s claim to Dr Nicholas, to have attained some level of insight into the destructive choices he has made in the past, is real and will remain so beyond his appearance before this Court, then there is some hope that can be held out for the offender's rehabilitation. However, the lost opportunities of the past dictate a degree of circumspection.”


	
	This Court is in a somewhat better position. It has the benefit of the uncontroverted evidence of the offender, by his affidavit made on 14 July 2015. He said that he was keen to rehabilitate himself, and did not wish to commit any offence against anyone, “especially against someone I know and like”. He had applied to participate in the sex offender program, but had not to date been successful. He was willing to do such a program either in custody or in the community. He had not been able to undertake Alcohol and Other Drug Programs, because they were not available at the South Coast Correctional Centre, where he has been since 8 November 2014. He has enrolled in and completed Certificate I “Access to Work and Training” (a course which includes general educational subjects, and practical skills such as first aid and a barista course). In July 2015, he enrolled in the Certificate II course. He said he had strong family support, although since being moved from Cessnock to Nowra had had only two visits from his family because of the distance to travel. He hoped to live with his grandmother at Mildura if released on parole, “to put some distance between myself and past associates especially for the first period after release”.
	
	
	The offender had committed no offences against gaol discipline since being sentenced.
	
	
	I respectfully agree with the primary judge that the offender’s prospects of reoffending are difficult to assess. In large measure they depend upon his being able, ideally with the assistance of a structured program during his parole, to free himself from the substances which, and associates who, have led to an escalating pattern of criminality over the last eight years. That emerges from the facts individual to the offender and his history, confirmed by the psychologist assessment, rather than a statistical extrapolation.
	


Comparable sentences


	
	The maximum penalty for the offence contrary to s 61I is 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The offence contrary to s 61L carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.
	
	
	A very wide range of conduct can constitute sexual intercourse without consent. Statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission for 207 cases between October 2007 and September 2014 show that 88% of offences received a full-time custodial sentence, although 10% received a suspended sentence. Within the 88% of full-time custodial sentences, there is a relatively wide range of sentences imposed: 90% fall within the band from 2½ years to 9 years, with the median being between 4 and 5 years imprisonment. Sentencing statistics can and should provide guidance as a useful yardstick: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]; Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 253 CLR 58 at [41]. However, their limitations must also be recognised, especially where, as here, such a wide range of conduct can amount to the offence.
	
	
	The parties were invited, following the hearing, to supply materials to assist the task of resentencing. The Crown provided three decisions, two from this Court, both of which involved multiple counts. More helpful was a table supplied by the offender of 11 decisions of this Court where there had been convictions for offences contrary to s 61I and where the objective seriousness had been assessed as low to below mid-range. The following three decisions are taken from that table; they appeared to share some significant features with the present case.
	
	
	In McCartney v R [2009] NSWCCA 244, there was penile-vaginal sexual assault by a 22 year old man of otherwise good character upon a female victim known to him, who returned to the offender’s home early in the morning following a night out, and who made her lack of consent very clear. An appeal against a sentence whose starting point (before a discount for a plea) was 3 years was dismissed, with the Court stating that it was “difficult to conceive how a lesser sentence than that assessed by his Honour could be imposed for this offence”: at [26]. There was a finding of special circumstances, and the sentence imposed was imprisonment for 30 months, with a non-parole period of 18 months.
	
	
	In Sabapathy v R [2008] NSWCCA 82, the victim was affected by alcohol, there was penile-vaginal intercourse, by a man of good character with good prospects of rehabilitation. After allowing for a 12% discount for the offender’s plea, a custodial sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months was imposed. This Court stated that no less severe sentence was warranted in law: at [77].
	
	
	In R v JRB [2006] NSWCCA 371, a Crown appeal against sentence was allowed. The sexual assault involved penile/vaginal intercourse, upon an intoxicated sleeping friend. JRB had been sentenced, following a guilty verdict at trial, to 3 years imprisonment, but with a non-parole period of only 3 months. That sentence was quashed, and the non-parole period extended to 15 months with a balance of sentence of 21 months (the effect of which was to leave in place the head sentence of 3 years imprisonment).
	
	
	More recently, Badans v R [2012] NSWCCA 97 was a case where there was penile-vaginal intercourse with a sleeping victim, without the use of a condom. A Crown appeal, including on the ground that the sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year was manifestly inadequate, was dismissed. This Court said that the sentence was “at the low end of the range of sentence for this offence”, but was not manifestly inadequate (the very low non-parole period principally reflected the offender’s intellectual disability).
	


Resentencing the offender


	
	Any sexual intercourse without consent is a serious offence. If it be the case that the offender had no recollection of his assaults because of his abuse of alcohol and other substances, that does not reduce his criminality. Moreover, the offender’s criminal history leads me clearly to the conclusion that this is not one of the small minority of cases where a sexual assault should not result in a sentence of full-time imprisonment. Having considered all other alternatives, no penalty other than full-time imprisonment is appropriate: s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The measure of the offender’s criminality is less than that manifested in McCartney, Sabapathy and JRB because of the circumstances of the offences, especially, the absence of violence or coercion or intimidation. Against this, the offender’s criminal history is considerably worse, and it is very difficult to express a view about the prospects of his rehabilitation.
	
	
	I respectfully agree with the approach adopted by the primary judge that an aggregate sentence is appropriate. Here there was, in substance, a single course of conduct, although amounting to two discrete offences. Further, this is clearly a case where special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are made out, having regard to the offender’s substance abuse and efforts which need to be made to address that abuse. There should, as well, be a discount of 25% for the offender’s guilty plea.
	
	
	In accordance with s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I indicate that I would have imposed a sentence of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 17 months, for the sexual assault. The notional starting point is a head sentence of 3 years. The objective criminality is somewhat less than that disclosed in McCarthy, Sabapathy and JRB, and there is evidence of remorse, but the offender’s antecedents and rehabilitation prospects are poorer. The relatively short non-parole period (the ratio is 63%) is attributable to the evidence supporting the measure of success the offender has had, and is expected to have, in participating in rehabilitating programs.
	
	
	I indicate that I would have imposed a sentence of 9 months imprisonment for the indecent assault. The aggregate sentence will reflect my view that both offences contributed to the overall criminality of the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	I would impose an aggregate sentence of 2 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 18 months. That sentence is to commence on 9 October 2014, such that the non-parole period will expire on 8 April 2016. In accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the offender is to be released on parole at the conclusion of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The formal orders I propose are:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal allowed, quash the sentence imposed on 9 October 2014, and in lieu thereof, sentence the offender to an aggregate sentence of 2 years and 4 months commencing 9 October 2014, with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 8 April 2016.
	
	
	Direct, in accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that the offender be released at the end of the non-parole period.
	



	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Leeming JA.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Leeming JA.

		12 August 2015",2015-08-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767490,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 14) [2015] NSWSC 1157,"Judgment – EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	These proceedings first came before me in April of this year. During the months of May and June, and as it turned out, into the month of July, I heard and determined a number of pre-trial applications which had been made by one or other of the parties. During the week of 13 July, it became apparent that there had been an increase in the number of applications which were to be brought on behalf of the accused McNamara, about which little or no notice had previously been given. As a consequence of the necessity to deal with those matters, it became necessary for me to put back the original trial date from 20 July 2015 until 27 July 2015. Even at that latter point there were pre-trial applications which remained to be determined. Nevertheless, the trial was in a position to commence.
	
	
	A jury of 15 persons was empanelled on 27 July and the Crown proceeded with his opening address which concluded the following day, July 28. Unfortunately, immediately following the conclusion of an opening address by Mr Waterstreet of counsel who then appeared for the accused McNamara, the jury was discharged. The reasons leading to my decision to discharge the jury on that occasion were, and remain, suppressed. The reason they were, and remain, suppressed, is because I have formed the view that to publicise them may have an adverse effect on the right of one of the accused to a fair trial.
	
	
	Following the discharge of the jury, I set about resolving the remaining pre-trial applications which were outstanding. I was then informed that further issues had arisen which would require determination before any trial could start. A new trial date of 18 August 2015 was then set. Specific arrangements were made by the Sheriff, at my request, for the assembling and the processing of a large number of jury panels in advance of the trial date. That step was taken so as to ensure, as far as I possibly could, that the trial would commence without any further interruption on 18 August.
	
	
	By 11 August, a week before the proposed trial date, I had delivered a total of 13 judgments in relation to various pre-trial applications. On the information which was then available to me there was one, or at the most two, further matters which required determination. With a week remaining before the trial date, there was obviously ample time for those matters to be dealt with so that the trial could commence as scheduled.
	
	
	On the morning of 11 August 2015 evidence was placed before me in the form of an affidavit of Mr Katsoolis, the solicitor for the accused Rogerson, which annexed a photograph which had been published on an “Instagram” account which, on the face of it, was held in the name of Mr Waterstreet. The photograph was one of Mr Waterstreet and another person whose identity has not been made known to me. The photograph appears to have been taken in the street just outside the immediate precincts of the court. The photograph bore a caption. I have come to the view that the terms of the caption cannot be published. Once again, the reason I have come to that view is because I am satisfied that to publish it may adversely affect the right of one of the accused to a fair trial.
	
	
	When that evidence was placed before me I stood the proceedings down to allow Mr Waterstreet to consider his position, and to take such advice as he considered was necessary. Mr Waterstreet informed me at the time that he was not responsible for posting the photograph.
	
	
	When the matter resumed before me later that day two further affidavits were filed in court. The first was an affidavit from the Crown's instructing solicitor, Mr Prince, who deposed to the fact that prior to the resumption of the proceedings on that day he had accessed the social media platform known as Twitter. Mr Prince stated that having done so, he performed a search under the name of Mr Waterstreet. He was then directed to an account which was entitled ""@CCWaterstreet"". Mr Prince annexed what he referred to as a “screen shot” which was taken at the time of conducting the search. The screen shot depicted a post to that Twitter account which had been made early on the morning of 7 August 2015. The post repeated the caption to which I earlier referred. Contained within the post was what appeared to be a link to the Instagram account which carried the photograph to which I have already referred (as well as the caption). Accordingly, on the evidence before me the caption in question appeared to have been published on not one, but two social media outlets.
	
	
	A second affidavit was then filed in court by Mr Thomas of counsel who appears on behalf of the accused Rogerson. That affidavit was sworn by a member of the support staff of Mr Thomas' instructing solicitor, Mr Katsoolis. That staff member had also conducted searches of social media accounts which appeared to be held in the name of Mr Waterstreet. The staff member deposed to the fact that by 11.08am on the morning of 11 August the photograph and the caption which had appeared on the Instagram account had apparently been removed. The staff member also deposed to the fact that from her own experience, accounts of this nature could only be accessed and operated by a person who had knowledge of the relevant user name and password.
	
	
	In the light of that additional affidavit material, and in the light of what I had been told by Mr Waterstreet earlier that morning as to who may or may not have been responsible for posting the photograph and caption, I gave Mr Waterstreet a further opportunity to consider his position and to seek such advice as he thought appropriate. I then adjourned the proceedings until the following day, 12 August 2015.
	
	
	When the proceedings resumed before me on 12 August 2015, Mr Game SC appeared on Mr Waterstreet's behalf. Mr Game informed me that he had given Mr Waterstreet certain advice. Whilst Mr Game did not (as one would expect) divulge the details of that advice, he informed me that the essence of it was that he had told Mr Waterstreet that he must return the brief. Mr Game then made a formal application on Mr Waterstreet's behalf for leave to withdraw from the proceedings. In doing so, Mr Game pointed out that although he was making that application as a matter of formality, it was really a situation where he had advised Mr Waterstreet that he simply could not continue to appear. To the extent that it remained a matter for me, I granted Mr Waterstreet leave to withdraw. I indicated at that time that I would provide reasons at some later stage. The circumstances in which I granted that application, and the reasons for it, will now be obvious.
	
	
	As a consequence of all of those matters, the accused McNamara found himself in a position where, although he retained the same solicitor, he was not represented by counsel. In those circumstances, on the application of his solicitor, I adjourned the proceedings until today so as to allow his solicitor to make inquiries as to the availability of other counsel who could be retained in the matter.
	
	
	When the proceedings resumed before me this morning, Mr Smith SC announced his appearance on behalf of the accused Mr McNamara together with Mr Lange of counsel. Mr Smith indicated that whilst he was in a position to accept the brief, his current commitments were such that he could not appear in the matter this year. He indicated that some discussions had taken place between the parties about a proposed trial date in March of 2016. I will return to that issue in a moment.
	
	
	All of these matters raise the obvious question of what is to now happen with this trial. Although he did not formally make application for the trial date to be vacated, that was the effect of Mr Smith’s stated position.
	
	
	The Crown, albeit with obvious reluctance, accepted the reality that there were difficulties in the trial proceeding. The Crown's position, in essence, was that questions of immediate availability aside, it would take new counsel some weeks to just read the material, let alone be in a position to take instructions. The Crown's position, as I understood it, was that in those circumstances, and bearing in mind the present estimate of the trial of three months, the matter could not proceed this year. Inherent in the Crown's submissions was an acceptance of the fact that if the trial were to start at some stage later this year it would inevitably run into the Christmas/New Year period which necessarily created difficulties in terms of the availability of jury panels and the like.
	
	
	Mr Thomas however, took a different view. He vigorously opposed any application to vacate the trial and expressed his opposition to any proposal that the trial commence in 2016. In support of that position Mr Thomas made a number of submissions.
	
	
	Firstly, he pointed out (and it is uncontroversial) that the accused McNamara is in receipt of a grant of Legal Aid. He submitted that the relevant protocols which apply in relation to grants of Legal Aid are such that Mr McNamara is not in a position to retain, as it were, counsel of his choice, but must accept such counsel who might be available. Mr Thomas submitted, based upon enquiries that he had made, that there were other members of the Bar of suitable experience who were in a position to accept the brief and to start virtually immediately.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Thomas submitted that there was no evidence that any enquiry had been made with the Public Defender's office as to the availability of counsel. He pointed out that such enquiry was part of the relevant protocol. I should say that in response to that submission, Mr Smith tendered correspondence received by his instructing Solicitor from the Public Defender's office makes it abundantly clear that no Public Defender is presently available to accept the brief.
	
	
	Thirdly, Mr Thomas made a number of submissions regarding the history of the current proceedings. He submitted in effect, that there had been other conduct on the part of Mr Waterstreet which was, to paraphrase what was said, less than satisfactory. Mr Thomas went so far as to submit that such conduct on the part of Mr Waterstreet must have been as a consequence of specific instructions provided by Mr McNamara. I should make it very clear that I do not regard any of the circumstances which have arisen to be the personal responsibility of Mr McNamara. Mr McNamara finds himself in his present position due to circumstances which, in my view, are not of his making.
	
	
	Mr Thomas also submitted that having reviewed the matter, he had revised his position as to the estimated length of the trial and had concluded that the appropriate estimate was eight weeks. He submitted that having made his own inquiries into the availability of counsel other than Mr Smith, someone could be retained in sufficient time to read the material, obtain instructions, start the trial in two weeks, and thus have it completed this year.
	
	
	I do not doubt that Mr Thomas made the inquiries to which he referred. I also do not doubt that there could possibly be other counsel in a position to accept the brief. However in my view, the suggestion that competent counsel of appropriate experience could read the volume of material which has been amassed in this case and obtain instructions so as to be ready to commence a trial in two weeks, is simply unrealistic. In my view the amount of material, both in terms of the brief itself as well as material produced on subpoena, would take at least three to four weeks to read and digest. It would only be at that time that counsel would be in a position to properly and sensibly take instructions from Mr McNamara. Whilst I obviously have some insight into Mr McNamara's case, I am certainly not in a position to determine for how long, and on how many occasions, he would need to speak to newly retained counsel in order to provide his instructions.
	
	
	I should also say, without any intending any disrespect to Mr Thomas, that the suggestion that this trial could be completed in a period of eight weeks would seem equally unrealistic. The Crown has already indicated on a previous occasion when the estimate was being discussed that the Crown case alone was expected to take five to six weeks. The suggestion that cases for two accused, together with addresses and a summing-up from me, could be completed within a two week period is, as I have said, unrealistic.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, and whilst I am mindful, obviously, of the position in which the accused Rogerson finds himself as a consequence of what has arisen, I am left with no alternative other than to vacate the trial date of 18 August 2015. For all of the reasons I have outlined the practical effect of taking that course is that this trial will not be able to commence until 2016. However, I make it clear that as matters presently stand, I would not be minded to leave it until March to commence it. Subject to hearing from the parties, it would be my intention to list the matter to commence on the first day of the new term at the end of January in 2016.
	
	
	To say that the vacation of this trial is unfortunate would be a gross understatement. I have no doubt that, if given a proper choice in the matter, both accused would wish this trial to commence. However, for all of the reasons I have given, recent events render that impossible. It would not be fair to Mr McNamara to force him to proceed without counsel. That would be the effect of forcing the trial to commence. It would be particularly unfair to place Mr McNamara that position when the circumstances which have led to it are, as I have said, not of his making.
	
	
	I am also mindful that the vacation of this trial comes at considerable public expense. I have already made reference to the specific arrangements which were put in place for the marshalling and processing of jury panels. The time and the expense devoted to that have largely been wasted. There is also a further burden placed on Legal Aid funding because of the necessity to retain new counsel. All of those factors have weighed heavily on my mind. The decision I have reached is not one that I have taken lightly but for all of the reasons I have given, I am left with no practical alternative.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion, there are some other things that need to be made clear. The first, is that the vacation of the trial date is not the fault of the Court, nor is it reflective of a fault in the administration of criminal justice in this State. It will be evident that since April of this year this Court has done its best to deal with pre-trial matters as quickly and efficiently as possible, so as to ensure that the trial could proceed without interruption. Regrettably, despite the Court's efforts in that regard, that has not been possible.
	
	
	It should also be made clear that there is no fault on the part of the Crown for the circumstances which have arisen. Equally, it should be made clear that there is no fault on the part of either of the accused personally. No fault lies at the feet of counsel or the solicitor for the accused Rogerson, nor at the feet of the solicitor (or recently retained counsel) for the accused McNamara. I have no doubt that all of those parties would wish this matter to proceed if it were possible. Unfortunately, it is not.
	
	
	I have previously noted that earlier this week I acceded to an application made on behalf of Mr Waterstreet to allow him to withdraw from the proceedings. After I had made that order, the Crown submitted that in all of the circumstances I should refer the evidence which had been placed before me to the Registrar of the Court for consideration of the question of whether or not proceedings for contempt of Court should be brought against Mr Waterstreet. When the Crown raised that issue, Mr Waterstreet was not present and he was not represented, Mr Game's retainer at that stage being limited to making the application for leave with withdraw. Accordingly, in those circumstances, I directed the Registrar to inform Mr Waterstreet of the Crown's position, and I stood the matter over until today for the purposes of hearing any further submissions that were sought to be made by either party.
	
	
	In the intervening period, my Associate received correspondence from Mr Game SC. Without going into detail, Mr Game indicated that he agreed that the appropriate course to take was to make an order that the matter be referred to the Registrar in the terms that I have outlined. I should make it clear that in agreeing to that course, Mr Game was not conceding that any contempt had in fact occurred.
	
	
	The Crown properly pointed out that despite the agreement which had been reached by the parties in relation to that issue, the referral to the Registrar remained a matter for me. However, in light of the evidence which was placed before me, that is the course I propose to take.
	
	
	Accordingly, for all of those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The trial date of 18 August 2015 is vacated.
	
	
	The proceedings are listed for further directions before me at 9.15am on Monday 14 September 2015 at which time neither accused will be required to be in attendance.
	
	
	Pursuant to part 55 rule 11(6) of the Supreme Court Rules, I refer the question of a possible contempt of Court by Mr Charles Waterstreet, Barrister, to the Registrar of the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
	
	
	In accordance with Part 55 rule 11(6), I direct the Registrar:
	



	
	to take advice from the Crown Solicitor for New South Wales as to whether proceedings for contempt of Court should be taken against Mr Waterstreet in respect of the matter that I have identified;
	
	
	to act in accordance with such advice as is received from the Crown Solicitor; and
	
	
	to inform the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales of that matter.
	



	
	Any party has liberty to restore the proceedings to the list on 24 hrs notice by contacting my Associate.

		14 August 2015",2015-08-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767500,Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Lakatos in the District Court at Sydney on 17 October 2013 for an offence of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine.
	
	
	A non-publication order was made at the commencement of the hearing of this matter for reasons which will become apparent. The applicant will be referred to in the name of the case by the pseudonym ""Alpha"" and herein as ""the applicant"".
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 307.2 of the Criminal Code (Cth) and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $550,000.
	
	
	The learned judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months dating from 9 October 2012.
	
	
	The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


1   The starting point of the sentence of 12 years is manifestly excessive

2   His Honour erred in the application of the discount for an early plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities to the starting point for the sentence

3   The sentence imposed by his Honour is manifestly excessive


	
	An extension of time is required. Given the Crown concedes there is merit in the second ground of appeal the extension should be granted.
	
	
	The sentence was well within the range of the primary judge's sentencing discretion, particularly as this was a serious example of this type of offence. The reduction of the sentence on account of the applicant's early plea of guilty and his assistance was appropriate but there was a miscalculation that cannot be allowed to stand. No lesser starting point before the application of the discount is warranted but a lesser resulting sentence should be passed.
	


Facts


	
	At some stage prior to 20 September 2012 the applicant communicated with two men who I will refer to as “K” and “H”, concerning the applicant arranging for a consignment of cocaine ordered by K to be imported into Australia. K paid the applicant $166,000. The applicant arranged for that money to be transferred to his (the applicant’s) father in Lebanon. The father retained $50,000 for the benefit of the applicant and himself and used the rest to acquire the drugs. The applicant obtained and provided his father with the details for the nominated recipient of the consignment, a man I will refer to as “M”.
	
	
	Between at least 20 September and 9 October 2012 the applicant’s father sourced the drugs, likely from Germany, through other persons. When he received them he consigned them via air freight from Syria to Sydney. The cocaine was concealed within plastic tubes stitched within the fabric of a shag pile rug. The consignment arrived on 9 October 2012 but was intercepted by Customs officers. The pure quantity of cocaine was 684 grams; the gross weight being 1.14 kilograms (thus a purity of about 60 per cent).
	
	
	During a period of several weeks in which the importation of the consignment had been delayed, the applicant was in communication with H, M and K. In communications with co-participants in the enterprise he utilised coded terminology in conversations via telephone services subscribed with false identification particulars.
	
	
	The applicant obtained from his father the details of the freight carrier company and the airway bill number for the consignment after it had been sent from Syria. Although unsuccessful, he attempted to monitor the progress of the consignment with this information on the freight carrier’s website. He maintained contact with H with respect to M’s anticipated receipt of the consignment and planned to meet with H after learning that it had arrived.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 9 October 2012 after the drugs had been intercepted. Incriminating evidence of a variety of sorts was found at his home. He declined to be interviewed. The alleged co-offenders attempted to make contact with him by telephone on numerous occasions (the calls obviously being unanswered) and they met on 12 October 2012, presumably to discuss what had happened to their investment in the cocaine.
	
	
	The wholesale value of the cocaine was $207,000 and the estimated street value was between $489,000 and $547,000.
	
	
	The Crown provided the sentencing judge with information concerning a conviction of the applicant in 2008 for supplying cocaine. He was involved in the actual supply of 2.65g of cocaine and was found to be in possession of two mobile phones, 54 grams of cocaine (71 per cent purity), about $3000 in cash, a small quantity of methylamphetamine and a set of scales. Two further offences were taken into account when he was sentenced: possessing a prohibited drug and dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
	


The sentencing judge’s assessment of the seriousness of the offence


	
	His Honour indicated at an early stage of his sentencing remarks that “this is a serious example of an importation of drugs”. Later, he described the applicant as being “part of a sophisticated drug supply chain”; “it was clearly an international operation”. He accepted that the applicant had an “important, high level and trusted organisational role and detailed knowledge with respect to a sophisticated cocaine importation”. He “brought together a sophisticated, organised overseas criminal enterprise concerned with the exporting of illicit drugs and the sophisticated organised Australian criminal enterprise designed to import such drugs”.
	
	
	The judge also had regard to “a significant degree of planning, premeditation and deliberation” and the applicant’s acknowledgement that he was motivated by the prospect of financial gain. He also took into account that it was not an isolated occurrence but the first of a number of proposed importations. His Honour concluded this aspect of his sentencing remarks by stating:
	


“In my view, these objective facts place the offence at a high level of seriousness and call into play significant issues of general deterrence.”


	
	Later, after reviewing a number of authorities in this Court concerning sentencing for this type of offence, his Honour reiterated: ""this is in my view a particularly serious example of such a crime"".
	


The applicant’s personal circumstances


	
	The applicant was aged 33 at the time of the offence. He had a criminal history, the only significance of which was the previous drug supply matter for which he was sentenced in 2008 to imprisonment by way of periodic detention for 2 years 6 months. The judge made clear that this ""does not warrant any increase in the appropriate sentence but it negates any mitigating factor"".
	
	
	He was born and raised in Lebanon and came to Australia with his brother in 2000, becoming an Australian citizen in 2003. He was described by the judge as having had a “turbulent upbringing”; his father was involved with trading in illicit drugs and his mother suffered from a mental illness. His parents separated when he was aged 10. His mother came to Australia in 2005 and the applicant and his brother had cared for her since.
	
	
	The applicant had some employment, including being self-employed operating an expanding business until it failed. He had not worked since March 2012, some six months before the offence in question. The judge noted that the applicant said he became involved in the offence for financial benefit in the hope of starting up another business.
	
	
	The applicant was married in Lebanon in 1999 but the marriage ended three years later after coming to Australia. He found the divorce stressful and he turned to using cocaine in 2003. He underwent detoxification and rehabilitation programs which were not completely successful but he did significantly reduce his usage. However, at the time of the offending he was using cannabis on a daily basis. Underlying his drug use is a history of depression and anxiety.
	
	
	The applicant had provided information about his alleged co-offenders and an unconnected person. He undertook to give evidence; such offer to assist being first advanced only two days after his arrest. As a consequence he has been held in a segregation gaol in what the judge accepted were “significantly arduous” circumstances. He will likely remain in such an environment for the entirety of his sentence until released on parole. The judge also accepted from the evidence before him that “his fear of harm is real and not imagined”. There was also the fact that the circumstances of his custody meant he was denied access to employment, rehabilitation programs and the potential for work release.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and the judge accepted that he did so honestly. He accepted that the applicant was “truly remorseful and contrite”. He also accepted his stated intentions as to rehabilitation.
	


Other sentence considerations


	
	The judge reviewed the schedules of cases concerning sentencing for drug importation offences provided by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 and by Fullerton J in Adegoke v R [2013] NSWCCA 193; 234 A Crim R 280. He also had regard to the general sentencing principles for this type of offence set out in the judgment of Johnson J in R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at [72]. He noted that general deterrence ""is of primary importance in relation to large scale commercial importations of dangerous drugs into this country"".
	
	
	His Honour concluded that ""an appropriate starting point for the sentence is one of 12 years""; noting at that point of his remarks that:
	


""A cursory analysis of the cases that I have referred to in the authorities … indicates that the quantity of the drug in the present offence is at the higher end of the range as is the sophistication of the offence which is not to be considered as an isolated incident.""


	
	The judge allowed a combined discount of 45 per cent for the applicant's early plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities, specifying that it was made up of 25 per cent for the plea and 20 per cent for assistance, 15 of which was for future assistance.
	


Ground 2 – error in the application of the discount for plea and assistance


	
	There was an inadvertent arithmetical error in the judge's reduction of the sentence on account of the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. From the starting point that he announced of 12 years, a reduction of 45 per cent should have yielded a sentence (with a small degree of rounding) of 6 years 7 months. However, the sentence imposed was one of 7 years 2 months.
	
	
	The Crown in this Court took the position that it would proceed to resentencing pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) if satisfied that it was the 12 year starting point with 45 per cent reduction that the judge intended as opposed to his stated resulting sentence of 7 years 2 months. I am so satisfied.
	


Ground 1 – manifestly excessive starting point of 12 years

Ground 3 – manifestly excessive sentence


	
	Whilst it is strictly unnecessary to deal with these grounds given my view as to the success of Ground 2, it is useful to consider the merit of the submissions as that will assist in the resentencing task.
	
	
	Written submissions by senior counsel for the applicant were almost wholly directed towards the first ground. However, it must be observed that it is not the ""starting point"" of a sentence that is the subject of appeal but rather the sentence actually imposed. In reality, it is the asserted severity of the ""starting point"" that the applicant says explains how the resultant sentence is manifestly excessive: McGeown v R [2014] NSWCCA 314 at [13]-[14] (Leeming JA).
	
	
	It was submitted for the applicant that the weight of the drug in this case, 684 grams, was about one third of the marketable quantity range (250g to 2kg) yet the starting point of 12 years was just less than 50 per cent of the maximum penalty of 25 years.
	
	
	It was observed that sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales showed that no offender received a head sentence greater than 12 years and the median sentence was 7 years. No offender received a non-parole period greater than 7 years and the median non-parole period was 4 years 6 months. (The statistics relied upon were for sentences imposed in the period October 2007 to September 2014. The currently available statistics for the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2015 are reasonably similar but not identical.)
	
	
	Next, senior counsel for the applicant referred to the guideline judgment in R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340 (""Wong and Leung"") where (at [142]) Spigelman CJ indicated that in sentencing of ""couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation"" where the quantity of drug is in the range of 200 g to 1 kg the sentence would be in the range of 6 to 9 years.
	
	
	Counsel noted the criticism by the High Court of Australia in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 of the guideline in Wong and Leung but noted that this Court had subsequently said in R v Mas Rivadavia; R v El Akkaoui; R v Aksu [2004] NSWCCA 284; 61 NSWLR 63 at [67] (Wood CJ at CL) that the ranges set out in Wong and Leung remain a “useful reference point"".
	
	
	Reference was made to Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa where Simpson J (as her Honour then was) made some remarks (at [307]-[308]) concerning the significance of quantity in drug importation cases with her Honour adding that it ""is not the only consideration, and must be tempered by other factors"".
	
	
	Three cases were cited, in which ""where possible … the role of the offender was found to be greater than that of a mere courier"": R v Vasquez [2003] NSWCCA 94 (sentence of 9 years); Minall and Watkins v R [2003] NSWCCA 311 (7 years 6 months); and Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43 (7 years 6 months).
	
	
	Finally, counsel observed that the sentencing judge ""did not find that the applicant was a principal, or even that he was at a mid-level in the hierarchy"". It was contended that K was in fact the principal and that he was assisted by H as a middleman in his dealings with the applicant.
	


Consideration


	
	The submissions for the applicant based upon statistics cannot be accepted. They seek to compare the starting point before reduction for plea and assistance in the present case with sentences imposed in other cases where the vast majority of offenders pleaded guilty (82 out of 95 in the current iteration), and for whom some reduction of sentence would usually have been made on that account.
	
	
	The statistics allow for selection of the variable ""plea of guilty"" but there is no provision to identify cases in which there has been a further reduction for assistance to authorities. All that can be said is that a sentence of 6 years 7 months (when correctly calculated) is around the median sentence for all offenders.
	
	
	The submissions of the applicant concerning Wong and Leung must be rejected. First, while Wood CJK at CL referred to the sentencing range in Wong and Leung as a “useful reference point” (at [67]), that remark has to be seen in the context in which it was made:
	


“[65] Notwithstanding the criticisms which were expressed by the High Court in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 concerning the extent of the emphasis that had been given in the guideline to the weight of the narcotic involved, and concerning the need for greater attention to be given to the role played by the offender, the range of sentences which were suggested by the Court of Criminal Appeal continued to be regarded as providing a useful guide before the repeal of ss 16G and s 19AG (which had made similar provisions in relation to non-parole periods: see for example R v Taru [2002] NSWCCA 391; R v Marchando [2003] NSWCCA 71 and R v Cerullo [2003] NSWCCA 201).

[66] Guideline decisions have occupied an important role, in this State in establishing general sentencing patterns which have emerged for offences of the kind to which they relate, and the decision in R v Wong and Leung is no exception. However, such judgments have never been intended to operate as strait jackets. Their role is to provide indicators of sentences that have been found to be appropriate, in the general run of cases, to which they are directed. They are, accordingly, expected to be taken into account, by sentencing judges although without excluding the important discretion to take into consideration the differences, objectively and subjectively, which exist in the individual case before the court: R v Karacic (2001) 121 A Crim R 7 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252.

[67] They are sounding boards which provide an important final check once proper consideration is given to the objective and subjective circumstances, and to the need to ensure that the sentence meets the various requirements of punishment, retribution and deterrence. As such they also provide a useful reference point for this Court when it is asked to review a sentence for manifest leniency or inadequacy.” (Emphasis added)


	
	Wood CJ at CL proceeded to discuss the significance of the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) before concluding:
	


“[84] To the extent that regard is had to R v Wong and Leung, in the indicative way for which guideline sentences are intended, or to the extent that reference is made to pre s 16G and 19AG sentencing patterns, or to those which will now emerge following the repeal of those sections, it is important for Judges to bear in mind:

(a) That R v Wong and Leung was decided in a context where s 16G required an adjustment to be made, although that adjustment was not one that was mathematically and unequivocally linked to a discount of 30 per cent, since there remained an area for sentencing discretion; and

(b) That it is no longer permissible to make an allowance for the s 16G factor.”


	
	When it is recognised that the 6 to 9 years indicated in Wong and Leung was regarded as generally appropriate for a ""courier"" or ""persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation"", one can immediately see that for a person who played a more significant role, as the applicant in the present case did, and who was not entitled to a s 16G discount, a starting point of 12 years is unremarkable.
	
	
	The ""comparable"" cases relied upon by the applicant are all distinguishable. If anything, they support the adoption of at least a 12 year starting point rather than characterise it as excessive.
	
	
	In R v Vasquez, the sentence under consideration (and only on a parity basis) was imposed on 14 January 2000. Section 16G was repealed with effect from 16 January 2003. Thus the sentence of 9 years for importing 649 g of cocaine may be assumed to have been the subject of a significant reduction on account of that provision. There was also some unquantified reduction on account of the offender's plea of guilty at what may be inferred to have been an early stage.
	
	
	The sentences of 7 years 6 months imposed upon each of the offenders in Minall and Watkins v R for the importation (by internal concealment) of 437 g of cocaine were also the subject of a ""discount"" on account of s 16G. The offenders had no criminal records and had pleaded guilty at, by inference, an early stage.
	
	
	Kuti v R involved sentencing after the repeal of s 16G. A man from an impoverished background arrived in Sydney on a flight from Nigeria with 452 grams of heroin concealed internally. The sentencing judge accepted that he became involved as a result of threats and in order to expunge a debt. His role was held to be that of a courier. He was 69 years of age with no criminal record. His wife, with whom he had four children, was ill before he came to Australia and had died before he was sentenced. He was genuinely remorseful and there was a discount of 25 per cent for his plea of guilty; the starting point for the sentence therefore being one of 10 years.
	
	
	The offence in the present case was of a higher level of seriousness than the offenders in each of those cases.
	
	
	The submission by the applicant's counsel that the ranges of sentences in Wong and Leung and the three cases just mentioned ""suggest that the appropriate starting point for an importation of about 700 grams of pure cocaine was in the order of 9 years"" must be rejected for the foregoing reasons. It must also be rejected to the extent it may be taken to suggest that in sentencing for drug importation offences there is a ""starting point"" based on quantity with adjustments then made for other factors: cf Wong v The Queen at [74]-[75] (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ). (See also, Kirby J at [138]-[139].)
	
	
	The erroneous emphasis upon the quantity of the drug in the applicant's submissions also means that the comparison of where within the range of the marketable quantity 684 grams falls with the proportion of the maximum penalty represented by the starting point of the sentence must also be rejected.
	
	
	The applicant's contention as to manifest excess, either in the starting point or in the resulting sentence, is not made out.
	


Resentencing


	
	The submissions for the Crown pointed out that where an arithmetical error is the sole basis of this Court's intervention in a sentencing appeal such intervention has been confined to simple correction. Burns v R [2008] NSWCCA 260 at [34], [37] and Young v R [2007] NSWCCA 114 at [26]-[28] were provided as examples. However, the Crown submitted that after Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 it seems necessary for the Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. I am not sure that this will always be necessary; it seems to me that it would depend upon the nature of the error. However, in the present case I am prepared to carry out the task.
	
	
	I have earlier set out the findings made by the sentencing judge as to the seriousness of the offence (see above at [17]-[19]). There was no challenge to any aspect of them. It is true that the judge did not describe the applicant as ""a principal"". But the applicant's submissions ignore the description of the applicant as having ""an important, high level and trusted organisational role"" with ""detailed knowledge with respect to a sophisticated cocaine importation"". Moreover, the applicant was regarded as having ""brought together a sophisticated, organised overseas criminal enterprise, concerned with the exporting of illicit drugs and a sophisticated organised Australian criminal enterprise designed to import such drugs"".
	
	
	Having considered the factual basis of the offending I find myself in complete agreement with the unchallenged findings of the primary judge. The various findings made concerning aspects of the applicant's subjective case were also not the subject of any challenge. As I am in agreement with them I am prepared to act upon them, including as to the level of discounting his Honour assessed.
	
	
	An affidavit sworn by the applicant on 31 July 2015 provided further information about the circumstances of his custody arising as a result of his assistance. It does not add anything of significance to the information that was before the primary judge but it does confirm his Honour's assessment of the applicant's custodial conditions as ""arduous"".
	
	
	A further affidavit by a police officer which was read at the hearing described assistance provided by the applicant subsequent to sentencing. It is not appropriate to go into the detail; that is available within the document marked as confidential Exhibit B. It justifies, in my view, an increase in the level of discount to 50 per cent (which the Crown conceded was open); the assistance component being 25 per cent, 15 of that being for assistance in the future.
	
	
	I have had regard to the sentencing principles summarised by Johnson J in R v Nguyen; R v Pham and also the useful examples of sentencing provided by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa. They lead me to conclude that nothing less than 12 years is warranted as a starting point for the sentence. It should be reduced by 50 per cent on account of the applicant’s plea and assistance. The non-parole period should be 3 years 8 months.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1   Extend time for the filing of the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal to 2 June 2015; grant leave to appeal; and allow the appeal.

2   Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 17 October 2013 and in lieu, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years 8 months. The sentence is to date from 9 October 2012. The non-parole period will end on 8 June 2016 and the overall term will expire on 8 October 2018.

2767504,Jadron v R [2015] NSWCCA 217,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: Sabaoon Jadron applies to this Court for leave to appeal against the following sentences imposed in the District Court at Parramatta. The statutory maximum penalty for each offence is as shown in brackets.
	



	
	Count 1: Between 1 March 2012 and 30 August 2012, supply a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, 157.9g, contrary to s 25(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW): 3 years 4 months comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 9 months and a balance term of 1 year 7 months. [Maximum: 15 years].
	
	
	Count 3: In the same period, supply a prohibited drug, cannabis, 90.5g contrary to s 25(1): 1 year 10 months comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance term of 10 months. [Maximum: 10 years].
	
	
	Count 4: In the same period, dealing with proceeds of crime, $5,580, knowing it was the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193B(2), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): 2 years 11 months comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months and balance term of 1 year 5 months. [Maximum: 15 years].
	



	
	The dates for each of those sentences were fixed in such a way that the sentence on Count 4 (dealing with proceeds of crime) would commence first, the sentence for Count 3 (supply cannabis) would commence 3 months later and the sentence for Count 1 (supply methylamphetamine) would commence 6 months later again. This degree of accumulation resulted in an effective total sentence of 4 years 1 month with an effective total non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.
	
	
	The commencement of each sentence was backdated to allow for time spent in custody, the number of days and the resulting commencement date being agreed between the Crown and defence counsel.
	
	
	The grounds of the appeal for which leave is now sought are:
	


“(1) The learned judge erred in her application of the principle of totality by making the sentences for Count 1 and Count 3 cumulative on the sentence imposed on Count 4.

(2) The learned sentencing judge erred by breaching the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 in passing sentence with respect to Count 1.”


	
	The Crown conceded Ground 1 at the outset of the hearing in this Court. Leave to appeal should therefore be granted and I will refer to the offender hereafter as the Appellant.
	


The Agreed Facts


	
	Her Honour was provided with a document entitled Agreed Facts bearing a heading which related the facts to the three charges against the Appellant and two charges against a female associate, Roberta Mafi. So far as Mafi was concerned the Agreed Facts were directed to charges pursuant to s 25(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, one concerning supply of 120.7g methylamphetamine and a second concerning supply of 90.5g of cannabis.
	
	
	According to the introductory paragraphs of the Agreed Facts, police commenced in December 2011 an investigation of the supply of prohibited drugs by the Appellant and Mafi. They obtained warrants for telephone intercepts and implemented physical and electronic surveillance. These methods produced evidence of the following:
	


“4. Jadron and Mafi were identified as supplying prohibited drugs, namely methylamphetamine (ice) and cannabis, from their unit and the garage area of the unit complex at 9 Elizabeth Street, Berala.

5. [The Appellant] and Roberta Mafi negotiated their drug transactions solely via text messages predominantly using [two mobile telephone services].

6. During the course of the investigation, police established that [the Appellant] and Roberta Mafi systemically supplied amounts of methylamphetamine (ice).

7. They had set prices for the various quantities in which they sold the prohibited drugs and their regular customers used certain commonly used codes for the prohibited drugs and quantities they sought to purchase.”


	
	The Agreed Facts set out the prices at which quantities between 0.1g and 3.5g were sold and the codes used to refer to these quantities respectively. The Agreed Facts provided this overview of the drug selling activity:
	


“9. Between 1 March 2012 and 31 August 2012 [the Appellant] and Mafi took part in a joint criminal enterprise supplying methylamphetamine (ice) and cannabis.

10. [The Appellant] supplied 159.7g (sic, this should read 157.9g) of methylamphetamine and 90g of cannabis during the period.

11. Mafi supplied 120g of methylamphetamine and 90g of cannabis during the period (Mafi was out of Australia between 31 July 2012 and 17 August 2012).

12. [The Appellant] and Mafi received approximately $78,950 as a result of supplying methylamphetamine.

13. [The Appellant] and Mafi had a ‘customer base’, with many regular customers.

14. During the period 1 March 2012 and 31 August 2012 [the Appellant] and Mafi conducted or agreed to conduct in excess of 1,000 supplies of prohibited drugs.

…

36. The offenders were involved in the supply of methylamphetamine on an almost daily basis. The intercepted text messages show that on each day there were anywhere between 5 and 25 text message conversations between different customers relating to the purchase of methylamphetamine.

…

38. Police identified the names and/or nicknames of a number of ‘regular customers’ but were not able to identify the names and/or nicknames of in excess of 40 other telephone numbers used by customers who were in regular text message contact with [a mobile phone service used by the Appellant and Mafi to arrange supplies of drugs, which had been intercepted by police].

39. Between 1 March 2012 and 30 August 2012 there were in excess of 1,000 transactions, including agreements to supply, exchanged between the two [phones used by the Appellant and Mafi] and customer phones.”


	
	According to the Agreed Facts, the Appellant was arrested on 30 August 2012. Police immediately executed a search warrant at Unit 7, 9 Elizabeth Street, Berala being the unit occupied by the Appellant. Quantities of cash were found in three separate locations within the unit, totalling $5,580. Police located an additional 112g of cannabis in the garage assigned to Unit 2 in the same unit block (leased by Mafi). Another 126g of cannabis were found in a storage compartment beneath the handlebars of a motorcycle in the underground carpark of the building. This cannabis was packaged in 83 small resealable plastic bags. 1.22g of methylamphetamine was found in three separate smaller quantities in various concealed places in the common areas of the unit building. These additional quantities of drugs were not the subject of any charges.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts were tendered without objection although the Appellant’s counsel expressed a reservation that some of the matters set out therein may be inadmissible as not relating to the three offences to which pleas of guilty were being entered. Counsel said (at T 2):
	


“However there are matters in the Agreed Facts that I will take your Honour to in due course. They are more a matter of a question of admissibility than facts that relate to the actual three offences before your Honour.”

[This and all subsequent transcript references relate to the sentence hearing on 12 September 2014].


	
	It became apparent that counsel’s reservation was with respect to pars 30-35 of the Agreed Facts which concerned the additional quantities of cannabis and methylamphetamine found in the garage of Unit 2 and in common areas of the unit complex. The Crown submitted that this material was appropriately before the Court “simply to show the nature and the scope of the operation that was involved in the two supply charges before your Honour but those amounts do not make up the quantities subject to the supply charge of 90g” (T 4).
	
	
	In support of his relevance objection the Appellant’s counsel submitted: “It was not necessary in my submission to put that material before your Honour because the scale of the operation or the nature of the operation is set out in the previous Agreed Facts” (T 32). In her Remarks on Sentence (“RoS”) her Honour accepted the Crown submission that the facts regarding additional drug seizures under the search warrants were relevant to show “the scope of the operation, including the way the drugs were secreted…even though it is conceded by [the Appellant], as it must be, that there were ongoing acts of supply” (RoS 4).
	
	
	It was common ground between the Crown and the Appellant that the 157.9g of methylamphetamine and the 90.5g of cannabis which were the subject of Counts 1 and 3 were quantities calculated by the police from the individual sales of which they had evidence from telephone intercepts and other surveillance carried out during the six month charge period. There was no evidence that the quantities sold or any part of them had been recovered or seized by police.
	


Size and number of transactions constituting the supply


	
	It was a prominent part of the Appellant’s case before the learned sentencing judge that all of the sales which made up the 157.9g were at the level of one or at most a few individual usage units of 0.1g. The written submissions on behalf of the Appellant included the following:
	


“6. It is submitted that the accused’s offending never rose above street level dealing and it is a relevant matter in assessing the objective seriousness (R v Haidar [2004] NSWCCA 350).

7. The police were aware of the accused’s offending conduct from March 2012 through telephone intercepts, surveillance, information from other users who had purchased from the accused and purchasers [who were] undercover police. …”


	
	In oral submissions, when arguing against the relevance of the additional quantities of drugs seized under warrant at the unit block following the Appellant’s arrest, counsel put the following submissions (at T 34-36):
	


“…I agree that if I had sought to run a matter on sentence that, for example in the period of the indictment… there are only isolated transactions, the Crown would be entitled to lead evidence to show that that was not the case to put it in its proper context but I haven’t of course sought to advance that submission at all, so there is no necessity in my submission to go to those additional matters [the post arrest seizures] to support the Crown contention which is accepted that these were ongoing [acts] of individual supply during the period covered by the counts in the indictment… I am not putting and I have never put a submission that during the period of the indictment there were only… isolated acts of supply… I accept that there were ongoing acts of supply by the accused and by Roberta Mafi.”


	
	Her Honour then pointed out that the Agreed Facts disclosed 1,000 transactions over a period of six months and made a rough calculation that this approximated five sales a day “on average” (T 35). The Appellant’s counsel did not dispute that this calculation followed from the Agreed Facts. He merely reiterated that the post arrest seizures:
	


“…are not necessary to be taken into account to understand the nature of what the Crown alleges my client was doing, that he’s admitted to and your Honour there’s nothing remarkable in my submission about Roberta Mafi and my client on average say doing five street deals a day, it’s entirely consistent with a low-level street dealer and nothing more.”


	
	At T 35 her Honour suggested that some of the sales must have been for more than a single usage unit of 0.1g. The Appellant’s counsel responded:
	


“Even if there was it doesn’t mean that that’s not street dealing… a user can buy a quantity of methylamphetamine to be used over a period of time… its still a street deal.”


	
	The Appellant’s counsel put similar submissions with respect to the 90.5g of cannabis the subject of Count 3. At T 40 the Crown confirmed that the 90.5g of cannabis “were the actual supplies”. The Crown was not able to suggest or prove a breakdown of the 90.5g into a number of transactions or into individual quantities sold. The 90.5g was described by the Crown as “an aggregation”. At T 41 the Appellant’s counsel submitted, with respect to the cannabis: “and they are all street level … amounts”. He submitted that “dealing in 90g of cannabis street level would not normally attract a full-time sentence of imprisonment in the Local Court”. He was asked whether he accepted that “there were multiple acts” and he said that he did.
	
	
	With respect to the $78,950 which the Appellant had received “as a result of supplying methylamphetamine” and the $5,580 in cash which was seized in the Appellant’s unit, it was submitted on his behalf that these amounts were “entirely consistent with low-level street dealing” (T 36). Counsel submitted to her Honour that what was described in the Agreed Statement of Facts “is that my client was undertaking street deals to support his own habit and almost all of the money went in supplying himself as a user of methylamphetamine and cannabis on a regular and daily basis as set out in the pre-sentence report and in the report from the psychologist” (T 36). He said “it was a business for the purposes of feeding addiction” (T 37).
	
	
	The Appellant’s counsel pointed out that the amount of $78,950 was calculated by the police as the proceeds of sales in which Mafi was engaged in a joint enterprise. It was submitted that Mafi would have been jointly entitled to the $78,950 and that if their activity “was being run solely for the purposes of profit and not to support a habit … by the end of six months there would have been a lot more than $5,580” (T 38).
	


Negotiations with respect to charges


	
	Information placed before her Honour and recorded at T 23-30 shows that while committal proceedings against the Appellant were pending in the Local Court, in April and May 2013 negotiations took place between the Crown and representatives of the Appellant as to whether the Crown would accept a plea of guilty to a charge under s 25(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of supplying a quantity of methylamphetamine not greater than 100g. The indictable quantity is 5g, the commercial quantity (which may be charged under s 25(2)) is 250g. These negotiations came to an end when a direction was issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the proceedings were to continue against the Appellant on a charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity.
	
	
	On about 4 September 2013 the Appellant was committed for trial on one count of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) and one count of ongoing supply contrary to s 25A(1). Section 25A(1) is in the following terms:
	


“25A Offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis

(1) Offence provision

A person who, on 3 or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days, supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both.”


	
	The Appellant’s case was listed for trial at Parramatta District Court on 26 May 2014 but the date was vacated. Following further negotiations between the Crown and the Appellant’s representatives that week the Crown agreed on 29 May 2014 to accept pleas of guilty to the three counts described at the beginning of these reasons. Count 3 (supply of cannabis) and Count 4 (dealing with proceeds of crime) were added ex officio when the Crown agreed not to proceed on the charge under s 25A(1) in relation to the 157.9g methylamphetamine. As the Crown and the Appellant’s counsel jointly submitted to her Honour (T 29) the addition of the two ex officio charges was “part of the negotiations” and it took place in conjunction with the Crown’s acceptance of a plea to a charge under s 25(1) in respect of the most serious matter – supply of 157.9g methylamphetamine over 6 months.
	
	
	In the RoS, her Honour recited the Agreed Facts in full. At pp 9-10 it was noted that the quantity of methylamphetamine involved was over half of the commercial quantity according to Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Her Honour observed that considerable planning was involved in the selling of the drug although she expressly did not treat this as a “feature of aggravation” but as part of the description of the manner in which the offence was committed. It was accepted by her Honour that the Appellant was a drug addict but her Honour went on to say:
	


“He had, though, in my view, clearly gone into the business of supplying drugs. This was a successful operation with a customer base and regulars. The quantities ranged from 0.1 gram for $50 to 3.5 grams at $1,400 for a “ball”. There were over 1,000 supplies in the 6 month period, that is an estimated average of slightly more than five supplies each and every day.”


	
	All of these findings were justified upon the basis of the Agreed Facts. With respect to the large number of supplies and the number of them per day over the six month charge period, the findings were precisely what the Appellant’s counsel had urged upon her Honour.
	
	
	It had been submitted for the Appellant that he sold drugs solely to fund his own consumption as an addict. Hearsay evidence to that effect was received through the pre-sentence report and a report of the Appellant’s psychologist. The Crown did not contest the proposition nor put the Appellant to proof of it. The Appellant did not give evidence. Her Honour appeared to accept that the Appellant’s business of drug selling was, at least predominantly, driven by the need to fund his own consumption. Certainly her Honour made no finding that he had been able to accumulate wealth from the exercise or that he lived a life of high spending and extravagance during the charge period, in any respect other than his outlay on drugs for his own use.
	
	
	Overall her Honour’s conclusion on Count 1 was that it was “well into the upper middle range” of seriousness for an offence against s 25(1).
	


Ground 2 – the principle in De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383


	
	Ground 2 is directed only to Count 1 (supply of methylamphetamine). The Crown’s concession on Ground 1 will require reconsideration of accumulation of the sentences on all counts and reconsideration of the principle of totality. Attention to these matters must be deferred until a conclusion has been reached with respect to the sentence for Count 1.
	
	
	As developed in submissions the Appellant’s complaint under Ground 2 is that when determining the objective seriousness of Count 1 her Honour had regard to the frequency of individual sales which made up the total supply as charged, in circumstances where that frequency would have been sufficient to have sustained a charge for the more serious offence under s 25A(1). The frequency found by her Honour would have satisfied the threshold of “3 or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days”, as provided for in s 25A(1). It was submitted for the Appellant that by taking into account the frequency of sales in these circumstances her Honour had infringed the principle in R v De Simoni (supra) and that this constituted a sentencing error.
	
	
	In De Simoni, Gibbs CJ said (at 147 CLR 389):
	


“However the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle that no one should be punished for an offence of which he had not been convicted. Section 582 [of the Criminal Code (WA)] reflects this principle. The combined effect of the two principles, so far as that is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.”


	
	His Honour continued (at 389) to cite a number of instances in which courts have recognised the principle at common law “that circumstances of aggravation not alleged in the indictment could not be relied upon for the purposes of sentence if those circumstances could have been made the subject of a distinct charge”.
	
	
	It is notable that in all of the cases cited by the Chief Justice (whose judgment was the only full statement of reasons for the majority) the aggravating circumstance which was held to have been wrongly taken into account on sentence was something distinct from and additional to the elements of the offence. For example in R v Bright [1916] 2 KB 441 the charge to which the prisoner pleaded guilty was one of attempting to elicit information regarding the manufacture of war material. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the sentencing judge had erred in taking into account that the prisoner had acted with an intention to assist the enemy. Such intention had not been charged in the indictment. If it had been charged and proved to the satisfaction of the jury the prisoner would have been liable to a more severe penalty (although no separate offence was created by the relevant regulation).
	
	
	This aggravating circumstance was quite extraneous to the elements of the offence as charged. It may be contrasted, hypothetically, with circumstances which would constitute the way in which the elements of the offence charged were perpetrated. Examples would be the making of multiple attempts to elicit information as part of a single course of conduct or the making of a very devious or elaborate or persistent attempt. Any of these would add to the objective seriousness of the infringement, whilst not being an aggravating feature additional to the elements.
	
	
	Similarly, in R v Toomey, a decision of the United Kingdom Court of Criminal Appeal noted at [1964] Criminal Law Review 419, the prisoner’s plea of not guilty to robbery with violence but guilty to simple robbery was accepted. He had injured an elderly woman when snatching her handbag. It was held that the sentencing judge had erroneously taken account of the violence toward the victim in sentencing. Although the note of the decision is brief the analysis seems to have been that the aggravating matter was extraneous to the elements of the offence of simple robbery. It may be said to have gone beyond merely a more culpable or serious manner of acting out the elements of the offence. It was additional to them.
	
	
	Gibbs CJ cited three further examples from the cases. In all of them the aggravating circumstance which it was held should not have been taken into account was something additional to the elements of the offence charged and something which, if it had been alleged and proved, would have exposed the offender to liability for a more serious offence and a higher penalty. The causing of a wound to the victim in the case of De Simoni (supra) itself was a circumstance of the same type. In none of these instances was the wrongly considered aggravating circumstance capable of being characterised as merely an aspect or a particular of the manner of carrying out the elements as charged.
	
	
	The alleged aggravating features of Count 1, now said to have been wrongly considered by her Honour, were the frequency of the sales which constituted the supply and the fact that they were for reward. Unlike De Simoni (supra) and the cases there considered, these were simply particulars of how the physical elements of the offence were carried out by the Appellant, not additional or extraneous matters of aggravation.
	
	
	It is well settled that a single count under s 25(1) may charge a course of selling which involves multiple acts, each of which may amount to an offence: R v Locchi (1991) 22 NSWLR 309; Hamzy v R (1994) 74 A Crim R 341; R v F (1996) 90 A Crim R 356. That was the basis upon which Count 1 was laid in this case. R v Locchi (supra) and Hamzy v R (supra) were cited and applied in R v Whalen; R v Willer [2003] NSWCCA 59; 56 NSWLR 454 (a case of multiple cultivations in one count) at [59].
	
	
	When more than one transaction is alleged to constitute a “supply” charged in a single count, the transactions must be “connected with one another, in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose, in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as forming part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise”: Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584 at 607. The Crown contended that there was a unifying common purpose here and the Appellant agreed.
	
	
	It is also clear that “supply includes sell”: see the definition of “supply” in s 3(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. A sale may involve payment, or reward, according to ordinary usage. Therefore facts found by the learned Judge on sentence regarding the receipt of payment for individual transactions of supply may be taken into account as defining the manner in which the central physical element of the offence occurred. Facts regarding payment for the drugs supplied are not additional aggravating features in the sense considered in De Simoni (supra).
	
	
	Her Honour was bound to make findings about the manner in which the 157.9g of methylamphetamine had been supplied and to take those findings into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. A charge under s 25(1) founded upon multiple sales over a period has much in common with a charge of conspiracy to import or to distribute drugs, in the respect that a sentencing judge is required to find and take into account the details of the offender’s conduct. In Savvas v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 1 the High Court found no error in a sentencing judge having made detailed findings about the prisoner’s activities in performance of conspiracies to import and to supply heroin, notwithstanding that those findings necessarily involved that the prisoner had committed a number of substantive offences which had not been charged or tried.
	
	
	At 183 CLR 5 the Court approved the following statement of Gowans J in R v Kane [1975] VR 658 at 661:
	


“In my opinion, any considerations which advert to the content and duration and reality of the conspiracy are proper to be taken into account.”


	
	At 183 CLR 7 the Court said:
	


“…it is artificial to ignore what the judgment in Kane describes as ‘considerations which advert to the content and duration and reality of the conspiracy’. And this can hardly be avoided if the actions of the accused are excluded from consideration. That is particularly true in the present case where the conspiracy was of an ongoing nature to import heroin on a large scale…”


	
	At 183 CLR 5 the Court quoted from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in De Simoni (supra) the passage set out at [32] above. It is clear that the Court perceived no conflict with De Simoni (supra) where a sentencing judge found facts which defined the manner of perpetrating the elements of an offence of an ongoing nature, in that case conspiracy, albeit that the facts as found disclosed other offences with which the prisoner had not been charged.
	
	
	The High Court’s approval of the fact finding undertaken in Savvas (supra) is applicable by analogy to a composite charge of supply under s 25(1), as laid in Count 1 in the present case. The primary judge in the present case was obliged to find the facts bearing upon the degree of culpability of the Appellant following a plea of guilty, whereas in Savvas (supra) this task followed a verdict after trial. By whatever course the conviction is arrived at, the role of the sentencing judge, in this respect, is the same. The principle to be taken from the High Court’s decision in Savvas (supra) applies here.
	
	
	Upon a plea of guilty to a charge under s 25(1), the Crown does not prove any circumstance additional or extraneous to the elements of offence merely by particularising the frequency of transactions which comprised the composite supply and the fact that they were sales rather than gifts. The principle in De Simoni (supra) is not attracted here because the particulars relied upon by the Crown (and agreed by the Appellant) as constituting the supply did not go beyond the elements of s 25(1). Nothing said in the judgment of Gibbs CJ dictates that in such a case the manner in which the actus reus of the offence has been played out may not be particularised or proved on sentence because to do so would reveal features, albeit inherent to the case under s 25(1), which might alternatively have founded a charge under s 25A(1).
	
	
	Further, even if De Simoni (supra) would otherwise have a bearing on this case, subs (8) of s 25A would exclude its application. The parties did not refer to or make submissions regarding that subsection. For context, the relevant provisions are all of subss (4)-(8) and (10) of s 25A, as follows:
	


“(4) Alternative verdict—relevant supply offences

If, on the trial of a person for an offence under this section, the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as evidence of commission of the offence under this section, committed a relevant supply offence, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of the relevant supply offence, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(5) Double jeopardy provisions

A person who has been convicted of an offence under this section is not liable to be convicted:

(a) of a relevant supply offence, or

(b) of a separate offence under this section,

on the same, or substantially the same, facts as those relied on as evidence of commission of the offence in respect of which the person has been convicted.

(6) A person who has been acquitted of an offence under this section is not liable to be convicted:

(a) except as provided by subsection (4)—of a relevant supply offence, or

(b) of a separate offence under this section,

on the same, or substantially the same, facts as those relied on as evidence of commission of the offence in respect of which the person has been acquitted.

(7) A person who has been:

(a) convicted of a relevant supply offence, or

(b) acquitted of a relevant supply offence,

is not liable to be convicted for an offence under this section on the same, or substantially the same, facts as those relied on as evidence of commission of the relevant supply offence.

(8) Liability for relevant supply offences not affected by offence under this section

Subject to subsections (5) and (6), this section does not:

(a) remove the liability of any person to be convicted of a relevant supply offence, or

(b) affect the punishment that may be imposed for any such offence.

…

(10) Definitions

In this section:

cannabis means cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, cannabis plant and cannabis resin.

relevant supply offence means any offence under this Act (other than under this section) relating to the supply of a prohibited drug.”


	
	Count 1 under s 25(1) is a “relevant supply offence” within the meaning of s 25A. The double jeopardy provisions in subs (5) and (6) of s 25A have no application here. Aside from them, the effect of subs (8) is that s 25A does not “remove” the Appellant’s liability on Count 1 or “affect the punishment that may be imposed” for that count. Upon the Appellant’s plea of guilty and conviction for the s 25(1) “relevant supply offence”, the punishment to which he is subject is to be determined having regard to, inter alia, the particulars of the transactions which constituted the offence. If the Court were bound to disregard those particulars, upon application of the De Simoni principle as the Appellant seeks to deploy it, then the Appellant’s punishment would be “affected”. By force of subs (8) that is not to occur.
	
	
	The reality that the Appellant’s small quantity, high frequency sales were merely particulars of the core element of his composite supply offence, rather than an aggravating feature to which the De Simoni principle might apply, is brought home by considering the position taken by the Appellant’s former counsel in the sentence proceedings. As referred to at [16]-[22], before her Honour a virtue was made of the small quantities and high frequency in order to characterise the Appellant as a street dealer, said to be less seriously culpable than someone who might sell fewer but larger amounts for pure profit. Reliance was placed upon R v Haidar [2004] NSWCCA 350 at [38]-[52] and cases cited therein. Those submissions recognised that the manner of offending had a bearing upon the Applicant’s degree of culpability and therefore had to be determined by the learned Judge. They recognised that no question of introducing an impermissible point of aggravation would arise from this course.
	
	
	In this Court the Appellant’s counsel presented the argument on Ground 2 as posing an insoluble conundrum. Whilst it was put that the sentencing judge was not permitted to have regard to the frequency of sales and the fact that they were for reward because, on those facts, the Appellant could have been charged under s 25A(1), it was not suggested that any alternative manner of distributing the drug could have been assumed by her Honour for the purpose of discharging her function. Her Honour had to have some description of how the offence had been committed, and any description other than that agreed upon in the Facts would have been fictional. It was submitted that “whilst those facts [ie, the Agreed Facts] were before [her Honour] she simply could not proceed to sentence on the basis of the facts as they stood”. Counsel contended in support of Ground 2 that the Crown could only proceed with sentencing the Appellant under s 25(1) if it “dropped” from its statement of the facts of the case either the circumstance of the sales having been repetitive and frequent or the circumstance of them having been for reward. Counsel accepted that this would result in “an exercise of sentencing on a very artificial basis”.
	
	
	These are particularly unattractive contentions. At sentence, the Appellant negotiated for and obtained the Crown’s agreement to withdraw the s 25A(1) charge upon terms that he would plead to the lesser s 25(1) count on the basis of the Agreed Facts. Now, on appeal, it is said that he cannot be sentenced for the s 25(1) offence at all upon the Agreed Facts. It would be very unsatisfactory if the Appellant, by changing his position from the sentence hearing to the appeal, could drive the Court to such a bind. But he cannot. De Simoni (supra) is inapplicable and s 25A(8) has, in any event, foreclosed the Appellant’s argument.
	
	
	For these reasons, it was not necessary for the Crown to “drop” or for her Honour to disregard agreed features of the manner in which the s 25(1) offence was committed, such as the frequency of sales and the receipt of payment. The absurdity of attempting to sentence the Appellant whilst disregarding the Facts which he accepted, concerning the way in which he committed the offence, did not and does not arise.
	


Reconsideration of accumulation following the concession of Ground 1


	
	The Crown’s concession that her Honour should not have accumulated the sentences in such a way as to impose any additional time to be served for Count 4 (dealing with proceeds) was properly made having regard to such decisions as Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; 198 A Crim R 135 at [26]-[35] and Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463 at [13]-[21]. The present was a case where the admitted proceeds of crime were an accumulation from the sales of drugs as charged in Counts 1 and 3. The Appellant’s dealing in the proceeds occurred as part of his commission of the two offences against s 25(1). It took place in the same period. The sentence for it should be concurrent with the sentences for the supply charges.
	
	
	Her Honour’s error in partly accumulating the sentence for the proceeds charge, by 3 months, requires that this Court must reconsider the sentencing of the Appellant as a whole in order to apply correctly the principle of totality.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The Appellant conducted an effective retail distribution operation over the course of six months, supplying a quantity of methylamphetamine equivalent to over 1,500 individual usage units, or “points”, of 0.1g. The Crown appears to have accepted that the Appellant’s application of the profits of this activity was largely directed to the purchase of quantities of the drug for his own use. Although the evidence was unsatisfactory on that aspect the Court should proceed upon the basis that the Crown’s acquiescence was well informed. The Appellant’s assertion about spending the profits to supply his own addiction should be accepted. This really does not detract from the very serious level of infringement of s 25(1).
	
	
	The submission of his counsel to her Honour that he was not carrying on the trade for greed and was not living “a high life” attempts to create a spurious distinction. He told his psychologist that “at the height of his crystal methamphetamine usage, … this cost him between $2,500 and $3,000 per week. … he used the money that he made through selling drugs to fund his own usage”. On this basis, he has lived an extravagant lifestyle in the sense of large-scale spending but has directed it to the consumption of intoxicants rather than the acquisition of possessions. It is not apparent why that should be regarded as diminishing his criminality in this case. He could not be said to have lacked control over his actions with respect to drug use: he informed his psychologist that he abstains from alcohol as a religious observance.
	
	
	He chose to fund his need for the drug by spreading it to others. Notwithstanding his own usage the Appellant remained clear thinking enough to be able to carry on his trade in a rational, clandestine and efficient manner. The seriousness of retail distribution such as that by the Appellant lies, in part, in its contribution to servicing and maintaining the market for methylamphetamine. This maintained market in turn provides the economic incentive for manufacture, importation and distribution at the bulk and wholesale levels.
	
	
	The cannabis supply charge was obviously less serious than Count 1 from the point of view of the law, because this drug is treated so differently from methylamphetamine in terms of traffickable and commercial quantities and applicable penalties in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act itself. However the cannabis supply which was charged under Count 3 had a significance to the overall criminality. The Appellant’s supply of this drug enabled him to offer choice which, it may be inferred, would have enabled him to attract custom. The business potential of selling cannabis as an adjunct to the sale of the methylamphetamine may be seen from the Appellant’s own experience, recounted to his psychologist. He said that he commenced using cannabis at the age of 25 years (the year before these offences):
	


“He identified [to his psychologist] that initially he smoked cannabis once every three days or so, but that his usage increased, and within six months he was smoking cannabis daily, up to 1 ounce per week. … During the period of a few months when he was smoking cannabis daily, Mr Jadron opined that he also commenced smoking crystal methamphetamine (or ice). He noted that initially he smoked 3 points per week, but that over time this increased to 7g per week.”


	
	Although Count 3 could have been prosecuted in the Local Court, where the maximum penalty would have been 2 years, the Director of Public Prosecutions was not obliged to take that course. It was a justifiable decision, having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the three preceding paragraphs, that the charge be dealt with on indictment so that the significance of this count could be considered in conjunction with the methylamphetamine aspect of the Appellant’s activities. As mentioned at [3], the maximum penalty for this offence, prosecuted on indictment, was 10 years: s 32(1)(h).
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	The Appellant was born in Afghanistan on 4 March 1986. He is the youngest of four children. His father was killed in fighting in Afghanistan when he was two months old. At the age of 10 years his mother took him and his siblings to Pakistan where they lived in a refugee camp for 12 months. At the age of 11 years, in 1997, the family migrated to Australia as refugees. They lived initially in Auburn and moved to Berala in 2000. The Appellant did not speak English until he commenced to learn the language in this country. He completed school at 18 years of age (2004) and thereafter operated an Internet cafe with his two older brothers for three years. This business was closed in 2007 because it was not profitable. Since then the Appellant has been in receipt of Centrelink benefits on the basis that he is a carer for his mother. The evidence before her Honour did not indicate that he had ever held any employment.
	
	
	The Appellant’s criminal record showed the following convictions and penalties:
	



	
	February 2009 – offences committed on 28 March 2007 (at age 21 years): possession of an unauthorised firearm (sentenced to 6 months imprisonment) and possession of a loaded firearm in a public place (9 months, concurrent).
	
	
	2 May 2008 – offences committed on 19 December 2007: common assault, behave in offensive manner and intimidate police officer in the execution of his duty. In each case a bond was imposed, the longest being for 18 months.
	
	
	3 July 2012 – offence committed on 31 January 2012: affray. A 20 month bond was imposed, under supervision.
	



	
	Obviously these offences were not of like kind with those which were before her Honour. But this record would not attract any consideration of lenience for the Appellant. In particular, it is material that the bond for the offence of affray, committed on 31 January 2012, was imposed on 3 July. For nearly 2 months thereafter until his arrest on 30 August 2012 the Appellant carried on the course of drug supply which is the subject of the current charges whilst under this supervised bond.
	


Conclusion on accumulation and totality


	
	Upon making its concession with respect to Ground 1 the Crown did not also concede that the total effective sentence should be reduced as a result of eliminating the impermissible accumulation. Nor did the Crown argue that either of the individual sentences for the two supply counts should be increased. Those individual sentences are lenient in view of the objective and subjective considerations summarised above. However, in the particular circumstances of this case, where the Crown has conceded an accumulation error but has not argued that any individual sentence was manifestly inadequate, I do not consider that the Court should alter any individual sentence in order to maintain the effective total sentence.
	
	
	The backdated commencement date for the sentences, as agreed upon before her Honour, is 22 May 2013. As mentioned at [4], her Honour fixed the sentence for Count 1 (supply methylamphetamine) to commence 6 months after the commencement of the sentence for Count 3 (supply cannabis). In my view the relationship between the commencement dates of the two supply counts should be maintained. This has the effect that, of the time actually served, the period attributable to the supply cannabis count is 6 months. That is an appropriate duration in the circumstances; any greater accumulation would be disproportionate to the part played by the cannabis offence in the overall criminality of the Appellant’s conduct.
	
	
	In order to maintain the degree of accumulation between the sentences for the two supply counts, whilst correcting their commencement dates to achieve concurrence with the sentence for the proceeds of crime charge, it would be necessary to bring forward by 3 months the commencement dates in respect of both Count 1 and Count 3. This would result in the total sentence being reduced to 3 years 10 months, with an effective non-parole period reduced from 2 years 6 months to 2 years 3 months. The balance term would remain at 1 year 7 months. Those are the only adjustments which I consider should be made to the sentences imposed in the District Court.
	
	
	I propose that the orders of the court should be:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed in part.
	
	
	Order that the sentence imposed in the District Court for Count 3 be amended to the effect that the non-parole period of 12 months commence 22 May 2013 and expire 21 May 2014 and the balance term of the said sentence commence 22 May 2014 and expire 21 March 2015.
	
	
	Order that the sentence imposed in the District Court for Count 1 be amended to the effect that the non-parole period of 1 year 9 months commence 22 November 2013 and expire 21 August 2015 and the balance term of the said sentence commence 22 August 2015 and expire 21 March 2017.
	
	
	The Appellant will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period fixed by Order (4).

		18 August 2015",2015-08-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767515,R v AF [2015] NSWDC 189,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Yesterday I delivered a judgment in which I ruled that s 306I Criminal Procedure Act did not allow the Crown to adduce evidence in the form of evidence earlier given at criminal proceedings in the following circumstances.
	
	
	In 2007 the accused went to trial on a charge alleging that he had sexually assaulted a named complainant. The complainant gave some evidence, but before her evidence was completed, issues regarding the accused’s fitness to be tried arose. That trial was therefore aborted. A fitness hearing was held in which he was found unfit to be tried. A special hearing then took place. At that special hearing, the complainant gave evidence to completion. Her evidence was recorded by means of audio-visual recording and a transcript of that was prepared. The accused was found to have committed the offences and a limiting term was set.
	
	
	Subsequently, as part of its regular review of the accused, the Mental Health Review Tribunal formed the opinion that AF had become fit to be tried. In accordance with the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act, I conducted a short fitness hearing yesterday and determined that he was fit to be tried. The Crown then made application under s 306I that the recording of the complainant’s evidence at the special hearing be admitted as her evidence in the trial, which was then due to commence. Belatedly, after argument was almost completed, the Crown withdrew that application. For reasons which I indicated in a short judgment I delivered yesterday. I refused the Crown’s application. The matter was then adjourned to allow the Crown to speak to the complainant.
	
	
	Upon resumption this morning the Crown made a further application. This was again that the evidence of the complainant at the special hearing be admitted in the trial. But instead of relying on s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act, the Crown relies on s 65 of the Evidence Act. In particular, ss 65(2)(a) and (b) and 65(3).
	
	
	Mr Steel makes a submission, that s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act covers the field in respect of circumstances in which evidence at earlier proceedings is admissible. He suggests that the omission of references to special hearings in s 306I may be the deliberate intention of parliament. I do not consider that that is likely. If that were the case then s 65 would clearly be amended accordingly. Mr Steel says, that it is possible that parliament intended that evidence given at a special hearing could not be tendered at a later trial because of issues of unfairness to an accused. That submission should not be accepted, issues of unfairness are covered by general discretions in the Evidence Act.
	
	
	In my view, there is nothing to suggest that parliament having spoken in s 306I means that the Crown cannot succeed in an application made under s 65 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Turning now to s 65. Of course, the first thing that the Crown must satisfy me of in seeking to rely on that section is that the complainant is not “available”. That term is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act. The Crown relies on the relatively recent amendment which provides that a person is unavailable if, relevantly, the person is mentally unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practical to overcome that inability.
	
	
	The Crown says that the complainant is mentally unable to give the evidence because of the distress and harm that requiring her to give evidence would cause. The Crown relies, in support of that assertion, on evidence given this morning by the officer-in-charge, Detective Sergeant David Shaw, and on a statement made by the complainant herself, that statement being made yesterday afternoon after my ruling on s 306I.
	
	
	Before getting to that evidence, I need to examine precisely what parliament meant by a mental inability. Quite clearly, in one sense, the complainant is able to give evidence about the alleged offence. She is capable of speaking, she is capable of communicating. But equally as clearly, that is not the sort of inability which alone parliament intended to be caught by the definition of unavailable witness.
	
	
	In the second reading speech concerning the Evidence Amendment Bill 2010, the Parliamentary Secretary speaking on behalf of the then attorney general said:
	


“The new subsection is intended to apply where a person is unable to give the evidence, not because the evidence is likely to be unreliable, but because giving the evidence would cause harm to the person, for example, where the person is unable due to major trauma or fear to give the evidence and/or where giving the evidence would have a significant adverse effect on the person’s physical or mental health.”


	
	So parliament intended that a mental inability to give evidence could be demonstrated by evidence which established that giving evidence would cause harm to the person.
	
	
	It is also instructive to consider the report of the joint law reform commissions of Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, which prompted that amendment. That report is to be found at ALRC102. It followed an issues paper, issues paper 28 and a discussion paper, ALRC DP 69.
	
	
	In the issues paper, an amendment to the definition of unavailable witness was foreshadowed based on United Kingdom legislation which provided that hearsay evidence could be admitted where a person is “unfit to be a witness because of his bodily or mental condition”. For reasons given in ALRC102, the United Kingdom wording was not followed, the commissions determining that the formula mentally or physically unable as foreshadowed in the issues paper should be retained.
	
	
	At 8.35 of the report this appears:
	


“As to mental inability, it is intended that such an amendment may facilitate in at least some cases the admission of the transcript of a complainant’s evidence in a retrial”.


	
	I emphasise what then appears:
	


“Requiring the complainant to testify again may, depending on the circumstances of the case, do such emotional or psychological harm to the complainant that the complainant should be considered unavailable to give the particular evidence”.


	
	Thus, both the Law Reform Commission report which led to the amendment of the definition of unavailable witness, and the second reading speech, speak of mental inability to give evidence being demonstrated where emotional or psychological harm, or a significant effect on the person’s mental health, would result from the person giving evidence. I interpret the definition in the dictionary to the Evidence Act in accordance with those statements.
	
	
	The officer-in-charge, who has been dealing with the complainant for some time, gave evidence that the complainant was on medication with respect to mental health issues and had made what he described as three suicide attempts in the past. In 2007 he received an email which contained a suicide note from the complainant shortly after the special hearing completed. Apparently the complainant presented herself to a police station indication a desire to harm herself and treatment was obtained for her.
	
	
	It is important to note the temporal connection between her giving evidence at the special hearing and her expressing at least a fear, if not an intention, to kill herself. I repeat, the evidence of the police officer was that he received this email containing a suicide note shortly after the special hearing completed.
	
	
	There have then been two attempts where the complainant’s attempts at suicide were sufficiently serious that she was admitted to hospital, one following an attempted overdose, and another as a result of which she spent four weeks in hospital.
	
	
	In the officer’s statement which was tendered there are suggestions that the complainant expressed the opinion to Detective Sergeant Shaw that she had had enough and done all that she could be expected to do. But matters go beyond that. The officer who, I repeat, has been involved with the complainant for many years, formed the opinion that she could no longer proceed with the matters. He also says, “I also feel that the process may take her back to the issues surrounding her attempt on her own life”.
	
	
	Of course, as Mr Steel who represents the accused points out, there is no evidence of a psychologist or a psychiatrist. The Crown made an application that matters be adjourned so that such evidence could be obtained, but this was a belated application made after evidence was completed and after submissions had been made, with no real expectation that such evidence could be obtained with any promptness at all, so I refused the Crown’s application for the adjournment.
	
	
	On the other hand, there is in my view plenty of evidence that the complainant would suffer significant harm if she was required to give evidence again. She was unable to even complete watching the video of her giving evidence at the special hearing. She said in a statement tendered to me,
	


“I remember that watching the video took me back to both the initial offence involving the accused and the trial process that followed. This was a very dark place in my mind and I can’t go back there any more”.


	
	She explains that she is genuinely fearful of the accused. But for eight years now she says,
	


“I have been steadily moving forward and leaving him in the past. This whole process brings him to the front again and I can’t do it or allow to become part of me again.”


	
	It is very easy to understand the position the complainant now finds herself in. At the first aborted trial she was abused by the accused who was then mentally unwell. Her evidence could not complete because of that circumstance. At the special hearing, she was also abused by the accused who was still mentally unwell to the extent that the accused was removed from the courtroom during much of her evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that requiring the complainant to give evidence again would cause her severe emotional harm at the very least, if not psychological harm and a real risk of a further attempt at suicide. I am satisfied, therefore, that she is unavailable to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Steel made the submission that all of these recent expressions of emotional harm by the complainant followed from the events of yesterday and that a delay might allow the inability of the complainant to give evidence to be overcome. I do not accept that that is the position. The emotional trauma which the complainant reports has been ongoing and her inability to give evidence without further emotional harm is not something which is likely to be affected by the passage of time.
	
	
	Having dealt with the issue of unavailability I next look at those aspects of s 65 that the Crown relies on. Let me deal with one of them immediately. The Crown says relying on s 65(2)(b), that the representation made by the complainant at the special hearing was made shortly after the asserted fact occurred. The asserted fact, her complaint that in mid-2002 she was sexually assaulted by the accused came six and a half years at least after the offences allegedly occurred. It could not be said that in November 2008 when the complainant gave evidence at the special hearing that this was shortly after she alleged she was sexually assaulted in mid-2002.
	
	
	The Crown does relies on s 65(2)(a), the Crown says that the complainant was under a duty to make her representations. Although this did seem initially attractive because the complainant was subject to a subpoena and had she refused to take an oath or give evidence would have been in contempt of Court, I accept Mr Steel’s submissions that the duty spoken of is not the duty that applies to any witness subpoenaed to give evidence. As I, in the light of Mr Steel’s submissions, interpret s 65(2)(a) it speaks of a duty imposed by something other than a requirement to give evidence. The words “to make representations of that kind” are of assistance here. I am satisfied that 65(2)(a) speaks about duties which are unrelated to personal matters about which the person is making a representation.
	
	
	That leaves s 65(3). In this case the accused was represented by a lawyer at the special hearing and that lawyer did cross-examine the complainant. Section 65(3) does not speak about require an examination of how good that cross-examination was. Any cross-examination would seem to be sufficient to trigger s 65(3) with presumably an ineffective cross-examination being one of the matters that would be taken into account in applying later discretionary considerations.
	
	
	The simple fact is that the complainant was cross-examined during her evidence given in earlier proceedings. I am satisfied, therefore, that s 65(3) does apply and so absent any later discretionary matter the evidence would be admitted.
	
	
	Mr Steel relies on s 137 of the Evidence Act. He points out that by reason of the accused’s then unfitness to be tried there may be issues regarding the adequacy of the cross-examination at the special hearing. I have read that cross-examination. It was clearly based on instructions from the accused. Thus an alternative version of events was put to the complainant. It was suggested that anal intercourse had not occurred, but that penile vaginal and oral intercourse had occurred with her consent.
	
	
	Various matters of fact were suggested to her consistent with an obligation on the cross-examiner to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. Behaviour which no doubt it was suggested was inconsistent with the behaviour of a person who had been sexually assaulted in the way she described was referred to and I can see no deficiency at all in that cross-examination.
	
	
	Of course, there remains the possibility that the cross-examination could have been better. The cross-examiner may have been hampered by the accused’s then unfitness to be tried and indeed his removal from the courtroom soon after the complainant’s evidence commenced. And this is a case where it would be difficult to construct a direction to the jury which would deal with that possible prejudice.
	
	
	Telling the jury that the accused was not present in court for most of the evidence of the complainant at the special hearing or that it is possible that instructions were not given completely because he was unfit to be tried are not the sort of directions that Mr Steel would want me to give because of the risk that they themselves would cause an unfair prejudice to his client. So I accept that there is a risk of unfair prejudice. There is a risk that the jury will give the evidence of the complainant greater weight than it truly deserves because they do not know the circumstances in which the cross-examination took place. On the other hand, it is certainly not the case that demonstrating unfair prejudice leads to the exclusion of evidence. I am satisfied that the probative value of the complainant’s evidence is considerable. Indeed, the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	For those reasons, I will allow the Crown to tender in this trial the recorded evidence of the complainant at the special hearing. There will, of course, need to be some edits to those recordings to remove any of the accused’s outbursts which might otherwise be heard by the jury in this trial.

		04 September 2015",2015-08-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767523,Massey v R [2015] NSWDC 350,"Judgment


	
	This is a case which has taken me some time to consider. An experienced businesswoman was in partnership in a local retail business. She and her business partner had different roles and they did not get on well with each other. In those circumstances, on one occasion, the woman forged her partner’s signature on a document that, in her opinion, should have been submitted and which her business partner did not agree to submit. She then sent the document off. The woman’s name is Narelle Therese Massey.
	
	
	On 23 June 2015 Ms Massey pleaded guilty in the Local Court here in Bega before his Honour Magistrate Dick to two charges. The first is called making a false instrument to obtain a financial advantage. That is an offence against s 253(b)(ii) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards the offence as very serious and has fixed a maximum of ten years imprisonment to the crime. The jurisdictional limit of his Honour was, however, two years imprisonment. The second offence that Ms Massey pleaded guilty to is using a false document to obtain a financial advantage. That is an offence against the following section, s 254 of the Crimes Act. Parliament again has fixed a maximum ten years imprisonment to that crime, bearing in mind that his Honour had a jurisdictional limit of two years.
	
	
	His Honour convicted Ms Massey on her plea of guilty and ordered that she enter into a good behaviour bond for 12 months. That is an order which his Honour made under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Ms Massey has appealed against the sentence. Through her solicitor, Mr P Thompson, she asks me to exercise the power I have under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to not record a conviction and to put her on a good behaviour bond.
	
	
	Mr Thompson called his client to give evidence. She explained the circumstances of the business. She was responsible for selling and marketing certain computer products. Many of them were Apple computers. She had two suppliers and one of them dropped out. That put pressure on her to find a second supplier. Having two suppliers was important for obtaining the products at reasonable rates. She found a second supplier, but the second supplier needed documents filled in for credit. The documents required a director’s guarantee. That is not unusual, of course, in business. However Ms Massey’s partner in business refused to sign the director’s guarantee. He offered a good reason not to sign it; he had received advice not to sign a director’s guarantee. As a lawyer one can understand the basis for that advice being given. Ms Massey persevered in trying to convince her partner to sign but he maintained his refusal.
	
	
	Ms Massey was about to go on leave - her husband needed to have a serious operation. She was going to take a week or ten days off. Christmas was approaching and she was aware of her need to have supplies of the computer products available. She then took a step which was not only very foolish, but was criminal. She wrote on the finance application form in the place provided for the director’s guarantee a signature which purported to be that of her business partner. She did not obtain his permission. She then took a second criminal step by sending the form by fax to the company which required it. She added that she knew that that company would require the original of the documents. She filed the application away and then attended to her husband and his medical circumstances.
	
	
	In other words, what Ms Massey had done was to forge her business partner’s signature on a document which she then proceeded to submit to a third party. It was an application for credit. That kind of behaviour in business is obviously completely unacceptable and no doubt one reason why Parliament has fixed such a significant penalty to the crime.
	
	
	When Ms Massey went to Canberra, her husband’s operation did not proceed well. Regrettably, he had a stroke and remained in the intensive care unit for nearly 40 days and then spent a lot of time in rehabilitation. In the meantime, back here in Bega, the false document was found and her business partner had commenced proceedings, understandably, to dissolve the partnership.
	
	
	Ms Massey acknowledged in cross‑examination by Mr B Page who appears for the respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, that her business partner had made it very clear that he was not interested in signing the document and she said she took the steps in order to “get the ball rolling”. She knew that the company would require further documents such as financial documents to be submitted before it was approved. She acknowledged, also in cross‑examination, that she knew that her partner had not signed the document because it exposed him to a personal liability. I should add that the application was for a line of credit of some $30,000.
	
	
	To her credit Ms Massey has no previous convictions whatsoever. She also has two references from well‑regarded people within the community. One is the manager and director of a local business who has known Ms Massey for around ten years. To her credit it appears that she has explained to both referees the circumstances of her offending, although obviously emphasising the stress and pressure that she was feeling. One of the referees said that he could “fully understand that personal pressure and frustration with her business partner may have led her to mark the document as she did”. He referred to her husband’s illness as well. He attested to her community mindedness and her family orientation and said that he accepted Ms Massey’s account that she “marked the document in a time of sheer stress and frustration”. He added significantly that he had “never had any occasion to have any doubts as to her honesty in any way, shape or form. I don’t think that one small mistake should ruin her reputation and be the cause or barrier to her future employment”.
	
	
	The other referee has known Ms Massey for about 13 years as a work colleague and then as a friend. She said how Ms Massey had conducted a successful bookkeeping business “where confidentiality and honesty are paramount”. She said that she believed “Narelle to be an honest and reliable person, she is recognised as an upstanding business woman within our community”. She and Ms Massey “have discussed this matter at length. I know she was under a lot of pressure with trying to run her business with a conflicting business partner”. That referee said that Ms Massey “has indicated to me she is very regretful for the actions she took in marking the signature area of the credit application”. The referee also acknowledged the “added stresses with her husband needing” surgery. This witness also acknowledged Ms Massey’s contribution to the community and to her family. That witness added her opinion that Ms Massey’s “lapse in judgment should not be allowed to tarnish her good character and limit her future opportunities”.
	
	
	I took a day to consider this case because I really was of two minds about how to deal with it. Mr Page’s position on behalf of his client was that this was ultimately not a case for not recording a conviction. He emphasised the stress which Ms Massey had placed upon her own view and her own opinion about how the business should be conducted and that as a result of that view she had forged and submitted the document clearly against her partner’s wishes. He made the telling point that it appeared that Ms Massey had not expressed her genuine remorse. I think there is some force in that last point, although I expect that Ms Massey has probably become more remorseful over the last couple of days.
	
	
	Mr Thompson emphasised the purposes of sentencing which are provided for in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which include the rehabilitation of his client. Of course they also provide for adequate punishment and protection of the community from the offender. Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets out factors which I can take into account. They include a person’s character and antecedents as well as the “extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed”.
	
	
	On balance, I am going to make an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. My reasons are these. Ms Massey has no criminal record whatsoever. She is now 52 and has not come to the notice of the law at all. Secondly, she is obviously well regarded by two members of the community who have known her for some time including in a business context and who have been informed of her offences. They both emphasise the “lapse in judgment” which Ms Massey has made. The third factor is the circumstances of the offending. Although her behaviour was unacceptable, she was under some personal stress at the time clearly because of her husband’s illness and surgery. So far as the business was concerned it was coming to an important time of the year. None of these reasons is an excuse for what she did but they may be regarded as “extenuating circumstances” so far as the section is concerned.
	
	
	Although as a result of my order Ms Massey will have no criminal conviction, I do propose to order a copy of this judgment and in due course it will be published. I regularly publish my judgments and sentences and I indicated to Mr Thompson that I may well do so in this case. I regard it as important for this reason. For any members of the community who would want to find out, they should know the full circumstances of the offences and the reasons behind the orders which I have made. That includes, of course, references to Ms Massey’s lack of a criminal record and the good character references but it will also include the details of what she did and the circumstances in which she did it. Normally members of the community would be put on notice by the very fact that Ms Massey has a conviction. She will no longer have a conviction. Although this has been dealt with in open court there may not be many members of the community who are present and that is why I propose to publish my reasons in due course.
	
	
	Accordingly I am going to allow the appeal and the formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of the sentence imposed by the magistrate, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without proceeding to conviction I find Ms Massey guilty of the offences and I make an order discharging her on condition that she enters into a good behaviour bond for 12 months. The conditions of the bond are these:
	



	
	That she be of good behaviour;
	
	
	That she notify the registrar of this Court of any change in her address;
	
	
	That she attends court if she receives a notice to do so.
	


HIS HONOUR:    Ms Massey I have given my reasons. You have heard those. I have got to give reasons for decisions, most of the decisions, almost all of them that I make and you have heard those reasons. You will not have a conviction. I have accepted Mr Thompson’s submissions. You are still on a good behaviour bond for 12 months. That is probably going to date from today now. You have got to stay out of trouble. I do not think you will have any difficulty with that. If you change your home address you have got to let them know here so they can contact you if need be from the Court and if you get a notice to come back to court you have got to do that. Now Mr Thompson will take you out to the registry now where you will fill in a good behaviour bond. Do you understand that?

APPELLANT: Yes I do, thank you.

THOMPSON: Just to confirm that will be in relation to both charges?

HIS HONOUR: Say that again?

THOMPSON: A bond in relation to both charges?

HIS HONOUR: I’m never sure of that.

THOMPSON: I heard your discussion a little bit earlier in relation to another matter.

HIS HONOUR: Yeah I’m never sure. Yes. To be careful we think we need two separate bonds. Why don’t I make two separate orders.


	
	There will be one good behaviour bond in respect of each offence and the orders will be exactly the same in respect of each offence.

		08 February 2016",2015-08-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767524,Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with McCallum J with the following comment. The learned sentencing judge considered the applicant's substance abuse disorder to be inconsequential as he had not taken up the opportunity “because he was not cooperating with the Court's attempts to get him to address that very problem”. As his Honour found, this disorder resulted (at least substantially) from ""his tragic developmental history"". Given that the overall psychiatric condition of the applicant was taken into account, it is unnecessary to deal with the conclusion that it was not significant; with respect, however, I would not accept that it is right to treat the applicant's addiction in this way. Dealing with drug addiction is never easy or straightforward and in this case was complicated by the considerable damage inflicted by the applicant's appalling upbringing. That damage was relevant to and a partial explanation for the applicant's inappropriate attitude to the opportunity for rehabilitation.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: Shane Carroll seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court after he pleaded guilty to a number of charges arising from two entirely separate events.
	
	
	The first was a driving accident in August 2009 which caused the death of the passenger, a friend of the applicant. The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. An offence of driving whilst having methylamphetamine in his blood or urine was taken into account on a Form 1 and a further offence of driving whilst disqualified was dealt with on a s 166 certificate. For the aggravated dangerous driving offence, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. The discount allowed for the plea indicated that the starting point was a term of imprisonment for 6 years. That sentence commenced on 23 February 2010 and had expired before the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	The second was an assault and kidnapping committed by the applicant and two others in January 2010. Each entered pleas of guilty to common assault, contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act in respect of the male victim and a specially aggravated offence of detaining the female victim with intent to obtain an advantage, contrary to s 86(3) of the Act. The maximum penalty for common assault is imprisonment for two years. The maximum penalty for the kidnapping offence is imprisonment for 25 years. Five further offences committed by the applicant were dealt with on a s 166 certificate, as follows:
	



	
	A person not being a police officer wearing or possessing a police uniform contrary to s 203(1) of the Police Act 1900 (NSW);
	
	
	Two charges of possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW);
	
	
	Possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis) contrary to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW);
	
	
	Possessing or attempting to possess a proscribed, restricted substance (testosterone) contrary to s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW).
	



	
	For the offence of assault, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 months commencing on 23 June 2013. That sentence was fixed to commence 3 years and 4 months after the commencement of the sentence imposed for the aggravated dangerous driving offence and was accordingly wholly concurrent with that sentence. For the kidnapping offence, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 8 months. That sentence was fixed to commence upon the expiration of the sentence imposed for the common assault (23 September 2013), and so entailed a substantial degree of accumulation upon the earlier sentences (commencing 2 months before the expiration of the non-parole period for the sentence imposed for the aggravated dangerous driving offence).
	
	
	For the offences on the s 166 certificate the applicant was sentenced to 7 days imprisonment for each of the drug possession offences, two weeks imprisonment for each of the two weapon possession offences and two months imprisonment for the possession of a police uniform. Those sentences were concurrent with each other and with the earlier dangerous driving sentence.
	
	
	The total effective sentence for both the 2009 offences and the 2010 offences was a term of imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 8 years and 1 month.
	
	
	The appeal requires an extension of time, for reasons adequately explained in the applicant’s evidence (affidavits of Chris Eliopoulos sworn 11 November 2014 and 23 March 2015). In summary, the applicant was initially advised that there were no reasonable prospects of success and was accordingly refused legal aid for an appeal. Advice funded privately was later provided by Mr Game SC but the applicant did not have the funds to proceed with a privately-funded appeal. At some later point, the applicant thought to make a fresh application for legal aid on the strength of Mr Game’s advice and, at that point, aid for an appeal was granted.
	
	
	In my view, those circumstances adequately explain the delay. The Crown ultimately took the position that, if the Court saw merit in the point raised by the appeal, an extension of time should be granted.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced for the 2009 offences and the 2010 offences by the same judge on the same day. However, the judge dealt with the 2009 offences separately, publishing separate remarks on sentence. The judge’s remarks reveal that sentence was passed first for the 2009 offences, which involved the applicant alone. For the 2010 offences, the judge sentenced all three offenders at the same time. Accordingly, there were obvious practical or logistical reasons for proceeding as his Honour did. The applicant contends, however, that, in his treatment of the applicant’s subjective case in two separate sets of remarks on sentence, the judge fell into error.
	
	
	The applicant relies on a single ground of appeal, recast during argument as follows:
	


“The sentencing process miscarried by reason of the fact that his Honour sentenced the applicant in two different sets of reasons for sentence. This led his Honour to err in the way in which he dealt with culpability, the applicant’s subjective case, the question of special circumstances, accumulation and totality.”


	
	As submitted on behalf of the applicant, although the course his Honour took was understandable for practical reasons, it is an undesirable approach. The vice of truncating the sentencing process, apart from the risk of inconsistent findings, was that it complicated the task of considering accumulation, special circumstances and totality before proceeding to pass sentence.
	
	
	The driving offence occurred at about 1.00 am at Catherine Field. The applicant had been drinking (he said about six beers). He had also smoked five cones of marijuana and taken methylamphetamine. He left the scene of the accident and accordingly there was no reading as to the precise levels of alcohol or drugs in his blood (he turned himself in the following day).
	
	
	There was no witness to the accident. On the strength of expert evidence it was estimated that the car was travelling at least 120 km per hour in a 60 zone when it left the road. The car veered off the road, ultimately colliding with a wooden electricity pole. A whole portion of the front of the car (including the engine) was dislodged. The passenger was found dead at the scene of the accident.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, the judge found that there had been “a complete abandonment of responsibility” (a reference to the guideline judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252) and that the applicant’s conduct ranked “high in the scale of criminal culpability”. It was not possible for the judge to make findings of fact as to the other considerations in the guideline judgment.
	
	
	When first spoken to by police, the applicant had lied, saying that he was in the back seat of the car and that an unnamed female was the driver. He gave evidence at the proceedings on sentence accepting that his deceit had injured the family and friends of the deceased and expressing remorse.
	
	
	At the proceedings on sentence, it was submitted that the applicant’s grief at the loss of his friend, the passenger, constituted a form of extra curial punishment. While accepting that the applicant was remorseful, the judge rejected that submission. His Honour also held that remorse and self-punishment could not mitigate gross moral culpability, citing R v Koosman [2004] NSWCCA 359.
	
	
	The judge made reference to the applicant’s “tragic developmental history” and his resulting substance abuse disorder but held that this was not of “significant ameliorating or mitigating weight because he was not co-operating with the court’s attempts to get him to address that very problem”. That was a reference to the fact that, at the time of the offence, the applicant was subject to a s 9 bond for failing or refusing to undergo a breath analysis, a condition of which was that he undergo treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
	
	
	The judge declined to make a finding of special circumstances. As already noted, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months.
	
	
	The assault and kidnapping offences were evidently inspired by the fact that the male victim, Glen Mara, owed the sum of $200 to one of the co-offenders, Rikky Sheen. The offences were committed in the context of Sheen’s attempts to recover that debt. Sheen arranged to meet Mara at a BP service station. When he arrived, Sheen asked him to get into a car. Mara became apprehensive, seeing the applicant and the other co-offender (Wilkin) in the car. The applicant yelled at Mara “get in the fucking car”. Mara ran away and was chased by Wilkin, who was carrying an object. Mara believed he was going to be shot. He was not physically assaulted. The charge of common assault was based on the threat of harm and the fear it caused.
	
	
	Mara had asked his girlfriend to wait nearby in her car. The offenders chased her in the car and forced her to pull over. She was subjected to a terrifying ordeal. She was grabbed by the hair and pulled bodily into the car by the applicant, who asked where Mara was. She replied that she did not know, whereupon the applicant accused her of lying and struck her a number of times to the face. The applicant got into her car and forced her to drive to another location. The co-offenders followed in the other car. After a short stop, all three males got into her car. One of the offenders (not the applicant) found a dress in back of the car which he pulled around her neck to choke her. She was later pulled bodily backwards by the dress around her throat through the gap between the two front seats and into the back seat. She was told to put her head down and held in the back seat with a jacket over her head. Eventually, after seeing police in the area, the offenders left the car and she made good her escape.
	
	
	The judge found that it was a very serious example of the aggravated form of offence under s 86(3). With his customary good judgment, Mr Game did not dispute that characterisation of the offence.
	
	
	The judge found that the roles played by each offender were indistinguishable. Sheen was the instigator, since he was attempting to collect the debt. The applicant had taken the lead in terms of directing their activities and being the first to assault the female victim. Wilkin was the one who strangled her and kept her pressed down on the back seat with her head covered. The judge said that none of the offenders was entitled to be regarded as significantly less culpable than the others.
	
	
	Whenever an offender is sentenced to imprisonment for more than one offence and sentences are accumulated, the principle of totality is invoked. The sentencing judge must give careful consideration as to whether the addition of one sentence upon another, each individually appropriate, will nonetheless produce a total sentence which is excessive (having regard to the totality of the criminality involved) or which is crushing. That principle is equally applicable to sentences imposed for completely different offences committed on different occasions as to sentences imposed for offences committed as part of a connected series: see R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743 at 748B per Hunt CJ at CL. In all cases of multiple sentences, the Court must evaluate the overall criminality involved in all the offences and, where necessary, “adjust the prima facie length of the sentences downward in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences”: Postiglione v R (1996) 189 CLR 295 at 308 per McHugh J.
	
	
	It cannot be said that it is impossible to apply that principle when giving separate remarks on sentence for separate offences. As already noted, there were practical reasons in the present case for taking that approach. In particular, since the aggravated dangerous driving offence involved a death, the judge may have considered it inappropriate or at least tactless to have the family of the deceased sit through the remarks on sentence in respect of unrelated offences involving two additional offenders committed several months later. In that respect, the judge’s approach was a thoughtful one, as indeed were his remarks on sentence in each case. Unfortunately, however, I do think the approach miscarried in the present case, primarily for two reasons. First, it resulted in inconsistent findings on important issues in the applicant’s subjective case. In my view, that in itself is a miscarriage of the sentencing process. It is no different than if the judge had made inconsistent findings within the same judgment.
	
	
	Secondly, it impaired the process of intuitive synthesis and resulted in a failure to apply the principle of totality.
	
	
	The vice of dealing with separate offences separately, as if each represented an independent sentencing exercise, was considered by this Court in R v JRD [2007] NSWCCA 55 at [26] to [27] per Howie J; McClellan CJ at CL and Bell J agreeing at [1] and [2]. In that case, as here, the judge approached each sentencing task separately, considering the facts of the first offence, the subjective features of the respondent and then imposing a sentence for that offence before moving on to the next. Justice Howie said:
	


“I do not believe that, in a case where the one offender is being sentenced for a number of offences, it can ever be appropriate to determine the sentence for each offence as if it were the only matter before the Court.”


	
	His Honour reiterated that the Court must decide the appropriate sentence for each offence independently and, for example, not increase the sentence for one offence because there are others committed by the same offender. However, his Honour emphasised that it is not irrelevant to the determination of the sentences for one offence that the offender is before the Court for sentence on other offences.
	
	
	Those remarks were made in the context of Crown appeal against leniency. The error of the two-judgment approach in that case manifested itself in the judge’s failing to have due regard to the significance of persistent offending in assessing the applicant’s culpability. Howie J gave the example (at [29]) that the totality of the offender’s conduct would be relevant to a finding whether a particular offence was an isolated “fall from grace” or whether it was merely an instance of a course of criminal conduct in which the offender was involved.
	
	
	If, as I apprehend, the judge was moved in the present case to protect the dignity of the sentencing process in respect of the offence involving a death, the remarks could have been given separately without trespassing against those principles. But the sentencing task itself cannot be completed in separate steps. As already noted the principle of totality requires the sentencing judge, having arrived at an appropriate sentence for each individual offence, to stand back and assess the overall criminality so as to ensure relativity with the overall sentence. If separate remarks are to be published (which is generally undesirable) the judge must take care to ensure that he or she has applied the principle of totality before reaching a concluded view as to the overall structure of the sentences to be imposed. The separation of the remarks on sentence should be an editing exercise, not one which informs the sentencing exercise itself.
	
	
	In the present case, notwithstanding what was evidently a careful approach, I think the judge allowed the separation of the two tasks to inform the sentencing exercise itself. Perhaps unwittingly influenced by the likely desire of the family of the deceased for a stern sentence (to which his Honour expressly referred at ROS 6.8), his Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s subjective case in those remarks were almost dismissive and certainly less favourable to the applicant.
	
	
	The material before the Court at the proceedings on sentence included a report dated 17 November 2011 from Mr Tim Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist. The report records detail of the applicant’s dysfunctional childhood. His father had been involved with the Irish Republican Army and that involvement had produced unhappy experiences. The father had also been physically abusive towards the applicant’s mother and sexually abusive towards his sister. The applicant had continuing psychological problems as an adult resulting from his exposure to those traumas and feeling unable to protect the women in the family. As a result, he had developed a substance abuse disorder. Mr Watson-Munro expressed the view that the applicant suffered from a range of symptoms from early childhood reflective of an anxiety disorder compounded by the substance abuse disorder. Those difficulties were further exacerbated when, following the fatal accident giving rise to the aggravated dangerous driving charge, he began to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Watson-Munro attributed the genesis of the applicant’s problems to the violence and sexual abuse to which he was exposed as a child. He said, however, that the major destabilising event in his life was the fatal car accident.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence for the 2009 offences, the judge made no explicit reference to that report. It was referred to only obliquely, in the following remarks:
	


As to the psychological injury consequent upon the death of Mr Luxford, this is difficult to gauge. The closeness of his friendship with Mr Luxford and consequently the measure of his distress appears to be something of which I have only Mr Caroll’s word.


	
	Those remarks were made in the context of his Honour’s consideration of the submission that the level of the applicant’s remorse and grief at the loss of his companion, the deceased, constituted a form of extra curial punishment. As already noted, the judge rejected that submission, stating:
	


I appreciate that he has expressed remorse but I am unpersuaded that this is so intense as to justify counting his regrets as part of his punishment.


	
	In the remarks on sentence for the January 2010 offences, the judge made extensive, explicit reference to Mr Watson-Munro’s report. His Honour set out a lengthy summary of the matters recorded by Mr Watson-Munro and the opinions he had expressed. As to the post-traumatic stress disorder, after reciting events recorded in the report up until the fatal accident, the judge said:
	


On to the frail personality thus wrought, the fatal motor vehicle accident which killed a young man who was his friend produced, as an effect, a post-traumatic stress disorder from which the prisoner is still suffering, and for which he requires treatment.


	
	In respect of the 2009 offences, the judge found that the applicant’s substance abuse disorder (which was a result of his tragic developmental history) was “relevant but not of significant ameliorating or mitigating weight, because he was not co-operating with the Court’s attempts to get him to address that very problem”.
	
	
	His Honour also found that there were no special circumstances requiring a departure from the statutory ratio in respect of the August 2009 offences. As submitted on behalf of the applicant, the question of special circumstances could not in truth be properly addressed without considering the applicant’s overall criminality and his overall subjective case.
	
	
	In my view, the applicant has also established that the delivery of two sets of reasons affected his Honour’s consideration of the principle of totality. No reference was made to the principle of totality in the reasons given in respect of the 2009 offences. In the remarks on sentence for the 2010 offences, the judge explained the commencement date (five months before the completion of the earlier non-parole period) as follows:
	


Thus, whilst it is cumulative upon part of the sentence delivered earlier today, it is also partly concurrent with that sentence. This is in deference to the principle of totality, although the crimes themselves are completely different.


	
	In the result, in my view the sentencing process miscarried. In accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37, it is necessary to re-sentence the applicant. In doing so, it is necessary to have regard to the principle of parity. This Court should not intervene with the sentences imposed upon the applicant in such a way as to create disparity with his co-offenders in the January 2010 offences: see Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49. Mr Game submitted that it would not be inconsistent with the principles stated in Kentwell to preserve the terms of sentence determined by the sentencing judge but to increase the degree of concurrency. In my view, that is the appropriate course in the present case. The way in which the sentencing process miscarried was in the failure to apply the principle of totality, which resonates in the degree of accumulation rather than the terms of the individual sentences.
	
	
	Since the sentences imposed in respect of the driving offence and the offence of common assault have expired, the appropriate course in my view is to backdate the commencement date of the sentence imposed for the kidnapping offence. In my view, an appropriate structure to reflect the overall criminality of the offences would be to increase the degree of concurrency by two years, so that the applicant will have served a total sentence (for all offences) of 8 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 1 month. That entails a departure from the statutory ratio of the non-parole period and the balance of term (whether considered by reference to the individual sentence or the total). In my view, that is appropriate so as to preserve the period of supervision on parole contemplated by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	As already noted, the commencement date fixed by the sentencing judge was 23 September 2013. The effect of the order I propose is that the sentence will be taken to have commenced on 23 September 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months expiring on 22 March 2016 and a balance of term of 2 years and 8 months expiring on 22 November 2018.
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	That the time within which the applicant may appeal against his sentences be extended to 11 November 2014.
	
	
	That leave to appeal be granted.
	
	
	That the sentence imposed for the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping be varied so as to commence on 23 September 2011 with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months expiring on 22 March 2016 and a balance of term of 2 years and 8 months expiring on 22 November 2018.
	
	
	The applicant will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 22 March 2016.

2767530,Riggio v R [2015] NSWCCA 223,"___________________________________________________________________

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Garling J in draft. I agree with the order proposed by his Honour and with his reasons.
	
	
	I also agree with the additional remarks of R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: The first ground of appeal is concerned with the process whereby the learned sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence. It asserts an error in the assessment of indicative sentences for the individual offences. But the indicative sentences are not amenable to appeal. Identification of error in the assessment of indicative sentences may be of some utility if it supports a contention that the aggregate sentence is excessive. However, the applicant does not assert that the aggregate sentence is excessive. In any event, I agree with Garling J that the asserted error is not established.
	
	
	The second ground of appeal asserts that the judge took into account the applicant's criminal history in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences. It involves a misinterpretation of the judge's remarks on sentence: a confusion of his comparison of the applicant's case with that of the co-offender on the one hand and his later and separate discussion of the objective seriousness of the offences on the other. Again, I agree with Garling J that no error is established.
	
	
	In my view, the proposed appeal is devoid of merit. I agree that leave should be refused.
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by McClintock DCJ on 25 July 2014.
	
	
	The applicant, Fernando Riggio, pleaded guilty before McClintock DCJ to an indictment on which there were two offences, each contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Trafficking Act”).
	
	
	The first count was expressed in this way:
	


“Between 30 May 2011 and 18 June 2011, at Leichhardt in the State of NSW, did supply a prohibited drug, namely, 3-4 methylenedioxyamphetamine, in amount of 403.4gms being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug.”


	
	The second count was in the following terms:
	


“Between 6 August 2011 and 9 August 2011, at Leichhardt, in the State of NSW, did supply a prohibited drug, namely, 3-4 methylenedioxyamphetamine, in amount of 450gms being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug.”


	
	At the time he stood for sentencing, the applicant asked that a further offence be taken into account pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). That further offence, which was placed on a Form 1, was that between 30 May 2011 and 18 June 2011, the applicant supplied 410.5gms of a prohibited drug, namely, propoxyphene. This was an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Trafficking Act.
	
	
	It is also convenient to note that there was an offence for which McClintock DCJ sentenced the applicant, which he was asked to deal with pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The offence related to possession of a small quantity of cocaine. The applicant pleaded guilty to this offence. His Honour imposed a 1 month term of imprisonment, which was wholly concurrent with the other sentences imposed. No issue arises with respect to this conviction and sentence. It can be put to one side.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for an offence against s 25(2) of the Trafficking Act is 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000. A standard non-parole period of 10 years is fixed by the legislation.
	
	
	With respect to the offence on Form 1, although the applicant was not being sentenced separately for it, it is appropriate to note that it carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years and a fine of $220,000. It is not a minor offence.
	
	
	McClintock DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months to commence on 11 August 2011 and to expire on 10 April 2018, with a balance of term of 3 years and 4 months, making a total sentence of 10 years which will expire on 10 August 2021.
	


Facts


	
	The following summary is taken from the Summary of Facts which was tendered to the sentencing Judge, and from his Honour’s summary.
	
	
	The applicant was identified by police in the central metropolitan region as being involved in a criminal enterprise to supply quantities of the prohibited drug, 3-4 methylenedioxyamphetamine (“MDA”) with two other offenders, Mr Albiciuc and Mr Lai.
	
	
	The circumstances of the first offence were that the applicant negotiated the purchase of MDA powder from Mr Lai who was living in Melbourne. It was agreed between the applicant and Mr Lai that Mr Albiciuc would travel to Melbourne to meet with Mr Lai where he would collect the MDA powder and then transport it back to Sydney to supply to the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant and Mr Lai made arrangements for a suitable date for Mr Albiciuc to meet with Mr Lai in Melbourne. On Friday 10 June 2011, Mr Lai telephoned the applicant and informed him that he would be collecting the MDA on the next day, being Saturday 11 June 2011, and that it would be appropriate for Mr Albiciuc to come to Melbourne on Monday 13 June 2011.
	
	
	In fact, Mr Albiciuc left his home and travelled to Melbourne on 14 June 2011. He met with Mr Lai and they visited a number of places together over a number of days. Eventually, on Friday 17 June 2011, Mr Lai received a telephone call from an unidentified associate who informed him that the drugs were available. Mr Lai obtained the drugs and provided them to Mr Albiciuc who then travelled back to Sydney. As he travelled to Sydney late on the afternoon of Friday 17 June 2011, the applicant telephoned Mr Albiciuc and enquired as to his progress.
	
	
	Late on the evening of Friday 17 June 2011, Mr Albiciuc was stopped by police on the Hume Highway just north of Marulan.
	
	
	The police searched the vehicle being driven by Mr Albiciuc and, in a compartment on the rear passenger seat, they located 403.4gms of brown powder packaged in a vacuum-sealed bag, which was later analysed as MDA with a 53% purity. Police also located two large resealable bags containing a white or cream coloured powder, which was later analysed and identified as propoxyphene, with a weight of 410.5gms.
	
	
	Mr Albiciuc was arrested by the police.
	
	
	For the purposes of the Trafficking Act, the commercial quantity of MDA is 125gms and the large commercial quantity is 500gms. The indictable quantity for propoxyphene is 50gms, and the commercial quantity is 2.5kg.
	
	
	The supply of the MDA constituted the first offence on the indictment. The supply of the propoxyphene constituted the offence which was placed on the Form 1.
	


Second Offence


	
	On the day after Mr Albiciuc was arrested, the applicant spoke with Mr Lai and discussed the fact that Mr Albiciuc had been arrested. The applicant attempted to identify what had gone wrong. He suggested to Mr Lai that something must have happened in Melbourne and asked Mr Lai to come to Sydney so that he could talk with him.
	
	
	On 23 June 2011, Mr Lai flew to Sydney and met with the applicant at his residence, which was above a restaurant at Leichardt, in which the applicant was involved. Later that evening, Mr Lai boarded a flight and returned to Melbourne.
	
	
	In the following days there were a number of text messages and conversations between the applicant and Mr Lai, largely dealing with whether there had been any mistake with respect to the previous supply of drugs, and also relating to the supply of a further quantity of MDA tablets.
	
	
	According to the Facts, sometime between 7 August 2011 and 8 August 2011, the applicant supplied Mr Lai with 1,800 MDA tablets via a courier. On 8 August 2011, the applicant sent a text message to Mr Lai to ask what was happening. Mr Lai replied “I only received 1,800 not 2k”. The applicant responded, “I counted myself bro”. Mr Lai sent a message “One bag said 300, rest 500 each”.
	
	
	It was agreed in the Statement of Facts that the typical average weight of a tablet found to contain a prohibited drug is 0.25gms. Accordingly, the police calculated that 1,800 tablets would weigh 450gms. As noted earlier, the commercial quantity of MDA is 125gms, and the large commercial quantity for that drug is 500gms.
	
	
	On 11 August 2011, the applicant was arrested at his residence located above the restaurant in Leichhardt. The premises were searched. A sum of cash was found concealed in a television unit. Two mobile phone handsets and two SIM cards were discovered. One of the SIM cards was found concealed behind a lounge. In another area of the residence, police found a set of electronic scales, a smaller set of electronic scales and an open packet of Glad Resealable Bags.
	
	
	The applicant was conveyed to the Newtown Police Station where he underwent an electronic interview. He denied to police that he was in any way involved in the supply of prohibited drugs, and denied that he had discussed prohibited drugs with Mr Lai or Mr Albiciuc.
	
	
	The applicant has been in custody since the day of his arrest on 11 August 2011.
	


Local Court Proceedings


	
	In the Local Court, the applicant pleaded not guilty. A contested committal hearing was held and he was committed for trial to the District Court in December 2012. The applicant first entered pleas of guilty to the offences on the indictment on 9 August 2013.
	
	
	By the time that the applicant came to be sentenced in the District Court, the co-offender had been dealt with. However, he was not dealt with by the sentencing Judge in this case.
	


Sentence Proceedings in the District Court


	
	The sentence proceedings commenced on Friday 2 May 2014, when the Crown tendered, without objection, a series of documents.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant tendered a series of documents including a letter from his client to the Court, a report of a Mr Watson Munro, psychologist, and a bundle of references from family members and friends of the applicant.
	
	
	Statistics from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales were also tendered and became an exhibit.
	
	
	In his letter, the applicant expressed his remorse and contrition for the offences for which he stood for sentence. He expressed his deep embarrassment and his regret at his circumstances. He informed the Court that, after he had been released from prison in 2005, a matter to which it will be necessary to return, he had acquired a restaurant in Leichardt where he had spent almost every day and night working for six years. He informed the Court that, having moved the business to larger premises in 2011, he had suffered a significant heart attack which required him to be hospitalised.
	
	
	He asserted in his letter that, upon release from hospital, he was again faced with more pressure “… when I was confronted by a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang (in April 2011) asking me to pay a sum of $25,000 before the doors of the restaurant opened. …”.
	
	
	The applicant claimed he was overwhelmed by the request and although advised by his daughter to go the police, he did not do so. Rather, he claimed that he was introduced to a friend who could obtain a loan of the money for him for a short term period. He then informed the Court that the restaurant had not been as successful as he had anticipated, that he was in a great deal of debt and that, as a consequence, he had resorted to dealing in drugs.
	
	
	The reference in that letter to his previous offences called up a previous episode of criminality involving the possession, supply and manufacture of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	On 23 September 2004, Hosking DCJ sentenced the applicant to various terms of imprisonment with respect to five counts upon which he had been convicted. In combination, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing on 9 February 2001 and expiring on 8 February 2005, with a balance of term of 18 months.
	
	
	The five offences consisted of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug (2 offences) and being knowingly concerned in the supply of a prohibited drug (3 offences). As well, the applicant asked for three further offences to be taken into account at the time of that sentencing, one being goods in custody reasonably suspected of being stolen, one being the supply of a prohibited drug in an indictable quantity, and one being possession of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	These were the only offences of any relevance on the applicant’s prior criminal history.
	
	
	The sentencing Judge received written submissions from both the Crown and counsel for the applicant. They were comprehensive submissions. The Crown submitted that the offences were very serious. It submitted that the applicant was a principal in the enterprise along with Mr Lai. The Crown submitted that the enterprise involved moving reasonably large quantities of prohibited drugs between Melbourne and Sydney.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the quantity of drugs as being a relevant consideration to the assessment of objective seriousness. In respect of Count 1, the Crown pointed out that the quantity of drugs was more than three times the commercial quantity, and in respect of Count 2, that the quantity was just under four times the commercial quantity.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the only evidence with respect to the motivation for the offences appeared to be a financial one, because it could not be said that the applicant had involved himself in the offences to maintain a drug addiction.
	
	
	The Crown noted that the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity. Ultimately, the Crown submitted that the offences fell above the mid-range of seriousness for the type of offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was a particular need for general deterrence in cases involving dealing in, and supplying, prohibited drugs. It also drew attention to the need for specific deterrence to feature in sentencing the applicant in light of the previous convictions for similar offences, and the fact that the applicant had re-offended.
	
	
	With respect to the applicant’s plea of guilty, the Crown set out the history of the committal proceedings, and submitted that the guilty plea was not made at the first available opportunity, and it could not be categorised as an early plea. It submitted that there was a significant delay between the time of committal and the time of the plea, which reduced the utilitarian value of the pleas.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the sentence which had been imposed on the co-offender, Mr Albiciuc, but noted that there was a different number of offences charged, and that the applicant’s role and level of participation was significantly different from that of Mr Albiciuc, who could be regarded essentially as a courier.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel submitted that the objective criminality of the applicant should be considered as being at a mid-range level of objective seriousness. He submitted that it would be an error to treat the applicant’s prior criminal record as increasing the objective seriousness of the offence, but conceded that it was available by reference to sentencing principles of retribution, deterrence and protection of society to indicate that a more severe sentence would be warranted.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel submitted that his plea of guilty indicated an acceptance of responsibility by him for the offences, and a willingness to facilitate the administration of justice. He also submitted that the sentencing Judge should find that the plea of guilty corroborated the applicant’s contrition and remorse for the commission of the offences.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel submitted that an appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the guilty plea was between 15% and 20%, and that a finding of special circumstances ought be made with a consequent reduction in the otherwise appropriate non‑parole period.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Remarks on Sentence were delivered by his Honour on 25 July 2014. They were comprehensive. Of the applicant’s role, his Honour found that the material demonstrated that the applicant was the principal in what seemed to him to be a small drug supply network. His Honour said that it was the applicant’s role to arrange transactions between himself and Mr Lai using Mr Albiciuc as a courier or go-between.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the sentence which had been imposed upon Mr Albiciuc. Having described it and the Crown case against Mr Albiciuc, his Honour concluded that the applicant’s case differed significantly from that of his co-offender. He held that because the applicant was the principal and the co‑offender was directed in what to do, the applicant’s criminality was much more significant and much more serious.
	
	
	As part of the discussion in which the position of Mr Albiciuc was being distinguished by his Honour, his Honour mentioned that the applicant had a significant past criminal record of relevance. Clearly Mr Albiciuc did not.
	
	
	His Honour then sketched the applicant’s personal background, and his subjective circumstances leading up to the offence. In so doing, his Honour generally recounted the version for which the applicant contended, based upon the material put before his Honour, such as the letter from the applicant. His Honour accepted, in part, the report of the psychologist that the applicant was suffering from depression and anxiety. His Honour concluded that, on the facts before him, that condition was not in any way connected to the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced.
	
	
	His Honour rejected the applicant’s account that the offences took place in the context that he was stood over for the payment of money. That rejection was based upon an absence of sworn evidence, both from the applicant and from others who would be able to recount the circumstances. Ultimately, his Honour concluded, having rejected the suggestion of duress, that the only finding which was available was that the applicant committed the offences for his own financial gain.
	
	
	His Honour rejected the findings of the clinical psychologist on this issue because they were not based on a firm factual foundation which had been justified by the admission or acceptable evidence.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the objective seriousness of the offences. He said that they were objectively very serious and they related to a commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. His Honour, in global terms, referred to the well‑known authorities that people who dealt in commercial quantities of drugs should be dealt with by sentencing courts with the imposition of a condign punishment.
	
	
	His Honour noted that there were two separate acts of criminality and, as well, the Form 1 offence. He then said:
	


“There has to be a degree of accumulation given, that they occur on different dates, and involve very significant amounts of drugs. They are separate and I intend to accumulate them.”


	
	His Honour then said, at page 13 of the Remarks on Sentence, this:
	


“I do not intend to impose a standard non-parole period partly because of the medical condition of the offender, which I find will need significant care whilst in jail and out of jail, partly for the need for supervision, and partly because of issues of accumulation and the need for the offender to be assisted over a long term in terms of rehabilitation.”


	
	It is to be remembered that whilst a standard non-parole period of 10 years existed for each of the two offences, it was not directly applicable because the applicant had pleaded guilty. It was to be considered, together with the maximum sentence, as a legislative guidepost: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. This is the approach adopted by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	His Honour then expressed himself as taking into account the offender’s subjective case. He then said:
	


“As I have indicated, I intend to find special circumstances, in part to assist the rehabilitation of the offender, and part because he will need supervision.”


	
	His Honour then went on to set out that he proposed to impose an aggregate sentence. He then moved to address the question of indicative sentences. In respect of each count, he indicated a sentence of 9 years with a 6 year non‑parole period. He then addressed some remarks to issues of totality and also the existence of the Form 1 matter, and proceeded to impose the aggregate sentence of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months. He ordered that the sentence commence on 11 August 2011, being the day the applicant was taken into custody.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	A Notice of Application for leave to appeal was filed on 10 April 2015. It included two specific grounds of appeal. They were:
	



	
	the sentencing Judge erred in adopting a blanket assessment by indicating the same sentence for each of the offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced;
	
	
	the sentencing Judge erred in using the applicant’s prior offending so as to increase the objective seriousness of the offences.
	



	
	It is appropriate to consider these grounds separately.
	


Ground 1 - Blanket Assessment Approach


	
	The applicant submitted that since the sentencing Judge indicated the same sentence for each of the counts, that he had fallen into error which was indicative of his failure to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offending on the part of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant then made a series of submissions which fell under this ground, but which seemed to be suggestions of discrete error. The first of these was that there was no real assessment by the sentencing Judge of the objective seriousness of the offending in respect of each the counts. The next was that there was no real determination as to the role of the applicant, including significantly where he was placed on the hierarchy of the drug supply network. There was no evidence of the value of the drugs, nor the amount of the money which the applicant had earned from his involvement in the drug offences.
	
	
	Finally, the applicant drew attention to the fact that he received the same sentence on each count, notwithstanding that Count 1 had a Form 1 offence attached to it, and that combined with the errors just referred to, could only lead to the conclusion that an impermissible “blanket assessment” approach had been adopted.
	
	
	With respect to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, the Crown pointed to the concession made in written submissions to the sentencing Judge by counsel for the applicant, that:
	


“… the objective criminality of the offender should be considered to be at mid-range level of objective seriousness.”


	
	The Crown submitted that in those circumstances, his Honour did not need to undertake a detailed analysis before reaching this conclusion.
	
	
	The Crown drew attention to the Remarks on Sentence here his Honour turned to the objective seriousness of the offences, and discussed them. His Honour said that the offences “are objectively very serious”. The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge set out an entirely adequate basis for that finding.
	
	
	I can see no basis for any error on the part of the sentencing Judge with respect to the objective seriousness of the offences and the role which the applicant played. The applicant’s counsel accepted that the offences fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour had regard to the objective seriousness of the offences, and found that they were objectively very serious. He carefully took into account the factors relating to the nature of the offences, the conduct of the applicant, the quantity of drugs involved, and the motivation.
	
	
	I am unpersuaded that the applicant has demonstrated error here.
	
	
	The second issue to which attention is drawn in the applicant’s submissions, is that other than a determination in respect of the first offence – that the applicant was a principal – there was no real determination as to the role of the applicant. It is submitted that there was an absence of evidence in relation to the applicant’s role and, more significantly, where he was placed in the hierarchy of any drug supply network.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the finding made by the sentencing Judge was adequate and attended to relevant principle.
	
	
	In R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270, the High Court of Australia considered matters relating to the sentence of a person convicted of an importation of a prohibited import. The High Court specifically noted that it did not accept that the identification of the precise nature of an accused’s involvement in such an act was an essential aspect of the sentencing process. The High Court also noted that the utility of an exercise of identifying the role of an offender is necessarily limited by the extent to which material facts are known.
	
	
	Here, the agreed Statement of Facts which was tendered gave a reasonably comprehensive description, for the purposes of sentencing, of the actual activities of the applicant in respect of both offences. The conclusion that he was a principal was well open to the sentencing Judge. To the extent that it may be contended that the Judge’s categorisation of the applicant as a principal extended only to the first count, and not to the second count, that does not bespeak error. The criminal conduct of the applicant in the second count was well described. It is clear that the applicant was supplying drugs to Mr Lai, and that he did so. There was no other factual material placed before the Court to suggest that the applicant was other than the principal in that offence.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there is any error in the way that the sentencing Judge approached this matter.
	
	
	Ultimately, this ground was supported by a contention that because the indicative sentence for each of the two counts was the same, the sentencing Judge had erred because he had made a “blanket assessment”, and that this approach was erroneous. The applicant relied upon the judgment of RA Hulme J in JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297 at [39].
	
	
	The term “blanket assessment” is apt to describe indicative sentences touching upon multiple offences. In the circumstances here, where the applicant was being sentenced for two similar offences, it is not an appropriate description.
	
	
	The criminality involved in the two offences was serious. The sentencing Judge correctly said so. The quantity of drugs and the nature of the drugs were similar. The conduct of the applicant in respect of each offence was broadly similar. The offences took place in time proximity, one with the other. The role occupied by the applicant in each case was the same. He was the principal involved in the offence.
	
	
	Obviously, the same subjective factors apply. The difference between the two was that the first offence had a Form 1 offence attached to it. But, it was also the first offence in time. Although one might have thought that the first offence in point of time may, but not necessarily must, have warranted a lesser sentence than a second such offence, that approach was complicated by the need to make proper allowance for the offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	Here, there was such similarity in all of the factors relating to each offence, both objectively and subjectively, that there was no error in a Judge indicating that the sentences for each of the offences would be the same.
	
	
	Concentrating on indicative sentences may well reveal error in the aggregate sentence reached: R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17], however it is necessary to keep in mind that the question for consideration by this Court is whether the aggregate sentence which was imposed was erroneous.
	
	
	Here, the mere fact that identical indicative sentences were described by the sentencing Judge for the two offences does not indicate any error of the kind contended for.
	
	
	I am not persuaded to uphold Ground 1 of the appeal.
	


Ground 2 – Error in Use of Prior Offending


	
	The principle by which an offender’s prior convictions may be relevantly considered on sentencing is clear.
	
	
	In Veen v The Queen (No.2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, at 477 Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ, said:
	


“… The antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: … The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration, or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender, and other offenders, from committing further offences of a like kind.”


	
	The applicant submits that the prior criminal history of the applicant was improperly used by the sentencing Judge to warrant the imposition of a higher penalty. The applicant points to the Remarks on Sentence where the sentencing Judge was engaged in a comparison of the role of the applicant and his co‑offender. The applicant cites the following passage in the sentencing Judge’s remarks:
	


“The offender’s case differs significantly from that of his co-offender. In the offender’s case he is the principal. The material demonstrated that he was directing the co-offender in the co-offender’s role. Accordingly, his criminality is much more significant and much more serious. In the offender’s case he has a significant record for like offences.”


	
	The applicant submits that it is clear from a reading of this passage that the sentencing Judge was using the applicant’s antecedent history in his assessment of the objective criminality of the applicant’s conduct, which was an erroneous approach.
	
	
	I do not accept that the applicant has demonstrated error. A fair reading of the whole of the sentencing Judge’s remarks, which is the appropriate approach on appeal, indicates that the passage relied upon occurred in the context of the sentencing Judge considering an issue of parity with the applicant’s co‑offender. The sentencing Judge was drawing attention to the differences between the two offenders, and indicating that he did not regard the sentence imposed on the co-offender as being a constraint on the approach which he was taking to the sentencing of the applicant. No complaint is made in this Court that the sentencing Judge erroneously failed to consider the issue of parity.
	
	
	The trial Judge later separately addressed the issue of objective criminality and the seriousness of the offending. In that part of his judgment, he made no reference to the applicant’s prior criminal history.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that success on this ground depended upon the Court reading that part of the Remarks on Sentence to which I have referred at [92] as being directed to an assessment of objective seriousness. I do not accept that it can, or ought, be read in that way.
	
	
	I am wholly unpersuaded that the sentencing Judge used the applicant’s past record in any inappropriate or erroneous way. I am unpersuaded that error has been established. I would not uphold this ground.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my opinion, the applicant has not established that the sentencing Judge has erred in any of the ways contended for in the two grounds of appeal. I can see no basis for a grant of leave to appeal in this matter.
	


Orders


	
	I would propose the following order:
	



	
	Leave to appeal be refused.

2767532,KB v R [2015] NSWCCA 220,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: On 6 June 2013 the applicant for leave to appeal pleaded guilty before the District Court at Wagga to three charges of indecent assault on a child under 16 years (s 61M(2), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and one charge of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years (s 66A(1), Crimes Act). The offences occurred between January and April 2009. The victim was 8 years old, the offender 52.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each of the offences against s 61M(2) was 10 years. A standard non-parole period of 8 years was prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). For the offence against s 66A(1) the maximum penalty was 25 years and the standard non-parole period was 15 years.
	
	
	The sentence hearing took place before English DCJ on 17 September 2013 and sentence was handed down on 27 September 2013. Leave is now sought to appeal against the severity of the terms of imprisonment imposed. The application is out of time but evidence has been given to explain the delay and extension of time is not opposed by the Crown. I would propose that time be extended and leave be granted. I refer to the offender as the Appellant in the balance of these reasons.
	
	
	At the time the offences were committed the Appellant was employed as a farmhand on a rural property. The complainant lived in a homestead on the property with her father (who farmed the property and employed the Appellant) and with her mother and sisters. One of the complainant’s sisters is approximately four years older than her.
	


Local Court charges concerning complainant’s sister


	
	Prior to the sentence hearing in the District Court the Appellant had pleaded guilty to four charges of indecent assault against the complainant’s older sister (s 61M(2)) and one charge of breaching an apprehended violence order. These offences had occurred between 1 June 2009 and 30 November 2009. They were dealt with in the Local Court at Cootamundra on 19 August 2013.
	
	
	The four offences contrary to s 61M(2) were perpetrated at the family property when the sister was 13 years old. They involved kissing her and touching her buttocks, chest and genitals. The Magistrate imposed non-parole periods of between 6 months and 12 months with the balances of the respective terms ranging between 3 months and 7 months. With some degree of accumulation, these sentences resulted in the Appellant commencing in custody on 19 August 2013 and not being eligible for release on parole until 18 December 2014 (16 months). The last date of expiry of the balance periods was 18 July 2015 (an additional 7 months).
	


The charges and sentences in the District Court


	
	The offences that are the subject of the present application for leave to appeal were as follows (together with a short statement of the circumstances and the sentences her Honour imposed). Pleas of guilty to these counts were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of an indictment which also contained alternate counts.
	
	
	Count 2 alleged an indecent assault on a person under 16 years (8 years) contrary to s 61M(2). Some time in March or April 2009 the complainant was sitting on the knee of the Appellant in the passenger seat of a utility motor vehicle. She was facing the front windscreen. The driver was the complainant’s father. Whilst the father was out of the vehicle at a gate the Appellant placed his hands inside the complainant’s clothing and rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Her Honour fixed a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 7 August 2014 and expiring 6 August 2017. That is, the sentence was made partly concurrent with the last-expiring non-parole period which had been fixed in the Local Court for the offences concerning the sister: there was a period of concurrency of 4 months and 11 days. The balance of the term was fixed at 3 years, for a total sentence of 6 years.
	
	
	Count 4 was a further charge under s 61M(2). Between January and April 2009 an incident very similar to that in Count 2 occurred. When the father got out of the vehicle the Appellant placed his hands inside the complainant’s shorts, this time on the outside of her underwear. He moved his hands around until they were beneath the complainant’s buttocks. A non-parole period of 2 years was fixed, to commence 7 November 2014. Hence, there were three months of accumulation upon the sentence for Count 2 but still 1 month and 11 days of concurrency with the last-expiring of the non-parole periods set in the Local Court. The balance of the term was fixed at 3 years; the total sentence was therefore 5 years.
	
	
	Count 5 was again laid under s 61M(2). Around April 2009, whilst the Appellant and the complainant were waiting near a pump shed for the complainant’s father to arrive, the Appellant placed his hands underneath the front of the complainant’s shirt and rubbed them up and down on her chest area approximately five times. When she tried to get off the bike the Appellant initially prevented her from doing so by pulling her down by her clothing. She struggled harder and he eventually let her go. Before the complainant’s father arrived on the scene the Appellant said to her “watch out” in what she described as “a really mean voice”. Not long afterwards, when the Appellant was with the complainant at some distance from the shed and out of view of the father, the Appellant once more placed his hands underneath the complainant’s shirt and rubbed them up and down her chest.
	
	
	Her Honour fixed a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 7 February 2015. That is, there were another three months of accumulation upon the sentences for counts 2 and 4. The balance of the term was fixed at 3 years, for a total sentence of 5 years.
	
	
	Count 7 was laid under s 66A(1), Crimes Act, a charge of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. At some time around April 2009 when the complainant was with the Appellant in the vicinity of the pump shed and her father was absent from the area, the Appellant told the complainant to lie down on the seat of a quad bike with her legs apart. He removed her underwear and his own lower clothing, stood with one leg on either side of the quad bike and lay on top of the complainant with his penis touching her vagina. There was partial penetration, he moved his body backwards and forwards and he ejaculated on her.
	
	
	Her Honour fixed a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 7 May 2015 – a further accumulation of three months on the sentences for counts 2, 4 and 5. A balance term of 5 years was fixed so that the total sentence for this offence was 14 years.
	
	
	The overall effect of the sentencing on all counts was a combined non-parole period of 9 years and 9 months and a total balance term of 5 years. As mentioned, the total was concurrent with the overall non-parole period of the Local Court sentences to the extent of four months and eleven days.
	
	
	Together with the sentence proceedings the learned sentencing judge dealt with a severity appeal in respect of the Local Court sentences for the offences concerning the complainant’s older sister. This appeal was dismissed and the Local Court’s sentences were confirmed in all respects. No further challenge has been made regarding that aspect of the proceedings which were before her Honour.
	


Ground 1 – regard paid to sentence decisions subsequently invalidated


	
	The Appellant makes no specific complaint about her Honour’s findings of fact or about the range of considerations taken into account or the weight given to them. The only specific complaint is that regard was paid to sentences for ss 61M(2) and 66A offences determined or upheld in this Court in RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137 and Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88. Ground 1 is that “her Honour’s approach of taking into account as a guide [these] cases … has occasioned a miscarriage of justice”. The basis for the contention is that following the High Court’s decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 the sentences in each of those cases were reduced upon further review in this Court: RJA v R [2014] NSWCCA 89 and Ingham v R [2014] NSWCCA 123.
	
	
	In the relevant passage of the remarks on sentence her Honour made the following statement:
	


“The Court of Criminal Appeal in the decision of R v Leslie [2013] NSWCCA 48 provided a useful review of sexual assault cases prosecuted under s 66A in addition to those prosecuted under s 66A(2). A perusal of some of the facts and penalties is instructive.”


	
	Her Honour then set out in brief terms the facts and outcomes of several of the cases cited in R v Leslie (supra). One of those cases was RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137 in which the offender had been convicted of three offences contrary to s 66A in relation to his natural daughter aged 8 and 9 at the dates of the respective offences. The offender was separated from the child’s mother. The child was temporarily in his care under access arrangements during three separate periods in February, August and September 2004. The offences occurred during these three periods respectively, when the offender was aged 29 to 30 years. He was sentenced after a trial. He was otherwise of good character. During the period of offending s 66A was in the same terms as s 66A(1), as that subsection applied to the Appellant in early 2009, with the same 25 year maximum and 15 year standard non-parole period .
	
	
	In the following table are set out the particulars of the offences considered in the two appeals to this Court entitled RJA v R, together with (a) the sentences determined by this Court in 2008, in the decision to which English DCJ had regard when her Honour sentenced the Appellant and (b) the results of the resentencing by this Court in 2014, pursuant to ss 78 and 79(1)(b), Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) following the High Court’s decision in Muldrock v R (supra). In this table the sentences are expressed in the form “non-parole period + balance term”, in years unless otherwise indicated. The line labelled “Total effective” shows the overall sentence which resulted from partial accumulation.

	The second of the decisions to which her Honour had regard but in which re-sentencing subsequently took place in this Court was Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88. There the offender was convicted after trial of eight offences contrary to s 66A(1), three concerning a 9 year old girl and five concerning an 8 year old girl. There was also a conviction for attempting to have sexual intercourse with one of the victims (s 66B) and there were two counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2). When the offences were committed in October 2006 the maximum penalty under s 61M(2) was the same as it was at the time of the Appellant’s offences. However the standard non-parole period for s 61M(2) was then 5 years whereas it had been increased to 8 years by the time of the offences the subject of this appeal. In October 2006 s 66A was in the same terms as s 66A(1) at the time of the Appellant’s offences, with the same maximum penalty and standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Ingham was a friend of the 9 year old’s mother, who was separated from her husband. He often stayed with the mother over weekends and he babysat the 9 year old girl and at times bathed her. The 8 year old victim was a friend of the 9 year old. All of the offences occurred over one weekend. The offender was 35 years old. The offences were planned and not isolated, there having been some sexual activity with the 9 year old girl on the weekend before. Each offence against each complainant was made more serious by the circumstance that it was committed in the presence of the other complainant. The offender had a prior conviction for sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years old, committed when the offender had been 18 years old. The Court accepted that the risk of reoffending was moderate.
	
	
	Again the results of the two occasions upon which this Court considered the sentencing of Ingham can most readily be appreciated from a table. In what follows, the offences against the two complainants respectively are grouped. For the most part the sentences listed in relation to the 2011 consideration of the case were those which had been imposed at first instance, with adjustments in this Court only to the counts under s 61M(2) (where the sentencing judge had misapprehended the standard non parole period). Total effective sentences for the counts relating to each complainant are shown, together with an overall total effective result.

	In the 2011 decision this Court did not disturb the Sentencing Judge’s order that all offences concerning the 9 year old complainant be concurrent with each other and likewise that all offences concerning the 8 year old be concurrent, with 12 months accumulation between the two groups of sentences. Upon reconsideration in 2014 the effect of this Court’s orders was that there was some accumulation of sentences within those imposed for the offences against the 8 year old so that the non-parole periods collectively were one year longer than the single highest non-parole period imposed for any one offence. A further three years accumulation was provided for as between this group of sentences and those for the offences against the 9 year old. This led to an overall collective non-parole period of 13 years.
	
	
	I consider that the Appellant’s first ground of appeal should be upheld. Her Honour took into account as considerations relevant to the exercise of her sentencing discretion the examples provided by the 2008 RJA decision and the 2011 Ingham decision, both of which have since been set aside.
	
	
	Just as this Court had to re-sentence RJA and Ingham, after reconsidering its own earlier decisions regarding those offenders in accordance with the High Court’s correction in Muldrock, so her Honour’s decision must be reconsidered on the basis that it took account of the original uncorrected Court of Criminal Appeal decisions in those two cases. This Court must therefore re-exercise the sentencing discretion. It becomes unnecessary to decide the Appellant’s second and more general ground, namely, that the sentences imposed by English DCJ were manifestly excessive. However the arguments advanced in support of that ground are relevant to the resentencing exercise.
	


Resentencing – approach generally


	
	For the purpose of resentencing in Ingham v R [2014] NSWCCA 123, Fullerton J (with whom Basten JA and RA Hulme J agreed) summarised the approach to be taken following Muldrock v R as follows, at [24]:
	


“[24] … The approach to sentence mandated in Muldrock requires a synthesis of all factors bearing upon an appropriate sentence for each of the ten counts on the indictment to which a standard non-parole period attaches, including the objective gravity of that offending and the impact of any aggravating factors; the appellant’s subjective circumstances and the legislative guidance offered by the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole periods, without the latter being prescriptive or exerting undue influence in the determination of an appropriate sentence. The standard non-parole period is not to be used as a starting point for a mid range offence after conviction; neither is it to have determinative significance (Muldrock at [31]). It may, however, be a more significant factor where an offence is in the mid range (or above) of objective seriousness and where there is little operating in the offender’s favour (see Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92 at [116]; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [63]).”


	
	At [40] her Honour adverted to the care required when having regard to sentences imposed in other seemingly similar cases. Having noted that both counsel had referred to a number of other decisions of this Court, her Honour continued as follows:
	


“[40] … While there are some common features in each of the cases referred, no two cases are parallel and few are relevantly comparable. The facts and circumstances of each case vary depending on the age of the child, the duration and extent of the sexual assaults, and the extent to which the conduct involves a breach of trust in addition to that which is inherent in the sexual abuse of a child under 10 by an adult. The utility of drawing any conclusions as to an appropriate penalty range was further limited because many cases were decided when the principles in R v Way were the applicable law (see RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137 ; 185 A Crim R 178; and R v Smith [2011] NSWCCA 163 where many of the cases to that date were summarised by RS Hulme J). It is also necessary that sentences imposed after the maximum penalty for s 66A was increased in 2009 are disregarded despite the fact that the standard non-parole period remained at 15 years.”


	
	In the absence of any challenge to the accuracy or completeness of the factual circumstances taken into account by her Honour, I would approach the resentencing exercise in reliance upon the considerations summarised in the remarks on sentence, applying the above principles.
	


Relevant findings in the District Court


	
	English DCJ found that there had been, as would be expected, very considerable and ongoing impact of the offences upon the complainant and her family. Findings were made that the offences involved abuse of the trust placed in the Appellant by the complainant’s family, as both an employee and a friend; the offences took place on the property which was the complainant’s home; the offences were of a predatory nature given the complainant’s very young age and the fact that the Appellant was 52 at the time; there was an implicit threat by the Appellant in his warning “watch out” in connection with Count 5 and the offences constituted a course of conduct of escalating seriousness with an element of planning. Her Honour found that the Appellant had undertaken a process of gaining confidence, over time, that the complainant would not report his actions.
	
	
	The evidence before her Honour included a psychologist’s report which had been prepared on the basis of only the offences against the older sister. This report concluded that the risk of recidivism with respect to the Appellant was low. However her Honour was able to give the report only limited weight because the more serious offences which were the subject of the pleas of guilty before her had not been considered in the report. A need for caution about the level of risk of recidivism remains.
	
	
	Her Honour took full account of the Appellant’s subjective circumstances. He was one of eight children. In childhood he had resided with his family in the same general area as the property on which he had been working when these offences were committed. He had done poorly at school. He had stuttered when young and had had difficulty communicating. He left school halfway through year 10. He was then unable to read but had learned since.
	
	
	After leaving school he had worked in a wool store and later as a farmhand. He remained in employment on one property for approximately 20 years. The owner had been supportive of the Appellant, assisting him to learn to read and to obtain a driving licence. After the property owner died the Appellant had become withdrawn and had appeared to his sister to be depressed. The Appellant’s parents were deceased, his father after a long illness.
	
	
	The Appellant had commenced employment with the complainant’s father in 2000. The two men had known each other for a long time, having attended the same high school although in different years. During the period in which the Appellant worked for the complainant’s father up until these offences came to light, he had been treated as a close and trusted family friend. He had been included in birthday celebrations and other family occasions. Her Honour took into account favourable character evidence including evidence from a disabled man in the locality who had received generous voluntary help from the Appellant.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the Appellant had not demonstrated remorse or even insight. The pleas of guilty to the charges were entered late. In those circumstances her Honour regarded their utilitarian value as limited and allowed a 15% discount. The pleas of guilty were seen as the only indication of contrition.
	
	
	It was accepted by the sentencing judge that the Appellant was suffering from depression, that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and that he had a significant hearing impediment. It was also found that the Appellant’s limited ability to interact with others would make his time in custody more onerous and that he would likely be placed under protection due to the nature of the crimes of which he was convicted. Her Honour considered that he would need significant help on his eventual release to parole and that a longer period of parole with monitoring would be required to reduce the likelihood of him reoffending – these were held to be special circumstances for the purpose of determining the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance term for each offence.
	


Additional subjective material on appeal


	
	For the purpose of exercising the sentencing discretion afresh the Court is asked to take into account a report dated 3 July 2015 of Patrick Sheehan, forensic psychologist. The most material passages are in pars 13, 15 and 17 of the report, as follows:
	


“13 During the interview Mr [B] did speak about his offences but was unable to account for his behaviour. He said he knew it was wrong and did not think of himself as someone who could do such a thing. He could not understand how he overcame his better judgement in his behaviour towards the two victims. He strenuously denied any prior sexual interest in underage girls. His lack of insight suggests an impaired ability to engage in self critical analysis and thought (likely underpinned by low-level verbal intellectual skills, see paragraph 15 below).

15 …His verbal intellectual skills were ‘extremely low’ (1st percentile) and an area of personal weakness. Other aspects of his intellectual functioning involving attention and concentration (‘average’ at the 50th percentile), information processing speed (‘borderline’ at the 8th percentile) and non-verbal/visual intellectual skills (“average” at the 39th percentile) were normal…

17 The totality of information suggests that Mr [B] does not have an intellectual disability. His very low verbal intellectual skills are offset by average perceptual reasoning and working memory. His processing speed is slow but not to the level of impairment. Verbal engagement with Mr [B] may give the impression that he is more impaired than he really is. …in my opinion his verbal intellectual deficits may be relevant to his offending by contributing to reduced social engagement and social intelligence, a reduced ability to establish and maintain intimate sexual relationships in adulthood and a reduced ability to engage in self critical analysis and thought.”


	
	Accepting this evidence at face value, it does not materially add to or alter the summary of the Appellant’s subjective characteristics given in her Honour’s remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The Appellant was charged on 22 June 2011. He was in custody for twelve days before being granted conditional bail on 4 July 2011. He was committed for trial on 20 February 2012. He did not enter his pleas of guilty until 6 June 2012. Consistently with her Honour’s finding, a discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of his pleas is appropriate.
	


Conclusion on resentence


	
	I take all of these matters into account, including this Court’s 2014 decisions in RJA and Ingham, making due allowance for the fact that those offenders were sentenced after trial whereas a 15% discount is appropriate for the Appellant’s early plea. The substituted sentences I propose would involve partial accumulation upon the terms imposed in the Local Court as well as partial accumulation between the periods of imprisonment which seem to me appropriate for each of the four counts under consideration on this appeal. The latter is necessary to recognise the series of independent assaults upon the complainant on distinct occasions over the relevant period. The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Extend time within which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence up to and including the date on which such application was filed.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	The sentences imposed in the District Court on 27 September 2013 are quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof the following sentences are imposed:
	



	
	Count 2 – a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 7 August 2014 and expiring 6 August 2017 and a balance term of 1 year 6 months expiring 6 February 2019.
	
	
	Count 4 – a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 7 November 2014 and expiring 6 November 2016 and a balance term of 1 year commencing 7 November 2016 and expiring 6 November 2017.
	
	
	Count 5 – a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 7 February 2015 and expiring 6 February 2017 and a balance term of 1 year commencing 7 February 2017 and expiring 6 February 2018.
	
	
	Count 7 – a non-parole period of 7 years 8 months commencing 7 May 2015 and expiring 6 January 2023 and a balance term of 3 years 4 months commencing 7 January 2023 and expiring at 6 May 2026.
	



	
	The Appellant will be eligible to be released to supervised parole at the expiration of the non-parole period fixed for Count 7.
	



	
	This represents a total non-parole period of 8 years and 5 months from 7 August 2014 to 6 January 2023 and a total balance term of 3 years and 4 months from 7 January 2023 to 6 May 2026.

2767534,Lokmeh v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 172,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff and defendants each seek orders in relation to the defence and cross-claim filed by the defendants to these proceedings.
	
	
	The plaintiff has commenced proceedings for defamation arising from a radio broadcast published on 3 November 2014, the contents of which are set out in annexure A below. The defendants filed a defence on 1 June 2015. The third defendant filed a Statement of Cross-Claim against the plaintiff on 2 July 2015.
	


The issues before the court


	
	The issues for determination are:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s objections to the proposed amended defence, and specifically in relation to the proposed contextual truth defence;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application to strike out the common law qualified privilege defence;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s complaint about the particularisation of the statutory qualified privilege and justification defences; and
	
	
	The plaintiff’s objections to the capacity of the imputation pleaded as arising in the Statement of Cross-Claim against him.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s complaint about the particularisation of the statutory qualified privilege and justification defences raise issues which the parties can deal with by correspondence, and I have accordingly not made any rulings on such issues.
	


The pleadings


	
	The following imputations are pleaded to arise from the matter complained of:
	



	
	The plaintiff paid to have the third defendant murdered (the matter complained of as a whole and in particular lines 60-62).
	
	
	The plaintiff paid money to a lawyer in an attempt to have the third defendant imprisoned (the matter complained of as a whole and in particular lines 60-62).
	
	
	The plaintiff extorted thousands of dollars from the third defendant to withdraw criminal charges (the matter complained of as a whole and in particular lines 68-74 and 220-228).
	



	
	The defendants filed a Defence on 1 June 2015. The defendants propose to rely at trial on defences of justification (s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)), contextual truth (s 26), statutory qualified privilege (s 30) and a “reply to attack” qualified privilege defence at common law.
	
	
	The contextual imputations pleaded are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff wanted the third defendant to be killed.
	
	
	The plaintiff conducted himself in such a way to cause the third defendant to fear for her life.
	
	
	Alternatively to (ii): The plaintiff caused the third defendant to fear for her life.
	
	
	The plaintiff acted dishonestly by registering his marriage with the third defendant in Lebanon when he knew that the third defendant had filed for a divorce.
	



	
	On 2 July 2015, the third defendant filed a cross-claim against the plaintiff. This cross-claim alleges the plaintiff posted the following comment on a Facebook page:
	


“[Plaintiff’s Facebook Profile Picture] Bassem Aboulokmeh added 2 new photos.

8 July 2014 . Bankstown .

Is it halal for a married women [sic] to get remarried while she is still married, share please

[Two photographs of a man and a woman]”


	
	The following imputation is pleaded to arise from this Facebook posting:
	



	
	The cross-claimant committed bigamy (the whole of the matter complained of).
	


The plaintiff’s objection to the contextual truth defence


	
	The plaintiff submits that the defence of contextual truth pleaded in paragraph 8(b) of the proposed defence should be struck out because:
	



	
	Contextual imputation (i) is incapable of being conveyed “in addition to” (s 26) the plaintiff’s imputation (a);
	
	
	Contextual imputations (ii) and (iii) are objected to on the same basis, but additionally (and somewhat inconsistently) on the basis that they are incapable of being conveyed;
	
	
	Contextual imputation (iv) is asserted to be incapable of “swamping” the plaintiff’s imputations.
	


Contextual imputation (i)


	
	The plaintiff submits that no imputation of killing, other than in lines 62 and 63 of the matter complained of, where the third defendant says that the plaintiff “allegedly” paid his lawyer $USD 20,000 “to either put me in jail or have me killed” is conveyed; the second defendant (Mr Hadley) responds by saying this is “a pretty serious accusation” in that it is “accusing someone of murder”. The plaintiff argues that contextual imputation (i) is not therefore reasonably capable of being found by a jury to be an imputation “in addition to” the plaintiff’s imputation, in that it is essentially the same claim.
	
	
	Mrs Barnett, for the defendants, submits that the plaintiff’s imputation (a) relates to a specific act, namely the plaintiff “allegedly” giving his lawyer a large amount of money with orders either to have the third defendant put in jail or killed, whereas the first contextual imputation is one of condition, and relates more generally to the plaintiff’s state of mind (and, in particular, his animus towards the third defendant). She points out that none of the plaintiff’s imputations deal with the plaintiff’s state of mind at all, although the whole thrust of the matter complained of is the plaintiff’s jealousy-fuelled quest for vengeance against the plaintiff. That quest for vengeance leads him to engage in a series of acts designed to harm or imprison the third defendant, only one of which is to pay his lawyer to have her killed.
	
	
	The problem that I have with this submission is that contextual imputation (i) is very specific – it refers to the plaintiff wanting to have her killed, rather than to his having a revengeful state of mind, in that he would stop at nothing, including having her killed, or an imputation of similar effect. In its present form, contextual imputation (i) comes perilously close to being a restatement of the plaintiff’s imputation (a). Is it capable of being “in addition to” it?
	
	
	The imputation in its current form is perilously close to the plaintiff’s imputation (a); what saves it, in my view, is that, whether the jury finds the plaintiff’s imputation (a) true or not, it is still open to a jury to find that the plaintiff wanted the plaintiff dead or would stop at nothing to achieve this, whether he acted on that wish or not. In those circumstances, contextual imputation (i) is an imputation “in addition to” the plaintiff’s imputation.
	
	
	I additionally note that Mrs Barnett submits that it is inappropriate to strike out contextual imputations at all, in advance of the trial, and specifically refers to s 26 requiring that the two imputations be carried together and that the plaintiff’s imputations be “defamatory”. An imputation cannot be “defamatory” if it is found by a jury to be substantially true: McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2012] NSWSC 224 at [76] – [77]; Born Brands Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 369 at [80] – [88]; cf Mizikovsky v Queensland Television Ltd [2014] 1 Qd R 197 at [19], which Mrs Barnett submits does not consider the “process of attrition” involved in the weighing up of the contextual imputations. Mrs Barnett submits that the cases favouring the “process of attrition” are correctly decided and that I should follow that line of reasoning, and not Mizikovsky.
	
	
	Mrs Barnett submits that to strike out any of the contextual imputations assumes that the jury will find that imputation (a) is conveyed, which is an assumption that cannot be made: McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) [2012] NSWSC 196 at [22]. While I agree that this is correct, that is not to say that a contextual imputation can never be struck out; the point is that there will be cases where it is inappropriate to strike out an imputation at an interlocutory stage on such a basis: Jones v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 1453 at [7]; Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 1601 at [57]. For the reasons I have set out above, I am satisfied that it would be inappropriate to do so now.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s objections to this contextual imputation (i) therefore fail. Although it is not strictly necessary to do so, in that capacity was not the basis for objection, I formally note that this imputation will go to the jury.
	


Contextual imputations (ii) and (iii)


	
	These imputations are pleaded as alternatives to each other. I note that no challenge was made to this method of pleading (as to the availability of which, see Zeccola v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 227).
	
	
	Mr Dibb submits that neither of these imputations can arise apart from the reference (covered by imputation (a)) to the allegation that the plaintiff paid his lawyer to have her put in jail or killed. Otherwise, he submits, “the matter says nothing about the third defendant being killed or fearing for her life” (written submissions, paragraph 3). If the matter complained of did so, any such imputation could not be conveyed “in addition to” the plaintiff’s imputations.
	
	
	Mrs Barnett responded to this by playing the matter complained of in court, to indicate her clients’ reliance upon the fear in the voice of the third defendant. She drew my attention to the third defendant’s tone of voice generally, and to occasions when her voice is heard to quiver (for example, at paragraph 40). Additionally, she identified specific phrases, such as the plaintiff saying that she could have been one of many women that are still trapped overseas: “I would have been one of them Ray”, followed by “I would have been another number”. She submits that the ordinary reasonable listener would hear fear in the third defendant’s voice.
	
	
	The tone of voice of a person can be an important factor in determining meaning, particularly in radio broadcasts: Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [197]; Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1928 at [56]; see also, in relation to a racial vilification claim, Ekermawi v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd, Ekermawi v Nine Network Television Pty Ltd [2010] NSWADT 145 at [67] – [68] (coincidentally, the broadcaster in all those proceedings was also Mr Hadley).
	
	
	Additionally, the subject matter should be taken into account. The third defendant paints a picture of the plaintiff as a man who will stop at nothing in his reprisals against her, and where the dangers she was thereby exposed to made her fear for her life.
	
	
	The combined effect of the language, subject matter and tone of voice of the third defendant are sufficient, on a capacity basis, for either of these contextual imputations to be conveyed, and they will go to the jury.
	


Contextual imputation (iv)


	
	The capacity of the matter complained of to convey this contextual imputation is not challenged; the issue is what may generally be described as its “seriousness”. Mr Dibb submits that an imputation of dishonestly registering his marriage in Lebanon when he knew that the third defendant (his wife) had filed for divorce is “self-evidently” (written submissions, paragraph 4) much less serious than imputations of attempts to murder her, to keep her effectively a prisoner in Lebanon, or to extort money from her. He submits that “the principle of proportionality (written submissions, paragraph 4) as well as the overriding obligations pursuant to s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) require the court to ensure that proceedings are conducted with a view to determining the real issues in a “just, cheap and quick” fashion, and that on this basis I should refuse to permit the contextual imputation to stand.
	
	
	In the course of listening to the matter complained of during the hearing, a missing word of some importance (“abuse”) emerged. The third defendant (at 164), asserting that women have rights even though, “in the Muslim world”, it is a man’s world, goes on to say: “OK, um, but for them, they twist, turn and abuse the law as to [sic] they see fit”. This reference to “abuse” is relevant to the sting in this contextual imputation is that the plaintiff has dishonestly performed an act of abuse of the legal process, in that he had his marriage registered in Lebanon even though he knew his marriage was over, and that his wife had filed for divorce. The parties have agreed to insert this word into the transcript.
	
	
	Knowingly twisting, turning and abusing the legal process is conduct squarely placed at the feet of the plaintiff by this contextual imputation. Abuse of the process of any court is conduct which ordinary right-thinking members of the community may view very seriously. Independently of any examination of the particulars in support (this being the step Mr Dibb requested me to take), I am satisfied that the question of whether such an imputation is capable of “swamping” (to use Mr Dibb’s word) the plaintiff’s imputations, in accordance with the principles explained in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541, is a matter which should be left to the jury.
	
	
	This finding means that it is unnecessary for me to determine the two bases put forward by Mr Dibb to support his argument, namely that the particulars of justification support such a finding, and his proportionality argument. I should note that I would not have accepted either of these arguments in any event. First, for the reasons explained by Hodgson JA in Hayson v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 376 at [20], the strength of a defence generally cannot be assessed by reference to the contents of particulars in an interlocutory application (see also Zeccola v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 227 at [19]). Second, there is currently no appellate support for the concept of proportionality in relation to particulars of justification (or indeed in any area of the law, beyond legal costs issues).
	
	
	Courts have, on occasion, restricted pleas of justification on the basis that they “could turn into a major inquiry into the harm…lasting for several months (Cruise and Another v Express Newspapers plc & Another [1999] QB 931 at 945), or distract the court with matters of peripheral relevance (Tancic v. Times Newspaper Ltd., [1999] E.W.J. No. 6510 at [18]). However, that is not the case here. The particulars relate to the relationship between the plaintiff and third defendant, and deal with issues likely to arise in relation to the factual matrix for the plaintiff’s own imputations.
	
	
	Accordingly, I decline to strike out contextual imputation (iv).
	


The defence of qualified privilege at common law


	
	The proposed amended defence raises, at paragraph 8(d), a defence of common law qualified privilege, on the basis of reply to an attack. The terms of the matter complained of could not be clearer; the third defendant is answering the claims made by her brother about her on the same radio station some days earlier.
	
	
	Mr Dibb submits, however, that this defence cannot be maintained because it is not the plaintiff who mounted the attack, but the third defendant’s brother. He submits that, while Dixon J, in Loveday v Sun Newspapers (1938) 59 CLR 503 noted that the privilege would apply to third parties, citing Coward v Wellington [1837] E R 58; 7 Car & P 59, these were obiter remarks in a dissenting judgment, and the facts and issues in Coward v Wellington did not support such a contention. In David McNicol v the ACT Health Authority [1988] ACTSC 55 Kelly J restricted the ratio in Coward v Wellington to being authority for the proposition that a person attacked may defend himself by showing that the blame is properly attributable to some other person. If this is correct, Mr Dibb submits, then this decision is, at most, authority for the proposition that where a reply to an attack defames a third party (rather than the person making the attack) is it privileged only insofar as it seeks to throw on that third party some blame that the original attack sought to be laid upon the third defendant. This would restrict the third defendant’s reply to something like “it wasn’t me who deserted my children, it was my husband”, according to Mr Dibb, which falls well short of the imputations pleaded here.
	
	
	This is not how the statements of Dixon J in Loveday v Sun Newspapers has been approached by courts in New South Wales: see, for example, Palmer v Belan [1999] NSWSC 187 at [151]; Trad v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (2011) 279 ALR 183 at [108] (defendant could reply not only on behalf of his principal but also another reporter). The question is, as Kirby J pointed out at [151] and the Court of Appeal pointed out at [111] – [113] respectively, whether the responding remarks are “not wholly unconnected with the defence” and not “mere retaliation”.
	
	
	Mr Dibb’s submission in fact tacitly acknowledges that the responding party may make a reply to attack which defames a third party; his real submission appears to be that the third defendant went too far. That is an issue for the trial, where the parties can refer to the earlier radio broadcast to which the third defendant was replying (which I was not given) and such other relevant evidence as may be before the court. I do not propose to analyse the matter complained of to determine (as the Court of Appeal did in Trad v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd) whether the reply to attack is capable of applying to each of the imputations, not least because this step was not taken in the application before me.
	
	
	Additionally, the circumstances in which a defence, especially a defence of qualified privilege, will be struck out on an interlocutory application would have to be extreme: Waterhouse v Perkins [2000] NSWSC 641 at [18] – [19]; Sutherland v ACP Publishing Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1139 (refusal to strike out defence of triviality for a mass media publication); Combe v Santamaria (1986) 84 FLR 292. This is not one of those occasions.
	
	
	The application to strike out the defence of qualified privilege at common law is refused.
	


The Statement of Cross Claim


	
	The third defendant, as cross-claimant, brings proceedings for defamation arising from a publication on the cross-defendant’s Facebook page. This Facebook posting consists of two photographs clearly of the same woman (although in each photograph she is shown sitting very closely to a different man) followed by the words:
	
	
	“Is it halal for a married woman to get remarried while she is still married. Share please.”
	
	
	The cross-claimant pleads that this gives rise to the imputation that the plaintiff committed bigamy.
	
	
	The plaintiff/cross-defendant challenges the imputation on the basis that it is not capable of being conveyed. The relevant principles for determination of capacity issues were agreed by the parties to be as set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227.
	
	
	Mr Dibb’s submitted that the word “halal” was wrong and/or incomprehensible unless pleaded with a true innuendo. The ordinary reasonable reader would, however, have no trouble understanding the sting of the libel since both photographs show the plaintiff apparently cuddling up to two different men, and the matter complained of refers to a woman getting remarried “while she is still married”. The reference to “halal” is surplusage.
	
	
	Nor does the use of a form of questioning deprive the publication of its defamatory meaning, for the reasons explained in so many judgments applying Jones v Skelton (1963) SR (NSW) 644 (where the question “Or is it?” formed part of the matter complained of).
	
	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff has asked me to strike out the defences of contextual truth and qualified privilege at common law, along with the particulars, and to strike out the sole imputation pleaded in the Statement of Cross Claim (and, thereby, the Cross Claim itself). The plaintiff has been wholly unsuccessful in this regard and should accordingly pay the costs of this application.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s complaints about particulars of the s 25 and s 30 defences are matters recently raised and can be dealt with by correspondence. The plaintiff’s complaints of “empty rhetoric” (written submissions, paragraph 25) are in any event too general to permit specific rulings.
	
	
	The parties should bring in Short Minutes of Order for a timetable for the completion of pleadings in the claim and cross-claim. As soon as the parties can agree upon such orders, which should include discovery and interrogatories, they can consider the issue of mediation.
	
	
	To further the issue of mediation, I propose to require the parties’ legal representatives to serve on their clients notices pursuant to r 42.32 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). This rule provides:
	


“42.32 Smyth orders

At any stage of proceedings, the court may order a party’s legal representative to serve on the party:

(a) a notice that specifies:

(i) an estimate of the largest amount (inclusive of costs) for which judgment is likely to be given if the party is successful, and

(ii) an estimate of the largest amount (by way of costs) that the party may be ordered to pay if the party is unsuccessful, or

(b) a notice that specifies:

(i) an estimate of the best outcome that the party is likely to achieve if the party is successful, and

(ii) an estimate of the worst outcome that the party is likely to undergo if the party is unsuccessful.”


	
	This will be a lengthy jury trial. It is unlikely that the court can list this matter for hearing prior to mid-2016. The parties should take that into account when considering issues such as mediation.

Annexure A


	
	RAY HADLEY: Mahassen G’day.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Hello Ray, good morning.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Good morning Mahassen
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: How are you?
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: I’m well thank you, Mahassen.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: It’s good to be home.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Now I’m told you’re the young lady that we had spoken about previously, when I received a phone call from your brother.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You’re the young lady who was, I believe, detained in Lebanon. Is that correct?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: By a stop order placed by my ex-husband.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok. Ok now look, I have no interest in your private life. That’s a matter for you and your former husband and your new partner. I have no interest in that. But the story back here, and you may not be aware of all the details, because you were over there. Umm, portrayed by your brother that you parted company with your former husband
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Hmm-mm.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You travelled to Lebanon,
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And got married to your new partner.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: While still married to your former husband.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Hmm-mm. But that’s not true.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, well you tell me
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: We were separated and I had filed for divorce.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Right.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep, and um that’s when I had left.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, so you’re separated and filed for divorce. But did you get married to your new partner in Lebanon in some circumstance?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No, we had a commitment ceremony.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: A commitment ceremony, ok.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Who officiated at that? I’m not being… I’m just trying to get to the truth. I’m not being a sticky beak. But who officiated the commitment ceremony?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: There was no officiation with the commitment ceremony, it was just done me and him.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, you committed to each other.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, your former husband then reported to authorities in Lebanon that you had done something wrong. Is that what happened?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No, a Sydney Sheikh wrote a false statement to help my ex-husband.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: To place a stop order on my Australian passport.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And what did the Sheikh write to the authorities in Lebanon?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: The Sheikh wrote that, um, we weren’t separated and I had not filed for divorce, we were just in reconciliation.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, and you maintain that was not true?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No, definitely not because he was well aware of my situation and um, between, he was like a mediator between the two. He was asking me before I had left, you know, is there any chance of reconciliation. I said no, I filed for divorce and he was given the appropriate documentation and he still went ahead and wrote this false statement. Um, 30th of June.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: So the statement was,
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: 10 days and I was in Lebanon.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: So the statement arrives in Lebanon, and so, under what authority do the police or the other authorities detain you in Lebanon? How do they do that?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: What had happened was the Sydney Sheikh, um, wrote this statement and gave it to my ex-husband and he registered the marriage through the Lebanese consulate in Sydney.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmm-mm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And that’s how the authorities were alerted. And he also hired a Lebanese lawyer,
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Right
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And allegedly paid him $20,000 American to either put me in jail or have me killed.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, well that’s a pretty serious accusation in relation to accusing someone of murder. So we better leave that to the authorities to investigate without making any accusations. Otherwise I’ll get myself in strife and probably so will you. So, um, how did you actually get back from Lebanon then? Because I know you’ve been on Channel 7 on their Sunday program recently, how did you actually come back?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I had to pay Bassem almost $18,000 Australian.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You had to pay whom?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Ex-husband.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You had to give him money?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes. To drop the charges.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Oh, I see.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And the police have not even investigated that.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Do you mean the police here or the police there?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No, police here.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, so how did you get the money to him then?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: It was from borrowed from my uncle and my mum.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, so one of the really sad things about this, and I got a lot of phone calls after your brother phoned me.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Hmm-mm.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And I have no need to cause you distress, but in every family structure Mahassen…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: We all have blues and fights and stinks. I mean it’s part of being part of a family.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And when things break down, and I said to your brother surely there’s, you know, no matter what the circumstances, this is your sister you’re talking about.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: That’s right.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You mentioned your mum then. Have you been reconciled with your family since arriving back in Australia?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I have reconciled with my mother, however I have chosen not to reconcile with the rest of the family.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Do they wish to reconcile with you?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Um, I don’t know. I honestly don’t know.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: How old are you love?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Sorry?
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: How old are you?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I’m 30.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, you got a long way to go.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: It’s a long time not to talk to your siblings.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes, and um, just as long as my children are home with me, that was my main concern.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Do you have the children with you?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: That was the other thing people didn’t understand, so I’ll give you a chance to explain yourself, um. That you had, and this is not my allegation, their allegation, that you deserted your children and travelled with your boyfriend to Lebanon.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: That is completely not true.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, so tell me what happened?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I would never have abandoned my children. I’m a primary school teacher of 10 years so I would never abandon my children. It was an actual initial agreement between me and the ex-husband, and he wanted me to go, believe it or not, I’m thinking why was he being so, you know…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: So it was a holiday, was it?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yeah, and cause I said I was going to go for two weeks, I didn’t tell him where…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmmm
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And he was fine, it was very lucky that I did not take my children because the father maintains custody of the children and then my children would have been, uh, banned from leaving Lebanon and they would have to stay there.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: So, as in the case with many of these unfortunate scenarios, you’d said I’m going to have a holiday for a couple of weeks…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yeah
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And uh, I guess he has some custody of the children so he said I’ll take the children while you’re away. Is that what…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Transpired?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes, that’s exactly what transpired.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Do you have a shared parenting arrangement with him now, do the kids see both of you?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: The children do see both of us, but I have retained full custody of the children because I was the primary caregiver since the day they were born.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Sure, I understand that.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: As their mother, and um, and the father just decided to remain, uh, that he, that I abandoned them, he just kept saying that I abandoned them and I didn’t. There was an agreement I was only coming for two weeks, it’s not as thought I was leaving for a year or two, it was like two weeks and I’ll be back.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And then when I tried to leave, um, that’s when the travel ban was raised on my Australian passport and which, um, the authorities found very, very strange.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Because they said, you’re an Australian, you’ve come here on an Australian passport. How could that happen?
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And I said, I know, I go well what’s happening. I was just totally lost for words, thinking what is going on and then that’s when, you know, the trouble all started.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: I guess, the warning here from the Lebanese Muslim Association is that women like you need to ensure they have an Islamic divorce before they travel to Lebanon.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: The Islamic divorce, um, the Islamic divorce was handed down…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Right.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: However, it’s the matter of denial in regards to them cause they don’t give you the appropriate paperwork. The sheikhs, it’s up to them at the end of the day…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: To give you the paperwork that says you are divorced under Islamic law?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yeah, but they can chop and change whatever they want as they please. Because I’m not the first one, Ray, and I’m not the last one.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: It turns out this is rampant in our community at the moment, where the ex-husbands are forcing their women to stay, Australian women, by the way, Australians and their children, and keeping them entrapped in Lebanon for blackmail. And sheikhs know about it and they’ve kept a lid on it for this long.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Well what they’ve said here, and this is obviously what you’re saying. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that other Australians, including mothers and children, are stopped from leaving Lebanon by Stop-Orders. Under Lebanese law, Lebanese nationals and non-nationals, may prevent family members from leaving Lebanon even if they are Australian citizens.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: That’s right. That’s right.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And the Australian government can’t prevent or overturn these stop orders.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Or issues on Australian citizens. So, as you say, you’re very lucky you didn’t have your children there.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: That’s right. If I had my children there, he would have retained, the children would have had to stay over there.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Hmmm.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And I could have, I never would have returned because I would not leave without my children.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Sure.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: And um,
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Anyway, let’s try and be positive about it. You have your children with you now, um…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: You’re talking to your mum, which is good.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: It’s a decision for you whether you talk to your siblings and other members of your family, but you’re only a young woman and obviously there’s a lot of things to go and it’s important for the children to have contact with…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Of course
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: All those members of your family because they’re positive influences even if they’ve had a disagreement with you.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yes, that’s right.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Now the children do see their aunties and uncles…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Oh, that’s good.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: But I’m not involved or affiliated with them at this present time.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Ok, you’re still a bit angry obviously?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: It’s not anger, it’s just I think the trauma from it all. And I think, Ray, um, if you, you’d probably understand and you know if anyone was down, you don’t kick a person when their down. Especially when they’re your flesh and blood.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: No, I understand that. Look, as I said I have no great understanding of the matters until I spoke to your brother, I have a greater understanding having spoken to you. But I did say to your brother, who seemed like a reasonable person and very respectful to me, I said this is your sister you’re talking about. You know, and uh, and I’ve had plenty of blues with members of my family and I’ll probably be the last one to lecture.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Well, we all have. We’re all families and everyone’s going to have a good [indistinct]. That’s understandable, they’re family constructs and that’s what happens. There’s breakdowns, there’s happy times, it just happens. But the thing is, you know, you’re talking to national as to, you know, putting such a violent, you know, slur on me and on your own sister. That was very traumatising.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Well I must admit, I was a bit taken aback by his fervour. But in the end I asked him to resile from that and he did concede some points.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yep.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: And I’m sure that he was quite emotional and disturbed by what he thought was happening.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: He, the thing is they didn’t, there’s, look Ray all I just want to say is that nobody knows what happens in your home.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: No, I understand.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Between your wife, your partner, whoever.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: No, I understand that.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: No-one knows what happens and I did not want, um, my family did not want the divorce to begin with.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: No, that’s what he said to me. He didn’t want it, but at the end of the day…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: But it’s not up to them.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: No, and thank you for making that point. You’re a 30 year old woman who’s quite capable of making her own decisions and I respect that as well. And I really appreciate the fact that you’ve jumped on the phone to talk to us today, to give us the other side of the story and I wish you the best in the future. Ok?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Thank you very much Ray. And I just want to make sure that also there was one more thing in regards to the extortion that was done by my ex-husband.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Well, do me a favour will you, just drop off the extortion. Cause if you’re gonna sue someone he’ll sue me, not you. So…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Nah, I’m…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Or call it alleged extortion.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Yeah, the alleged extortion.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Yeah, go on.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Where I had to pay my ex-husband $15,000 in order for him to drop the charges. Now, um, all I’m just trying to say is that the ex-husbands are getting help from these Muslim clerics and these Sheikhs where they’re in a position of power. You know, under the Australian law. Where he dismissed and disregarded my application for divorce, which meant nothing…
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Yeah
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Absolutely nothing. And by him writing a statement on his own accord and sending that off to the authorities, and also when Zali Burrows, my lawyer, she came and helped me and she was trying to get me through the legal system. This Sheikh as well, [indistinct] from the mosque in Lakemba, he even went out of his way and called the head Sharia judge that was taking my trial. And reconfirmed, and he even knew how volatile my situation was.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Sure. Well let me say this in relation to the treatment of some women, not all women, in the Muslim faith. There’s a lot to be learned about the way women are…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: It’s a man’s world. That’s all it is.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Well unfortunately, I think it may well be in that particular…
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Even so, we have our rights. We have our rights, and it doesn’t just stop in religion, as women we have our rights. Ok, um, but for them, they twist, turn the law as to they see fit.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Well, you’re a strong young woman and obviously you’ve got the message out there, and I’m sure that there will be other young women who take the lead from you to a certain extent.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I hopefully want to, um, set up a network to help these women that are still trapped overseas. And hopefully I can reach out, because I would have been one of them Ray.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Alright then.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: I would have been another number.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Mahassen, if we can help in any way, we don’t want women getting treated in the manner in which you described and if we can help we will, ok?
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Thank you so much Ray.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Thank you for your time.
	
	
	MAHASSEN ISSA: Thank you, you take care.
	
	
	RAY HADLEY: Mahassen Issa, the young lady we spoke about and not to, we spoke to her brother when she was trapped in Lebanon. She’s now back in Australia thankfully.

		19 August 2015",2015-08-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767537,Moses v R [2015] NSWCCA 218,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed upon him by the Drug Court of New South Wales on 25 September 2014. This was a “final sentence” pursuant to s 12 of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW) in respect of nine offences. They included four counts involving breaking and entering dwelling houses (ss 112(1)(a), 112(2) and 113, Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), one count of possession of a prohibited drug and two counts of supply (ss 10(1) and 25(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)).
	
	
	Most of the offences were committed between June 2012 and February 2013 but the last two (supply prohibited drug) occurred on 29 April 2014. The Drug Court has jurisdiction to sentence offenders for both summary and indictable offences, as occurred here. All counts except the aggravated break and enter (s 112(2), Crimes Act) were either summary offences or indictable offences being dealt with summarily.
	
	
	Section 5AF(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) confers upon a person sentenced by the Drug Court the same right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal as would be available under s 5AA to a person convicted by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. Leave to appeal is required: s 5AA(1A).
	
	
	Section 5AF(3)(a) directs that the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine a sentence appeal from the Drug Court concerning an indictable offence is to be exercised by two or three judges as directed by the Chief Justice. Where a sentence for a summary offence is under appeal from the Drug Court, par (b) of subs (3) applies:
	


“(3) The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine an appeal under this section is to be exercised:

(a) …

(b) in relation to an appeal against a sentence for a summary offence—by such single judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct unless the judge, on the application of either party or of his or her own motion, considers that the appeal raises matters of principle or it is otherwise in the interests of justice for the appeal to be dealt with by the full Court of Criminal Appeal and notifies the Chief Justice accordingly, in which case the appeal is to be heard and determined by such 3 or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.”


	
	The Chief Justice has directed that I should exercise the Court of Criminal Appeal’s power so far as this application concerns the sentence passed by the Drug Court for summary offences. I consider that it is in the interests of justice for the appeal to be dealt with by three judges because it arises out of an aggregate sentence which was passed for summary offences together with indictable offences (one of them being dealt with on indictment, the others summarily). It would not be practical to determine whether any sentencing error occurred in respect of the summary offences separately from the same question in respect of the indictable offences. Pursuant to s 5AF(3)(b) I have, accordingly, notified the Chief Justice who has directed that the appeal so far as it concerns summary offences be heard and determined by the bench constituted to deal with the indictable offences.
	
	
	The Applicant was assessed as eligible for the Drug Court Program on 11 April 2013. He first came before the Drug Court on 9 May 2013. The offences dealt with that day by way of “initial sentence” under s 7A, Drug Court Act and the individual sentences which Judge Dive indicated (pursuant to s 53A(2)(b), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) were as follows. All of the matters were able to be dealt with summarily:
	



	
	Count 1, break enter and steal on 19 June 2012, s 112(1)(a), Crimes Act. The Applicant had forced entry to an unoccupied home in Kensington, disturbed the contents of a number of rooms and removed, inter alia, an Apple MacBook. The maximum penalty on summary prosecution was 2 years: s 267, Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Indicated sentence: 15 months.
	
	
	Count 2, possess prohibited drug, s 10(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 22 December 2012. The Applicant was observed on Anzac Parade under the influence of an intoxicant. He was in possession of 0.26g of heroin. The maximum penalty was 2 years. Judge Dive indicated 2 months.
	
	
	Count 3, break and enter with intent to steal on 8 February 2013, s 113(1), Crimes Act. The Applicant was observed attempting to gain entry to an unoccupied unit in Kensington. Indicated sentence: 10 months.
	
	
	Count 4 was withdrawn.
	
	
	Count 5 was dealt with under s 10A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act without imposition of penalty.
	
	
	Count 6, break enter and steal on 20 February 2013, s 112(1)(a), Crimes Act. The Applicant forced entry to an unoccupied freestanding house and took a large number of items with an estimated value of $3,000. His Honour indicated 18 months.
	
	
	Count 7, drive whilst disqualified on 22 March 2011, s 25A(1)(a), Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW). This offence had originally been dealt with on 30 March 2011 at Waverley Local Court, with the Applicant entering into a good behaviour bond for 2 years. The maximum penalty was 18 months imprisonment. His Honour indicated 3 months.
	
	
	Count 8, break enter and steal on 15 June 2012, s 112(1)(a), Crimes Act 1900. The Applicant forced entry to a home in Kensington and removed some items. On 27 September 2012 this offence had been dealt with by the District Court at Sydney by way of a 12 month suspended sentence and bond. Judge Dive indicated that if this matter were to be dealt with alone, the bond would be revoked and the 12 month sentence would have to be served.
	



	
	Pursuant to s 53A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act his Honour fixed an aggregate sentence of 2 years for all of these offences, exercising jurisdiction under subs (3) of s 7A, Drug Court Act. It was not necessary to fix a non-parole period: see subs (4) of s 7A. In accordance with subs (5) his Honour suspended execution of the aggregate sentence for the duration of the Applicant’s participation in the Drug Court Program. This Program included prescription of methadone and a requirement that he undergo a supervised urine drug test three times per week.
	
	
	On 17 February 2013 the Applicant had committed an indictable offence, which became Count 9. He broke into a house at Mascot. Two residents of the house were in a bedroom upstairs at the time. When the owner of the house, who occupied the downstairs level, returned to the property the next day considerable disturbance of possessions was apparent, a syringe was found on the floor in a bedroom and there were spots of blood on a bed and in various locations throughout the house. These were subsequently shown to be of a similar DNA profile to that of the Applicant. The Applicant was the former boyfriend of the property owner’s daughter. He had been to the premises on past occasions but the owner had never permitted him to enter. During the Applicant’s intrusion into the house there had been no confrontation with the occupants as they remained in their bedroom upstairs.
	
	
	The Applicant pleaded guilty to this charge and it was brought before Judge Corbett in the Drug Court on 8 August 2013. As the offence had been committed prior to the first “initial sentence” proceeding before Judge Dive (see [8] above), it is not clear why the charge had not reached the Drug Court and been dealt with on that occasion. Judge Corbett found the circumstances of the offence of 17 February 2013 as summarised above. Her Honour accepted that the offence had not been planned and that the Applicant had been “under the influence of some form of substance” at the time.
	
	
	In passing a further “initial sentence” under subss (8) and (9) of s 7A of the Drug Court Act Judge Corbett took into account the Applicant’s long criminal history. He was at the time 38 years of age. Commencing in 1999 he had been convicted over about four years of a number of drug matters, goods in custody and an offence of aggravated break and enter. For the latter he was sentenced in February 2004 to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year. Between 2005 and December 2011 he had been convicted of larceny, possession of housebreaking instruments, break and enter, goods in custody and shoplifting. He had been sentenced to and had served a number of prison terms in the order of 4 to 12 months.
	
	
	Taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence and the Applicant’s subjective circumstances Judge Corbett imposed a substitute “initial sentence” in respect of all of the offences which had first been dealt with by Judge Dive on 9 May 2013, together with the additional count of aggravated break and enter on 17 February 2013. Her Honour fixed a new aggregate term of imprisonment under s 53A(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of 4 years. As before, it was not necessary that a non-parole period be fixed. The sentence was wholly suspended under s 7A(5)(b) of the Drug Court Act for the duration of the Applicant’s continued participation in the Drug Court Program.
	
	
	On 29 April 2014 the Applicant committed two further offences, contrary to s 25(1), Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Namely, he supplied 0.13g heroin and 0.11g cocaine to a single individual. The Applicant was taken into custody on 29 April 2014. Bail was refused. He initially entered a plea of not guilty. The matter was to be dealt with in the Local Court. On the day it was listed for hearing, 21 July 2014, he changed his plea.
	
	
	The Applicant’s participation in the Drug Court Program was terminated on 24 July 2014 pursuant to s 10(1)(a) and s 11, Drug Court Act. Accordingly he came before Judge Corbett on 25 September 2014 for final sentence pursuant to s 12. Section 12 provides as follows:
	


“12 Imposition of final sentence

(1) On terminating a drug offender’s program, the Drug Court must reconsider the drug offender’s initial sentence.

(2) In reconsidering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court must take into consideration:

(a) the nature of the drug offender’s participation in his or her program, and

(b) any sanctions that have been imposed on the drug offender during the program, and

(c) any time for which the drug offender has been held in custody in connection with an offence to which his or her program relates, including time during which the person has undergone imprisonment:

(i) under the sentence, or

(ii) under the condition of the program arising under section 8A.

(3) After considering a drug offender’s initial sentence, the Drug Court is to determine the drug offender’s final sentence:

(a) by making an order setting aside the initial sentence and taking such action under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it could have taken for the offence to which the initial sentence related, or

(b) by making an order confirming the initial sentence.

(4) The final sentence determined for a drug offender in relation to an offence is not to be greater than the initial sentence imposed on the drug offender in relation to that offence.

(5) (Repealed).”


	
	In careful reasons dated 25 September 2014 Judge Corbett considered all of the matters to which she was required to give attention under subs (2) of s 12. The additional charges of supply of prohibited drugs were before the Drug Court pursuant to subs (8)(a) of s 7A. Her Honour determined to impose an aggregate sentence for the two new offences together with the seven others previously considered. For that purpose her Honour took into account the objective facts of the two most recent offences (referred to as Counts 10 and 11), the history of the Applicant’s pleas in relation to them (which resulted in the allowance of a 10% discount) and the detailed facts of the most serious offence before the Court, the indictable matter of aggravated break and enter on 17 February 2013 (referred to as Count 9). With respect to the latter her Honour updated the facts by noting that the Applicant had made a written apology to the owner of the premises and had reimbursed the cost of cleaning. This was confirmed by letter from one of the occupants, the Applicant’s former girlfriend, who was apparently supportive of him as her Honour noted.
	
	
	Her Honour also took into account the Applicant’s long criminal history, the course of his participation in the Drug Court Program, a report from a psychologist tendered on his behalf, details of his health and history of drug use and submissions made on his behalf by his legal representative. Judge Corbett found special circumstances which justified adjustment of the relationship between the non-parole period and balance term. The indicative sentences nominated by her Honour pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) were as initially stated by Judge Dive on 9 May 2013 in relation to Counts 1-3 and 6-8 (see [8] above); 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months for Count 9 and 5 months for each of Counts 10 and 11. Her Honour fixed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A comprising a total term of 4 years and 2 months and a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months.
	
	
	For the purposes of determining the date from which the sentence should run, at pp 8 and 9 of her reasons Judge Corbett added up a number of days of sanctions to which the Applicant had been subject in the course of the Drug Court Program, some days of pre-sentence custody and some further days upon which bail had been refused. Her Honour calculated the total of these at 220 days. This led her Honour to nominate “an agreed backdate to 17 February 2014”. In fact, there was an error in the addition. The total number of days should have been 231 and the backdate should have been to 6 February 2014.
	
	
	At p 11 of her reasons Judge Corbett determined that the commencement of the period of imprisonment should be backdated a further 5 months, apparently to allow for the period of the Applicant’s incarceration from the date of his arrest in relation to the two most recent supply offences to the date of the sentence hearing before her Honour. This period had not otherwise been counted in the calculation of 220 days which her Honour had previously made. The result was that the learned judge concluded the sentences were to run from 17 September 2013 (at p 11 of her Honour’s reasons).
	
	
	The error referred to in [18] above was subsequently corrected in Chambers and her Honour’s orders were entered using the correct date, such that the Applicant’s sentence dated from 6 September 2013.
	


Ground 1 – sentence excessive

Ground 4 – failure to consider a range of facts at final sentencing


	
	The Applicant’s written and oral submissions were prepared and presented by him in person. A degree of patience has been required in order to relate the Applicant’s arguments to his grounds. In support of Grounds 1 and 4 the Applicant has referred exclusively to the circumstances of Count 9, the aggravated break and enter charge concerning his intrusion into the home of his former girlfriend on 17 February 2013. He raises these matters:
	



	
	The learned sentencing judge did not take into account a letter written to the Court by the occupant confirming that he had made restitution. This is incorrect. The matter was expressly referred to in the sentencing remarks and taken into account.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty immediately. This was recognised and taken into account. In Judge Corbett’s remarks of 8 August 2013 concerning the further initial sentence, when her Honour first indicated an individual sentence for this matter of 3 years, a 25% discount for the early plea was accorded.
	
	
	“I also believe the sentencing judge did not take into account the fact I was familiar with the property also being the home of my partner daughter”. Contrary to the Applicant’s contention, the learned sentencing judge was well aware that the Applicant was known to the owner of the property and had been in a relationship with the owner’s daughter. This was referred to both in the remarks associated with the second initial sentence (8 August 2013) and again in the remarks on the final sentence.
	
	
	“I know for certain that I did not steal anything or damage anything on purpose and I was only there to find Briarne”. Her Honour did not find that anything had been stolen. There was evidence of damage to the property, including disturbance of possessions and the leaving of blood stains. Her Honour was entitled to act on this evidence, which does not appear to have been contested.
	



	
	Taking into account all of the objective circumstances of the offence to which the Applicant refers in his submission, his proposition that “the offence should [have] been treated more like a domestic disturbance than a planned criminal activity” was not something that her Honour was obliged to accept or give weight to. This was the most recent incident in a repetitious pattern of the Applicant forcing entry to homes in the Kensington/Mascot area. The circumstances of the instant offence were aggravated by the presence of two residents of the property sleeping in a bedroom upstairs at the time of the break in. Her Honour justifiably took into account the apprehension which this event must have caused to them, albeit that the incident did not result in a confrontation.
	
	
	The effect of the adjustment to the aggregate sentence which her Honour made to take into account this offence was the addition of 2 years. The non-parole period fixed on final sentence on 25 September 2014 was only 52% of the aggregate total period of imprisonment. Applying that proportion to the 2 years of additional head sentence which was the effective result for the aggravated break and enter on 17 February 2013, the extension of the non-parole period which may be attributed to this count is only 12 months and 2 weeks. Far from being excessive, that must be regarded as lenient treatment of an offender who has demonstrated persistent disregard of the property rights and domestic security of other citizens for over a decade.
	
	
	Apparently with reference to this ground the Applicant also complains that when his final sentence was determined there was a failure to take into account a psychological report, references, a letter from “the victim” and information regarding his participation in the Drug Court program. That is not so. All of these matters were before Judge Corbett on 25 September 2014 and they are referred to in her Honour’s remarks on final sentence.
	
	
	Lastly the Applicant asserts that s 12(4), Drug Court Act was infringed because his final sentence was greater than the initial sentence. But subs (4) only prohibits any increase in the sentence for a particular offence, from the initial stage to the final. That did not occur in relation to the Applicant.
	
	
	I would dismiss Grounds 1 and 4.
	


Ground 2 – accumulation of Local Court sentences


	
	Under this ground the Applicant has made reference to s 58(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which provides as follows:
	


“(1) The Local Court may not impose a new sentence of imprisonment to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with an existing sentence of imprisonment if the date on which the new sentence would end is more than 5 years after the date on which the existing sentence (or, if more than one, the first of them) began.”


	
	This section would not appear to have any application to the Drug Court: s 15(3), Drug Court Act. In any event the final sentence imposed by her Honour would not end more than 5 years after the date on which any existing sentence began. Ground 2 should be dismissed.
	


Ground 3 – accumulation of Local Court and District Court sentences


	
	There can be no valid objection to an aggregate sentence imposed for a combination of summary and indictable offences. That is precisely what the Drug Court Act permits in ss 7A and 12. Ground 3 should be dismissed.
	


Ground 5 – error in backdating the commencement of the sentence


	
	As mentioned in paragraphs [18]-[20] above, there was an error in her Honour’s initial calculation of the backdating, by 11 days, as appears from the remarks on sentence. The Court was informed by the Crown that a correction was made by her Honour in chambers. The Drug Court’s records and those pertaining to the custody of the Applicant should show that he has been sentenced to an aggregate sentence for Counts 1, 2, 3 and 6-11 (as particularised in the remarks on sentence of 9 May 2013, 8 August 2013 and 25 September 2015) of 4 years and 2 months commencing 6 September 2013 and expiring 5 November 2017. A non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months was fixed, commencing 6 September 2013 and expiring 5 November 2015, at the expiration of which the Applicant will be eligible for parole.
	
	
	The orders I would propose are as follows:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

		19 August 2015",2015-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767538,R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2015] NSWSC 1181,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The trial of these matters is scheduled to commence on Monday 24 August 2015, or two full working days from today. That date has been known for a considerable time.
	
	
	The proceedings were listed before me today on the application of Mr D K L Raphael of counsel for the accused Mr Seller. In essence, Mr Raphael seeks leave to withdraw from the proceedings as defence counsel for Mr Seller because Mr Seller has neither provided Mr Raphael with funds sufficient to cover his anticipated legal costs of appearing at the trial nor has he otherwise satisfied Mr Raphael that he will be able to do so.
	
	
	The application is made pursuant to rule 107 of the Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015. That rule is in these terms:
	


“107 A barrister must not return under rule 105 a brief to defend a charge of a serious criminal offence unless:

(a) the barrister believes on reasonable grounds that:

(i) the circumstances are exceptional and compelling; and

(ii) there is enough time for another legal practitioner to take over the case properly before the hearing: or

(b) the client has consented after the barrister has clearly informed the client of the circumstances in which the barrister wishes to return the brief and of the terms of the rule.”


	
	Rule 105(d) provides that a barrister may return a brief to appear before a court if the barrister has reasonable grounds to doubt that his fees will be paid reasonably promptly or in accordance with a costs agreement.
	
	
	Mr Raphael’s application is supported by an affidavit sworn by him today. It reveals that Mr Raphael has been retained as counsel for Mr Seller since August 2014. On 3 July 2015 Mr Raphael wrote to Mr Seller in the following terms:
	


“Dear Ross,

Further to memorandum to you of yesterday, attached is a statement of fees rendered with respect to fees due by you in various matters. According to my records you have paid me on account three amounts of $5,000 and one of $1,000. Please confirm whether or not your own records indicate funds over and above a total of $16,000 having been paid.”


	
	Annexed to that correspondence was a schedule of outstanding costs owed to Mr Raphael by Mr Seller for a variety of matters totalling $139,870. Of that sum, $62,338 would appear to be owing in respect of the present matter.
	
	
	On 20 July 2015 Mr Raphael wrote to Mr Seller again, this time in the following terms:
	


“I refer to my telephone discussion with you of Saturday the 11th instant in which I explained to you that, given that you already owe me somewhat in excess of $120,000 simply cannot give up 6 weeks of my time (this includes a further 7 days preparation) without there being a minimum of $75,000 being paid to me in reduction of your existing indebtedness to me or being held in a solicitor’s trust account to cover most of my fees of the hearing.

I had said I would, as a favour to you, only charge you $2,750 per day including GST. This would inevitably also require me to do some work on the weekend during the trial. Even without weekends my fees at the above low rate would be $82,500 but, if you can put into trust $75,000 that would suffice.

I am sorry if you believe I am letting you down but since September last year you have only paid me $1,000.

If you are unable to pay that amount of $75,000 then I should return to you the copy documents served upon me. I tried to speak with you both on Thursday and Friday to no avail. I really think you and I need to talk in person.”


	
	Mr Seller replied later the same day as follows:
	


“I will get back to you. An old uncle, my mother’s brother, died last week so have had my mind on other things. I think as nothing has changed since we last spoke just hang on till 7th August when the HC Special leave hearing is on and see if the trial will as a result go ahead in August.

Also hopefully Brereton J will hand down his decision soon and we will know the likelihood of getting money out of that source, albeit that it may be delayed it will provide a strong indication of how much we should expect from that decision.”


	
	Mr Raphael deposed to the following matters in paragraphs 5 to 9 inclusive of his affidavit:
	


“5. On the 3rd August 2015 I had a conversation with Mr Seller. I said to him ‘What can we do about this fee basis, I just cannot proceed without certainty of payment.’ He said to me ‘We really hope to have the hearing date vacated by reason of a successful special leave application on Friday of this week.’ I said to him ‘I certainly hope that you are successful because there is certainly no money going to come to you from the Aquatic Air case. Ben DeBuse has told me that they will appeal the orders which we are seeking in that matter and likewise I said the same to him.’

6. On the 14th August 2015 I had yet another telephone conversation with Mr Seller. I said to him ‘Without cash in the solicitor’s Trust Account there is just no way I can appear for you.’ He said ‘I am going to make an application for Legal Aid.’ I said to him ‘Well I hope you are successful but the fees they pay are less than $1,000 per day and that is not acceptable to me.’ We had a similar telephone discussion last weekend.

7. On Tuesday the 18th August 2015 I appeared on behalf of Aquatic Air Pty Limited (a company controlled by Mr Seller) in relation to orders to be made in relation to the case of Equatic [sic] Air Pty Ltd v Siewert. That matter, after two hours debate before his Honour Brereton J, is still unresolved with further submissions as to the nature and quantification of the orders to be lodged not late [sic] than the 21st of this month.

8. Mr Seller said to me at [sic] after we returned to my chambers yesterday ‘I just have no money to pay you’. I said to him ‘As I told you yesterday, I am going to have to apply to the Judge to be released from my retainer.’

9. Early this morning I had the benefit of conversations with the Ass to Justice Harrison. Around 9.10a.m. she telephoned me to say that she had listed the matter at 3.00p.m. before his Honour and that I would have to have Mr Seller there. I said ‘I do not know if I can arrange it, I will do my best.’ She said ‘Get back to me as soon as possible.’ I telephoned Mr Seller and said to him ‘Ross you have to be at Court at 3.00p.m. today before Justice Harrison. Justice Harrison is in Court 10B.’ Mr Seller said to me ‘All right well I’ll have to drive up to Sydney, I will see you in Court’.


	
	There was no other material relied upon in support of the present application. Significantly, there is no evidence that Mr Seller consented to Mr Raphael returning his brief. Mr Seller was present in court when the matter came before me. He gave no evidence and was not asked to do so. Mr Raphael did not suggest that his application was based upon Mr Seller’s consent to the course that is proposed.
	
	
	It is important to observe that this is not an application by Mr Seller based upon Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292. Mr Seller does not contend that he is without funds or assets and that, through no fault of his own, he is unable to obtain or retain suitable legal representation at his trial.
	
	
	Mr Raphael has, for better or worse, quite apparently extended considerable generosity to Mr Seller with respect to payment of his outstanding fees. Mr Raphael has not however, as far as I can determine, ever indicated to Mr Seller that he proposed to return his brief if his fees were not paid or were not adequately secured. That may be a function of the friendship between the two men but it does not reduce or remove Mr Raphael’s ethical obligation to conform to the rule. Experience indicates that postponement of difficult decisions is often generated by a hope, far less an expectation, that things will work out for the best given time. Unfortunately, in the context of a looming criminal trial of a serious criminal offence, the luxury of indecision is not available.
	
	
	I indicated in open court that Mr Raphael would in these circumstances have to remain in the matter as defence counsel for Mr Seller. The foregoing are my reasons for coming to that decision.
	
	
	My formal order is that the application is refused.

2767541,El-Ali v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Local Court of NSW (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1134,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	On 5 June 2015 I dismissed an application made by the plaintiff for an order, pursuant to s. 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, that he be granted leave to appeal against a decision of Magistrate Favretto delivered on 16 December 2014 in the Local Court: El-Ali v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Local Court of NSW [2015] NSWSC 671. I also dismissed the plaintiff’s application for relief under s. 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).
	
	
	When the matter was previously before me one of the submissions advanced on behalf of the plaintiff was that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“CDPP”) did not have the power to prosecute the plaintiff for offences against NSW legislation because the relevant charges had been laid by someone other than the CDPP. In circumstances where I ultimately decided that the relief sought by the plaintiff was not available, it was not necessary for me to consider the issue of the extent of the DPP’s powers.
	
	
	On 26 June 2015, following delivery of my previous judgment, the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking:
	



	
	an order that the CDPP be restrained from further carrying on the committal proceedings against the plaintiff; and
	
	
	a declaration that the CDPP has no power under the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (“the Act”) to carry on the committal proceedings against the plaintiff.
	



	
	In support of the orders sought, the plaintiff relies principally upon the submission which was previously made and which is set out in [2] above. The orders sought by the plaintiff are opposed by the CDPP who is named as the first defendant. The second defendant has filed a submitting appearance.
	
	
	When the parties came before me on 10 August 2015 it was agreed that I would determine the matter on the basis of:
	



	
	the written submissions filed in the previous proceedings;
	
	
	the oral submissions made at the previous hearing on 13 March 2015; and
	
	
	the further written submissions recently filed by each of the parties.
	


THE RELEVANT BACKGROUND


	
	The background to the matter is set out in full at [4]-[19] of my previous judgment. In the circumstances, it is appropriate that I set out those paragraphs again:
	


THE CHARGES AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF 

[4] The plaintiff has been charged with an offence (“the Commonwealth offence”) of conspiring to import tier two goods contrary to s. 11.5 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) and s. 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).

[5] He has also been charged with the following (“the State offences”):

i. conspiring to possess unregistered firearms contrary to s. 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW);

ii. unlawfully selling firearms contrary to s. 51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW); and

iii. participating in a criminal group contrary to s. 93T(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

[6] The entirety of the charges against the plaintiff involve the alleged importation, possession and supply of 140 Glock pistols. Two other persons, Ahmed Karnib (“Karnib”) and Andrew Botros (“Botros”) have also been charged with offences arising out of the same circumstances. In short, the case against the plaintiff is that he arranged for the purchase, delivery and importation into Australia of firearms, firearm parts and firearm magazines. On the Crown case, there were 21 successful importations into Australia. However, only a proportion of the pistols which are said to have been imported have been recovered.

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

[7] In light of the issues raised by the plaintiff, it is necessary for me to briefly recount the procedural history of the proceedings in the Local Court.

[8] The charges against the plaintiff came before the Local Court on various occasions between 14 March 2012 and 5 February 2013, during which time they were progressively adjourned to allow the completion of service of the brief of evidence. On the majority of those occasions there were separate appearances on behalf of the CDPP (in respect of the Commonwealth offence) and the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions (“the NSWDPP”) (in respect of the State offences).

[9] On 5 February 2013 there was a single appearance by Mr Powell, solicitor, on behalf of the CDPP. On that occasion Mr Powell informed the court as follows:

“The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had taken over the conduct of the prosecution of the existing State offences from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has elected to prosecute the existing State offences on indictment.”

[10] The circumstances in which the CDPP came to take over the prosecution of the State offences emerge from correspondence between the CDPP and the NSWDPP. On 16 May 2012 Mr Pickering SC, the Deputy NSWDPP wrote to the then CDPP, Mr Craigie SC (as his Honour then was) in (inter alia) the following terms (CB 49-51):

“The defendants, Khoder EL ALI, Ahmed KARNIB and Andrew BOTROS are each charged with the following offences:

Intentionally import prohibited tier 2 goods: s. 233 BAB(5), Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (maximum penalty:10 years);

possess more than 3 unregistered firearms: s. 51D(2), Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) (maximum penalty: 20 years; standard non-parole period 10 years).

unlawfully selling firearms on an ongoing basis: s. 51B(1), Firearms Act 1996 (maximum penalty: 20 years; standard non-parole period 10 years).

participate in a criminal group: s. 93T(1), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (maximum penalty: 5 years).

…

EL ALI is also charged with 15 offences of providing a false or misleading application under s. 70 of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW), which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment when the application does not relate to a prohibited firearm or pistol. Those charges are currently with police prosecutors and have been referred to my Office for consideration of election. They relate to allegations that EL ALI provided false information to the Firearms Registry in connection with applications for permits to acquire firearms.

[REDACTED]

For the following reasons, I am of the view that it would be appropriate for your office to have conduct of the prosecution of all charges, Commonwealth and State, against each of the defendants.

[REDACTED]

I would be grateful for your views on the proposed course at your earlier (sic) convenience. If you agree to your Office conducting the prosecution of all charges, pursuant to the Instrument of Delegation signed on 22 September 2011, I consent to your Office conducting the prosecution of the defendants for the NSW charges and I elect for the charges under s. 70 of the Firearms Act 1996 against EL ALI being dealt with on indictment.”

[11] By letter of 24 January 2013, the then Senior Assistant Director of the CDPP, Ms Ellen McKenzie, wrote to Mr Pickering SC in (inter alia) the following terms:

“I write to inform you that, having completed a review of the brief of evidence, it has been decided to accede to your request.

It is proposed now to seek advice from senior counsel as to the appropriate charges to be preferred against each accused. This office will be in further contact with you in due course in relation to any issues that arise in respect of the disposition or continuation of any State charges.”

THE RELEVANT INSTRUMENTS OF APPOINTMENT

[12] On 6 December 2012 the then Governor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, Her Excellency the Honourable Dame Quentin Bryce, approved a recommendation made by the then Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia, Ms Nicola Roxon MP, that Mr Robert Bromwich SC be appointed as the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for a period of 5 years commencing on 17 December 2012. The instrument of appointment was signed by the Governor-General on 6 December 2012.

[13] On 2 January 2013, pursuant to the provisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 (Cth) (“the CDPP Act”) the acting Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, Jason Clare, signed a consent in the following terms:

“I, Jason Clare, acting Attorney-General of Australia, pursuant to s. 6(1)(m) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 HEREBY CONSENT to ROBERT BROMWICH SC holding appointments to prosecute offences against the laws of each and every State.”

[14] On each of 6 February 2013, 12 June 2013 and 25 August 2014 Mr Lloyd Babb SC, the NSWDPP, signed separate instruments of delegation, the effect of each of which was to delegate, to nominated persons, certain of his functions and responsibilities. In the schedules accompanying each of those three instruments Mr Bromwich SC was one of the persons nominated. Each schedule was in (inter alia) the following terms:

“I Lloyd Adam Babb SC, the Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales hereby:

…

Delegate to the persons listed in the Schedule who have been approved by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales, my functions and responsibilities;

To institute and conduct committal proceedings for indictable offences, proceedings for summary offences in any court and summary proceedings for indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily in Local Courts;

To find a bill of indictment in respect of an indictable offence in circumstances where the person concerned has been committed for trial for that indictable offence and to institute and conduct, on behalf of the Crown, the prosecution of such a person on that indictment for indictable offences in the District Court or the Supreme Court.

…

These delegations and orders are to apply during the term of the appointment of the persons named in the Schedule to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions or until earlier revocation.

THE COMMITTAL PROCEEDINGS

[15] At all times after 5 February 2013 the CDPP appeared in the Local Court as prosecutor in respect of both the Commonwealth and State offences. Counsel briefed by the CDPP appeared at the committal proceedings which were governed by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“CPA”).

[16] At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence in the committal proceedings the plaintiff pleaded guilty to the Commonwealth offence. Counsel for the plaintiff then submitted to the Magistrate that the State offences should be dismissed on the basis that the CDPP had no power to prosecute them. In written reasons delivered on 16 December 2014, the Magistrate rejected that submission. He found (inter alia) that the CDPP had the lawful authority to conduct the committal proceedings in respect of the State offences. Immediately following that decision, and without the committal proceedings actually concluding, the plaintiff filed the present summons seeking leave to appeal against the Magistrate’s decision.

THE REASONS OF THE MAGISTRATE

[17] The Magistrate (commencing at [1]) set out the background to the application made on behalf of the plaintiff:

“[1] These are proceedings for the commitment for trial of the accused Khoder El Ali on a Commonwealth importation offence and a number of State firearm offences concerning the unlawful importation and sale of firearms and firearm parts (collectively “the firearms”). The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“CDPP”) prosecutes the Commonwealth offence in its own right and purportedly carries on the prosecution of the State offences on behalf of the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions (“NSWDPP”).

[2] The accused has been charged along with two others, Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros. Generally, all three are charged with the importation, possession and subsequent supply of some one hundred and forty (140) Glock pistols in 2011 and 2012 (by the unlawful importation of the Glock’s (sic) in parts) through the Sylvania Waters Post Office and adjacent business addresses. Both Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros took part in a contested committal with the calling of the witness Patrick Fuge (the seller and exporter of the Glock’s and parts) from Germany under s. 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The accused did not take part in the s. 91 hearing. Both Ahmed Karnib and Andrew Botros are currently before the District Court awaiting sentence.

[3] The case against the accused Khoder El Ali is that he arranged for the purchase, delivery and ultimate importation into New South Wales, Australia of the firearms, firearm parts and firearm magazines. El Ali used various false identities for the unlawful importation from suppliers in Germany (19 importations via Fuge) and the USA (two importations) by having the firearms broken down into parts for export into Australia. In all twenty one (21) importations were successful into Australia totalling one hundred and fifty (150) Glock pistols. Only eight Glock pistols have been recovered to the Court’s knowledge. One hundred and forty (140) Glock pistol magazines and eight (8) magazine speed loaders were seized on 10 February 2011 which then became the subject of a controlled delivery. Ahmed Karnib arranged for the transport of the firearms into Sydney and either took delivery and possession himself or arranged delivery and possession through Andrew Botros via the Sylvania Waters Post Office.

[4] At the close of the CDPP’s case the accused entered a plea of guilty to the Commonwealth importation offence. The Court notes that the entering of that plea of guilty will by itself, have the consequence of establishing some of the elements of the State Firearm offences; at least the possession of the firearms in New South Wales once the firearms came into Sydney and some were delivered to an address at Dulwich Hill but the majority were delivered at Sylvania Waters.”

[18] The Magistrate then said (at [5]-[6]):

“[5] However, the accused submits that the State offences should be dismissed because the CDPP had no power to carry on the proceedings on behalf of the NSWDPP. As the latter did not appear at the hearing the accused must be discharged: see s. 61(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, subject to the discretion in s. 6(1)(b) to adjourn the proceedings to allow the NSWDPP to appear.

[6] Alternatively the accused submits that the State Court Attendances (sic) Notices (“CANs”) should be quashed as either “embarrassing” as averred or that the elements of the offences are not proven.

[7] The accused’s latter submissions are to be considered and properly only determined at this stage under s. 62 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, namely the legal test “…Whether the prosecution evidence is capable of satisfying a jury, properly instructed, beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person has committed an indictable offence”. That determination requires the court “not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case…”: R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 127. The CDPP’s case is to be taken at its highest and there is still a case to answer even if the CDPP’s evidence is tenuous, inherently weak or vague: DPP v Elskaf [2012] NSWSC 21 at [47]” (emphasis in original).

[19] The Magistrate went on to consider the respective submissions of the parties before concluding (at [60]):

“For the foregoing reasons the CDPP did have the lawful authority to “carry on” the committal proceedings for the State firearm offences and in doing so to appear for the NSWDPP. Consequently the NSWDPP did not fail to appear at the committal hearing.”

THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION


	
	Section 6(1) of the Act is in the following terms:
	


Functions of Director

(1) The functions of the Director are:

(a) to institute prosecutions on indictment for indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth; and

(b) to carry on prosecutions of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) (not being prosecutions instituted by the Attorney-General or a Special Prosecutor), whether or not instituted by the Director; and

(baa) if the Attorney-General requests the Director in writing to carry on a prosecution of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) that was instituted by the Attorney-General--to carry on that prosecution; and

(n) to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the functions referred to in paragraphs (a) to (mb) and in subsection (2).

 


	
	In view of the submissions advanced on behalf of the plaintiff, three other provisions of the Act are relevant. The first and second are ss. 9(5) and (5A) respectively which are in the following terms:
	


Powers of Director

…

(5) For the purposes of the performance of his or her functions, the Director may take over a proceeding that was instituted or is being carried on by another person, being a proceeding:

(a) for the commitment of a person for trial in respect of an indictable offence against a law of the Commonwealth; or

(b) for the summary conviction of a person in respect of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth;

and where the Director takes over such a proceeding, he or she may decline to carry it on further.

(5A) Where the Director is carrying on a proceeding instituted by another person, being a proceeding of the kind mentioned in paragraph (5)(a) or (b), the Director may decline to carry it on further even if the Director has not taken it over under subsection (5).

…”


	
	The third is s. 14 which is in the following terms:
	


Director to inform court when taking over or carrying on proceedings

(1) Where:

(a) pursuant to subsection 9(3), (3A) or (5), the Director takes over a prosecution or proceeding; or

(b) the Director decides to carry on:

(ii) a proceeding for the recovery of a pecuniary penalty under a law of the Commonwealth;

being a prosecution or proceeding that was instituted or is being carried on by another person;

the Director shall, as soon as practicable:

(c) by notice in writing, inform the registrar or other proper officer of the court in which the prosecution or proceeding is to be heard; or

(d) if the prosecution or proceeding is being heard by a judge or magistrate--in such manner as the Director thinks fit, inform the judge or magistrate;

that the Director has taken over, or is carrying on, as the case may be, the prosecution or proceeding, but failure of the Director to do so does not affect any of the Director's powers in relation to the prosecution or proceeding.

(2) The Director shall, as from the time when he or she complies with subsection (1) in relation to a prosecution or proceeding that he or she has taken over pursuant to subsection 9(3), (3A) or (5), be deemed for all purposes to be the prosecutor, informant or complainant, as the case requires, in that prosecution or proceeding.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions of the plaintiff


	
	The fundamental submission of counsel for the plaintiff was that the words “institute and carry on” which appear in s. 6(1)(m) of the Act are to be read conjunctively, as opposed to disjunctively. In other words, it was submitted that properly construed, s. 6(1)(m) meant that that the CDPP could “carry on” only those proceedings which he himself had instituted. Adopting this construction it followed, in counsel’s submission, that because the proceedings against the plaintiff for the State offences were not commenced by the CDPP, the CDPP had no power to carry them on, and thus no power to conduct the committal proceedings in respect of those offences before the Magistrate.
	
	
	It was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that although the words “institute and carry on” as they appear in s. 6(1)(m) could be read disjunctively if considered in isolation, such a construction should not be adopted in light of the provisions the Act as a whole. It was submitted, by reference to various authorities, that the meaning of a statutory provision was to be determined by reference to the language of the instrument when viewed as a whole and that, when this approach was taken, the disjunctive construction advanced by the CDPP could not be accepted.
	
	
	In developing these submissions, counsel referred to various aspects of the drafting of s. 6 which were said to support the construction which was advanced. It was pointed out, in particular, that in a number of provisions within s. 6 the draftsman had deliberately separated the function of instituting proceedings from the function of carrying on such proceedings. By way of example, counsel pointed out that:
	



	
	in respect of Commonwealth indictable offences, the power to institute proceedings was to be found in s. 6(1)(a), whereas the power to carry on those proceedings was to be found in s. 6(1)(b);
	
	
	in respect of committal proceedings for Commonwealth offences, the power to institute the proceedings was to be found in s. 6(1)(c), whereas the power to carry on those proceedings was to be found in s. 6(1)(e); and
	
	
	in respect of summary proceedings for Commonwealth offences, the power to institute the proceedings was to be found in ss. 6(1)(d), whereas the power to carry on those proceedings was to be found in 6(1)(e).
	



	
	Counsel submitted that in contrast, each of ss. 6(1)(m) and 6(1)(ma) provided for both functions within the same provision. It was submitted that these variations in drafting were explicable only on the basis that the Parliament intended that the power of the CDPP to carry on proceedings for State offences was conditional upon the relevant charges having been brought by the CDPP, and not by someone else.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that a disjunctive construction would lead to anomalies in light of ss. 9(5) and (5A) of the Act. By reference to those provisions, counsel submitted that the CDPP may carry on proceedings instituted by another person (s. 6(1)(e)), and may subsequently decline to carry on those proceedings (s. 9(5A)). However, it was submitted that if the CDPP’s argument was to be accepted, the CDPP was able to carry on proceedings for State offences instituted by someone else in circumstances where there was no power (be it in s. 9 or elsewhere) to decline to further carry on those proceedings.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that the construction advanced on behalf of the CDPP would undermine the effectiveness of the notice provisions contained in s. 14(1) of the Act. It was submitted, in particular, that having regard to s. 14(1) the CDPP was required to notify the court when he had decided to carry on the prosecution of a Commonwealth offence, or proceedings for the recovery of a pecuniary penalty, but was not under any similar requirement where he had elected to carry on a prosecution for a State offence. Counsel submitted that the absence of a notice requirement was explained by the fact that no notice was, in fact, required in respect of proceedings for State offences because such matters could be prosecuted by the CDPP only if he had instituted those proceedings. It was submitted that what was an “obvious absurdity” could only be avoided if a conjunctive construction was applied to the words “institute and carry on”.
	
	
	In advancing these submissions counsel accepted that the decision of the Qld Court of Appeal in R v Dexter [2002] QCA 540 was at odds with his position. However, he submitted that a proper reading of the decision in Dexter made it clear that the provisions of s. 6(1)(m) were not fully considered in that case and that in these circumstances, it was open to me to decline to follow it.
	


Submissions of the first defendant


	
	Senior counsel for the CDPP accepted that prerogative relief was available in relation to committal proceedings. However he emphasised the significance of the discretionary considerations which arise in such circumstances: Nanevski v Haskett [2006] NSWSC 1114 at [28] per McClellan CJ at CL; Tez v Longley [2004] NSWSC 74; (2004) 142 A Crim R 122 at [13]; [18]-[27] per Shaw J.
	
	
	As to the principal submissions advanced on behalf of the plaintiff, senior counsel for the CDPP argued that an interpretation of s. 6(1)(m) of the Act which meant that the plaintiff’s plea of guilty to the Commonwealth offence in the course of the committal proceedings ipso facto ended the role of the CDPP as prosecutor of the State offences, would be manifestly absurd.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that the relevant Commonwealth legislation mandates that a construction of a statute which promotes the purpose or object of an Act is to be preferred to a construction which does not. In this regard, senior counsel cited s. 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (“the Interpretation Act”) which is in the following terms:
	


15AA Interpretation best achieving Act's purpose or object

In interpreting a provision of an Act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose or object of the Act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act) is to be preferred to each other interpretation.


	
	In reliance upon that provision, senior counsel submitted that the underlying purpose of the Act was to empower the CDPP to prosecute offences, and that a disjunctive construction of s. 6(1)(m) was consistent with, and promoted, that purpose.
	
	
	It was further submitted that a disjunctive construction produced a fairer and more convenient operation of the provision, and conformed with the relevant legislative intention. It was submitted that if the Parliament had intended the words in s. 6(1)(m) to be construed conjunctively, other language would have been used so as to make that intention clear, such as “to institute and then carry on” or “to carry on, in accordance with the terms of the appointment, prosecutions for State offences instituted by the Director”. It was submitted that the absence of such language supported the CDPP’s position.
	
	
	Senior counsel further submitted that there was a nexus between the State offences charged against the plaintiff and the Commonwealth offence. It was submitted that such a nexus remained, notwithstanding the plea of guilty to the Commonwealth offence and the plaintiff’s committal for sentence on that charge, and that it supported the power of the CDPP to prosecute the State offences.
	
	
	Finally, senior counsel submitted that the decision in Dexter directly supported the CDPP’s position. It was submitted, in particular, that the reasons of McMurdo P were part of the ratio decidendi, and that they supported the conclusion that s. 6(1)(m) of the Act was to be read disjunctively. It was submitted that I should follow the decision in Dexter unless I could come to a conclusion that it was plainly wrong. It was submitted that such a conclusion was not reasonably open in the circumstances.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In “Statutory Interpretation in Australia” (D C Pearce and R S Geddes) the authors, in reference to s. 15AA of the Interpretation Act, state the following (at [2.11]):
	


“The task of the Court under s. 15AA and its equivalents is to seek to discover the underlying purpose or object of the Act or other legislation in which a provision is contained and, if possible, to adopt an interpretation of the provision that furthers the purpose or object”.


	
	The long title to the Act states that it is an Act “to establish an Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and for related purposes”. In the present case, counsel for the plaintiff accepted that part of the underlying purpose of the Act was to provide the Director with “statutory powers”. The statutory powers to which counsel was referring must necessarily be statutory powers related to the prosecution of offences. Similarly, the reference to “related purposes” in the long title to the Act must be a reference to purposes related to the prosecution of offences.
	
	
	The position taken by counsel for the plaintiff as to the purpose of the Act is generally consistent with the terms of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Director of Public Prosecutions Bill (1983) which stated (inter alia):
	


“Clause 6 – this clause states that the functions of the Director are as follows:

“… to conduct prosecutions for State offences where, with the consent of the Attorney-General, the Director holds an appointment to do so”.


	
	It is apparent from the terms of Clause 6 that it was the intention of the Parliament that the Director conduct prosecutions for State offences where (as here) he holds the necessary appointment to do so. The stated intention says nothing about the institution of such prosecutions. Moreover, there is no relevant difference between the word “conduct” (being the term used in the Explanatory Memorandum) and the term “carry on” (being the term used in s. 6(1)(m) of the Act). In R v Dainer and ors; Ex parte Pullen (1988) 78 ACTR 25 Kelly J, in reference to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Raymond v Attorney-General [1982] QB 839, concluded (at 31) that the term “carry on”, where it was used in the Act in relation to proceedings or prosecutions, was intended to relate to the general conduct of such proceedings (see also Dexter at [29] per McMurdo P where her Honour cited the dictionary definition of such terms). All of these considerations tend against the conjunctive construction of s. 6(1)(m) which has been advanced by the plaintiff.
	
	
	Further, as counsel for the CDPP pointed out, the acceptance of a conjunctive construction of s. 6(1)(m) would mean, in the context of the present case, that once the plea of guilty to the Commonwealth offence had been entered by the plaintiff, there would suddenly have been no prosecutor for the State offences, in circumstances where the two were factually related. I accept the submission of senior counsel for the CDPP that this would be an absurd result and one that the Parliament could not possibly have intended. It would also be a result which was at odds with what counsel for the plaintiff agreed was part of the underlying purpose of the Act (at [25] above).
	
	
	Moreover, as counsel for the plaintiff conceded, the construction of s. 6(1)(m) which he advanced is at odds with the decision in Dexter (supra). In Dexter the appellant had been convicted in the Queensland District Court in respect of a series of offences contrary to the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) (“the Code”). At the time, the CDPP and the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions (“QDPP”) had in place an agreement to allow either organisation to prosecute Commonwealth and State offences on a single indictment. The agreement required a case by case decision, as well as mutual consent. It included general guidelines for deciding which organisation should have conduct of proceedings. The CDPP had asked the QDPP to consent to the presentation of an ex-officio indictment against the appellant containing 17 counts contrary to the Code. In seeking that consent, a draft indictment was provided. The QDPP subsequently gave permission to the CDPP to present that indictment. This permission amounted, in effect, to the QDPP giving its consent:
	



	
	to prosecuting counsel, to sign and present the indictment; and
	
	
	to the CDPP, to prepare and fund the prosecution, and to instruct prosecuting counsel.
	



	
	Following his conviction, the appellant appealed. He argued that the CDPP’s involvement in the institution and presentation of the indictment, which charged offences only against a law of Queensland, rendered the indictment a nullity, and that the convictions based upon it were required to be set aside. It was argued that the CDPP had no lawful authority to indict and prosecute the appellant, be it in right of the Commonwealth or in right of the State.
	
	
	The appeal was dismissed. In the course of her judgment McMurdo P said the following (commencing at [29]):
	


[29] As the CDPP had the consent of the Commonwealth Attorney-General to hold an appointment to prosecute offences against the laws of Queensland under s6(1)(m) CDPP Act (and held a commission to prosecute under s560(2) Criminal Code (Qld)) the CDPP's functions included ""to institute and carry on ... prosecutions"" for Queensland. The term ""carry on"" is not defined in the CDPP Act. The meaning of the phrase in the Macquarie Dictionary18 is ""to manage; conduct;..."". Although the CDPP did not institute this prosecution on indictment he did, with the consent of the QDPP, carry on the prosecution in preparing the case and briefing and instructing (prosecuting counsel). S6(1)(m) CDPP Act does not limit the function of the CDPP to the conduct of Queensland prosecutions which he has also personally instituted (that is, where he has signed and presented the indictment); it also includes the carrying on of prosecutions, which incorporates the preparation and management of a prosecution case.

[30] The CDPP's commission under s560 Criminal Code (Qld) was personal to him and s6(1)(m) CDPP Act only authorised the institution and carrying on of Queensland prosecutions in accordance with the terms of that commission. His commission authorised the CDPP in the absence of the Attorney-General for the State of Queensland to ""sign in [his] own name and present indictments in respect of indictable offences and to prosecute the same for Her Majesty The Queen at any Sittings of the Supreme, Circuit and District Courts appointed to be held at any place within the State of Queensland."" It has never been the case that such a commission limits the holder to the prosecution of indictments signed and presented by the holder; it also allows the holder to prosecute all properly signed and presented valid indictments. The words ""the same"" refer to ""indictments in respect of indictable offences""; they are not limited to indictments in respect of indictable offences signed and presented by the holder. The terms of the CDPP's commission to prosecute under s560(2) Criminal Code (Qld) allowed him to carry on the prosecution of the indictment signed and presented by Mr MacSporran, who also held a commission to prosecute under s560 Criminal Code (Qld). The words ""carry on ... prosecutions"" in s6(1)(m) CDPP Act and ""prosecute"" in the commission are not limited to the adversarial conduct of the case in court but include giving advice and preparation” (emphasis added).


	
	Jerrard JA (at [89]) relevantly agreed with McMurdo P. In the present case, there is no issue that the CDPP holds a relevant instrument of appointment. Both parties accepted that the passages of the judgment of McMurdo P to which I have referred formed part of the ratio decidendi.
	
	
	As a judge at first instance I should not depart from a decision of an intermediate appellate Court in another jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation or uniform national legislation, unless I am convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong: Farah Constructions Pty Limited and ors v Say-Dee Pty Limited [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135]; 152 (per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ) citing Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited [1993] HCA 15; (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492 (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ). I am not convinced that the interpretation ascribed to s. 6(1)(m) in Dexter is plainly wrong. On the contrary, I respectfully agree with the reasons of McMurdo P. Her Honour’s interpretation of s. 6(1)(m) is consistent with the view I have otherwise reached.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that it is open to me to decline to follow the decision in Dexter because the provisions of s. 6(1)(m) were not fully considered by the Court of Appeal. Such a submission is at odds with the terms of the judgment of McMurdo P. Further, it is of some significance that the decision of the Court of Appeal was the subject of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court: Dexter v R [2004] HCA Trans 219. The provisions of s. 6(1)(m) were specifically referred to by senior counsel for the appellant at the hearing of the application for special leave (commencing at T6 L217). Without calling upon the then Commonwealth Director, Gleeson CJ concluded (at T7 L262) that there were insufficient prospects of success of an appeal to warrant a grant of special leave. The application for special leave was then dismissed. In my view, the provisions of s. 6(1)(m) were obviously the subject of judicial consideration in Dexter, and the conclusion which was reached was at odds with the submissions now advanced on behalf of the plaintiff.
	


ORDERS


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The order granting a stay of the proceedings against the plaintiff in the Local Court is vacated.
	
	
	The proceedings in this court are dismissed.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to provide written submissions, not exceeding two pages in length, as to the question of costs by 4:00pm on 27 August 2015.
	
	
	The first defendant is to respond by providing submissions, not exceeding two pages in length by 4:00pm 2 September on 2015.

		20 August 2015",2015-08-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767545,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tony MAWAD [2015] NSWCCA 227,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: My reasons for joining in the orders of the Court made on 10 August 2015 refusing the respondent bail accord with those of Beech-Jones J, save that I would refrain from expressing a view on the matters the subject of his Honour's observation at [49].
	
	
	I would add the following observation in relation to the show cause requirement under s 16A of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW). I do not regard the passage from Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Brooks [2015] NSWCCA 190 at [22] (set out at [40] below) as impermissibly attempting to place an additional hurdle upon an accused person to show cause why his or her detention is not justified. The description of the material put before the Court by the respondent in Brooks as “nothing particularly special or unusual”, is to be understood as explaining the application of the show cause requirement in that case. The use of language such as “special or unusual” merely conveyed that the circumstances relied upon by the respondent in Brooks did not amount to showing cause.
	
	
	ADAMS J: As Beech-Jones J has pointed out, the decision to refuse bail was that of the majority of the Court. I would have granted bail for substantially the same reasons as, and on the same conditions imposed by, Hamill J. The reason for this different result essentially depends on my differing from the majority as to the risk that Mr Mawad poses for the commission of further offences whilst at liberty on bail.
	
	
	Whilst the Court is by no means bound by the way in which the Director puts his case, it is worth noting that, apart from generalities, this consideration was not the subject of any detailed analysis. I would respectfully point out that, although the evidence suggests the possibility of access to weapons, there is no material that informs the readiness with which he might do so. Moreover, any supply of weapons to the applicant would constitute a serious offence and persons who might be approached by the applicant would be well aware that, to say the least, he is of interest to the police and such a supply would be attended by significant risks. Even so, I readily accept there is some, not insignificant, risk that the applicant might commit a further offence whilst on bail. Although I would not, as it were, give the applicant the benefit of any doubt, it seems to me that the evidence as a whole should lead to the objective assessment of the risk that he might commit further offences as low, having regard also to the conditions which were imposed by Hamill J, which were, if I may respectfully say so, adequate to deal with it. Those conditions included, not surprisingly, daily reporting to police and a curfew.
	
	
	These questions are very much matters of fact and degree upon which minds might well reasonably differ. Although this is a hearing de novo, as Beech-Jones J has observed, the views of the primary judge are properly taken into account. They have reinforced my conclusion that the Director's application should be dismissed.
	
	
	I wish also to express my strong agreement with [49] of Beech-Jones J's judgment. It is difficult to see the utility of, in effect, making available, not one but two de novo hearings in the Supreme Court, so that potentially every bail application, regardless of merit, could be heard by four judges of this Court (leaving aside the earlier considerations by other judicial officers).
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: On 10 August 2015 the Court heard a detention application brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (the “Director”) under s 50 of the Bail Act 2013 (the “Act’). At the conclusion of argument the presiding judge, Gleeson JA, announced that, by a majority, the Court would grant the Director’s application. An order was made refusing the Respondent bail. He was taken into custody. I was part of that majority. These are my reasons for granting the Director’s application.
	


Background


	
	On 1 October 2014 the Respondent, Tony Mawad, was arrested and refused bail. On 23 July 2015 Hamill J granted Mr Mawad bail on strict conditions (R v Tony Mawad, unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Hamill J, 23 July 2015). He was released on those conditions on 30 July 2015. On or about that date the Director filed the detention application. The application was referred to this Court because a bail decision had already been made by the Supreme Court (s 67(1)(e)). The application is to be determined by this Court de novo. It is not an appeal from or a review of the decision of Hamill J (R v Kugor [2015] NSWCCA 14 at [4]), although that does not mean the judgment of Hamill J cannot be considered for its persuasive effect which in this case was substantial.
	
	
	At the time he was arrested Mr Mawad was charged with a series of offences arising out of an armed robbery of a home improvement store at Chullora at around 6.00am on 22 April 2014. The Director alleges that Mr Mawad and a co-accused each brandished pistols at two employees of the store and forced them to open a cash room. The amount stolen was $40,565.00. It is alleged they absconded from the scene in a car they had stolen some days prior to the robbery. The Director also alleges that they recruited an employee of the store, *** ***, who assisted them in gaining access on the morning of the robbery. Hamill J described the crime as a “reasonably well organised and executed robbery”. I agree. *** *** has since been arrested. He has confessed to his involvement and has agreed to give evidence against Mr Mawad and his co-accused.
	
	
	In relation to the robbery, Mr Mawad has been charged with a number of offences the most serious of which are two counts of armed robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. It seems that there are two counts because two employees of the store were terrorised. Mr Mawad was charged with various firearms offences arising out of his alleged possession of firearms during the course of the robbery. He was also charged with taking and driving a conveyance for use in the robbery. Further, at the time of his arrest on 1 October 2014, the police executed a search warrant on his home and located a “6 mm airsoft calibre KWC manufacture repeating air pistol”. He did not have a licence or permit for the weapon. This resulted in another firearms charge. It is not clear whether the Director alleges that this firearm was used in the robbery. *** *** told police that one of the offenders used a “real” gun and another offender used a “cap” gun.
	
	
	The charges under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one of the firearms offences arising from the robbery are all “show cause” offences for the purpose of s 16B of the Act as they are both serious indictable offences under Part 3 or 3A of the Crimes Act 1900 that involve the use of a firearm (s 16B(d)(i)) or an indictable offence involving the unlawful possession of a pistol or prohibited firearm in a public place (s 16B(d)(ii)). They are also show cause offences because Mr Mawad was on bail at the time the offences were allegedly committed.
	
	
	The interrelationship between the necessity to show cause and the demonstration of the existence of unacceptable risk of a bail concern materialising was outlined in Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Tikomaimaleya [2015] NSWCA 83 (“Tikomaimaleya”). It suffices to state that where the show cause test applies the Court must apply a two stage test. The first is to determine whether or not the accused person has shown cause “why his or her detention is not justified” (s 16A(1)). The second stage arises if cause is shown, as the court must then assess whether or not the person’s release raises any bail concerns (s 17(1); s 16A(2)) and, if so, determine whether there is an unacceptable risk of those concerns materialising (s19). A bail concern is a concern that the person will fail to appear, commit a serious offence, endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or interfere with witnesses or evidence (s17(2) and s19(2)). In relation to the first stage, the justification or otherwise for a person’s detention is to be determined by a consideration of all the circumstances whereas the unacceptable risk test requires that consideration only be given to the factors in s 18 (Tikomaimaleya at [24] to [26]) although it “may well be that matters that are relevant to the unacceptable risk test will also be relevant to the show cause test” (Tikomaimaleya at [24]).
	
	
	Before I apply these tests I will address a number of further issues that were agitated at the hearing of this application which inform the analysis of both stages of the test for bail, namely the strength of the Crown case, the applicant’s criminal record, the subjective material relied on by Mr Mawad, the likely time to trial, the bail conditions imposed by Hamill J, and the relevance or otherwise of certain statements made by the investigating police officer.
	


The strength of the Crown case (s 18(1)(c))


	
	Neither of the victims of the robbery is able to identify Mr Mawad as one of the persons who terrorised them. The perpetrators wore masks. Instead, to implicate Mr Mawad the Director relies on evidence from *** *** and an intercepted telephone call between him and Mr Mawad. The Director contended that, in light of that intercept, *** ***’s evidence was “compelling”. Counsel for Ms Mawad, Ms Francis, strongly disputed that assessment and the alleged significance of the recorded conversation.
	
	
	It appears that during the immediate investigation of the robbery *** *** maintained that he was an innocent bystander or indeed a victim. However the police became suspicious of his involvement and immediately commenced surveillance. At around 11.30am on the day of the robbery *** *** was observed meeting Mr Mawad who handed him a brown paper bag. Telephone records indicate that there were telephone conversations between Mr Mawad and *** *** and Mr Mawad and his co-accused in the hours before and after the robbery.
	
	
	On 6 August 2014 *** *** participated in an interview with the police and confessed to his involvement. He named Mr Mawad and his co-accused as his co-offenders.
	
	
	On 1 October 2014 the police recorded a conversation between *** *** and Mr Mawad. A transcript of that conversation was placed before this Court. During the conversation *** *** was trying to extract admissions from Mr Mawad. The pretext for the call is *** ***’s concern about the “State Crime Command” investigating him. At one point *** *** tells Mr Mawad “they [the police] reckon there was eighty grand Tonz” to which Mr Mawad ultimately replies “Liars brother, they are liars” and “I wish there was eighty grand” (transcript p 2). Later, the conversation continued as follows (transcript page 3):
	


“**:   They reckon they got DNA on the safe, on that cupboard. Did you cut, did your gloves rip?

TM:   What cupboard?

**:   Where youse took the money from, Tony. Do you know the fuckin’ … the cash you took from that bag or something?

TM:   He’s the one who (indecipherable) took them.

**:   You didn’t touch them?

TM:   He’s the one who took them all. Most of them. Me?

**:   You didn’t touch them?

TM:   One maybe. Not really.” (emphasis added)


	
	Ms Francis contended that the recorded conversation is at most suggestive of Mr Mawad having dealt with the proceeds of the robbery rather than having participated in it. I disagree. Prima facie it appears to be cogent evidence of Mr Mawad’s participation in the robbery. It suggests that during the telephone call with *** *** he cast his mind back to recall whether or not he touched something at the scene.
	
	
	Bail applications are not suitable forums to conduct mini trials. Nevertheless, an assessment of the strength of the Crown case is important to an assessment of prospective risk which is at the heart of the process of determining whether or not to grant bail. Based on the material presented, it is my assessment that the case against Mr Mawad is strong.
	


Mr Mawad’s antecedents (s 18(1)(a), 18(1)(d))


	
	Mr Mawad is 39 years of age. Between 1993 and 2002 he accumulated a few convictions for assault, break and enter, obtaining money by deception and driving offences. The most serious penalty imposed was a two year bond under former s 558 of the Crimes Act. The Director did not contend that much significance should be attached to these convictions.
	
	
	In March 2014 Mr Mawad was charged with aggravated break and enter with intention to commit a serious indictable offence. He was on bail for this offence when he allegedly committed the offences the subject of this application. On 15 October 2014 this charge was withdrawn. On 2 March 2015 he pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the attempted commission of a serious indictable offence. On 4 March 2015 he received a two year bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. No material was placed before this Court in relation to the offence to which he pleaded guilty. In those circumstances it has played no part in my determination beyond the fact that it explains why the respondent was on bail on 22 April 2014.
	


Family circumstances (s 18(1)(a), 18(1)(m))


	
	Mr Mawad is a qualified glazier. He has operated his own glazing business since 2004. In that year he married his wife. They have two children, a boy aged 5 and a daughter aged 2. In her affidavit, Mr Mawad’s wife describes their relationship as close and states that he is a supportive father. Mr Mawad and his wife own their own home which has an estimated value of $750,000 and a mortgage of $320,000. It has already been offered as security for Mr Mawad’s bail. Mr Mawad’s glazing business supported the family. It has now folded.
	
	
	A considerable amount of material was placed before this Court in relation to the vulnerability of Mr Mawad’s family in his absence. This material was at the core of Ms Francis’ contention that her client had shown cause why his detention was not justified.
	
	
	Mr Mawad’s son has poor vision and some hearing loss. The material included reports from a psychologist diagnosing him with a severe expressive language disorder and a mild receptive language disorder. As a result he was not able to commence school at age five. An assessment of his intellectual performance “across all adaptive skill areas” has placed him as only higher than 0.1% of children the same age.
	
	
	The necessity for the presence of Mr Mawad for his son’s wellbeing is three fold. First, the nature of his disabilities is such that the optimum time for professional intervention to address his deficits is now. Speech pathology and the other forms of professional assistance he needs are expensive. Mr Mawad’s wife states that she does not have the means to pay for it unless her husband is released from custody and able to work. Second, the preschool that Mr Mawad’s son attends has provided a report indicating that he has exhibited behavioural difficulties that have dramatically improved in the short time that Mr Mawad had been released from custody. Third, in her affidavit Mr Mawad’s wife describes how she lacks family support in caring for their children which is especially difficult given their special needs. To make matters worse she needs to have surgery. She has been advised that, in the three months after her operation, she must rest and will not able to lift objects that are heavier than a kilogram.
	
	
	The position is similarly difficult for Mr Mawad’s daughter. A speech pathology assessment report assesses her as having “severe language difficulties, both receptive and expressive”. As is the case with her brother she needs intensive speech pathology.
	
	
	I accept this material.
	


Likely time to trial (s 18(1)(h))


	
	Subsection 18(1)(h) identifies that one of the matters to be considered in an assessment of bail concerns is the “length of time the accused person is likely to spend in custody if bail is refused”. This consideration is related to s 18(1)(l) which refers to the need for an accused person to be “free to prepare for his or her appearance in court or to obtain legal advice”. Further this matter informs the unacceptable risk test in s 19(1) in that a consideration of what level of risk is “unacceptable” can involve a consideration of the undesirability of persons spending prolonged periods in pre-trial custody. Such an outcome is inimical to a system of justice that has as its foundation the presumption of innocence.
	
	
	In this case the Court had the benefit of estimates from an experienced Crown Prosecutor and Defence Counsel. Mr Mawad’s committal hearing is listed to be heard on 13 August 2015. The estimated length of his trial is 7 to 10 days. Depending on where Mr Mawad stands trial it is expected that, if he is refused bail, he would obtain a trial date between December 2015 at the earliest and June 2016 at the latest.
	


Bail conditions (s 18(1)(p))


	
	The bail conditions imposed by Hamill J involved Mr Mawad residing at his home and observing a curfew. Strict reporting conditions and conditions of non-association were imposed. His Honour also imposed a requirement that an acceptable person agree to forfeit $300,000 in the event that Mr Mawad failed to comply with his bail requirements and that the agreement be supported by security. His Honour also required that another acceptable person deposit the sum of $10,000 in cash and agree to forfeit that amount in the event that Mr Mawad failed to comply with his bail acknowledgement. Both of the security conditions have been complied with. The latter security was provided by an elderly lady who has known Mr Mawad for almost eight years through their local church.
	


Police views


	
	During the hearing of the application the Crown Prosecutor sought to rely on a letter written by the investigating officer, dated 14 July 2015, addressed to the “Presiding Judge” outlining, inter alia, the officer’s view on various matters relevant to the bail application that was before Hamill J and relevant to the detention application in this Court. At the time it was provided to Hamill J his Honour noted that it was “received but disregarded [officer’s] views as to outcome of [the] application as not relevant”.
	
	
	Ms Francis objected to the Court receiving the letter. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that she only wished to rely on the following extracts from the letter being matters potentially relevant to an assessment of bail concerns:
	


“This investigation has uncovered evidence that the Accused has contacts with known criminals who have access to firearms. Police are of the view that firearms can easily be sourced by the Accused and he would have a reason/ motive to do so against parties involved in this investigation particularly *** *** and his family.

…

The Accused can easily find the whereabouts of *** *** and his immediate family as *** *** currently remains at his normal residential address with his partner and children. These concerns have previously been expressed by *** *** and his family … The Accused is well known by myself as the officer in charge of this investigation … to have a lot of criminal connections in the suburbs where the *** *** … family reside.”


	
	Ms Francis objected to the Court receiving the emphasised passages in the above extract on the basis that they were mere expressions of opinion that are inscrutable in light of the absence of any detail to support them.
	
	
	Ms Francis referred to the following passage from the judgment of Garling J in JM v R [2015] NSWSC 978 at [48] (“JM”):
	


“Section 18 does not permit a court to have regard to the views of investigating police, or any other police officer, about whether bail should, or should not, be granted. The only views to which a court may have regard are those of a victim, or the family member of a victim and then, only to a limited extent: s 18(1)(o) of the Act. A police officer may, and commonly will, put material or relevant facts relating to the matters required by s 18 of the Act, to be considered by a court. But this is, or should be, limited to nothing more than a factual account. Statements of police opinion, or views as to the appropriateness of a grant, or refusal, of bail fall outside the terms of s 18 and are thus unable to be considered.”


	
	I respectfully agree with his Honour that the opinion of a police officer that bail should be refused is a matter that is “unable to be considered”. This is the view that was adopted by Hamill J. However, the present issue concerns police opinions and assertions on factors affecting bail such as the bail applicant’s ability to access weapons and his alleged “criminal connections”.
	
	
	Section 31 of the Bail Act provides:
	


“31 Rules of evidence do not apply

(1)   A bail authority may, for the purpose of exercising any of its functions in relation to bail, take into account any evidence or information that the bail authority considers credible or trustworthy in the circumstances and is not bound by the principles or rules of law regarding the admission of evidence.

(2)   This section does not apply:

   (a)   to proceedings for an offence in relation to bail, or

   (b)   to proceedings under Schedule 2 (Forfeiture of security).”


	
	A provision in the same form was found in s 32(3) of the Bail Act 1978. Provisions dispensing with the necessity to apply the rules of evidence are “intended to be facultative, not restrictive” and are meant to free the relevant decision maker from constraints that may be otherwise applicable (Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at [49] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J) although the extent to which they do so is to be ascertained from a consideration of statutory context (see Qantas Airways Ltd v Gubbins (1992) 28 NSWLR 26).
	
	
	The bail authorities referred to in this provision include a “police officer, an authorised justice [and] a court” (s 4) most, if not all, of whom deal with a significant volume of bail applications in a limited time frame. Thus the provision facilitates the orderly and expeditious disposition of bail applications by not requiring bail authorities to undertake a process of determining whether or not evidentiary material in whatever format should be admitted. Instead the bail authority can receive material it “considers credible or trustworthy”. Further, the bail authority can determine whether that relatively low threshold is met at the time the information is provided to it or at the time it determines the bail application. In effect s 31 enables a bail authority, including a court, if it so choses, to avoid making “rulings” on whether or not material that has apparent relevance should be received. Instead the bail authority can receive the material and give it such weight as it considers appropriate in its deliberations.
	
	
	In this case the objected to opinions of the police officer can be considered at least “trustworthy” in that there is no reason to doubt the bona fides of its author. However, just because this Court is not bound by the rules of evidence does not mean it is obliged to ignore the policy and rationale underlying those rules (R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; ex parte Bott (1933) 50 CLR 228 at 256 per Evatt J). This includes scepticism of conclusions unsupported by any factual detail. In my view, the absence of any detail setting out the basis for what are otherwise potentially damaging assertions warrants this Court not attributing any weight to those assertions. They played no part in my deliberations.
	


Has cause been shown?


	
	The Director submitted that Mr Mawad had failed to show cause why his detention was not justified. The Director contended that the matters pointed to on behalf of Mr Mawad are “common features” and they “should [not] be endorsed as sufficiently special to overcome the show cause requirement on a charge as serious” as that which he faces. In so submitting the Director relied on the following passage from Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Brooks [2015] NSWCCA 190 at [22] per R.A. Hulme J:
	


“As was submitted by the Crown, there is nothing particularly special or unusual in what the respondent has put before the Court. Age, lack of criminal antecedents, ties to the community and strong family support do not amount to showing cause. This is particularly so when one has regard to the seriousness of the offence with which the respondent has been charged and the apparent strength of the Crown case. In view of the conclusion which we have reached, it is not necessary to consider the question of unacceptable risk.” (emphasis added)


	
	Brooks was a detention application. The Respondent had been charged with murder.
	
	
	I do not understand Brooks to have stated that either “special or unusual” or “particularly special or unusual” circumstances must be demonstrated before cause can be shown. If it did then I disagree. This Court has no authority to add glosses to statutory tests. This is particularly so when s 22(1) of the Act specifically imposes a requirement to establish “special or unusual circumstances” when an appeal is pending in this Court or from this Court to the High Court against a conviction on indictment or a sentence imposed after conviction on indictment. In such case, the establishment of special or unusual circumstances is deemed to satisfy the show cause test where it is otherwise applicable (s 22(2)). These provisions are inconsistent with any suggestion that in all cases where the show cause test applies, special or unusual circumstances must be shown (JM at [39] to [41] per Garling J; see also El-Hilli v Melville v R [2015] NSWCCA 146 at [11] per Hamill J).
	
	
	Equally I do not understand Brooks to be stating that “age, lack of criminal antecedents, ties to the community and strong family support” could never amount to showing cause, only that they did not amount to cause in that case. Again if Brookes did state that then I disagree for the same reason. Each case must turn on its own circumstances. A test posited in terms as to whether detention is “justified” or not necessarily defies any judicial attempt to circumscribe the circumstances in which it can be met.
	
	
	It is clear that the relative strength of the Crown case is relevant to whether cause has been shown but it is not determinative (JM at [41]). In this case and notwithstanding the strength and seriousness of the Crown case I considered that Mr Mawad had shown cause. The evidence as to the particular vulnerability of his family in his absence was compelling.
	


Unacceptable risk


	
	Next it must be considered whether the DPP has demonstrated the existence of an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	First, the Director contended that there was an unacceptable risk that Mr Mawad would fail to appear. I do not accept that is the case. His family ties to Sydney are deep. There is no reason to doubt his attachment to his young family. If he absconded he would leave his wife homeless. While there exists a residual bail risk that he might fail to appear, the conditions imposed by Hamill J certainly reduced it to below an unacceptable level.
	
	
	Second, the Director contended that his release represented a risk to the victims of the robbery and *** ***. Given that the victims of the robbery are not able to identify him then any risk to them does not reach a level that is unacceptable. It is difficult to conceive of anything that could be gained by intimidating or harming them. The position of *** *** is more troubling. There is material suggesting that threats have been made to *** *** and he has been harassed. As stated by the police officer in the extract at [32] he apparently lives close to Mr Mawad. The difficulty is that it seems unlikely that the release of Mr Mawad would lead to any heightened risk to *** ***. Assuming in favour of the Director that Mr Mawad has the level of involvement in organised criminal activity that is alleged, then the threat to *** *** exists regardless of whether Mr Mawad is released or not. While there is a bail concern in relation to *** *** I do not consider that there is an unacceptable risk to his safety that would arise from the release of Mr Mawad.
	
	
	Third, the Director contended that Mr Mawad poses a risk of committing further offences. Unfortunately for Mr Mawad it is at this point that the nature of the alleged offending and the strength of the DPP’s case coalesce to establish an unacceptable risk. In the case of persons who engage in organised violent crime of the kind of which Mr Mawad is accused, the nature of the offending is such as to create an appreciable risk that they will either directly participate in or at least facilitate the commission of similar offences. The ready access to weapons revealed by such offending heightens the risk they pose. The finding that the case against Mr Mawad is strong engages those concerns. The position is made worse by the fact he was on bail on 22 April 2014. The result is the risk of re-offending rises to a level that is unacceptable, even allowing for the effect of the strict bail conditions that were imposed. For that reason I agreed that bail should be refused.
	


Other matters


	
	For the sake of completeness I express my disquiet about the structure of the Bail Act 2013 in allowing de novo reviews in this Court of bail decision made by the Supreme Court. This is a court of appeal not a court at first instance. Yet it must conduct a fresh review even though the question of bail will ordinarily have already been considered by at least two levels of the judicial system. By allowing de novo reviews the Bail Act 2013 facilitates the making of more interlocutory applications which serves to fragment the criminal process, potentially delaying trials. It does so in a manner that diverts this court from its task of hearing appeals from convictions and sentences. It is also a process that generally advantages the Director in that in most cases he has superior resources than that available to an accused person. Thus the Director has a greater capacity to litigate and re-litigate the issue of whether bail should be granted.
	
	
	For the benefit of the parties I indicate that this judgment will be published on Caselaw. If the parties consider that the interests of justice warrant it being removed at some point, for example because a trial is proximate, then they should notify the Court accordingly.

2767555,Yucebasoglu v R [2015] NSWCCA 226,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Fagan J.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence passed on him in the District Court at Parramatta on 11 April 2014 for the offence of causing damage by fire to property with the intention thereby to cause bodily injury to another person, contrary to s 196(1)(b), Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence was committed on 1 November 2012 when the offender doused the front verandah of a weatherboard dwelling house at Auburn with petrol and ignited it. The house was at the time occupied by four people, a husband and wife and their two children.
	
	
	The sentence proceedings followed a plea of guilty. The maximum penalty under s 196(1)(b) is 14 years. There is no standard non-parole period. After allowing a discount of 15% for the plea of guilty and a further 10% for some assistance to authorities which the Appellant had provided, the learned sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 5 years 3 months imprisonment. This comprised a non-parole period of 3 years 11 months and 7 days with the balance of the term being 1 year 3 months and 24 days. The ratio of the balance period to the non-parole period conformed to s 44(2), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The Applicant had been in custody from his arrest on 3 November 2012. The non-parole period was ordered to commence from that date.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	



	
	His Honour erred in finding that the Applicant’s mental illness did not reduce the Applicant’s moral culpability.
	
	
	The sentence was manifestly excessive.
	


Circumstances of the offence


	
	The property to which the Applicant set fire was a single story home at 56 Helena Street, Auburn. A short pathway from the street led to the front door which was located on a verandah across the front of the house. The occupants at the time of the offence were a Mr Nazimi Zabun, his wife and two of their three children. The offence occurred at 3:00am when Mrs Zabun and the two children were asleep in a main front bedroom and Mr Zabun was in an adjacent room.
	
	
	The Applicant walked onto the property through the front gate carrying a bag which contained a large plastic container filled with flammable liquid. From a subsequent investigation of the fire scene it appears that this was petrol. The Applicant poured the contents of the container over the floor of the verandah and over the wall, door and window of the front of the house. He also poured petrol onto a wooden table and chairs on the verandah. The Applicant then stepped down onto the adjacent pathway and used a cigarette lighter to ignite the accelerant.
	
	
	The verandah area was immediately engulfed in flames. Combustion was so rapid as to create a virtual explosion. The Applicant ran from the scene having suffered burns himself. His left hand and forearm, right ankle and foot and part of his waist were burned – a total of between 6% and 9% of his body surface area. Skin grafts were later required.
	
	
	One of the children was the first of the occupants to become aware of the fire. She screamed and woke her mother, father and younger brother. They were unable to exit through the front of the house but fortunately there was a back door through which they escaped. Neighbours applied a garden hose. Emergency services were called and the fire was extinguished. None of the occupants of the house suffered any injury as a result of the fire. The extent of the property damage and the cost of reinstatement were not the subject of any evidence or finding.
	
	
	The detail of the manner in which the Applicant carried out the offence is known because his actions were captured on a closed circuit television system installed at the house. Police officers and Mr Zabun were able to identify the Applicant on recorded footage from the security camera. When spoken to by police he was asked about his burn injuries, which were evident. He asserted that these had been sustained during a barbecue which he said had occurred some days earlier.
	
	
	At the time of the offence the Applicant lived in a unit at 95 Station Road, about 1.8 kilometres away. Mr Zabun informed police that he had been involved in an ongoing dispute with the Applicant prior to the arson. Because Mr Zabun died prior to the sentence proceedings in the District Court, from causes unrelated to the fire, there was no evidence from him as to the duration, origin or other details of the dispute.
	
	
	The Applicant was examined by Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, in about May 2013. He asserted to Dr Furst that his niece, Selin, had been caught at school with Xanax (an anti-anxiety medication with sedative properties) and that she had said she bought this product from Mr Zabun. The Applicant told the psychiatrist that five or six days before setting fire to the house he had had an argument with Mr Zabun about the alleged supply of Xanax to the niece and that three days before the offence, at a cafe in Auburn, Mr Zabun had “grabbed a chair and broke it on the back of my head”, requiring twelve stiches at Auburn Hospital. In his report Dr Furst referred to contrary information provided by Mr Zabun to police concerning “some type of altercation [with the Applicant] in the days leading up to the offence in question”. Dr Furst’s understanding was that Mr Zabun claimed it was the Applicant who was selling drugs. His report notes that Xanax was prescribed for the Applicant at the time.
	
	
	His Honour concluded (Remarks on Sentence at p 3):
	


“As it happens, there appears to be no substance to the stated motive of a belief that Mr Zabun was supplying drugs to the offender’s niece or for that matter, to anyone else. That said, it was either this or some other sense of grievance between the two men that occasioned the offender’s actions, rather than any psychotic drive.”


	
	It was sufficient for his Honour’s purposes in determining sentence and for this Court’s purposes on the appeal to proceed upon the basis that the Applicant believed Mr Zabun had acted wrongfully toward him in some respect.
	


Applicant’s psychiatric history


	
	The Applicant’s date of birth is 21 May 1972. He was born in Australia to parents of Turkish origin. He was 40 years old and was living with his mother at the time of the offence. His history of mental illness and use of illegal drugs is summarised chronologically in the following paragraphs.
	
	
	Early 1990s: The onset of the Applicant’s mental illness was in his early 20’s. As he related his history to Dr Furst, his symptoms in those years included him screaming to himself and having “rages”. This was prior to any diagnosis of a mental illness or any treatment with medication. At this time he was also using cannabis on a daily basis. The cannabis use continued right up to the time of his arrest in November 2012, generally about 1g per day.
	
	
	1996: In this year at the age of 24 years the Applicant was first admitted to Cumberland Hospital with apparent psychotic symptoms including “weird thoughts” and “voices” speaking to him and telling him to do things. He was paranoid and depressed. His admission was for three months during which he was treated with antipsychotic medication.
	
	
	1996 to 2006: Between the ages of 24 and 34 the Applicant was admitted to Cumberland Hospital on three or four further occasions. During this period, whilst in custody for various offences (related below) he was treated with antipsychotic medications. Apparent schizophrenia was diagnosed in 2002, at age 30.
	
	
	2006: Prior to the commission of the subject offence, his last admission to hospital was in 2006, aged 34 years. On that occasion he was treated with antipsychotic drugs. He was experiencing paranoid thoughts and auditory hallucinations.
	
	
	2006 to 2012: In this period he was treated (with what frequency is not clear) by a consultant psychiatrist in Westmead. He was prescribed the antipsychotic drug Olanzapine and the anxiolytic Xanax during this time. He was also prescribed Methadone in connection with opiate dependency.
	
	
	Early 2012: The Applicant attended the Auburn Community Mental Health Team in early 2012, experiencing auditory hallucinations and depression. At that time he suffered sleeplessness, loss of appetite and loss of motivation. He reported to Dr Furst that for a period (of unspecified duration) up to the commission of the offence he was taking benzodiazepines (at times daily, at the rate of 2 to 5 pills per day) to induce relaxation. He was also using amphetamines, methylamphetamine (“ice”), cocaine and heroin approximately monthly. The benzodiazepine Xanax was prescribed for the Applicant. It does not appear how his rate of consumption compared with the amounts prescribed.
	
	
	5 November 2012: On this date, within a few days after the offence, he was reviewed by the “Consultation Liaison Psychiatry Team and Drug and Alcohol Team” at Concord Hospital. He told them that he had used heroin on a daily basis from 2000 to 2004 and had been maintained on methadone over more recent years. He exhibited insomnia and high level anxiety which the Concord Hospital medical staff attributed to benzodiazepine withdrawal. He described “low mood over the previous six months” but “minimal voices”. He was diagnosed with opiate dependence and benzodiazepine withdrawal, on a background of schizophrenia and possible depression. Dr Maharaj, a psychiatrist who examined him at this time recorded this:
	


“His thought form was logical and goal directed, with vague ideas about paranoid themes thought not to be of delusional intensity.”


	
	Dr Furst’s diagnosis of his psychiatric status in May 2012, six months after the commission of the offence was:
	


“- schizophrenia, paranoid type

- substance use disorder (opiate, cannabis and benzodiazepine dependence)

- likely personality disorder (antisocial traits).”

Criminal history


	
	The Applicant’s offending commenced in 1991 at age 19. From then he has had frequent convictions across a wide spectrum of unlawful activity: receiving stolen goods, possession and supply of prohibited drugs, driving whilst licence cancelled on numerous occasions, other driving offences including driving in a manner dangerous and driving under the influence of drugs, motor vehicle theft, obtaining financial advantage by deception, stealing, assault, resisting police and robbery in company. The most serious offences, as measured by penalties imposed, have been as follows:
	



	
	1996 (age 24): a series of offences involving stealing a motor vehicle, driving whilst disqualified and driving in a manner dangerous and under the influence of drugs: 6 months imprisonment.
	
	
	1998 (age 25): driving a motor vehicle taken without consent of owner and while disqualified: 16 months imprisonment with 10 months non-parole period.
	
	
	2000 (age 28): driving while disqualified: 9 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 3 months.
	
	
	2005 (age 32): (a) assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company: 21 months with a non-parole period of 15 months; (b) robbery in company: 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months (concurrent).
	



	
	Since 2007 the Applicant has continued to be brought before the courts frequently on charges of supplying prohibited drugs, shoplifting, driving whilst disqualified, driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Over the course of his criminal history, including in the 5 years preceding this offence, he has from time to time been dealt with by way of suspended sentences and bonds, often upon terms that he accept the guidance of a psychiatrist or psychologist, that he take medication as prescribed and that he undertake counselling for drug rehabilitation and educational development. Judging by the ongoing criminal record and the history of substance abuse recounted to Dr Furst, constructive orders of this nature have not achieved their objectives. They have not secured cooperation of the Applicant by way of abstaining from substance abuse and taking medication as prescribed, which would appear to be highly desirable for the optimal management of his psychiatric condition.
	


Conclusions of Dr Furst


	
	Dr Furst noted that the Applicant had fled the scene of the fire and had subsequently given a variety of accounts of what happened. These included him telling police that he burned himself on a barbecue, telling his psychiatrist at Westmead, Dr Maharaj, on 5 November 2012 that he was “sleepwalking … the whole thing was like a mission”. He told Dr Maharaj “there was just a small fire” and denied having had a plan, stating “I can’t explain it”. To Dr Furst on 22 May 2013 he said that he was driven by auditory hallucinations.
	
	
	With reference to these varying accounts Dr Furst opined:
	


“There was a history of dishonesty offences and likely secondary gain by exaggerating the symptoms he may have been experiencing on the night in question. I note he was not thought to be acutely psychotic on reviews by the Drug and Alcohol Team and Psychiatrists at Concord Hospital in the days following his arrest.

In my opinion he was aware of his actions and their wrongfulness at the time in question before the court, notwithstanding his probable underlying mental illness. I did not think that he has the mental illness defence available to him.”


	
	On page 9 of his report, after referring to uncertainty regarding the true nature of the dispute between the Applicant and Mr Zabun, Dr Furst drew the following conclusions:
	


“In any case the conflict between the two parties was probably the main motive behind the alleged actions of the accused when lighting the fire in question, rather than a psychotic drive.

In my opinion the presence of his apparent schizophrenia mitigates the seriousness of his actions, as schizophrenia often leads to impairment of the higher centres in the brain responsible for emotional control, planning and sound judgement.”

Ground 1 – mental illness and moral culpability


	
	At pp 12-13 of the Remarks his Honour referred to authorities which establish that an offender’s mental illness may have the effect of reducing his or her moral culpability and may bear upon whether such considerations as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation should be given less weight in determining an appropriate sentence: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53], [54]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. His Honour also cited Veen v R [No. 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 488 where it was recognised that the sentencing objective of protecting the community (which is now a statutory objective in New South Wales: s 3A(c), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) may point towards a longer sentence for an offender affected by a psychiatric condition, whereas the diminished weight of objectives such as deterrence, retribution and denunciation may point in the opposite direction.
	
	
	Having cited the above authorities as apposite to the case, his Honour concluded:
	


“In the present case, the offender was a person who, whilst having a strong history of mental illness, did know what he was doing and he knew that it was wrong.”

That finding was open to his Honour on the basis of Dr Furst’s evidence quoted at [27] and [28] above.


	
	His Honour then quoted the last of the paragraphs which I have set out from Dr Furst’s report at [28] and held as follows:
	


“So in that respect, Dr Furst’s opinion limits the impact of the mental illness to the exercise of judgment. There is no suggestion, for instance, that the offender was directed to light the fire for delusionary reasons. I do accept Dr Furst’s opinion in particular as to the matter of compromised judgment. I also accept it is more probable than not that the offender was, to some extent, impacted upon in his judgment and self-control by his illness. That said, the effect was not of such a degree as to reduce the offender’s moral culpability for what was a wilful and dangerous act approached with a considerable degree of deliberation and preparation.” (Emphasis added).


	
	These findings were open to his Honour on the basis of Dr Furst’s report. The last of the paragraphs of that report which I have quoted at [28] spoke of the effects of schizophrenia upon centres of the brain “responsible for emotional control, planning and sound judgement” in terms of a generalisation about the disease. The doctor said: “schizophrenia often leads to impairment … etc”. Whilst identifying this commonly seen effect of the illness, the doctor did not purport to have detected that an impairment of “emotional control, planning and sound judgement” had actually occurred in the Applicant to any particular extent. Following upon his recognition that the Applicant’s conflict with Mr Zabun was “probably the main motive behind the alleged actions of the accused when lighting the fire in question, rather than a psychotic drive”, Dr Furst’s opinion that the “apparent schizophrenia mitigates against the seriousness of his actions” is very non-specific and guarded.
	
	
	This guardedness is consistent with Dr Furst’s other conclusions on p 8, quoted at [27] above. Namely, that the Applicant was “not thought to be acutely psychotic” when reviewed by specialists at Concord Hospital in the days following his arrest and that, in Dr Furst’s opinion “he was aware of his actions and their wrongfulness at the time in question”.
	
	
	I consider that this caution in the specialist’s opinion justified the learned sentencing judge in recognising that whether or not the Applicant’s moral culpability was lessened because of the effects of his psychiatric illness was a question of the degree of those effects. His Honour’s acceptance that the Applicant was “to some extent impacted upon in his judgment and self-control by his illness” but that “the effect was not of such a degree as to reduce [his] moral culpability” was a finding reasonably open on the basis of the limited conclusions of Dr Furst as discussed above.
	
	
	I do not consider that the primary judge erred in making the finding which is impugned in Ground 1.
	


Ground 2 – manifestly excessive sentence


	
	Having found that mental illness did not reduce the Applicant’s moral culpability his Honour correctly acted upon that conclusion in determining how much weight and effect he should give to considerations of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. His Honour listed the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and continued as follows:
	


“I find that notwithstanding the offender’s mental illness and its impact in reducing his powers of judgment in particular, each of these concerns [ie the purposes of sentencing] remains with an important part to play in the resolution of the sentencing discretion required. [His Honour referred to the serious and dangerous nature of the offence and to the community’s abhorrence of arson]. There is a strong need to deter both the offender and others from commission of a crime that can be carried out with relative ease and with potential for devastating outcomes. This is related to the protection of the community and does require that the offender be accountable for his actions and be subjected to a degree of denunciation, albeit not as much as would be the case but for the impact of his mental illness.” (Emphasis added).


	
	On a fair reading of this passage taken in the context of the Remarks as a whole, his Honour’s reference to “a strong need to deter both the offender and others” does not indicate that the learned judge was declining altogether to ameliorate the influence of general and specific deterrence on account of the mental illness. Earlier his Honour had quoted from Muldrock v R (supra) at [ 54]:
	


“The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and the needs of the community.”


	
	In view of his Honour’s citation and recognition of that principle, the passage from the Remarks, quoted at [36] above, (particularly the final words, “albeit … etc”) merely indicates that, given Dr Furst’s limited and circumspect conclusions, the high importance of deterrence, retribution and denunciation for the crime of setting fire to a dwelling house occupied by family, in the small hours of the morning, would not be much reduced in this case.
	
	
	In Veen v R [No. 2] (supra) Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 476-477):
	


“The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.”


	
	In the same case Wilson J said (at 487):
	


“The difficulty arises in determining the effect that the element of protection of the community may properly have in arriving at a particular sentence. In my view, it should not have the effect of increasing a sentence beyond the longest sentence that the actual offence charged, when viewed objectively, would justify. In the case of a mentally deranged offender whose release would represent a potential danger to the community, the necessity to protect the community would be likely to outweigh any other considerations personal to the offender which may have led to a reduction in the sentence, with the consequence that the maximum sentence appropriate to the offence would be imposed. What is not permissible, in my opinion, is that the maximum appropriate sentence be increased to some longer sentence solely because of the imperative to protect the community.”


	
	In the present case such reduction in weight for factors of deterrence and denunciation as the learned sentencing judge may have considered appropriate was evidently offset, in his Honour’s assessment, by the increased importance attaching to protection of the community. This consideration clearly assumed importance where the Applicant had a long history of offending, escalating through offences of violence (the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the robbery in company in 2005) to the present very serious event – all on a foundation of ongoing psychiatric illness and misuse of drugs.
	
	
	The gravity of this offence is considerable. The elements necessarily accepted in the Applicant’s plea of guilty include an intention to cause bodily injury to another person. The Applicant told Dr Furst that he had seen Mr Zabun through the window before fetching the petrol and dousing the verandah with it. It is clear that his Honour took as his starting point a total sentence before discount of 7 years. Taking into account the objective seriousness of the crime and all of the Applicant’s subjective factors, his Honour’s adoption of half of the maximum penalty, before discount, was not excessive.
	
	
	The Applicant has made no criticism of his Honour’s allowance of a discount of 25% for the plea and assistance. This resulted in a discounted total sentence of 5 years 3 months which, again, therefore, was not excessive. The non-parole period and additional term by which this total sentence is to be served, as set out at [4], in my opinion should not be disturbed. Ground 2 should be dismissed.
	
	
	I propose the following as the orders of the Court:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		21 August 2015",2015-08-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767560,Jawid v R [2015] NSWDC 358,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a conviction recorded by Magistrate Crompton sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 9 March 2015. The appellant was charged with one offence contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 s 474.15(2). The charge was that between 6.48am and 7am on 20 August 2014 at Pyrmont he did use a carriage service, namely mobile phone number 04[## ### ###], to make threats to shoot the victim Asad Sultan and [to] harm the victim’s family.
	
	
	At one time in 2014 the complainant, Mr Sultan, and the appellant, Mr Jawid, resided at unit 10, 122 Saunders Street, Pyrmont. The weight of the evidence suggests that in April 2014 the appellant and a long-time friend Mr Haschem Hassanzadeh took a lease of that home unit. They advertised for a flatmate or flatmates. One person who responded to their advertisement was the complainant, Mr Asad Sultan. He moved in. He paid a bond of approximately $300 to Mr Haschem Hassanzadeh to whom I shall refer hereafter as “Haschem”. The appellant and Haschem are from Afghanistan. The appellant described his native language in his evidence as “Persian” by which I assume he meant Farsi. I do not know Haschem’s native language but considering that they had been friends from childhood and were from the same country it may well be that his native language was also Farsi.
	
	
	The complainant, Mr Sultan, is from Pakistan. However, he may have spent some time in the United Kingdom. There was reference to his describing himself as an Englishman and also too having been in Birmingham. The usual language of those who describe themselves as Pakistanis is Urdu. I do not know Mr Sultan’s native language but I assume that it is either Urdu or some other dialect spoken in Pakistan. Farsi is not a normally spoken language in Pakistan.
	
	
	Mr Sultan had agreed to share the home unit in Pyrmont as he was estranged from his wife. According to the weight of the evidence he was required to give two weeks’ notice of his intention to vacate the premises. He appears to have vacated the premises on either the 20th or 22 June 2014. There is a dispute between Mr Sultan and the appellant and Haschem as to whether the complainant, Mr Sultan, gave the requisite notice. However, it is clear that the bond money was not immediately paid to him. Mr Sultan wished to leave the premises at Pyrmont in order to take up residence in Sutherland, seeking to recommence cohabitation with his wife.
	
	
	There was a dispute at the time of Mr Sultan’s leaving the home unit at Pyrmont. It appears that Mr Sultan alleged that he had been assaulted by the appellant and the appellant complained that false accusations were made against him by Mr Sultan, which resulted in the police executing a search warrant at the premises still occupied by the appellant but the execution of that search warrant led to no charges whatever being laid against the appellant. One can see that there was some ill will between the appellant and the complainant.
	
	
	There is no dispute that on the morning of 20 August 2014 certain telephonic communications passed between the appellant and the complainant. These are very helpfully summarised by Mr McKenzie in his written submissions on behalf of the Crown, at the foot of p 3. Those communications were these:
	



	
	At 6.48am on 20 August 2014 a telephone call made by the appellant to the complainant.
	
	
	At 6.53am on the same day a text message sent by the appellant to the complainant a copy of which became exhibit 2 in the Local Court.
	
	
	At 6.55am on the same date a voice message left on the complainant’s voicemail service which was played in the Local Court and which has been replayed before me.
	
	
	At 6.57am on 20 August a second voice message left on the complainant’s voicemail service which was played in the Local Court and which has again been played, to me, today.
	



	
	Despite there being four different communications there was only one charge offered against the appellant. It appears that the Crown proceeded on the basis that the telephone conversation and the text message and the two voice messages were part of one course of conduct.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate accepted that the first voice message satisfied him beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant threatened to shoot the complainant. He was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the second voice message or the text message established beyond reasonable doubt a threat by the appellant to cause serious harm within the meaning of s 474.15 (2). His Honour does not appear, from my reading of his reasons, to have dealt with the telephone conversation itself, the only evidence of which was that given by the complainant. However, his Honour did give himself a direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 11 and having given himself that direction made his finding concerning the second voice message and the text message. One would accept in those circumstance that the same result would apply to the original telephone conversation of 6.48am and therefore that his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in that telephone conversation the appellant threatened to shoot the complainant. The learned Magistrate’s only finding about the text message is a reference to his having listened to it twice so he could hear it clearly, he then said this:
	


“I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the message says, ‘I’ll shoot you, motherfucker, fuck you, motherfucker’.”


	
	There is no dispute that the appellant used foul language in talking with the complainant and in his voice messages and in his text messages. However, he was not charged with an offence of using foul or abusive language, if such an offence exist.
	
	
	I have listened closely to both voice messages. I could not discern in the first voice message the word “shoot”.   I could hear the sound “shoo” which could equally have been written as “shoe”.
	
	
	The first thing to observe is that the appellant is not a native speaker of English. He, as I have earlier indicated, comes from Afghanistan. He came to Australia in 2001. English is not his native language. To further understand the nature of the the interchanges between appellant and the complainant it is necessary to go back, into background facts. It would appear that on 19 August 2014 the complainant approached Haschem concerning the unrepaid bond money. The appellant gave hearsay evidence about that approach which was not subject to any objection. The evidence is this, commencing at p 32 line 32:
	


“Q. If I can take you up to 20 August, all right? Do you recall telephoning Mr Sultan on 20 August?

A. Yea, I did.

Q. Can you tell the Court why you telephoned him on that date?

A. Yes, because like he went to my friend place, the guy that he living with me, Haschem, we live together, he went twice and it’s shop.

Q. Is that Haschem Hassanzadeh?

A. Haschem Hassanzadeh, yeah. He went to shop. Like one time he wasn’t there he was telling his boss that he’s a thief, he’s a liar, something like this and second time like he was serving the customers, he worked in a kebab shop, he’s serving the customers. In front of customers he just like doing the same thing, abusing him, saying things. He was telling him, ‘just go away’ like ‘I’m serving customer”..

Q. Do you know the reason for that argument?

A. Because of his bond, like the bond like the deal with that. Whenever if I ask him move out I have to give you two weeks’ notice, whenever you move out you have to give two weeks’ notice as well.

Q. And what was the issue in respect to his bond?

A. Suddenly he just came there he wants to move out. So told him, like my friend told him, that like our deal is that. He said, “Oh, ask to move out, I don’t have money” or something, “I’m moving with my wife” but we knew that he wasn’t moving with a wife. No notice, nothing, yeah.”


	
	The appellant then went on to point out that the bond was being held by Haschem. The appellant went on on p 32 of the transcript to point out that he had been told, presumably by Haschem, that the complainant had gone to Haschem’s workplace and confronted him in front of customers. That communication being given to the appellant when he came home from work on the morning of 20 August 2014. The appellant said that he worked 12 hour shifts and finished at 6am each morning and then went home. He was working as a security guard in premises at Pyrmont. The trip home would not have taken him long. He then pointed out that he normally took alcohol when he knocked off work. It was on the morning of 20 August after he got home that he found out about the approach made by the complainant to Haschem on the previous evening. That is what promoted the appellant to commence the communications with the complainant.
	
	
	The evidence of the appellant concerning the reason for the interchange is corroborated to an extent by the evidence of Haschem. At p 52 line 27 the solicitor for the appellant, Mr Richardson, sought to ask Haschem about this approach to him but objection was taken by the prosecutor. However, at the foot of p 52, the following evidence commenced:
	


“Q. Do you recall Mr Jawid making any phone calls on the morning of 20 August?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Do you know the reason why Mr Jawid made those phone calls?

A. He was a little bit upset because he came to my workplace and said stuff about me to my colleagues which...

Q. So who do you say came to your workplace?

A. Mr ... Asad.

Q. Mr Sultan?

A. Mr Sultan.

Q. When do you say he came to your workplace?

A. I think it was the day before when he made the call and we met in the morning and we were talking about just how stupid it is that somebody comes - doesn’t talk to me and behind me talks with my colleague ...”

There was then a further objection and no further evidence was adduced from Haschem on this issue. However, that puts the interchange by telephone in context.


	
	The complainant gave evidence at the foot of p 10 and top of p 11 of the telephone conversation that he alleged with the appellant about which I do not need to recite anything further. That was followed by the text message which I do not need to recite in detail but one of the items alleged by the complainant was that the appellant said “I will shoot you”. The appellant’s constant refrain is he did not say the word “shoot” but the word “shoo”.
	
	
	This initial telephone conversation was followed by the text message at 6.53am. The text message is this:
	


   “U fuk with afg u wil c m f p.

   i wil show u.

   U didnt c noting yat m f.

   I wil fuk u soon with u r bin.

   loten son of a bechh”.

With the benefit of evidence given by both the complainant and the appellant this message was supposed to say this:

   “You fuck with Afghan you will see motherfucking Pakistani.

   I will show you.

   You did not see anything yet motherfucker.

   I will fuck you soon with your bin Laden, son of a bitch.”

One will note the use of the word ‘show’ and not the word ‘shoot’ in the text message.


	
	Then follows the first voice message in which I could clearly hear the word “shoo” but not the word “shoot”. There is no use of either of those words in the second voice message.
	
	
	The Local Court and this Court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant threatened to shoot the complainant or a member of the complainant’s family, the crime alleged in the court attendance notice. I cannot be so satisfied.
	
	
	It is common for non-native speakers of a language to mispronounce that language or any language with which they have no great expertise or in which they have no sound learning. By the words “sound learning” I mean established or actual learning. It is clear from the audiotapes, part of which I have heard, that the appellant was capable of pronouncing a final T in an English word. Speakers of some languages find it very difficult to pronounce terminal vowel sounds. For example, in the French language only the terminal vowels R, L, F and C are pronounced. A final T is never pronounced in French unless it is followed by a vowel and is necessary to sound the final T in order to pronounce the vowel that follows.
	
	
	The first part of the cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown prosecutor has been played. It is clear that the appellant was quite capable of pronouncing a final T. For example, p 38 line 19 contains the word ‘went’. On the same page, line 23 contains the word ‘that’. Line 31 contains the word ‘text’, and line 31 contains the word ‘that’. Line 38 contains the words ‘what’ and ‘that’, and line 42 contains the word ‘night’. Line 45 contains the word ‘that’. On p 39, line 11 contains the words ‘first’ and ‘that’ and line 17 contains the word ‘text’.
	
	
	Each of the final Ts in those words has been pronounced. It is clear from the transcript that the appellant was capable of pronouncing both ‘shoot’ and ‘show’ as well as ‘shoo’ or ‘shoe’. I do know from the evidence that the appellant was emotionally agitated in the early hours of 20 August 2014 and had been taking alcohol. He clearly said the word ‘shoe’. Did he mean the word ‘shoot’ or the word ‘show’. He says he meant the word ‘show’. Despite how we spell the word ‘show’ the two letters ‘ow’ represent not a vowel and a consonant but in fact a diphthong, just as the letters ‘oe’ in the word ‘shoe’ represent another diphthong. One can understand that in emotional circumstances and when affected by alcohol the appellant may have used the wrong diphthong and that he did in fact intend to mean ‘show’ rather than ‘shoot’. That intention is clearly shown in the text message which forms part of the whole interaction between the complainant and the appellant on the morning of 20 August 2014.
	
	
	In the circumstances I cannot be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that in the first voice message the appellant intended to say “I will shoot you” which is the version accepted by the learned Magistrate to ground the conviction. For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by Magistrate Crompton sitting in the Downing Centre Local Court on 9 March 2015.
	
	
	I thank Mr McKenzie who appeared for the Crown today for his very lucid and helpful submissions which clearly assisted me greatly in managing the material that was put before me on this appeal.

		09 February 2016",2015-08-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767565,Aparicio v R [2015] NSWDC 370,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of a sentence passed by Magistrate Schurr sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 9 July 2015. The appellant was charged that on 3 April 2015 at Abbotsford he did assault KLG contrary to the provisions of s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. This is the offence of common assault which, when dealt with in the Local Court, can attract a prison sentence of two years and/or a fine of $5,500.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate recorded a conviction and fined the appellant $250. At the time of the offence the appellant was 57 years old. The victim was aged 11. The offence could be described as the appellant’s slapping the victim on the right side of the victim’s face with the appellant’s left hand.
	
	
	The victim’s father and the accused are friends. They are both from Colombia. The victim’s father has no relatives in Australia and the bond between him and the appellant is close. The victim’s father and the victim’s mother live apart. The victim’s father has access to his son on a limited basis. The victim’s father, when he visits Sydney from his usual place of residence in Queensland, often stays with the appellant at his house at Abbotsford. Sometimes the victim stayed at the appellant’s house at Abbotsford with his father.
	
	
	On Maundy Thursday 2 April 2015 after finishing school the victim went to the appellant’s house to be with his father. They stayed there on that night. The plan was that they were also to stay at the appellant’s house on Good Friday night after consuming a meal at the Sydney Fish Markets in the evening. During Good Friday the appellant, the victim’s father and the victim left the house to walk the appellant’s dogs. They went to a park. The victim was walking behind the appellant and his father seeking to play with his iPod, which apparently was malfunctioning and caused the victim to become quite upset. Both the victim’s father and the appellant argued with the victim that he ought not get upset, that he ought not cry because crying was feminine behaviour which was not regarded as the done thing for males from Colombia. The victim became more upset and during the interaction between the three the appellant, slapped the victim on the right cheek. The victim became further upset, sought to leave the company of the appellant, and his father, and appealed on the telephone to his mother. The victim’s time spent with his father was curtailed when the victim’s mother came to collect him. The facts suggest that there may have been some manipulation by the victim of his parents to achieve his own ends.
	
	
	The matter was not reported to the police until Saturday 11 April 2015, over a week later, and the police did not speak to the victim’s father until Anzac Day 2015 and that lead to the appellant’s being charged by a court attendance notice first returnable on 9 July 2015. On that day the appellant pleaded guilty and the learned Magistrate imposed the penalty to which I have referred.
	
	
	The appellant came to Australia in 1990. He had met in San Francisco Dr Sophie Bernard whom he followed back to Australia and they married. They have two children of their own, both of whom are now adults, a daughter aged 23 and a son aged 20. Dr Bernard is a well-known general practitioner and a Master of Orthopaedics who runs a large group general practice in Five Dock. A reference from Dr Bernard is before me and attests to the appellant’s being not only a man of good character but an attentive and thoughtful father to both their children and to others Dr Bernard has not known her husband over the last 25 years to have been violent towards anyone. The appellant’s own son has been relatively recently diagnosed with a serious psychiatric illness which calls for his attention to his own son.
	
	
	Not only does the evidence of Dr Bernard establish that this incident was completely out of character, so does a reference from Dr Yale Cohen of Lindfield, another medical practitioner who has known the appellant since 1990 and also Mr John Rupert Lyon‑Bowes Bernard, Dr Bernard’s father who resides with the appellant and Dr Bernard, and is an Emeritus Associate Professor of Linguistics at Macquarie University. There is also a reference to much the same effect from Ms Maria Cassanita, a Justice of the Peace, who has known the appellant for over 15 years, whose son was a friend of the appellant’s son and who attests to the appellant’s helping train junior soccer players in the Abbotsford community.
	
	
	The reason for this offence can be assigned to the appellant’s medical condition. Perhaps in 2014 or earlier the appellant was involved in a work accident suffering a severe injury to his cervical spine. He underwent a posterior fusion as C1-C2 on 12 September 2014. More recently he has noticed the onset of low back pain, since approximately May 2015. The appellant has L4-5 spondylolisthesis and lumbar canal stenosis.
	
	
	The appellant and his wife are well known to Dr Peter Klug, a well-known forensic psychiatrist who regularly appears before me in the Court’s civil jurisdiction. Dr Klug provided the appellant with a reference. He confirms that he has known the appellant for over 20 years and describes the event as completely out of character. His reference continues thus:
	


“He has, however, been under considerable stress by virtue of substantial problems with his general health. He suffers from an auto‑immune condition that effects both his gastro‑intestinal tract (colitis) and his spine. Recently he had a major operation on his cervical spine (neck) and he is appropriately on analgesic medication. The operation was of limited use and he continues to experience chronic neuropathic pain.

I can only imagine that if he had been irritable and emotionally over‑reactive that being in pain is the likely cause. It is well known that chronic pain has a high association with significant alterations in mood. Also, I believe that his medication regime might have played a role in the situation. He has been on medication, Lyrica [pregabalin] which is prescribed for the treatment of neuropathic pain. This drug, with which I am familiar, can be associated with various side effects including, significant alterations in mood, diminished concentration and confusion. This in turn might lead to uncharacteristic behaviour, or outburst, especially if the person’s pain is still not well controlled.”

The appellant’s experience of pain from his cervical spine for which he was being medicated explains this incident which I accept was completely out of character.


	
	The appellant has been in this country for 25 years and has no criminal record whatever, and as far as I know has no criminal record in his native land. The appellant seeks the benefit of s 10 and in my view this is an appropriate case in which to provide the relief sought.
	
	
	For those reasons I allow the appeal. The conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Local Court at Burwood on 9 July 2013 are set aside.
	
	
	Alvaro Pio Reyes Aparicio, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without proceeding to a conviction but having regard to your good character and health I am satisfied that it is expedient to release you on a good behaviour bond. I order that you be released on a good behaviour bond for a period of six months from today. Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	



	
	you are to appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond;
	
	
	you are to be of good behaviour;
	
	
	you are to reside at [XX XX XX]; or.
	
	
	you are to advise the Registrar of this Court by prepaid Registered Post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond.

		23 February 2016",2015-08-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767567,English v R [2015] NSWDC 374,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The only issue in this appeal is the quantum of the compensation which was ordered to be paid by Magistrate George sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 13 March 2015. The notice of appeal clearly states this:
	


“I am appealing in the quantum sum of the financial advantage obtained as found by Magistrate George”.


	
	In the course of submissions the learned Magistrate said on 22 January 2015 at p 47 commencing at line 42 this:
	


“...I don’t think his case is going to get any better and I don’t like to hear it, but I certainly think that $12,000. The most essential part of all of this is that the arrangement has come to an end thanks to the police intervention, and that this man can hopefully get on with his life, such as it is. I assume he is still employed by the council but, as I say, I couldn’t properly make a finding beyond the $12,000.”


	
	The person to whom the Magistrate was then referring was the complainant, [PM].
	
	
	The police had estimated that the amount of money obtained from [PM] by deception was $72,800. The victim himself assessed the sum of $50,000 but that was just a round figure and the complainant who suffered from an intellectual disability was clearly unable to provide any firm basis to justify his assessment of the moneys which had been obtained from him. The $12,000 to which the learned Magistrate was referring was a concession made by the appellant through his solicitor before the learned Magistrate, based on what the appellant himself had admitted when he gave an interview to the police which was electronically recorded.
	
	
	When the matter went back before the learned Magistrate on 13 March 2015 the Magistrate said this:
	


“A police estimate of $72,000 I do not believe is provable to the criminal standard. Mr Martin’s estimate of $50,000, as I say, is probably because he thinks $50,000 sounds like a lot of money. You are prepared to acknowledge $10,000.

In my view, on the balance of probabilities, $50,000 is closer to the mark; beyond reasonable doubt, $30,000 is a figure that you should pay.”


	
	No attempt was made by the Crown to establish the actual amount of money that the appellant received by means of deception from the complainant. The complainant’s banking records were not put before the Court. The period of time over which the moneys were obtained was a matter of conjecture. It was anywhere between nine months and four years, perhaps more. It was posited on the pretence made by the appellant that the complainant had broken a car seat in a four-wheel drive vehicle whose colour the complainant was unable to recollect. It was later identified as being grey in colour. Evidence from Roads and Maritime Services indicated that the appellant’s wife owned between 10 September 2010 and 16 September 2013 a silver Mazda panel van with windows, and between 31 May 2010 and 6 July 2009 a silver Ford Falcon sedan, and prior to that a white Holden Astra sedan. None of the vehicles to which the appellant had access fit within the description given by the complainant.
	
	
	The actual amount actually obtained by the appellant has not been proved on the balance of probabilities, let alone beyond reasonable doubt. The most compensation that the appellant could be ordered to be paid was the amount of $12,000 which was conceded by his solicitor before the learned Magistrate based on concessions made by the appellant himself in his ERISP and, as the Magistrate rightly said on 22 January 2015, ‘anything beyond that was a matter of conjecture’.
	
	
	For those reasons I set aside the order for compensation made by Magistrate George sitting in Burwood Local Court on 13 March 2015. In lieu thereof, I order the appellant to pay compensation to [PM] in the sum of $12,000.
	
	
	Any other orders sought?
	
	
	NAIVIDI: No, your Honour.
	
	
	FUNG: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

		01 March 2016",2015-08-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767588,RP v R [2015] NSWCCA 215,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J:   I have had the advantage of considering, in draft, the judgments of Davies J and Hamill J. I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Davies J.
	
	
	I wish to make some short comments concerning the conviction appeal on count 3, as to which their Honours have reached different conclusions.
	
	
	Both Davies J and Hamill J approach the issue upon the basis that the finding on doli incapax concerning count 2 has some bearing with respect to count 3 (see [78], [145], [160]). I agree with this approach.
	
	
	It falls to the Crown to rebut the presumption of doli incapax to the criminal standard on each count. However, the context in which the issue arises is important. Where, as here, there are several counts and the presumption is rebutted on an earlier count (count 2), this finding may be taken into account where a similar offence is alleged to have occurred weeks later (count 3).
	
	
	This is not to apply some automatic consequence, the approach accepted in the District Court. Rather, it acknowledges that the doli incapax issue will be considered in the context of the developing understanding of a child which takes into account the child's previous acts, knowledge and experiences (such as in this case, count 2).
	
	
	The finding on count 2 means that the Applicant was aware that what he did on that occasion was seriously wrong. A few weeks later (see [28] cf [157] [160]):
	


(a)   the Applicant asked the Complainant to come into a room after their father had departed the premises;

(b)   the Applicant took his own pants down to get his penis out;

(c)   on seeing this, the Complainant ran towards the door, but the Applicant stopped him;

(d)   the Complainant called for his sister (who was outside), but the Applicant grabbed him and put him face down on the floor;

(e)   the Applicant pulled the Complainant's pants down and commenced to have penile/anal intercourse with him for what was said to be two to three minutes;

(f)   the Applicant stopped when the boys heard their father returning on a motor bike.


	
	Count 3 involved not only the conduct giving rise to the offence, but the clear manifestation to the Applicant, by his attempted flight, that the Complainant did not want to participate in these acts. The Applicant took hold of the Complainant and put him face down on the floor.
	
	
	Although some features present in count 2 are not present in count 3, the circumstances attending the Applicant's act, and the manner in which it was done, establish that the Applicant was aware, as with count 2, that what he did was seriously wrong.
	
	
	For these reasons, together with those expressed by Davies J, I agree with his Honour concerning the resolution of the conviction appeal on Count 3.   
	
	
	DAVIES J:   The Applicant stood trial at Wagga Wagga District Court on 27 August 2014 on an indictment containing four counts of sexual assault alleged to have been committed upon his younger half-brother TP from October 2004 to July 2007 as follows:
	


(1)   Aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) Crimes Act 1900    (NSW). The maximum penalty is ten years’ imprisonment;

(2)   Sexual intercourse with a child under ten years, namely six or seven    years, contrary to s 66A(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum    penalty is 25 years’ imprisonment;

(3)   Sexual intercourse with a child under ten years, namely six or seven    years;

(4)   Aggravated indecent assault.


	
	The Applicant pleaded not guilty to all counts on the indictment. The trial proceeded by way of judge alone (by consent of both parties) before his Honour Judge Letherbarrow. The sole issue at trial was that of doli incapax. The Applicant was aged between 11 years 6 months and 12 years 3 months at the time of the offending.
	
	
	A verdict of acquittal was directed for count 1.
	
	
	In a judgment delivered on 28 August 2014 the Trial Judge found that the Crown had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax for counts 2, 3 and 4 and he found the Applicant guilty in respect of those counts.
	
	
	On 5 December 2014 his Honour sentenced the Applicant as follows:
	


Count 3:   Imprisonment for two years commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring 4 December 2016 with a non-parole period of eight months commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring on 4 August 2015;

Count 4:   Imprisonment for a fixed term of three months commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring on 4 March 2015.

Count 2:   Imprisonment for two years and three months commencing 5 February 2015 and expiring 4 May 2017 with a non-parole period of nine months commencing 5 February 2015 and expiring on 4 November 2015.


	
	The overall sentence was two years and five months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring 4 November 2015.
	


The procedure at the trial


	
	As noted the Applicant elected to be tried by a judge alone. The Crown consented to that course, the judge was satisfied that the Applicant had received legal advice and understood the consequences of that election and his Honour therefore granted leave.
	
	
	The trial proceeded with the tender of documents. No oral evidence was called. The Complainant’s evidence was unchallenged. The evidence consisted of the following:
	


(a)   A DVD and an edited transcript of the Complainant’s interview with the    police on 4 September 2013;

(b)   An edited statement from the Applicant’s mother;

(c)   An edited statement from the Applicant’s sister (in respect of count 4    only);

(d)   Psychologist’s report by Mr Peter Champion dated 1 February 2012;    and

(e)   A Job Capacity Assessment Report dated 6 October 2010.


	
	At the close of the Crown case the Trial Judge acceded to a submission made on behalf of the Applicant that there was no case to answer in relation to count 1. His Honour entered an acquittal in relation to that count. His Honour also determined, consistently with that acquittal, that the statement of the Applicant’s mother ([17](b) above) could no longer be relied upon for the later counts.
	
	
	It was accepted by counsel appearing for the Applicant at the trial that if the Trial Judge found that the presumption of doli incapax had been rebutted beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown in relation to count 2, this would mean that such presumption had also been rebutted beyond reasonable doubt in relation to counts 3 and 4 as it was accepted that they occurred later in time.
	
	
	The Trial Judge noted that the only issue for determination, as agreed between the Crown and those appearing for the Applicant, was one of doli incapax. The Applicant did not argue that the other elements of the three offences in counts 2, 3 and 4 had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence tendered by the Crown and which was admitted without objection and without challenge.
	
	
	The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


Conviction

Ground 1:   The verdict on count 2 is unreasonable in that the Trial Judge erred in finding that he was satisfied that the evidence of circumstances surrounding the commission of count 2 established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and that no other rational inference arose.

Ground 2:   The verdicts in counts 3 and 4 are also unreasonable.

Ground 3:   The Trial Judge erred in finding that ""as a matter of logic"" the accused must be guilty of counts 3 and 4.

Sentence

Ground 4:   The Trial Judge erred in finding that the Applicant occupied a position of trust with respect to the Complainant and did so in circumstances where he failed to accord procedural fairness to the Applicant.

Ground 5:   The Trial Judge erred in failing to take into account s 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) or alternatively the willingness of the Applicant to facilitate the course of justice.

Ground 6:   The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Factual circumstances of the offending


	
	There was some doubt about exactly when each of the offences occurred. It was common ground, and his Honour accepted, that he should find that each offence took place at the earliest date averred. Accordingly, for counts 2 and 3, the offending occurred when the Applicant was approximately 11 years 6 months, with count 4 occurring when he was approximately 12 years 3 months old. On the same basis the Complainant was aged approximately 6 years 9 months at the time of counts 2 and 3, and 7 years 5 months at the time of count 4.
	
	
	By reason of the approach adopted by the Trial Judge with the agreement of counsel, it was only necessary for his Honour to make factual findings in relation to count 2. His Honour found the following facts.
	


Count 2


	
	The Applicant was at home with the Complainant and two of their other siblings. The Applicant, who was the eldest, had been left in charge of them as their father was at work and their father’s girlfriend C was at the shops. When the Applicant let the Complainant “play with his stuff”, a fight broke out between them, and the Applicant locked the Complainant in a room which caused the Complainant to demand to be let out. The Applicant then let himself into the room and said to the Complainant that if “you want to come out, you gotta let me do this to ya …”. The Applicant then pulled his pants down and put a condom on his penis at which stage the Complainant “kept saying ‘no, [RP], no’…”.
	
	
	The Applicant then grabbed the Complainant and “threw” him on a bed and then pulled the Complainant’s pants including his underpants down. He then inserted his penis into the Complainant’s anus and put his hand on or around the Complainant’s mouth whilst having intercourse with him. The Complainant said that this hurt and he was “crying” and that he “just kept on trying to tell [the Applicant] to stop but he had his hand up over me mouth and wouldn’t stop…”
	
	
	The Complainant said that the act of intercourse went for “a long time, it felt like a long time” and did not cease until he heard C calling out for help to get the groceries out of the car, at which point the Applicant withdrew his penis. He commenced to put his clothes on during which time he said to the Complainant “don’t say nothing”.
	
	
	In relation to counts 3 and 4, the following summary is taken from the Trial Judge’s Remarks on Sentence.
	


Count 3


	
	The events which gave rise to count 3 occurred a few weeks after count 2 at the place of work of the Applicant’s and the Complainant’s father, GP. That place of work was the treatment works at Wagga Wagga.
	
	
	GP took the Complainant, the Applicant and his daughter K to his place of work but he left them alone whilst he went to check some ponds and valves. This ordinarily took about one hour.
	
	
	After GP left, the Applicant asked the Complainant to come into an office where there was a pile of workmen’s clothes on the floor. Whilst in the office the Applicant took his pants down so he could “get his penis out”. On seeing this, the Complainant ran towards the door but the Applicant stopped him. The Complainant also called out for K but the Applicant grabbed him and put him on the floor face down on the pile of clothes.
	
	
	The Applicant then pulled the Complainant’s pants down and commenced to have penile/anal intercourse with him which he said continued for two to three minutes. It stopped when he heard their father returning on a motor bike.
	


Count 4


	
	These events occurred after GP had moved to a house at Karingal with his girlfriend C, probably a few months after the events that gave rise to count 3.
	
	
	On this occasion the Complainant was watching a motor bike DVD with the Applicant whilst their father was out of the room. The Applicant put his hand on the Complainant’s penis on the outside of his clothing and rubbed it for approximately five minutes. The Complainant then said that he was “starting to get sick of this” and the Applicant stopped.
	


Legal principles


	
	The principles are for the most part conveniently summarised in a judgment of Hodgson JA (with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed) in BP v Regina, SW v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 172:
	


[27]   The common law concerning the criminal responsibility of children has been modified in New South Wales by s.5 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (which provides for a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 years can be guilty of an offence), but not otherwise. Accordingly, as regards a child between 10 and 14 years, there remains a presumption that such a child is doli incapax, that is incapable of committing a crime because of lack of understanding of the difference between right and wrong, and consequential lack of mens rea. It is clear that when a child between 10 and 14 years is accused of a crime, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only that the child did the act charged, accompanied by the necessary mental element, but also that, when doing it, he or she knew it was seriously wrong, as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief: The Queen v. M (1977) 16 SASR 589; C v. DPP [1996] 1 AC 1 at 38; R v. CRH, NSWCCA, 18/12/96; R v. ALH (2003) 6 VR 276.

[28]   The child must know that the act is seriously wrong as a matter of morality, or according to the ordinary principles of reasonable persons, not that it is a crime or contrary to law: Stapleton v. The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, The Queen v. M.

[29]   It has been said that evidence to prove the child’s guilty knowledge must not be the mere proof of doing the act charged, however horrifying or obviously wrong the act may be: C v. DPP at 38. This was said in CRH to represent the common law of Australia; but it was strongly disapproved by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v. ALH at [20] and [85]-[86]. However, on either view, the circumstances of the offence, such as concern to avoid detection, may be some evidence of knowledge; although, if the concern is consistent with the child thinking that the act is merely naughty, this will carry little weight.

[30]   It is not necessary to resolve this conflict in this case, because there was evidence in addition to the mere doing of the acts charged. However, I would say that, even if the view expressed in C v. DPP and CRH is correct, there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence. For example, in the present case, assuming the jury accepted LD’s evidence that she was crying and screaming and struggling and asking BP to stop, these would in my opinion be factors that could support the inference that BP knew that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being and as such was seriously wrong. That evidence, coupled with the evidence that BP asked SW to stop LD screaming, that BP continued what he was doing after LD said she would tell the police, and the statement of Ms. Dockrill, was in my opinion plainly sufficient to base a finding by the jury, beyond reasonable doubt, that BP had sufficient understanding of the wrongness of his conduct.


	
	As paragraph [29] of BP makes clear, the act charged is not without some relevance in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted. There must, however, be more than proof of the act charged.
	
	
	In C (A Minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions [1996] AC 1 Lord Lowry (with whom the other Lords agreed) said at 39:
	


The cases seem to show, logically enough, that the older the defendant is and the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge. The surrounding circumstances are of course relevant and what the defendant said or did before or after the act may go to prove his guilty mind. (emphasis added)


	
	In R v CRH (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 December 1996, unrep) Newman J (with whom Smart and Hidden JJ agreed said):
	


In short, it is my view that such Australian authority as exists is consistent with the law as expressed by Lord Lowry in C. This is the law of Australia.


	
	The passage from C was approved and followed Hoeben CJ at CL in RH v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 520 at [12]-[16].
	


Grounds 1 and 2:   Unreasonable verdicts


	
	This ground raises a significant matter for consideration, namely, how this Court should go about dealing with a ground relating to an unreasonable verdict in a judge alone trial. The matter is highlighted particularly in the present appeal because, not only was the trial a judge alone trial but it proceeded with no oral evidence. Although a DVD of the Complainant’s evidence was tendered, the Trial Judge was urged only to read the transcript of that interview on the basis that there were no issues of credibility in the trial. It seems that the Trial Judge acceded to that suggestion.
	
	
	Although it is clear that the principles derived from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 and SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 apply also to an appeal following a trial before a judge sitting alone (W v R [2014] NSWCCA 110 at [151]), it has not been clear precisely how this Court performs that task where a judge alone trial has taken place..
	
	
	The High Court has recently considered the matter in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29. The joint judgment of French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ referred at [9] to Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250 where it was said that each of the three limbs of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is capable of application to a judge alone trial. They noted that the Court left open in Fleming the question of whether the Court of Criminal Appeal should intervene under the first or third limb of s 6(1) only if it appears that there is no evidence to support a finding of guilt or the evidence is all one way or where there has been a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In Kurtic v R (1996) 85 A Crim R 57 at 60 Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Grove J and Barr AJ agreed) said, in reliance on M v The Queen, that the test to be applied by this Court on the ground that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory is the same whether the case was heard by a judge alone or with a jury. His Honour went on to say:
	


In such a case, it is the duty of this Court - whether the appeal is from a jury trial or a judge alone trial - to make its own independent assessment of both the sufficiency and the quality of the evidence, in order to see whether the jury (or judge trying the case alone) ought to have a reasonable doubt or whether this Court itself experiences such a doubt or is persuaded that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. It has nevertheless been accepted by this Court that an appeal against conviction from a trial by a judge alone pursuant to s33 of the Criminal Appeal Act is not an appeal by way of rehearing. In the statutory context to which I have referred, this must be so. As the finding of a judge in such a trial is to be given the same effect as a verdict of a jury for all purposes, error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself or herself leading to a miscarriage of justice.


	
	Those principles and others from Kurtic were challenged by the appellant in Fleming. However, the appeal in Fleming was upheld on a ground that concerned a failure of the Trial Judge to comply with the earlier equivalent of s 133(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Whether the approach to the unreasonable verdict ground was correctly stated by Hunt CJ at CL in Kurtic was not determined, as was noted by this Court in Hedges v R [2011] NSWCCA 263 at [48] and as the joint judgment in Filippou has now acknowledged.
	
	
	It is not clear from the passage from Kurtic set out above if Hunt CJ at CL was suggesting that the approach to consideration of whether a verdict was unreasonable in a judge alone trial was confined to the matters enumerated (no evidence to support a finding, evidence all one way, judge misdirecting himself or herself). That appears to be how the High Court in Fleming at [26] understood what his Honour was saying. In any event, later authority in this Court suggested a much broader approach, namely, to ask the question whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the Applicant’s guilt: R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at [3]-[4]; Hedges at [48]; Sabel v R; R v Sabel [2014] NSWCCA 101 at [145]-[148]; see also W v R  at [151].
	
	
	The joint judgment in Filippou said:
	


[11]   Beginning with the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is clear from the terms of s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act that the effect of the latter provision is to equate a judge's finding of guilt to a jury's finding of guilt ""for all purposes"". It follows from the natural and ordinary meaning of the

words of s 133(1) that, for the purposes of an appeal against conviction under

s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act, a judge's finding of guilt is to be treated as if it

were the same as a jury's finding of guilt.

[12]   Authority makes plain that a jury's finding of guilt is not to be disturbed unless it appears that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the evidence is all the one way, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or unless there has been a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice. It follows perforce of s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act that, in the case of an appeal against a judge's finding of guilt, the finding is not to be disturbed under the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act unless there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or the evidence was all the one way, or the judge has so misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law as to result in a miscarriage of justice. It is, however, to be borne steadily in mind that, as with a jury's verdict, so also with the judgment and verdict of a judge alone, in most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which the judge ought to have experienced. To adopt and adapt the language of M v The Queen:

""It is only where a [judge's] advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. ... If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the [judge], there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.""    


	
	The Applicant pointed to what was said in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 to submit that the High Court there suggested that this Court could move beyond its function as a court of error. Accordingly, this Court was in the position where it could draw its own inferences from the evidence and, effectively, substitute those inferences for those drawn by the Trial Judge.
	
	
	It was made clear in Filippou that this was not the correct approach. The joint judgment referred at [44] to [47] to the fact that McClellan CJ at CL in this Court in Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92 identified error in the reasoning of the trial judge but was not persuaded that the trial judge’s conclusion of guilt was erroneous. The joint judgment then said:   
	


[48]   Ex facie, that appears to mean that McClellan CJ at CL did not consider that the errors he identified in the judge's reasoning process were productive of an error in her Honour's conclusion because he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. It is as if his Honour conceived himself to be deciding a civil appeal by way of rehearing under s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). But, if so, that was not a proper way of disposing of the appeal. As was earlier explained, an appeal from judge alone under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act is not an appeal by way of rehearing. Having identified error, the task for the Court of Criminal Appeal is to determine whether the error is productive of a miscarriage of justice. In this context that would have meant determining whether the judge had so erred in fact by preferring Allen's version of events over Mrs Filippou's recollections as to engage either the first or third limbs of s 6(1), or so erred in law by giving ""determinative"" weight to the appellant's post-offence statements as to engage the second limb of s 6(1); and, if so, then assessing whether it was established that the error was not productive of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the sense of depriving the appellant of a chance of acquittal (or, in this case, a chance of a manslaughter verdict) fairly open to him. To dispose of the matter on the basis simply that the Court of Criminal Appeal was not satisfied that the judge's conclusion was erroneous because the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that the appellant had been proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt did not engage with the requirements of the statutory task.


	
	For a verdict to be unreasonable it is not enough that review of the evidence demonstrates that it was possible for the tribunal of fact to reach a different conclusion: Lazaris v R [2014] NSWCCA 163 at [65]. As Hayne J said (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing) in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]:
	


But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard,

or as the joint judgment said in Filippou at [56],

[T]he question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was not whether it was “satisfied that the judge’s account was correct” but whether her Honour’s findings as to the sequence of events were not reasonably open.


	
	I do not consider that Weiss provides support for the Applicant’s submission. Weiss was a case concerned with the application of the proviso in the Victorian equivalent of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The reference to courts of criminal appeal moving beyond functions apt solely to a court of error appears at [23] where the Court’s judgment made reference to the earlier Victorian Act that made “elaborate and detailed provisions” for supplemental powers of the court in criminal appeals. Those provisions have no counterpart in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The relevance of Weiss for the present matter appears at [41]-[43] where the joint judgment was stipulating how the task of considering the proviso was to be undertaken:
	


[41] That task is to be undertaken in the same way an appellate court decides whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the ""natural limitations"" that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. There will be cases, perhaps many cases, where those natural limitations require the appellate court to conclude that it cannot reach the necessary degree of satisfaction. In such a case the proviso would not apply, and apart from some exceptional cases, where a verdict of acquittal might be entered, it would be necessary to order a new trial. But recognising that there will be cases where the proviso does not apply does not exonerate the appellate court from examining the record for itself.

[42] It is neither right nor useful to attempt to lay down absolute rules or singular tests that are to be applied by an appellate court where it examines the record for itself, beyond the three fundamental propositions mentioned earlier. (The appellate court must itself decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; the task is an objective task not materially different from other appellate tasks; the standard of proof is the criminal standard.) It is not right to attempt to formulate other rules or tests in so far as they distract attention from the statutory test. It is not useful to attempt that task because to do so would likely fail to take proper account of the very wide diversity of circumstances in which the proviso falls for consideration.

[43] There are, however, some matters to which particular attention should be drawn. First, the appellate court's task must be undertaken on the whole of the record of the trial including the fact that the jury returned a guilty verdict. The court is not ""to speculate upon probable reconviction and decide according to how the speculation comes out"". But there are cases in which it would be possible to conclude that the error made at trial would, or at least should, have had no significance in determining the verdict that was returned by the trial jury. The fact that the jury did return a guilty verdict cannot be discarded from the appellate court's assessment of the whole record of trial. Secondly, it is necessary always to keep two matters at the forefront of consideration: the accusatorial character of criminal trials such as the present and that the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. (emphasis added, citations omitted)


	
	Given the similarity of approach to the two tasks referred to at the outset of [41] of Weiss, it is reasonable to substitute “the verdict was unreasonable” for “substantial miscarriage of justice” at [42].
	
	
	The significant difference between a trial with a jury and a judge alone trial is that the judge is obliged to make findings of fact and to identify the principles of law applied by the judge: s 133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The reasoning the judge has employed to reach the relevant findings is exposed to examination and analysis in the way an inscrutable jury verdict cannot be. The reasoning will identify what matters have been considered by the judge in making any finding. That enables this Court to determine at least whether there is no or insufficient evidence to support a finding or that the evidence was all one way or has misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law.
	
	
	A determination of whether a child aged between 10 and 14 years is doli incapax is a question of fact for a jury. It must also be acknowledged that determination of the issue is largely one of impression. Logic and reasoning take the matter only so far. There is no bright line between a realisation that an act or particular behaviour is simply naughty or mischievous and a realisation that it is seriously wrong.
	
	
	Despite the submission made by the Applicant based on Weiss ([46] above) the parties accepted that the issue for this Court is not what finding it would make on the evidence led but on whether the Trial Judge’s finding was open to him beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence. Put another way, the question for this Court is whether the Trial Judge must have had a doubt that the Crown had rebutted the presumption that the Applicant was doli incapax, because that was the only matter for his determination.
	
	
	A further issue is then raised about what evidence can be examined by this Court to ascertain if the finding was open. One aspect of the evidence contained in the transcript of the Complainant’s interview concerned the use of a condom by the Applicant in relation to count 2. Both parties submitted that this Court should consider the evidence concerning the use of the condom but they differed on what should be concluded from it. The Applicant’s Senior Counsel submitted that it indicated sexualised behaviour in a way that suggested the Applicant would not have realised he was engaged in wrongdoing. The Crown submitted that its use was some further indication of the Applicant’s preparation for, and knowledge of, wrongdoing. That raises the issue of whether this Court should similarly ignore it on the assumption that, if there had been a jury, the jury also would have been told to ignore that evidence notwithstanding that the Complainant’s answer in his interview made reference to it.
	
	
	The Trial Judge found that the presumption of doli incapax was rebutted for these reasons:
	


It is clear that the accused knew that the Complainant did not want to engage in the relevant act even before it occurred, that he used force upon the Complainant to commit it, and that he put his hand over the Complainant's mouth in an obvious attempt to stop him calling out, no doubt to avoid detection.

During the act the Complainant was also crying and in pain and was trying to tell the accused to stop despite his mouth being covered, but the accused would not and persisted in the act for some time. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the obvious close proximity of the accused to the Complainant during the act that he was aware that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being but nevertheless continued the act for a significant period, further, the accused only ceased the assault when an adult arrived back home at the residence. He then told the Complainant not to say anything. In my view, the accused is obviously extremely concerned that his conduct would be discovered.

These facts establish much more than a belief in the accused that what he was doing was naughty or mischievous. They establish clearly, and in my view beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused knew at the time that the act he was committing upon the Complainant was seriously wrong as understood.


	
	The Applicant challenged each of the matters identified by the Trial Judge. He submitted that knowing that the Complainant did not want to do the act was a feature of all the counts including count 1 where the Trial Judge held there was no prima facie case. It was equally consistent with doing something wrong which fell short of being seriously wrong.
	
	
	In relation to using force on the Complainant, the Applicant submitted that his Honour ought to have had regard to the fact that the Applicant was highly sexualised. Attention was drawn to the fact that Mr Champion, the psychologist, had said there was a possibility that the Applicant was himself a victim of past molestation. As noted earlier, the Applicant submitted that, having regard also to the use of the condom, he may have thought that his behaviour was normal and was thus not gravely or seriously wrong.
	
	
	In addition, the amount of force used by the Applicant could not be determined without at least a viewing of what the Complainant said happened in the DVD. However, the Trial Judge did not view the DVD. The Applicant submitted that it was his state of mind that was significant, and by reason of his own upbringing where he was exposed to violence, it could not be concluded that he would have thought the force used was significant.
	
	
	In relation to putting his hand over the Complainant’s mouth, this was equally consistent with naughtiness or wrong behaviour short of being seriously or gravely wrong, because the Applicant did not want to be caught by his father. A desire to avoid detection was equivocal as to serious wrongdoing.
	
	
	In relation to the Complainant’s crying and experiencing pain, there was no evidence that the Applicant was aware of those matters. Even if he was, they had to be viewed in the context of the violence in which he had been brought up.
	
	
	Finally, there was little evidence of the period of time during which the act continued.
	
	
	It is clear that all of the matters identified by the Trial Judge must be viewed together and not individually. The High Court has discussed in a number of cases the approach to an assessment of circumstantial evidence. In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 Dawson J (with whom Toohey & Gaudron JJ agreed) said at 580:
	


But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.

In Chamberlain [Chamberlain v the Queen [No.2] (1984) 153 CLR 521] Gibbs C.J. and Mason J., at p 535, accept that evidence may have a cumulative effect and point out that it is the duty of the jury to consider all the facts together at the conclusion of the case. They say:

""At the end of the trial the jury must consider all theevidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece ofevidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example,the jury, considering the evidence of one witness byitself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidencemay provide corroboration, and when the jury considersthe evidence as a whole they may decide that the witnessshould be believed. Again, the quality of evidence ofidentification may be poor, but other evidence may supportits correctness; in such a case the jury should not be toldto look at the evidence of each witness 'separately in, soto speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they shouldconsider the accumulation of the evidence"".


	
	In R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 Gummow, Hayne & Crennan JJ said at [48]:
	


Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial case to be considered piecemeal. As Gibbs CJ and Mason J said in Chamberlain [No 2] :

""At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness 'separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment'; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence: cf Weeder v The Queen.

Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider 'the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together': per Lord Cairns, in Belhaven and Stenton Peerage, cited in Reg v Van Beelen; and see Thomas v The Queen and cases there cited.""

And as Dixon CJ said in Plomp:

""All the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which a jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged. There may be many cases where it is extremely dangerous to rely heavily on the existence of a motive, where an unexplained death or disappearance of a person is not otherwise proved to be attributable to the accused; but all such considerations must be dealt with on the facts of the particular case. I cannot think, however, that in a case where the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence any part of the circumstances can be put on one side as relating to motive only and therefore not to be weighed as part of the proofs of what was done."" (emphasis in original, citations omitted)


	
	In a similar way, when assessing the matters the Trial Judge has identified to reach a conclusion on a finding of fact, it is not enough to identify weaknesses in each of those matters. The matters must be viewed as a whole. Then the question must be asked of them as a whole, must the Judge have entertained a doubt about the finding that the Crown had rebutted the presumption?
	
	
	Two of the matters put forward by the Applicant tend to suggest error in failing to consider material matters. They are the failure to view the DVD to see the amount of force used by the Applicant, and the failure to consider Mr Champion’s report. To the extent that error is suggested in those regards I would reject the suggestion. The DVD was not, as in many cases, a record of what actually happened. It appears to have been, at best, a spontaneous demonstration of what the Complainant said the Applicant did in forcing him to the bed. Its probative value was minimal, even accepting that the Complainant was doing his best to demonstrate the appropriate movement. It was unlikely to convey in any real way what force was involved.
	
	
	Reliance on the report of Mr Champion has a number of difficulties. His examination of the Applicant was conducted in January 2012 which was more than six years after the events complained of. It is not easy to determine, for example, what violence the Applicant was exposed to nor how it had affected him at the relevant time. Certainly a reading of paragraph 29 of Mr Champion’s report leads to the strong inference that the violence was not directed towards the Applicant. Moreover, Mr Champion speaks of “possible molestation” without the Applicant having suggested it or made complaint about it, and despite there being no other evidence of it. Contrary to the Applicant’s submission it cannot be concluded on the evidence that he was highly sexualised.
	
	
	The proper approach to the task of assessing whether the finding was unreasonable is likely to mean that evidence expressly disregarded by the Trial Judge should similarly be ignored by this Court. That evidence concerns the Applicant’s use of the condom. A jury would have been told to ignore that evidence. The Judge has expressly done so.
	
	
	The position might have been different if there was evidence that was simply not mentioned by the Judge in his reasons. An enquiry whether on all of the evidence a verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported must entail a consideration of all the evidence that was before the trier of fact. However, where evidence has been expressly disregarded by the Trial Judge this Court would be substituting its own view for that of the Trial Judge by considering evidence that he has effectively excluded.
	
	
	One further matter which should be mentioned is the nature of the act itself. An act of penile/anal intercourse in the circumstances of counts 2 and 3 is “more obviously wrong” than, say, the acts which constituted counts 1 and 4. The act itself was available to be taken into account with the other matters, and strengthens the conclusion to which his Honour came although without expressly referring to it as a consideration.
	
	
	In my opinion the applicant does not establish that there was no or insufficient evidence to support the finding that the presumption of doli incapax had been rebutted nor that the finding was unreasonable. I am satisfied that on the whole of the evidence considered by the Trial Judge it was open to him to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in respect of count 2. I consider that no other rational inference was available from the evidentiary matters identified.
	
	
	The grounds asserting that the verdicts on counts 2 and 3 were unreasonable must be rejected.
	


Ground 3:   Using the finding for count 2 in respect of counts 3 and 4


	
	In his Honour’s judgment, having found that the presumption had been rebutted in respect of count 2, the Trial Judge said:
	


It follows from Ms Mendes' concession and as a matter of logic that the accused must also be guilty of counts 3 and 4 and I accordingly find him guilty of such counts.


	
	The concession made was this (T27/08/14 at p. 14):
	


MENDES:   …The submission is this, that if your Honour found that count 2 was made out beyond reasonable doubt, then it would flow from that decision that verdicts of guilty would be entered with respect to counts 3 and 4.

And then again (T27/08/14 at p. 15):

MENDES:   …If your Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt with respect to count 2 at some later stage, there would be a flow on effect.


	
	The Applicant submitted that the concession should not have been made by counsel at the trial because it is necessary to look at all of the circumstances of the offending in respect of each charge. The Applicant submitted that the acts carried out by the Applicant in relation to count 3 did not demonstrate the same degree of force against the Complainant nor was there evidence of the Complainant crying or crying out. In relation to count 4, the incident involved only the Applicant manipulating the Complainant’s penis through his clothes.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that what took place in relation to count 3 was sufficiently similar to what happened in relation to count 2 with the result that the presumption, having been rebutted for count 2, should remain rebutted for count 3. In relation to count 4 the Crown, while accepting that different acts were involved, submitted that the Applicant was a year older and much closer to being aged 14 years so that the presumption was weaker.
	
	
	Because of the concession made by the Applicant’s counsel at the trial rule 4 applies. In my opinion the matter is of such significance that leave should be granted. At least in relation to count 4, as I will discuss, a miscarriage of justice is established.
	
	
	The enquiry on each count is whether the Applicant knew that the act charged was seriously wrong. In relation to count 3 the act charged was the same act as charged in relation to count 2. Although surrounding circumstances such as the Complainant crying or being forcibly thrown down, or having his mouth covered by the Applicant’s hand all contributed to the conclusion that the presumption was rebutted, the absence of those circumstances in relation to count 3 does not have the effect that the Applicant did not know that the act charged in count 3 was not seriously wrong. Although it is the Applicant’s state of mind which must be examined it could not rationally be inferred that because the act was carried out less forcefully or with less resistance from the Complainant the Applicant could have believed that it was not seriously wrong in the light of what he had done in relation to count 2. The surrounding circumstances in relation to count 2 demonstrated that the Applicant knew that the act charged was seriously wrong. When he committed the same act in relation to count 3 the absence of a number of the accompanying circumstances does not detract from his knowledge that the act itself was seriously wrong.
	
	
	The position with count 4 is completely different. The same act was not involved. There was no direct touching of genitals. The evidence was that there was apparently no resistance from the Complainant until after about five minutes when he said that he was getting sick of what the Applicant was doing. At that point the Applicant stopped. It would not be unreasonable to infer that that the Applicant might have thought that the Complainant consented to what he was doing. That consent was only relevant to the issue of whether the Applicant thought that what he was doing was seriously wrong. It is difficult to see how what had earlier taken place, that is, the acts involved in counts 2 and 3, could throw any light on a conclusion about whether the Applicant thought what he did in respect to count 4 was seriously wrong.
	
	
	It was not open to the Trial Judge to find that the presumption had been rebutted in respect of count 4. The determination of guilt was unreasonable and the verdict should be set aside.
	


Sentence appeal   

Ground 4 - The Trial Judge erred in finding that the Applicant occupied a position of trust with respect to the Complainant


	
	In his Remarks on Sentence the Trial Judge said this:
	


Moving to the objective seriousness of the offending, the Court of Criminal Appeal has identified a number of relevant factors to consider when assessing this question in relation to an offence contrary to s 66A. These are discussed in such cases as R v AJP [2004] NSW CCA 434, MLP v R (2003) 164 A Crim R 93, R v PGM (2008) 174 A Crim R 152, and [Hibberd v R (2009) 194 A Crim R 1]. I will deal with several of these factors now.

…

Sixthly, the relationship between the complainant and the offender is also of some relevance in that, to a degree, the offender was in a position of trust with respect to the complainant, especially in relation to count 2 when he was left in charge of the other children, including the complainant. (emphasis added)


	
	His Honour then determined that both counts 2 and 3 fell within the mid-range of offences of the type with count 2 being the more serious. In respect of count 4 his Honour found that it fell into the low range for offences of the type but not towards the bottom of the range.
	
	
	The only evidence relevant to the issue of the Applicant being in a position of trust was found in this portion of the transcript:
	


Q202.   O.K. So like you just described like the first incident how you said that

he touched you and you were locked in the room. Tell me about the

first time you remember him putting his penis in your arse?

A   That was when dad and that weren't home and he had to watch us.

Q203.   So your dad wasn't home?

A.   No.

Q204.   And neither was his girlfriend?

A.   [C].

Q205.   [C]. And who had to watch you?

A.   [RP] my dad would make [RP] watch us 'cause dad was at work

and [C] was at the shops.   

Q206.   So dad was at work and [C] was at the shops?

A.   Yeah she went to the shop.

Q207.   So who was there on that day?

A.   Just me and [RP], [D] and [K].

Q208.   So you, [RP], [D] and [K], excuse me, [K]?

A.   Yeah.


	
	Contrary to the Applicant’s submission, his Honour did not determine that the Applicant’s position of trust was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Rather, his Honour was examining matters that were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending. Nevertheless, on the basis of the evidence in that portion of the transcript, it was not open to his Honour to conclude that the Applicant was in a position of trust with respect to the Complainant. Although the Crown submitted that the Applicant believed he had authority to send the Complainant to his room as a punishment, that raises the further issue, not explored at the sentencing hearing, of whether the Applicant understood or was capable of understanding what a position of trust might entail in terms of behaviour.
	
	
	There is the further matter that the Crown never put forward any suggestion that the Applicant was in a position of trust. For that reason, and in the absence of his Honour having raised it with counsel for the Applicant, there was a denial of procedural fairness in his Honour making that finding.
	
	
	Moreover, his Honour’s words “especially in relation to count 2” point strongly to the conclusion that his Honour considered that the position of trust obtained also for counts 3 and 4. There was simply no evidence of any sort to justify such a conclusion in relation to counts 3 and 4.
	
	
	In my opinion, this ground is made out.
	


Ground 5:   Failure to take into account the provisions of 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	Section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) relevantly provides:
	


22A Power to reduce penalties for facilitating the administration of justice

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise).


	
	Section 21A(3)(l) lists as a mitigating factor to be taken into account “the degree of pre-trial disclosure by the defence (as provided by s 22A)”.
	
	
	The Applicant relied alternatively on the provisions of s 22A together with s 21A(3)(l) and on a general willingness to facilitate the course of justice by limiting the issues in the case. To the extent that reliance was placed on s 22A it is difficult to see how error can be said to have occurred when his Honour was never asked to impose a lesser penalty by reason of that section.
	
	
	Nor, for that matter, was his Honour asked to take into account the Applicant’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice, by limiting the issues and not requiring the Complainant for cross-examination, outside the auspices of s 22A.
	
	
	In Avery v R [2015] NSWCCA 50 Bellew J (R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreeing) said:
	


[72]   … It is not open for a party to come to this Court and assert error on the part of a sentencing judge based upon a failure to take a particular course which the judge was never asked to take. Generally speaking, a party is bound by the manner in which the case is conducted at first instance: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80] and [82] per Johnson J.


	
	The Crown submitted that it was clear that the course adopted by the Applicant in agreeing not to contest the facts was for the purpose of having counts 1 to 4 severed from counts 5 and 6 which related to offences charged at a time when the Applicant was over the age of 14 years. The Crown submitted that the approach to the trial of counts 1 to 4 was not necessarily for the facilitation of justice but was for the purpose of obtaining the forensic advantage of severing the other counts from the indictment.
	
	
	Simply because it was part at least of the Applicant’s motivation to secure such a forensic advantage cannot mean that justice was not facilitated by the resultant arrangement. What is clear is that the trial proceeded expeditiously and economically, and the Complainant was not required for cross-examination. There were obvious savings of cost and a considerable advantage to the Complainant.
	
	
	During his Remarks on Sentence his Honour first noted that the sole issue at the trial was whether the Crown had rebutted beyond reasonable doubt the principle of doli incapax.  He later said:
	


As mentioned, the sole issue at trial was that of doli incapax. Accordingly, there was no dispute as to the facts surrounding the subject offences as detailed by the complainant in his recorded interview, the DVD and transcript of which were admitted by consent. Further he was not required for cross-examination. In these circumstances, Ms Mendes whilst not conceding such facts, made no submission that they had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and I so found.

It is clear that his Honour had reminded himself of these matters when considering the sentence. Although no specific discount was mentioned it is likely that they were taken into account in the instinctive synthesis.


	
	However, in the absence of any submission made to his Honour in relation to a reduction in sentence whether by dint of the application of s 22A or generally by the facilitation of justice for the way the trial was conducted, I do not consider there is any basis for holding that error has occurred on the part of the Sentencing Judge.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Ground 6:   Sentence manifestly excessive


	
	By reason of the error found in respect of Ground 4, it is necessary to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted after an independent exercise of the sentencing discretion: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [43]. In that way it is not necessary to consider whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
	


Re-sentence


	
	As a result of what was said in Kentwell at [43] there has been some debate concerning how the process there described is to be carried out, particularly in relation to the application of the proviso in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Any differences in the approach to be taken to the sentence originally imposed appear to me to have been removed by the analysis carried out by R A Hulme J in Thammavongsa v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 107 at [16] – [25] and seemingly accepted by Simpson J in the same case at [6]. What that analysis makes clear is that it is not appropriate in undertaking the process referred to in Kentwell at [43] for this Court to conclude merely that the sentence imposed at first instance is within the range of appropriate sentences.
	
	
	In addition to the material before the Trial Judge at the sentencing hearing, the Applicant read on the appeal two affidavits concerning his time in custody. These affidavits, one by the Applicant and one by his solicitor annexing the Applicant’s custodial case-notes, demonstrate the problems the Applicant has had whilst in custody largely as a result of the offences for which he has been sentenced. He has spent a reasonable period of time on protection with all the limitations that this form of custody entails, and he has been assaulted at various times. He is reported as being a good worker who is polite and gets on well with the other inmates.
	
	
	The Trial Judge dealt at length with the reports from three psychologists, Dr Pulman, Dr Ashkar and Mr Champion. All agreed that his intellectual abilities were in the borderline to low average range but with significant variation amongst different cognitive abilities. Dr Pulman thought that he was not suffering from any mental illness at the time of the offending and that there was no evidence of cognitive difficulties or disabilities which were likely to have been contributing factors to his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Dr Ashkar considered that the Applicant had poor emotional regulation and behavioural inhibition skills. He suspected that these matters underlay the Applicant’s behavioural difficulties and sexual offending behaviour. The Trial Judge accepted that the Applicant’s premorbid intellectual functioning and his considerable immaturity at the time of offending meant that the need for general deterrence was diminished.
	
	
	I have read these reports and agree with the Trial Judge’s conclusions concerning the Applicant’s subjective circumstances although, for reasons which follow, general deterrence has some significance.
	
	
	Like the Trial Judge I consider that the offending fell within the mid-range for offences of this type with count 2 being more serious because of the greater degree of force used. The absence of any consideration of the Applicant being in a position of trust does not reduce the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The Juvenile Justice Report that was before the Trial Judge at the sentencing hearing disclosed that the Applicant believed that the events giving rise to the charges did not happen at all. His Honour correctly concluded that this denial showed a lack of remorse.
	
	
	At the time the Applicant was sentenced he had already been sentenced for three other similar offences committed against other siblings. Those offences and other matters suggested that his prospects of rehabilitation were no better than average, as the Trial Judge determined. Personal and general deterrence are important considerations despite the Applicant’s young age at the time of offending and his low level of maturity.
	
	
	It is appropriate to take into account as a factor in mitigation the manner in which the trial was conducted by the Applicant. There was no dispute as to the circumstances of the offending, simply a dispute on whether those matters were sufficient for the presumption to be rebutted. The result was a much shortened trial without the need for cross-examination of the Complainant who was still a minor.
	
	
	There are a limited number of cases that involve similar offending.
	
	
	In AEL v R [2007] NSWCCA 97; (2007) 170 A Crim R 355 the applicant who was said to be aged no more than 13 years and possibly 12 pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. At the time the maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment. There were three further matters of indecent assault upon another child under the age of ten included on a Form 1. The victims in each case were his siblings, his brother aged eight and his sister aged five. He had been re-sentenced on a breach of a bond at first given to him by the Sentencing Judge that involved him entering into a residential program. This Court held that a non-parole period of 18 months with a further term of three years and six months was manifestly excessive. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 13 months with an additional term of a little over 20 months.
	
	
	In Regina v KLH [2004] NSWCCA 312; (2004) 148 A Crim R 515 the applicant was convicted following a trial on three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years. He was aged 13 when the offences were committed and the victim was a boy aged seven years. One of the counts involved penile/anal intercourse and the other two counts involved oral intercourse. He received a total effective sentence of three years non-parole with an additional term of 18 months. This Court held that that was manifestly excessive. It re-sentenced him to a non-parole period of nine months in respect of each of the counts of oral intercourse with an additional term of nine months and to a non-parole period of one year for the anal intercourse. The sentences were to be served concurrently.
	
	
	In Regina v JDB [2005] NSWCCA 102; (2005) 153 A Crim R 164 the applicant pleaded guilty to six offences of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years. He was aged between 13 years 5 months and 14 years 2 months at the time of the offences. The offences involved his half-sister who was aged 8 at the relevant time. Three of the offences involved penile/anal intercourse and three involved penile/vaginal intercourse. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of sentence of two years. This Court held that the sentences were manifestly excessive. He was resentenced to a non-parole period of nine months with an additional term of two years and three months.
	
	
	In BP v R, BP was found guilty of penile/vaginal intercourse with a girl aged 16 years. He was found guilty of digital penetration of the same complainant. SW was found guilty of digital penetration of the same complainant. The Trial Judge sentenced BP for the penile penetration to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of two years. For the digital penetration he was given a three year bond. SW was given a suspended sentence of two years imprisonment. BP was aged 12 at the time of the offences and SW was aged 11. There was no appeal against that sentence.
	
	
	In Regina v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123 the applicant pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years. The victim was nine years old and the applicant was 13 years old, almost 14. The offence involved the forceful insertion of the applicant’s penis into the complainant’s mouth. He was initially sentenced to a non-parole period of twelve months with an additional term of two years. It became necessary on appeal to this Court to resentence the applicant because of an error by the Sentencing Judge in applying s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He was resentenced to a non-parole period of six months with a balance of term of two years and six months.
	
	
	A comparison with those cases highlights only one particular difference with the present Applicant. At the time he was regarded as having committed these offences (an assessment of his age that erred in his favour) he was aged 11 years 7 months at the time of counts 2 and 3 and aged 12 years 3 months at the time of count 4. Whilst it is true that he was found to have been suffering from intellectual difficulties, none of the psychologists discerned any causal link between his difficulties and his offending. Further, in most of the cases referred to, the applicants had emotional or intellectual difficulties or both. Although the number of cases involving children of approximately the Applicant’s age is small in number, the sentences imposed in those cases provide some assistance in reaching a view about what sentence should be imposed in the present case.
	
	
	The Applicant submitted that in the circumstances of the Applicant’s youth and immaturity together with his low intellectual abilities, a s 9 bond was an appropriate sentence. In that regard it was noted that the Applicant had been in custody already since December 2014. if a sentence of imprisonment was imposed that sentence should be suspended for the same reasons.
	
	
	In my opinion, no other sentence than imprisonment is warranted. I accept that the Applicant’s time in custody has been difficult and I do not overlook the assaults and threats made to him. Unfortunately, such occurrences are not uncommon in a custodial environment and particularly for prisoners sentenced for offences such as the ones for which the Applicant has been convicted. Those matters do not justify the suspension of the sentence. The Applicant requires a lengthy period on parole to assist in his rehabilitation. For that reason, and because of the appropriate period of accumulation of the two offences, I find special circumstances.
	
	
	The sentences that I would impose, including the appropriate accumulation, mean that no lesser sentences are warranted than were imposed by the Trial Judge.
	


Conclusion


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal in respect of the conviction appeal.
	
	
	Appeal upheld with respect to count 4.
	
	
	Quash the conviction in respect of count 4 and enter an acquittal.
	
	
	Dismiss the conviction appeal in respect of counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	Leave to appeal in respect of the sentence.
	
	
	Dismiss the sentence appeal.
	



	
	HAMILL J:   I have had the considerable advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Davies J. I gratefully adopt his Honour's careful analysis of the facts and issues which arose in this appeal. His Honour has set out the grounds of appeal and I need not repeat them.
	
	
	I agree with Davies J that it was open to the primary judge to find that the prosecution had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in relation to count 2 and with his conclusion that ground 1 must be rejected.
	
	
	I also agree with Davies J that the verdict in relation to count 4 should be set aside and that a verdict of acquittal should be entered. I agree with his Honour's reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	However, I have come to a different view in relation to the conviction appeal relating to count 3 and in relation to the outcome of the application for leave to appeal against sentence. I have concluded that the appeal in relation to count 3 should be upheld and the conviction quashed. The appeal against sentence should also be upheld and the applicant re-sentenced to a suspended sentence. These are my reasons for those conclusions.
	


Some observations on the law of doli incapax


	
	Davies J has explained the operation of the presumption of doli incapax by reference to the statute and case law. I do not disagree with anything that his Honour has written but refer to some aspects of the law that guide my consideration of the appeal.
	
	
	In New South Wales, it is ""conclusively presumed"" that a child under 10 years of age cannot be guilty of an offence: s 5 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). The common law provides that for children between 10 and 14 years of age there is a presumption of doli incapax (incapable of crime) which may be rebutted by evidence called in the prosecution case: see, for example, R v Gorrie (1919) 83 JP 136, C (A Minor) v DPP [1996] AC 1, Regina v CRH, BP v R, SW v R ; see also the helpful analysis by Matthew Johnston, 'Doli Incapax' (Paper presented at the Legal Aid Children's Legal Service Criminal Law Conference, Sydney, 30 May 2009).
	
	
	The prosecution must establish (beyond reasonable doubt) that the child knew that the act was ""seriously wrong as a matter of morality"": BP v R, SW v R at [28]. In R v Gorrie, Salter J directed the jury that:
	


""[The prosecution] must satisfy the jury that when the boy did this he knew that he was doing what was wrong - not merely what was wrong but what was gravely wrong, seriously wrong.""


	
	The age of the child is an important consideration in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted. Given the conclusive presumption in s 5, it follows that the closer the child is to the age of 10, the more cogent the evidence must be to rebut the presumption. In DK v Rooney & Anor (Supreme Court (NSW), 3 July 1996, unrep), McInerney J said:
	


""...it (the prosecution) must make it appear to the tribunal that the child knew at the relevant time that what he or she was doing was more than merely naughty or mischievous. The standard of proof is the criminal standard. The presumption is irrebuttable, as I have said earlier, if the child has not attained ten years of age. It is also clear that the closer the child comes to that age (i.e. ten) the stronger must be the evidence to rebut the presumption.""


	
	Equally, ""[t]he authorities are clear that the nearer the child in question is to the age of 14, the less strong need the evidence be if the presumption is to be rebutted"": R (a Child) v Whitty (1993) 66 A Crim R 462 (Harper J).
	
	
	In C v DPP Lord Lowry said:
	


""What is required has been variously expressed, as in Blackstone, 'strong and clear beyond all doubt or contradiction', or, Rex v Gorrie 'very clear and complete evidence' or, in B v R (1958) 44 Cr. App. R 1, 3 per Lord Parker CJ 'It has often been put in this way, that … ‘guilty knowledge must be proved in the evidence to that effect must be clear and beyond all possibility of doubt'.""


	
	In many of the cases, a distinction has been drawn between knowledge in the child that the act was seriously or gravely wrong and acts of mere naughtiness or mischief. Lord Lowry thought that this distinction gave context to the phrase ""seriously wrong"" which was otherwise ""conceptually obscure"" and that this view was ""confirmed by the rather loose treatment accorded to the doli incapax doctrine by the textbooks"". I confess that I find the distinction unhelpful and, in jury directions, could give rise to an erroneous process of reasoning whereby a finding that the act was more than naughty or mischievous may lead to a finding that the child knew that what they did was seriously or gravely wrong without proper attention being paid to that question. There is a vast chasm between something that is ""naughty"" or ""mischievous"" and something that is gravely or seriously wrong. The trouble with introducing the comparison is that it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that if something is more than naughty, it must therefore satisfy the test. It does not. The question is a simple one, although one that is difficult in application. The question was well stated by Salter J in R v Gorrie - the child must know ""that he was doing what was wrong not merely what was wrong, but what was gravely wrong, seriously wrong.""
	
	
	However, the issue does not arise for determination here. While he referred to naughtiness and mischief, there is no doubt that the primary judge applied the correct test, at least in respect of counts 1 and 2 and, by inference, counts 3 and 4. No submission to the contrary was made.
	
	
	There is some controversy surrounding the relevance of the seriousness or gravity of the act constituting the offence. The preponderance of authority is reflected in Lord Lowry's statement in C v DPP (at 38):
	


""The second clearly established proposition is that the evidence to prove the Defendant's guilty knowledge, as defined above, must not be the mere proof of the doing of the act charged, however, horrifying or obviously wrong that act may be.""


	
	This approach has been adopted in New South Wales. In DK v Rooney, McInerney J said:
	


""The knowledge is not to be presumed from the mere fact of the commission of the act, but it must be proved aliunde and may be proved inter alia by the circumstances attending the act, the manner in which it was done and the evidence as to the nature and disposition of the child concerned.""


	
	In Victoria, Lord Lowry's approach was questioned in the case of R v ALH [2003] VSCA 129; (2003) 6 VR 276. After referring to the principle as being designed to avoid circular reasoning, Cummings AJA said at [74]:
	


""But proper linear analysis could have regard to the nature and incidents of the acts charged without being circular. What is required is the eschewing of adult value judgments. Adult value judgments should not be attributed to children. If they are not, there is no reason in logic or experience why the proof of the act charged is not capable of proving requisite knowledge. Some acts may be so serious, harmful or wrong as properly to establish requisite knowledge in the child; others may be less obviously serious, harmful or wrong, or may be equivocal, or may be insufficient. I consider that the correct position is that proof of the acts themselves may prove requisite knowledge if those acts establish beyond reasonable doubt that the child knew that the act or acts themselves were seriously wrong.""


	
	Callaway JA agreed, saying at [19]:
	


""It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was doli capax. They were entitled to take into account not only his age but also the acts constituting the offences. It was unnecessary for there to be additional facts so long as the criminal standard was satisfied. The decision of the House of Lords in C v. Director of Public Prosecutions is, with respect, unduly restrictive.""


	
	Batt JA agreed at [24].
	
	
	In BP v R, SW v R Hodgson JA (Adams and Johnson JJ agreeing) noted the observations in R v ALH but said (at [30]) ""it is not necessary to resolve this conflict in this case, because there was evidence in addition to the mere doing of the acts charged."" His Honour went on to say that:
	


""Even if the view expressed in C v DPP and CRH is correct, there should not be a narrow view taken on what are circumstances of the offence that can operate as evidence. For example, in the present case, assuming the jury accepted LD's evidence that she was crying and screaming and struggling and asking BP to stop, these would in my opinion be factors that could support the inference that BP knew that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being and as such was seriously wrong.""


	
	I agree with the observations of Davies J (at [35]) that ""the act charged is not without some relevance in determining whether the presumption has been rebutted"" but that there ""must be more than proof of the act charged"". This agrees with the approach of Lord Lowry in C v DPP that ""the more obviously wrong the act, the easier it will generally be to prove guilty knowledge"".
	


Count 2 and appellate review of an unreasonable verdict in a judge alone


	
	I agree with Davies J that it was open to the trial judge to find that the prosecution had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in respect of count 2. I agree with his Honour's reasons for that conclusion on the facts of this case. The High Court has recently confirmed that, in light of s 133(1) Criminal Procedure Act, the application of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act is the same whether the trial is conducted by jury or by judge alone: Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29 the at [12] (French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ) and [82]-[83] (Gaegler J).
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, a doubt entertained by this Court would almost certainly be a doubt that the Trial Judge ought to have experienced: see M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 495; see also Filippou at [138]. That is because all of the evidence at trial was tendered in documentary form and the Trial Judge enjoyed no advantage in experiencing the atmosphere of the trial or in assessing the witnesses as they gave evidence.
	
	
	I have reviewed the evidence and am not left with a reasonable doubt that the prosecution had, with respect to count 2, rebutted the presumption of doli incapax. In respect of count 2, the Applicant conducted himself in a way that suggested that he was aware that what he was doing was seriously wrong. He covered the Complainant's mouth to stop him from crying out and told the Complainant not to tell. The act of intercourse was accompanied by some force and the Complainant was crying. In spite of the Applicant's submission to the contrary, it is difficult not to infer that the Applicant was aware of the distress he was causing to the Complainant.
	
	
	This is not a case like DK v Rooney where the act of ""homosexual intercourse"" committed by a child of 12 years was held by McInerney J to be insufficient in itself to rebut the presumption. In the present case, the ""circumstances attending the act"" and ""the manner in which it was done"" established that the Applicant was aware that what he did was seriously wrong.
	


Count 3


	
	As a result of a concession by counsel for the Applicant at the trial, the Trial Judge gave no independent assessment to the facts and circumstances of counts 3 and 4. The judgment reflects this. In convicting the Applicant in relation to those counts, all that his Honour said was this:
	


""It follows from [defence counsel's] concession and as a matter of logic that the accused must also be guilty of counts 3 and 4 and I accordingly find him guilty of such counts.""


	
	This approach was erroneous in both fact and law. To understand that conclusion it is necessary to consider the Trial Judge's reasons for concluding that the presumption of doli incapax was rebutted beyond reasonable doubt in respect of count 2. Those reasons were encapsulated in the following passages of the judgment:
	


""In my view, whilst I accept that the accused is and most likely was at the relevant time of very low intelligence and for the purpose of the argument am prepared to assume that this means he possessed a lesser appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct, I am nevertheless satisfied that the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the commission of count 2 as contained in the complainants statement established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong as defined and that no other rational inference arises.

I do not accept [his counsel's] argument that such circumstances raise the reasonable possibility that the accused believed he was only being naughty or mischievous, nor do I accept that they raise any reasonable inference or conclusion inconsistent with the accused being aware at the time that his act was seriously wrong as defined.

It is clear that the accused knew that the complainant did not want to engage in the relevant act even before it occurred, that he used force upon the complainant to commit it, and that he put his hand over the complainant's mouth in an obvious attempt to stop him calling out, no doubt to avoid detection.

During the act the complainant was also crying and in pain and was trying to tell the accused to stop despite his mouth being covered, but the accused would not and persisted in the act for some time. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the obvious close proximity of the accused to the complainant during the act that he was aware that what he was doing was causing great distress to another human being but nevertheless continued the act for a significant period, further, the accused only ceased the assault when an adult arrived back home at the residence. He then told the complainant not to say anything. In my view, the accused was obviously extremely concerned that his conduct would be discovered.

These facts establish much more than a belief in the accused that what he was doing was naughty or mischievous. They establish clearly, and in my view beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused knew at the time that the act he was committing upon the complainant was seriously wrong as understood.

Accordingly, I am satisfied that the presumption in question has been rebutted beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown and I find the accused guilty of count 2.""


	
	Senior Counsel for the Applicant identified correctly the features of the case, outside of the facts of the offence itself, that satisfied his Honour that the presumption was rebutted:
	


(1)   The Applicant knew that the Complainant did not want to engage in the    relevant act even before it occurred.

(2)   The Applicant used force on the Complainant.

(3)   The Applicant put his hand over the Complainant's mouth in an attempt    to stop him calling out in order to avoid detection.

(4)   The Complainant was crying and in pain and trying to tell the Applicant    to stop.

(5)   The Applicant ""persisted over some time"" or, as it was subsequently    put, for a significant period of time, and only stopped when an adult    returned home.

(6)   The Applicant told the Complainant not to say anything.


	
	I accept that the ultimate finding in respect of count 2 may have had some relevance to an assessment of the Applicant's knowledge in respect of count 3 given that count 3 occurred later in time and the nature of the intercourse was the same in each count. However, each count required individual and separate consideration. The approach adopted was contrary to the standard directions given to juries that they must consider each count separately and to the authorities that support such directions. In KRM v R [2001] HCA 11; (2001) 206 CLR 221 McHugh J observed at [36]:
	


""It has become the standard practice in cases where there are multiple counts, however, for the judge to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and to consider it only by reference to the evidence that applies to it (a ""separate consideration warning""). The universal giving of a separate consideration warning and the omission of a universal propensity warning indicates that the giving of a separate consideration warning is ordinarily sufficient to avoid miscarriages of justice in cases such as the present.""


	
	This is the type of standard direction given in every jury trial involving multiple counts. As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 said at [214]:
	


""The kind of direction mentioned, and the reasoning behind it, are matters of common sense which tend, if anything, in favour of an accused so far as they discourage tendency reasoning and invite specific focus on the evidence in relation to each count.""


	
	The fact that a trial is being conducted by judge alone does not alleviate the need for the tribunal of fact to consider each charge separately and to determine whether or not all of the elements of the offence were established. This included, in this case, the question of whether the evidence established the criminal capacity and intention of the child.
	
	
	This was important in the factual circumstances of the present case. Almost all of the features of the case that led the Trial Judge to find the Applicant guilty of count 2 did not exist in relation to count 3. The central fact - that is, the act constituting the sexual intercourse - was the same but the surrounding circumstances were quite different. In particular:
	


(1)   There was no evidence in count 3 that the Applicant knew that the    Complainant did not want to engage in the conduct.

(2)   Count 3 involved no allegation that the Complainant was in pain and    crying.

(3)   Count 3 involved no allegation of the type of force (throwing the    Complainant onto the bed) that was contained in count 2. In count 3    the Complainant said that the Applicant put him on the floor on some    clothes that were lying there.

(4)   There was no assertion in count 3 that the Applicant put his hand over    the Complainant's mouth to stop him from shouting out.

(5)   Count 3 took place over a short period of time.

(6)   Count 3 did not involve an allegation that the Applicant told the    Complainant not to tell anybody.


	
	Apart from the act itself, the evidence in relation to counts 2 and 3 were very different. The only common feature in the surrounding circumstances was the fact that the act stopped when an adult returned. The conclusion reached on count 2 could not, as a matter of law, logic or fact dictate the conclusion to be reached on count 3.
	
	
	The concession made in the court below was made in error. There could be no tactical or forensic reason for this concession to be made and leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be granted to allow the Applicant to rely on Ground 3, which is in the following terms:
	


""The trial judge erred in finding that, ""as a matter of logic"" the accused must be guilty of counts 3 and 4.""


	
	I am of the opinion that this ground is made out. For the purpose of s 6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), there was a wrong decision on a question of law. The verdict must be set aside unless I consider that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". The High Court has considered the operation of this proviso in a number of cases over many years: see, for example, Wilde v The Queen [1988] HCA 6; (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372, Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2008) 224 CLR 300 at 313-316, AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8 at [58]; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at 457, Handlen v The Queen [2011] HCA 51; (2011)245 CLR 282 at 298, Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen [2012] HCA 14; (2012) 246 CLR 92 at 106 and Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; (2012) 246 CLR 469 at 480-481; Filippou v The Queen at [15].
	
	
	The High Court has held that ""[n]o single universally applicable description of what constitutes 'no substantial miscarriage of justice' can be given"": Weiss at [44]. Statements have been made as to whether conviction is inevitable or whether the appellant lost a fair chance of acquittal (Wilde at 372), but such expressions must not ""mask the nature of the appellate court's task"" or become substitutes for the statutory language (Weiss at [33]). In Baiada Poultry it was said at [29]:
	


""The second point to make about determining the application of the proviso is that the Court held, in Weiss, that the proviso cannot be engaged 'unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty'. That is a negative proposition. It states a necessary but not sufficient condition for applying the proviso. As this Court's decision in AK v Western Australia shows, demonstration that a chain of reasoning can be articulated that would require the verdict reached at trial does not always permit, let alone require, the conclusion that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred. Nettle JA recognised this to be so; the majority in the Court of Appeal focused only upon whether Baiada was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence charged.""


	
	The plurality went on at [35] to explain that ""if it was open to a jury to reach a contrary conclusion, the point was not established beyond reasonable doubt"". In Baini (which concerned somewhat different statutory language) French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said at [32] that ""the inquiry to be made is whether a guilty verdict was inevitable, not whether a guilty verdict was open.""
	
	
	Most recently, in Filippou v The Queen, the plurality explained at [15]:
	


“That leaves the proviso, which in terms is applicable to all three limbs of s 6(1). It directs that, even where error of the kind identified in any of the three limbs is established and amounts to a miscarriage of justice, the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied that the error has not been productive of a substantial miscarriage of justice. By ""substantial miscarriage of justice"" what is meant is that the possibility cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has been denied a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to him or her or that there was some other departure from a trial according to law that warrants that description. Consequently, if the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded that the first limb applies, it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. In contrast, where the second limb applies, the circumstances in some cases may be such that, despite the judge making ""the wrong decision of [a] question of law"", the Court of Criminal Appeal is persuaded that the error could not have deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her. In that case the proviso will operate. Where the third limb is engaged, if the Court of Criminal Appeal has concluded that the appellant has not received a fair trial it will follow that it has concluded that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. But where, despite some other identified irregularity, the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has received a fair trial according to law and not otherwise been deprived of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her, once again the proviso will operate. It is also to be borne in mind, as was explained in Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd v The Queen and more recently noticed in Lindsay v The Queen, that, although the proviso is expressed in permissive terms, ""if the condition (the conclusion that no substantial injustice has actually occurred) is satisfied"" the proviso must be applied.”


	
	The present case is somewhat unusual in that it was a trial by judge alone and all of the evidence was tendered in documentary form. On my review of the evidence I am unable to conclude that conviction was inevitable or that it was not open to the tribunal of fact to come to the view that the presumption was not rebutted in relation to count 3. Apart from the evidence of the act itself, there was little surrounding evidence that demonstrated that the 11 (or perhaps 12) year old child knew that what he was doing was gravely or seriously wrong. I do not consider that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". I would uphold ground 3 and quash the conviction in relation to count 3.
	
	
	The question of whether there should be an order for a new trial involves consideration of the merit of ground 2 which asserts that the verdict in count 3 was unreasonable: cf the discussion in Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250 at [13]-[14] and the conclusion at [44]-[45].
	
	
	The Complainant described the incident that gave rise to count 3 in an interview conducted in 2013 by which time he was 15 years old. He said that it happened after the incident giving rise to count 2 but agreed that it was ""around the sort of same time"". It happened at the place where his father worked. The Complainant, the Applicant and their sister were at work with his father. The Complainant thought ""he wasn't gonna do it anymore and then that's when he pulled my pants down and started doing it"". The Applicant had asked the Complainant to go into an office when the father was doing some work outside. The sister was outside hitting a ball. The Applicant ""just started stripping"". He took his pants down to his knees. The Complainant said that ""I went to run away but he was at the door bit"" and that he ""went to call out for [the sister] and then that when he grabbed me and started doing it and I didn't wanna, I didn't want [his sister] to come in and see that he was doing it to me 'cause I didn't let her know that he was doing it to me ---."" The Complainant said that he was lying down on a pile of clothes and that the Applicant ""just grabbed me and put me on there"". He was on his ""tummy face down"" and the Applicant ""put his penis in his bum."" He stopped when he heard the father returning and it only went on for 2-3 minutes. On direct questioning, the Complainant said that the Applicant ""didn't tell me not to tell anyone"" and that the Applicant did nothing else to him on that occasion.
	
	
	There was no evidence that on this occasion the Complainant was crying or demonstrably upset. There was no evidence that the Applicant took steps to keep the conduct secret apart from stopping when the father returned. There was no evidence of force being used or of covering the Complainant's mouth to stop him from crying out.
	
	
	While the timing was not precise, it seems that the Applicant was around 11 years and 6 months at the time. Like the Trial Judge, I accept that the evidence supported a finding that the Applicant was ""of very low intelligence"" and ""possessed a lesser appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct"". That finding was based on the material in a report of a clinical psychologist (Peter Champion) prepared in February 2012. The report had its limitations, not least of which was that it was based on an assessment conducted many years after the offences, by which time the Applicant was 18 years old. Further, it was prepared specifically to address the question of the Applicant's fitness to plead or stand trial. Overall, intelligence testing placed the Applicant in the ""borderline disabled range"". There were variations in the results of the testing, with the Applicant scoring reasonably well in arithmetic but showing ""consistent deficits in verbal reasoning, vocabulary development and general knowledge"". He demonstrated some limitations on the ""perceptual reasoning scale"". Overall, Mr Champion thought ""his potential was probably in the low average range"" and said he met the criteria for a ""formal diagnosis of mild development disability"". It is reasonable to infer that the Applicant’s intellectual shortcomings at 18 years also existed when he was 11 years of age.
	
	
	I have considered the seriousness of the acts giving rise to the offence including the nature of the intercourse and the very young age of the Complainant. I have also taken into account that shortly before this incident, a similar incident had occurred (count 2) during which the Applicant demonstrated an awareness of the wrongfulness of the act by (amongst other things) covering the Complainant's mouth and telling him not to tell anybody about what had happened. However, taking into account the Applicant's youth and intellectual difficulties along with the lack of clear evidence as to the temporal proximity of the two incidents, it does not necessarily follow that because the child knew that an act was seriously wrong on the first occasion, he knew that it was wrong on a subsequent occasion.
	
	
	One factor that I have not taken into account was the suggestion that the Applicant may have been exposed to, or the victim of, sexual molestation. I accept that this may be a relevant factor in an appropriate case. However, there was no evidence of any such molestation in this case. The only evidence was from Mr Champion who said that the Applicant's symptoms of a post-traumatic stress disorder ""may flow from past adverse events such as possible molestation or exposure to violence in earlier years."" He determined that the Applicant had endured a grossly dysfunctional family life with a history of exposure to violence. However, there was no direct (or even hearsay) evidence of any sexual molestation. On my reading of the report, Mr Champion was not asserting that the Applicant was a victim of past sexual molestation. Rather, he was providing possible causes for post-traumatic stress disorder in circumstances where he found that the Applicant exhibited symptoms of such a disorder. Accordingly, I have disregarded the possibility of the Applicant being exposed to sexual molestation.
	
	
	On my review of the whole of the evidence, I am left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Applicant knew that what he was doing was gravely or seriously wrong in a moral sense. A reasonable doubt experienced by an appellate court is ordinarily one that ought to have been experienced by the court at first instance: M v The Queen at 495 (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). Their Honours went on to explain:
	


""It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""


	
	In the present case, no oral evidence was called. All of the evidence presented before the District Court was in documentary form. Accordingly, the caveat referred to in M v The Queen has no application in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	It follows that the conviction and sentence in relation to count 3 should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered.
	


Sentence


	
	The sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences in relation to counts 2, 3 and 4:
	


(3) A non-parole period of 8 months commencing 5 December 2014 with a balance of term of 1 years 4 months (total sentence - 2 years).

(4) A fixed term of 3 months commencing 5 December 2014.

(2) A non-parole period of 9 months commencing 5 February 2014 with a balance of term of 1 years 8 months (total sentence - 2 years and 5 months).


	
	The sentence in relation to count 4 was entirely concurrent with the sentence for count 3. The sentence for count 2 was accumulated by 2 months so that the total effective non-parole period was 11 months commencing 5 December 2014 and expiring 4 November 2015. There was a balance of term of 2 years and 5 months (that imposed in relation to count 3).
	
	
	Because of the conclusion I have reached in respect of count 3, it would be necessary (at least) to adjust the commencement date of the sentence (s 59 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Act"")). However, it is also necessary to consider the Applicant's specific and general complaints in relation to the sentence.
	
	
	I agree with Davies J that ground 4 (""the Trial Judge erred in finding that the Applicant occupied a position of trust with respect to the Complainant"") is made out. I accept that the sentencing Judge was not making a finding of an aggravating feature under s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act. However, he was plainly taking the ""position of trust"" into account in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offending. The Judge erred in finding that a child aged 11 or 12 years of age left in charge of his two younger siblings should be considered to be in a position of trust for the purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	I also agree with Davies J that ground 5 (""the Trial Judge erred in failing to take into account s 22A Sentencing Act or alternatively the willingness of the Applicant to facilitate the course of justice"") should be rejected. The matter was not raised during the sentencing hearing. I expect this was not an oversight but rather an ethical approach arising from counsel's knowledge of the tactical considerations underpinning the manner in which the trial was conducted. I note in particular that two other counts were severed from the indictment and that the Juvenile Justice report suggested that the Applicant denied that counts 1-4 had occurred at all. While there is little doubt that the trial was conducted efficiently, it is not appropriate in the circumstances to uphold a ground asserting error when no submission was made to the Judge concerning these matters. However, like Davies J, I take it into account in considering the question of sentence in the light of the error identified under ground 4.
	
	
	Because ground 4 is to be upheld, it is necessary to consider afresh the question of an appropriate sentence for count 2: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601at [42]-[43].
	
	
	The offence is a very serious one, involving the anal penetration of a child less than 10 years of age. He was only 6 or 7 at the time. The offence was committed in the home of the victim and no doubt had a devastating effect on him. In his interview, the victim said that he complained because ""I was getting sick, like I couldn't hold it in no more"".
	
	
	The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. Ordinarily, the purposes of punishment (under s 3A and the common law) would require an extremely lengthy term of imprisonment. However, the Applicant was himself a young child when the offence was committed. While he was being sentenced as an adult because of the understandably delayed complaint, the sentencing principles relating to children apply to a consideration of an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) provides:
	


""A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:

a) That children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard , and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that effect them;

b) That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,

c) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption.

d) That it is desirable wherever possible to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,

e) That the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater that that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.""


	
	These fundamental principles remain relevant in a case where the offence is to be dealt with according to law: see for example Regina v SDM [2001] NSWCCA 158; (2001) 51 NSWLR 530 per Simpson J at [22].
	
	
	In R v Elliott and Blessington [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1 Kirby J (dissenting in the outcome) said (at [127]) that ""a jurisprudence has developed in the context of sentencing young offenders, which recognises the important differences, in terms of responsibility, between adults and children."" His Honour referred to Slade v The Queen [2005] NZCA 19; [2005] 2 NZLR 526 and to studies concerning the capacity of adolescents to regulate their moods, impulses and behaviours. Those considerations apply with even greater force in the case of an 11 year old offender with an intellectual disability.
	
	
	In MS2 & Ors v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 397; (2005) 158 A Crim R 93, Adams J identified at [16] two reasons that the youthfulness of offenders is considered a very significant factor in sentencing. The first is the public interest in the rehabilitation of young offenders and the second is the fact that immaturity is relevant to culpability or criminality.
	
	
	In sentencing children, greater weight is given to rehabilitation and less weight to deterrence: see, for example: R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116, KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 McClelland CJ at CL at [22]-[26]. However, the closer a child is to adulthood and the more serious the offending, the more likely that deterrence and retribution will be significant factors. A relevant factor in this assessment is the amount of planning involved in the offence. In the present case, the child was around 11 ½ when he committed the offence. There was no evidence of planning or anything to suggest the offence was other than opportunistic and spontaneous.
	
	
	The Applicant had no previous criminal history although in 2012 the Children's Court sentenced him to a series of control orders (12 and 14 months) for four similar offences that occurred in 2011. The commission of those offences provides no comfort in assessing the likelihood that he will re-offend. Nothing in the reports tendered in the sentencing hearing (or on appeal) leads to a positive finding as to his prospects of rehabilitation. On the contrary. Risk assessments as to future offending suggest that he requires a ""medium-high level of supervision"". At the time of sentence, it seems that he had not been involved in any programs to address his offending behaviour. However, material tendered on re-sentence demonstrated regular attendances on a psychologist and completion of the forms to facilitate his referral to a sex offender program.
	
	
	There was no evidence of remorse and, as I have said, the Juvenile Justice report noted that he told the author that he believed the events ""didn't happen at all"". He asserted that the allegations were made because he ""dobbed on the victim … for smoking bumpers."" This supported the conclusion of the Juvenile Justice Officer that he was ""unable to demonstrate that he was taking any responsibility for the offences"". However, I take into account the efficiency with which the trial was conducted and the extent of disclosure and co-operation exhibited by the defence in the course of the trial proceedings.
	
	
	The Applicant is incarcerated in an adult gaol and the evidence suggests that this is particularly onerous because of his relative youth, his emotional immaturity and intellectual disability as well as the nature of the offences. He has been bullied by other inmates. The material tendered on re-sentence showed that he had reported incidents of violence directed towards him. His uncle said that he lost a lot of weight (around 30 kilograms) when he first went into custody and believed that it was because he was scared and stressed. He has now put the weight back on.
	
	
	In view of the seriousness of the offence and the concerns regarding the protection of the community arising from his lack of insight and poor prospects of rehabilitation, I have concluded that a custodial sentence is the only appropriate sentence: s 5(1) Sentencing Act. However, because he was a child at the time of the offence, that sentence should be a modest one of 20 months duration. It should be backdated to the date that he was taken into custody. Because of the reduced significance of deterrence and his need for counselling, supervision and assistance in re-entering the community, I have concluded that the sentence should be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, the orders that I favour are as follows:
	


(1)   Grant leave to appeal against conviction and allow the appeal in part.

(2)   Confirm the conviction in relation to count 2.

(3)   Quash the convictions and sentences in relation to counts 3 and 4 and enter a verdict of acquittal in relation to each of those counts.

(4)   Grant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on count 2 and allow the appeal.

(5)   In lieu thereof, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 20 months commencing 5 December 2014 and concluding 4 August 2016. The whole of the sentence is to be suspended upon the Applicant entering a bond under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The bond is to be subject to the following conditions:

   (a)   The Applicant accept the supervision of the adult Probation and Parole Service of Department of Corrective Service and obey all reasonable direction of that service.

   (b)   The Applicant participate in the CUBIT Outreach (CORE) Program or such other program as reasonably directed by the Probation and Parole Service.

2767596,Villalon v R [2015] NSWCCA 229,"Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Michael Villalon, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the Supreme Court by Price J on 18 September 2014 for the manslaughter of his stepfather, Keith Owen Chaney.
	
	
	The deceased died at Mascot on 28 February 2012 as a result of a stabbing by the applicant with a knife. The applicant was charged with murder. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on that charge, but guilty of manslaughter.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced the applicant upon the basis, consistent with the verdict, that at the time he killed the deceased he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental condition, and the impairment was so substantial as to warrant the applicant’s liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter: s 23A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	His Honour imposed a sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months commencing on 28 February 2012 and expiring on 27 August 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months commencing on 28 August 2017 and expiring on 27 February 2020.
	


Relevant facts


	
	The applicant did not give evidence during the trial or the proceedings on sentence. The following summary of the facts is taken from his Honour’s findings on sentence, which were not challenged on appeal.
	
	
	The applicant lived with his mother and the deceased from 2009 when he came to Australia from the Philippines. At the time of the offence, he was aged 27 years. He was aged 30 at the time of sentence. The deceased was antagonistic towards the applicant; his behaviour included nagging, threats, physical assaults, inappropriate behaviour and making the applicant watch pornographic videos and convert them into CDs. The applicant was particularly concerned about the deceased's inappropriate conduct towards his younger sister. The applicant had been experiencing psychotic symptoms from 2009, including beliefs that the deceased had buried a lady under the house and was contaminating water in the house.
	
	
	On 28 February 2012, a dispute arose between the applicant and the deceased about the bathroom door and the front and back doors of the house being left open or closed. The deceased and the applicant had often argued about the doors. The deceased went to touch the applicant in the chest area, and the applicant pushed him back. The applicant then struck the deceased with a figurine and then stabbed the deceased with a knife a number of times in the abdomen, then below the right eye, penetrating through the spinal cord, which was partly severed. This was the fatal blow due to consequent neurological shock. The applicant used a second knife to inflict further wounds to the deceased’s chin and neck. The applicant also used a hammer to inflict seven lacerations to the top of the deceased’s head. Three of the lacerations involved skull fractures.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 28 February 2012, and charged with murder shortly thereafter.
	
	
	On 12 December 2012, the applicant’s solicitor wrote to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions enclosing a report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 12 June 2012 and advised of the applicant’s instructions to plead not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. In his report, Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that the applicant was “suffering from an abnormality of the mind (a paranoid psychotic illness) at the time of the homicide”.
	
	
	The applicant confirmed his offer to plead guilty to manslaughter at the committal hearing in the Local Court on 2 April 2013. On 27 May 2013 the Director of Public Prosecutions informed the applicant’s solicitor that his offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in satisfaction of the murder charge had been refused. On arraignment in the Supreme Court on 7 June 2013 the applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.
	
	
	The applicant indicated his plea of guilty to manslaughter before the jury in his first trial, which commenced on 22 October 2013 but the jury was discharged on 7 November 2013 being unable to agree on a verdict. The applicant again indicated his plea of guilty to manslaughter before the jury in his second trial, which commenced on 19 May 2014.
	
	
	Three forensic psychiatrists gave evidence during the trial. Dr Allnutt, Dr Westmore and Dr Furst all agreed that the applicant was suffering from an underlying psychotic illness at the time that he killed the deceased. Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that this was either a schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia, as a result of which the applicant experienced an abnormality of the mind including persecutory beliefs, referential thoughts and auditory phenomena. The illness was undiagnosed at the time of the offence. It impacted on the applicant’s capacity to understand events, leading to illogical and erroneous interpretation of some events and the applicant believing that the deceased was conspiring with others to have him harmed in a serious manner. On balance, Dr Allnut considered that the symptoms had commenced a number of years earlier.
	
	
	Dr Westmore was of the opinion that the applicant suffered from a paranoid schizophrenic illness or a psychosis at the time of the offence, his mental state having deteriorated since 2009, and the abnormality of mind would have impaired the applicant’s capacity to think normally. He and Dr Furst were both of the opinion that the applicant had a lack of capacity to control himself. Dr Furst's primary diagnosis was one of schizophrenia.
	
	
	As already mentioned, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the charge of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	At the sentencing hearing on 6 June 2014, the Crown provided a written outline of submissions on sentence, but did not relevantly supplement those submissions. On the issue of the discount on sentence for the guilty plea, the Crown’s written submissions referred to the timing of the applicant’s plea of guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court. The Crown submitted, without articulating any reasons, that the discount on sentence should be assessed in the lower part of the range of 10% to 25%. Notably, the Crown did not submit that there had been any material delay in the applicant’s plea. Nor did the Crown make any submission concerning the utilitarian value of the plea.
	
	
	The applicant submitted both in writing and orally that a discount of 25% should be allowed for his guilty plea (tcpt 6/6/14 at 3, lines 16-29).
	
	
	The sentencing hearing was part heard and continued on 18 July 2014 and concluded on 28 August 2014. On that day, senior counsel then appearing for the applicant drew his Honour’s attention to the Crown’s written submissions on the discount for the guilty plea to manslaughter.
	
	
	Counsel repeated her previous submission that a discount of 25% was warranted, given that the applicant had indicated his plea of guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court. Counsel further submitted that the only reason that plea was not formally entered (in the Local Court) was because the Crown had not yet made a decision as to whether or not to accept that plea in satisfaction of the murder charge (tcpt 28/8/14 at 2, line 42 – 3, line 6). The Crown, in reply, did not advance any matters in support of its earlier written submissions (tcpt 28/8/14 at 3, line 42 – 6, line 13).
	


The judge’s reasons


	
	His Honour found that the applicant’s attack was “deliberate, brutal and sustained” and that the applicant intended to kill the deceased: at [16].
	
	
	His Honour referred to the evidence of the three psychiatrists mentioned above. He found that the jury was satisfied that at the time of the offence, the applicant's “capacity to understand events, to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying schizophrenic illness ... so substantial as to warrant (applying community standards) his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter”: at [23].
	
	
	His Honour took into account that the applicant’s substantial impairment reduced his moral culpability for the killing: s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act), but neither negated his moral culpability entirely, nor entirely excused his deliberate acts which were committed with an intention to kill: at [24].
	
	
	His Honour found provocation by the deceased a mitigating factor to be taken into account (at [25]), as was the fact that the offence was not planned but committed on the spur of the moment: at [26]. Nonetheless his Honour found that the offence was objectively serious as the applicant unlawfully took the deceased’s life: at [26].
	
	
	His Honour found and took into account the applicant did not have a record of previous convictions and was a person of good character: at [27]. He found that by his plea of guilty to manslaughter, the applicant had accepted responsibility for his offending, but did not find on the evidence that the applicant was remorseful for his crime: at [28].
	
	
	His Honour found the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea to be 20% and gave the following reasons at [29]:
	


Whilst the proceedings were in the Local Court, the offender’s solicitor wrote on 12 December 2012 to the Director of Public Prosecutions enclosing a copy of Dr Westmore’s report and advised that the offender intended to plead not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. The offender’s intention to plead guilty to manslaughter was confirmed at the committal hearing on 2 April 2013. The Director of Public Prosecutions rejected the offender’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. Upon arraignment on 7 June 2013, the offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter which he confirmed before the jury in the first trial and the trial before me. In these circumstances, I assess the utilitarian value of the plea to be 20 per cent.


	
	His Honour gave little weight to general deterrence having regard to the applicant’s schizophrenic illness: at [30]. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant’s risk of reoffending was low, provided he continued to take his medication and adhered upon release to the proposed psychiatric treatment plan: at [37]. His Honour gave modest weight to the need for specific deterrence noting that the offender’s mental illness did not in the circumstances eliminate the need for specific deterrence: at [37].
	
	
	His Honour found special circumstances existed, based on the applicant’s need for ongoing psychiatric treatment, to justify a departure from the statutory proportion of 25% between the sentence and the non-parole period fixed by s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act: at [39].
	
	
	In imposing the sentence referred to above, his Honour said:
	


39. I find that special circumstances exist that justify a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence being the offender’s need for ongoing psychiatric treatment. I have determined that a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].

40. Taking into account all factors that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence I consider is 10 years. The sentence is reduced by 20 per cent to 8 years.


	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on two grounds.
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in his application of s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by:

(a) failing to apply R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 at [15] as interpreted and applied since R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383;

(b) failing to give reasons for not affording the applicant a “discount” commensurate with the timing of his offer to plead guilty

Applicant’s submissions


	
	Ground 1 involves a challenge to the exercise of his Honour’s discretion to allow a discount of 20% for the indication of the plea of guilty. The applicant contended that the indication of his plea was given at the earliest time, and accordingly his Honour should have given a discount of 25%.
	
	
	The applicant pointed to the “practice” of the courts in relation to offers to plead guilty. Reference was made to R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310, where the offender had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter but the Crown would not accept that plea and a jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. At [15], Grove J (Spigelman CJ and Sully J agreeing) said:
	


There has been a long practice, however, in this court and in trial courts to take into account the offer of a plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted.


	
	Grove J explained (at [16]) that the offer of the guilty plea was relevant in two ways: one as an indication of remorse and contrition for the offence committed; and second, because of its utilitarian value. His Honour concluded that the offender should not be deprived of any benefit that he might expect for the utilitarian value of the offer of his plea.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that the reasoning in R v Oinonen required qualification following the subsequent guideline judgment of this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 (R v Thomson). In R v Thomson, Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, expressed the view (at [123]) that the focus should be on the utilitarian advantage derived by the criminal justice system from encouraging pleas of guilty. The Chief Justice had earlier observed that questions of remorse or contrition should be dealt with together with other subjective considerations: at [116]-[118].
	
	
	The applicant submitted that R v Oinonen, as applied since R v Thomson, is authority for the allowance of an equivalent discount to that commensurate with what would have been awarded had the guilty plea been accepted at the time of its offer. Reference was made to R v Pennisi [2001] NSWCCA 326 at [27]; R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15; 137 A Crim R 535 at [21]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; 160 A Crim R 1 at [121]; Williams v R; Saunders v R [2006] NSWCCA 33 at [24]-[28].
	


Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown accepted that the practice of the courts is to take account of an offer of the plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted. Reference was made to R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32], where this approach was endorsed.
	
	
	The Crown also referred to R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; 160 A Crim R 510 at [12] where Howie J, referring to R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398; 158 A Crim R 357 at [38]-[41] (Hulme J), explained that it is a mistake to focus solely upon the timing of the plea, because such an approach is to misread R v Thomson and ignores the rationale for a discount of 25%. Hulme J in R v Harmouche identified the rationale for a 25% discount as encompassing both “the extent of the utilitarian benefit and the complexity of evidence gathering and of any trial which was avoided”.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the time between the date of Dr Westmore’s report of 12 June 2012, and the indication of the applicant’s plea of guilty to manslaughter on 12 December 2012. The Crown submitted that this period of time supported a conclusion that the applicant’s plea was not indicated at the earliest possible time and that such conclusion was implicit in his Honour’s assessment of the discount in the present case as 20%.
	


Consideration


	
	No issue of principle is raised by ground 1. The parties were in agreement that although the applicant did not formally enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court, his Honour was required to take into account the offer of that plea of guilty which matched the crime for which the applicant was ultimately convicted.
	
	
	Nor was there any issue as to the guideline judgment in R v Thomson that the utilitarian value of a plea should generally be assessed in the range of 10% to 25% discount on sentence: at [160].
	
	
	It is well established that the primary consideration is the timing of the plea. Spigelman CJ noted in R v Thomson that a plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial: at [154]. The complexity of the issues about which the evidence will have to be gathered and adduced will also affect the value of the plea. Spigelman CJ noted that the greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of the plea: at [154].
	
	
	The Chief Justice observed at [155]:
	


The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial.


	
	At [160], Spigelman CJ emphasised that what is to be regarded as an early plea will vary accordingly to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	In R v Borkowski at [32], Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) restated the principles of general application for a guilty plea discount. Four matters are worthy of emphasis in the present case:
	


1.   The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [116].

2.   Some allowance may be made in determining the discount where the trial would be particularly complicated or lengthy: Thomson at [154].

…

9   The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain: R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Ahmad v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan v The Queen (2008) 51 MVR 572; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: R v Stambolis; Saad v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1: R v Chiekh [2004] NSWCCA 448.

10.   An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value: R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129.


	
	To successfully challenge his Honour’s assessment of the discount on sentence in the present case, it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate error of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
	
	
	In this regard although his Honour outlined the chronology of events relating to the timing of the plea indicated in the Local Court and confirmed at the committal hearing, his Honour did not make any finding that the applicant had not indicated his plea at the first reasonable opportunity.
	
	
	Nor did his Honour refer to any circumstances which may have eroded the utilitarian value of the applicant’s guilty plea indicated in the Local Court: see R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229; 59 MVR 356 at [2] (Bathurst CJ). His Honour’s reasons do not, with respect, reveal the basis upon which he arrived at the 20% discount on sentence.
	
	
	Of course, it is not correct to say that the applicant had an entitlement to a discount of 25%. A submission to that effect was made, and rejected, by this Court in Trujillo-Mesa v R [2010] NSWCCA 201. Fullerton J (with whom Hodgson JA and Price J agreed) said at [17]:
	


This Court has restated in a number of decisions, and without qualification, that there is no entitlement to and no presumption favouring a particular percentile discount for a plea of guilty.

Nonetheless, in the circumstances of the present case, his Honour should be taken to have mistaken the facts as to the timing of the applicant’s plea, in arriving at the assessment of a discount of 20%.


	
	It seems that his Honour accepted what was implicit in the Crown’s written submissions, namely that the applicant had not indicated his plea at the first reasonable opportunity. The difficulty with this assessment, as already indicated, is that the Crown’s written submissions did not articulate why the timing of the applicant’s plea should be so characterised.
	
	
	In this Court, the Crown submitted that the applicant had not indicated his plea at the earliest opportunity, as he had not disclosed Dr Westmore’s report and indicated his intention to plead guilty to manslaughter until 12 December 2012, being 6 months after the report was written. The Crown accepted that there was no evidence of delay in the committal proceedings due to the late provision of Dr Westmore’s report (tcpt at 16, lines 13-16), but nonetheless, submitted that it could be inferred that there was “delay” by the applicant in indicating his plea (tcpt 16 at lines 9-11).
	
	
	When pressed in oral argument as to how the timing of the provision of Dr Westmore’s report could have affected the committal hearing, the Crown initially submitted that if the applicant had provided Dr Westmore’s report earlier than when he did, the Crown may have obtained its own report prior to committal, and that this may have influenced the Crown’s position (tcpt at 16, lines 13-26. It was further submitted that there was a prospect that the Crown would have accepted the applicant’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in satisfaction of the murder charge and there would have been a committal for sentence (tcpt at 16, lines 33-45). Acceptance of this submission would involve the Court in inappropriate speculation. It also would ignore what in fact transpired when the Crown obtained Dr Allnut’s report dated 5 April 2013. (It was common ground that the report from Dr Allnut was dated 5 April 2013, although it seems from the transcript of the proceedings on sentence, that Dr Allnut’s report was not in fact tendered on the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	The Crown subsequently acknowledged that the timing of the provision of Dr Westmore’s report did not matter because once the Crown obtained its report from Dr Allnut, the Crown rejected the applicant’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter (tcpt at 17, lines 8-13). So much should be accepted.
	
	
	It should be accepted that, in relative terms, the applicant indicated his plea of guilty to manslaughter at the earliest reasonable opportunity during the committal proceedings. The applicant maintained his plea of guilty to manslaughter at all times thereafter.
	
	
	It should also be accepted that the applicant’s offer to plead guilty to manslaughter carried the utilitarian benefit that the Crown did not have to concern itself with the cause of death, the identity of the killer, or the applicant’s intention to kill the deceased.
	
	
	Whilst the utilitarian value flowing from the guilty plea to manslaughter is not a fixed element: R v AB at [33] (Johnson J; Bathurst CJ and Hoeben J agreeing), the Crown did not point to any other circumstances in the present case which may have eroded the utilitarian value of the guilty plea. In the circumstances, I would conclude that his Honour’s discretion miscarried because he must be taken to have mistaken the facts as to the timing of the plea, in assessing the discount on sentence as 20%: House v The King at 505.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the appeal is made out.
	


Ground 2: His Honour erred in his application of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by determining the non-parole period first, in circumstances where there was a finding of “special circumstances”, resulting in an extension of the full term rather than a reduction in the non-parole period: cf R v Tobar (2004) 150 A Crim R 104 at 110 [36]-[39].

Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant contended that having found special circumstances, his Honour was required to give effect to that finding by “a reduction in the minimum term and not by an extension of the additional term”: R v Tobar [2004] NSWCCA 391; 150 A Crim R 104 at [36] (Simpson J; Dunford and Hidden JJ agreeing), applying R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114. The applicant also referred to R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [35]-[39]; Musgrove v R [2007] NSWCCA 21; 167 A Crim R 424; Markham v R [2007] NSWCCA 295 at [29]; R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218.
	
	
	The applicant contended that his Honour had failed to follow this approach, and erroneously engaged in a “bottom-up” process of sentencing (tcpt at 8, lines 25-28). It was submitted that his Honour had first determined what he held to be an appropriate non-parole period, then determined a head sentence and only then reduced the sentence for the guilty plea. The applicant’s complaint was that the head sentence had been extended on account of the fixing of the non-parole period first.
	


Crown’s submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that no such error had been made by his Honour. The Crown pointed to his Honour having referred to the finding of special circumstances to vary the statutory ratio, prior to referring to either the non-parole period or the term. This, the Crown submitted, was to be contrasted with the error found in Musgrove v R at [44] (Simpson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Price J agreeing) that:
	


A finding of special circumstances, after the determination of the non-parole period, would provoke an extension, beyond proper limits, of the balance of term. [Emphasis added.]

Consideration


	
	Section 44(1) of the Sentencing Act provides:
	


Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).


	
	The distinction between the requirement to firstly “set” as opposed to “determine” the non-parole period was considered in Musgrove v R where Simpson J said at [44]:
	


That the non-parole period is now, by s 44(1), required first to be set does not necessarily mean that it must first be determined: see Moffıtt at 122; 27-28, R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218; R v Tobar. Indeed, in the light of the discretion conferred by subs (2), it is difficult to see how the sentencing duty could properly be discharged by the determination first of the non-parole period. To determine, initially, the non-parole period, before determining the total sentence, would, in my opinion, (where special circumstances are then found) be conducive to error of the kind exposed in Huynh. A finding of special circumstances, after the determination of the non-parole period, would provoke an extension, beyond proper limits, of the balance of term. Sentencing judges need to be wary of taking a course that might lead to that error. Yet, on too literal an application of the section, that kind of error is rendered likely. The section appears to enjoin a sentencing judge firstly to fix the non-parole period, as the minimum term to be served in custody; and then to consider the question of special circumstances. It is obvious that, if special circumstances are found, the temptation will be to extend the balance of term rather than, as was held in Moffıtt and cases thereafter to be the correct course, to reduce the non-parole period. [Emphasis in the original.]


	
	Here the applicant challenges [39] and [40] of his Honour’s reasoning (set out at [28] above). Counsel for the applicant fairly accepted in oral argument that if the two paragraphs in his Honour’s reasons had been reversed, the present complaint would not have been open to the applicant (tcpt at 9, lines 7-15).
	
	
	In my view, his Honour did not err in the manner suggested by the applicant. On a fair reading of his Honour’s reasons, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances before determining the non-parole period. Having found special circumstances, based on the applicant’s need for ongoing psychiatric treatment, his Honour is to be taken to have determined the total sentence of 8 years, after allowance for the 20% discount for the plea, and determined the non-parole period of 5 years 6 months, taking into account the finding of special circumstances so as to reduce the proportion that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence to about 68%.
	
	
	I reject the applicant’s submission that it should be inferred from the order in which his Honour expressed his reasons in the two paragraphs identified, that he extended the balance of the term (to 8 years) to reflect his finding of special circumstances, rather than to reduce the non-parole period.
	
	
	Ground 2 of the appeal is not made out.
	
	
	There should however be a grant of leave to appeal, as ground 1 has been made out.
	


Is some other sentence warranted in law?


	
	Once error is established it becomes this Court’s duty to resentence unless in the exercise of its discretion it concludes that no sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted and should have been passed: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	The Crown contended that if the Court concludes there was error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, then no lesser sentence is warranted in law taking into account the full range of factors affecting sentence: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant relied in this Court upon an affidavit from the applicant as to his remorse and circumstances post-sentence. Evidence of post-sentence conduct is admissible for the purpose of determining whether a sentence should be substituted under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124] (Johnson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adam J agreeing).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that the affidavit evidence demonstrated that the applicant has been compliant with his prescribed medication regime, has completed various courses and is undertaking a job-seeking course. The affidavit also expressed the applicant’s sorrow and regret for his actions in killing the deceased which he acknowledged were inhumane, and which he ascribed to his mental condition at the time. The Crown did not challenge this evidence.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant urged the Court to make the same findings as his Honour made on sentence, except in relation to remorse (tcpt at 14, lines 3-7). The applicant’s recent expression of regret and sorrow may be taken as an indication of an acceptance of responsibility for his conduct. The Crown did not submit to the contrary.
	
	
	I have had regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances which have been mentioned above.
	
	
	It is necessary to balance all these matters against the offending.
	
	
	The maximum sentence is an important legislative guidepost for the Court to take into account: see Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. The legislature has set the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment for manslaughter: Crimes Act, s 24.
	
	
	As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. In its objective gravity it may vary greatly: R v Forbes at [133] (Spigelman CJ; McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J agreeing).
	
	
	The authorities recognise that although manslaughter can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation within any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter: R v Forbes at [134].
	
	
	In R v Forbes Spigelman CJ referred to the earlier observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1995, unrep). Those observations are pertinent here. Gleeson CJ said (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing):
	


It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.

At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. (R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.)

When the basis of a finding of manslaughter is diminished responsibility, pursuant to s23A of the Crimes Act, what is nevertheless ordinarily involved, and what is involved in the present case, is a conclusion that the taking of human life was the consequence of a deliberate and willed act, performed with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. The abnormality of mind substantially impairs the offender's mental responsibility for his or her act but it does not negate such responsibility. The reduction in the capacity for self control which results from the abnormality of mind diminishes the responsibility, but it does not excuse the act. (R v Low (1991) 57 A Crim R 8.)

Making a judgment as to the extent to which, in a given case, responsibility is diminished, can be a difficult task. The hypothesis, however, is that the offender is responsible for a deliberate act which took the life of another person, and which, but for the abnormality of mind, would bear the character of murder.

An examination of sentences imposed in other cases of diminished responsibility shows that quite severe sentences have been passed upon persons found to have diminished responsibility ...

…

Reference to these cases is not made for the purpose of suggesting that they determine the appropriate penalty in the present case. The point is that the sentences there imposed proceeded upon a clear recognition that, notwithstanding the diminished responsibility, it was necessary to impose a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness of the case and, in particular, the circumstance that what was involved was the felonious taking of human life with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.


	
	Notwithstanding the frequent remarks in this Court about the lack of utility of comparing sentences in manslaughter of different cases, counsel for the applicant referred to Pitt v R [2014] NSWCCA 70 and three other decisions referred to in that case, as comparative cases on sentence. None of these cases assist the applicant. Dealing briefly with each of them.
	
	
	Pitt v R involved schizophrenia on the part of the offender and there was a history of extreme provocation. The offender had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. Pitt does not assist the applicant. The circumstances of the killing were different and occurred after a long and chaotic night during which the offender and the deceased had repeatedly argued. In addition, the offender’s psychiatric state interrelated with his perception of the threat posed to him by the victim and the victim’s brother.
	
	
	R v Kain [2013] NSWSC 638 involved a psychiatric impairment, and the killing occurred after the offender lost his temper. A jury had acquitted the offender of murder and convicted him of manslaughter to which he had pleaded guilty. Kain does not assist. The offender was sentenced on the basis that he was guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, not that he intended to kill his mother or cause her grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	R v Hollaway [2013] NSWSC 218 involved schizophrenia, and multiple stabbings. The offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. The offender’s abnormality of mind arose from an underlying condition of a drug induced psychosis on the background of an unstable personality. The offender was acting on the belief at the time of the stabbing that it was necessary to do what she did in order to defend herself.
	
	
	The applicant did not ultimately rely on R v Chen [2012] NSWSC 1000 in oral argument (tcpt at 12, lines 47-48).
	
	
	In the present case, the objective gravity of the offence was substantial, as his Honour found. The applicant’s attack upon the deceased was deliberate, brutal and sustained. It was only the abnormality of mind which diminished the applicant’s responsibility for his act. However, as his Honour observed, it did not negate his moral culpability entirely: R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [34] (Dunford J; Hoeben J agreeing).
	
	
	Each of the mitigating factors found by his Honour may be accepted (there being no challenge by the Crown) and each is to be taken into account. Nor did the Crown challenge his Honour’s findings as to the respective weight to be given to deterrence, general and specific, taking into account the applicant’s mental condition. These findings may also be accepted.
	
	
	His Honour’s finding that the applicant would require ongoing psychiatric treatment is not challenged by the Crown. A finding of special circumstances should be made (justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term) to provide for the applicant’s need for a longer period of such treatment upon his release. I would maintain his Honour’s departure from the statutory ratio to approximately 68%.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. The sentence that I would consider appropriate after allowing for the 25% discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty is a term of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months. I would set a non-parole period of 5 years 1 month, commencing on 28 February 2012 and expiring on 27 March 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years 5 months commencing on 28 March 2017 and expiring on 27 August 2019.
	
	
	The Court is required to specify the earliest date on which the applicant is eligible for release on parole: Sentencing Act, s 48. Here that date is 27 March 2017. The form of order proposed – that “the offender will become eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period” which expires on 27 March 2017, broadly reflects the approach suggested in R v BA [2014] NSWCCA 148 at [19] (McCallum J; Gleeson JA and Fullerton J agreeing) and adopted in subsequent cases such as R v Dennis; R v Elwood [2014] NSWSC 1615 at [59] and [62] (R A Hulme J).
	
	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	The sentence imposed in the Supreme Court on 18 September 2014 is quashed.
	
	
	The applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 1 month commencing on 28 February 2012 and expiring on 27 March 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years 5 months commencing on 28 March 2017 and expiring on 27 August 2019. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole at the end of the non-parole period.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Gleeson JA. If the plea of not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter had been accepted by the Crown when it was first offered there would have been no reason for the sentencing judge to have applied anything less than 25%, the discount which has been accepted since R v Thompson and Houlten [2000] NSWCCA 56; 49 NSWLR 383 as the full measure of allowance for the purely utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. I do not see anything in the evidence or submissions of the Crown at sentence, nor anything in what was put to this Court on the appeal, which would have justified a reduction in the quantum of discount if, hypothetically, the manslaughter plea had been accepted.
	
	
	It was within the Director of Public Prosecutions’ responsibility to reject the offered plea and thereby to cause the issue of abnormality of mind, which was raised by the applicant's plea of not guilty to murder, to be submitted to a jury. But the applicant had done everything in his power to relieve the Crown of the risk and expense of a trial. The requirement for a trial flowed solely from the Crown's unwillingness to accept the applicant's case regarding his mental condition and its insistence that a jury should determine the matter.
	
	
	In R v Pennisi [2001] NSWCCA 326 the circumstances were relevantly comparable to the present and Bell J allowed 25% for the ""notional utility"" of the offered plea. As Gleeson JA has shown, the Crown has not identified to this Court any reasonable ground for having submitted to his Honour that the discount should have been ""in the lower part of the range of 10% to 25%"". This aspect of sentencing has assumed such an importance in the decisions of accused persons regarding their pleas that the Crown really needs to have a principled basis for asking a sentencing judge to strike the discount at the low end of the range. In the particular circumstances of this case no principled basis has been shown for the Crown to have urged that the discount be anything less than the upper limit.

		26 August 2015",2015-08-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767601,Boikov v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 192,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for orders on 28 August 2015 following argument as to the form and capacity of certain imputations pleaded in the statement of claim. The application to strike out the imputations on the basis of capacity is brought under rr 28.2 and 28.3 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”). The application to strike out the imputations on the basis of form is brought under UCPR r 14.28, on the basis that the imputations have not been pleaded conformably with the requirements under UCPR r 14.30.
	
	
	The defendant challenged the form and capacity of imputations 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d). The imputations set out in paragraph 3 of the statement of claim are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to help pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, condones the shooting down of flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is reasonably suspected by ASIO of having travelled to the Ukraine for the purpose of fighting with the pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, called for people to join him in the fighting in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, has committed a criminal offence punishable by a lengthy jail term because he went overseas to fight for the pro-Russian rebels.
	



	
	Imputations 3(e) and 3(f) were not challenged. Although no order was sought in this regard, I formally note these imputations will go to the jury was pleaded.
	
	
	I first note the relevant principles of law. The parties agreed that the relevant principles in relation to capacity are as set out by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], where the court held that the determination of capacity is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony”, as well as being a “matter of impression … the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”, citing Berezovsky v Forbes [2001] EWCA Civ 1251.
	
	
	Where the basis of the objection is one of form, the requirements for precision are as set out by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 197 and, more recently, in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].
	


Imputations 3(a) and 3(b)


	
	The plaintiff conceded that imputations 3(a) and 3(b) did not differ in substance and elected to rely upon imputation 3(a). Imputation 3(b) is accordingly struck out.
	


Imputation 3(c)


	
	The solicitors for the defendant in their letter of 27 August 2015 state that this imputation “is incapable of arising from the matter complained of”, but provide no details.
	
	
	In oral submissions, Ms Barnett submitted that, for the plaintiff to “condone” for shooting down of MH 17, he must be shown to have actual knowledge of the shooting down and of the role the separatists played in the shooting down. The ordinary reasonable reader could not draw from the matter complained of that the plaintiff even knew who had shot down MH 17, and still less that he condoned this act. All that the matter complained of does is suggest that the pro-Russian rebels he has joined could be responsible for the shooting down, and not that the plaintiff either knew or approved of this.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen answered this submission by listing all the references in the matter complained of to the MH 17 aeroplane and to the plaintiff’s whereabouts at the relevant times.
	
	
	First, while outright guilt for the shooting down is not spelled out, there are strong hints as to who is considered by the defendant to be responsible. The matter complained of contains repeated references to the “pro-Russian rebels” who “shot down MH17”, to use the words of the heading. While the words in this heading are put in inverted commas and followed by a question mark (“who shot down MH17?”), the question is whether the “Aussie Cossak” plaintiff could “really” have joined the organisation accused of the act, leaving the impression, for the ordinary reasonable reader, that these rebels are very likely to be the same rebels who shot down MH 17, an impression which is reinforced by the use of repetition throughout the article of these claims, particularly in the following four paragraphs, which are in bold text.
	
	
	These next four paragraphs describe the plaintiff as someone who is “said to be fighting with pro-Russian rebels” and under ASIO surveillance, and that these “separatists” are “accused of shooting down doomed flight MH17” (paragraph 4). The reader is told that the plaintiff is being monitored by ASIO after he flew to the Ukraine to support these pro-Russian separatists who are, as the caption under the photograph (paragraph 9) states, “the same rebels accused of downing MH17”. The reader is then told that, not only has the plaintiff joined the rebels, but that he has “put out a call for others to join him in the fighting overseas”.
	
	
	These allegations are repeated in the caption under the photograph (“said to have taken up arms overseas fighting with pro-Russian separatists, the same rebels accused of downing MH 17”) and in paragraph 10:
	


“The separatists he claims to have flown overseas to assist have been blamed for the downing of fatal Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 which was shot down over eastern Ukraine almost two weeks ago.”


	
	Paragraphs 11 and 26 contain an additional element inferring responsibility for the shooting down, in that they refer to the fighting in the area surrounding the MH17 crash site; this fighting “has halted any international investigation” (paragraph 26) and prevented retrieval of the victims’ bodies (paragraph 11). The plaintiff is described as being in this region (named Donetsk – see paragraph 8) “with a two-star Russian general” (see the photo caption which is paragraph 13 of the matter complained of), and the fact that he “would not confirm” this to the Daily Telegraph is put in a context where doubt is placed on the plaintiff’s veracity.
	
	
	The photographs show the plaintiff on horseback with a sword and shooting a gun while wearing camouflage clothing and in company with similarly-attired shooters. The final photograph shows soldiers in camouflage with machine guns, one of whom is wearing a mask. Those soldiers are identified by inference as soldiers in the MH 17 crash area. This further underlines the theme that there is fighting in the MH 17 crash area, that the plaintiff is involved, that the rebels preventing access to the crash site are suspected of shooting the plane down, in circumstances where the inference is that the plaintiff must know about these matters.
	
	
	The matter complained of links these allegations to paint a stark picture of the plaintiff as someone who not only flew to the Ukraine to support these separatists and “put a call out for others to join him in the fighting overseas” (paragraph 7), but who has been “fighting” in an area where the pro-Russian rebels who are accused of downing MH 17 are making it impossible MH 17 crash investigators to do their work. His claims that he is “not a threat” (paragraph 21) are, like his denials of being “in Donetsk with a two-star Russian general”, put to the reader in a context where reasonable minds may differ as to whether the reader would accept what the plaintiff asserted.
	
	
	The role of the headline is particularly important. The hint of derision in the headline, arising from the question mark, quotes and use of the word “really” is reminiscent of the matter complained of (“It is beyond understanding. Or is it?”) in Jones v Skelton [1963] 3 All E R 952 at 959, where Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest explained:
	


“The question mark might convey to the reasonable reader the thought and the meaning that there had been some impropriety. The reader, a jury might conclude, was invited to adopt a suspicious approach and so to be guided to the real explanation of what had taken place—an explanation which the writer of the letter did not care or did not dare to express in direct terms. It was therefore open to a jury to decide that a reasonable reader would conclude that the plaintiff had brought improper influence (short of corruption) to bear on his fellow councillors.”


	
	Taking all of the above features of the matter complained of into account, this imputation is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation 3(d)


	
	The defendant submits, and I agree, that an imputation of suspicion of conduct cannot arise at the same time as an imputation of being guilty of the conduct alleged. Imputation 3(d) should be pleaded as a fall-back imputation to imputation 3(a).
	


References to “Australian citizen”


	
	The defendant’s solicitors in their letter of 27 August 2015 complain about the use of the term “Australian citizen” in the imputations where the matter complained of “does not state this”.
	
	
	It is unusual for a defendant to object to the use of a word or phrase on the basis that the matter complained of does not refer to it. The manner in which a defamatory sting is best encapsulated is often contained in words which do not appear in the matter complained of but which summarise its content accurately.
	
	
	Repeated references to Australian subject-matter are to be found in almost every paragraph of the matter complained of. These include calling the plaintiff “Australian-born” (paragraphs 2 and 6) and “Aussie” (paragraph 1), references to the plaintiff’s home in Sydney and to the Cossack society in Australia (paragraphs 7, 19, 20, 24, 28), descriptions of the laws of Australia (paragraphs 3, 8, 20, 21 and 22) and the references to the deployment of Australian Federal Police Officers in the Ukraine area (paragraphs 14 and 30) and the involvement of the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (paragraph 29). The whole tenor of the matter complained of make it clear that ASIO is “keeping tabs” on the plaintiff because he is an Australian citizen who has travelled to a foreign warzone to support pro-Russian separatists and call for others to join him in the fighting overseas. In those circumstances, the use of the words “Australian citizen” is an essential part of the sting of the imputations. The defendant’s application to strike out these words from the imputations on the basis of capacity is dismissed.
	


Costs


	
	The parties have each had a measure of success in this argument and accordingly each party should pay his or its own costs.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.30 imputation 3(b) struck out.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 28.3 imputation 3(c) is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	
	
	Imputation 3(d) is to be pleaded as a fall-back imputation to imputation 3(a).
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.30 the defendant’s objections to the use of the words “Australian citizen” in the imputations is dismissed; pursuant to UCPR r 28.3, imputations containing this term are capable of arising.
	
	
	All remaining imputations not challenged will go to the jury.
	
	
	Each party pay his or its own costs.
	
	
	Plaintiff’s amended Statement of Claim filed and served in 7 days.
	
	
	Plaintiff respond to defendant’s request for further and better particulars in 7 days.
	
	
	Proceedings relisted for directions on 10 September 2015 at 2 pm; note that the defendant may bring an application to strike out any continued claim for special damages in the statement of claim if the request for particulars of these is not answered.
	
	
	Note the defendant has served a Notice of Intention to Elect Trial by Jury in these proceedings.

2767602,Boikov v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 193,"Judgment


	
	These are my reasons for rulings on the form (r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”)) and capacity (UCPR r 28.3) concerning the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff as arising from a series of publications upon which the plaintiff seeks damages for defamation.
	
	
	The parties agree that the relevant principles in relation to the capacity of the matter complained of to convey imputations are as set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], and that the relevant principles in relation to the need for precision in imputations are as set out in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 2 NSWLR 135 at 137 and in Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].
	
	
	These issues must be considered separately for each of the publications, which consist of a Daily Telegraph newspaper article (the first matter complained of), the website publication of the newspaper article (the second matter complained of), the newspaper editorial (the third matter complained of), a website publication (the fourth matter complained of, which is not the subject of challenge), an article in the Australian (the fifth matter complained of) and the website publication of this article (the sixth matter complained of). However, the effectively identical nature of the print and website publications means that, for convenience, my rulings may relate to the same imputations pleaded for each such publication where there is no difference in the text.
	


The first matter complained of – The Daily Telegraph Newspaper


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the first matter complained of are as follows (paragraph 6 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to join the pro-Russian separatists.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to Russia with hate.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, flew to the Ukraine to recruit support for the pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, supports the pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, condones the shooting down of flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is reasonably suspected by ASIO of having travelled to the Ukraine for the purpose of fighting with the pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is a traitor to his country because he sought to fight in a foreign conflict.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, called for people to take up arms.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian rebels.
	
	
	The plaintiff committed a criminal act punishable by 20 years jail when he went to the Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian rebels.
	


The second matter complained of – The Telegraph Website


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the second matter complained of are as follows (paragraph 8 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to join the Ukrainian separatists.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to Russia with hate.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, flew to the Ukraine to recruit support for the pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, supports the pro-Russian rebels accused of shooting down flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, condones the shooting down of flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is reasonably suspected by ASIO of having travelled to the Ukraine for the purpose of fighting with the pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is a traitor to his country because he sought to fight in a foreign conflict.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, called for people to take up arms.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, travelled to the Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian rebels.
	
	
	The plaintiff committed a criminal act punishable by 20 years jail when he went to the Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian rebels.
	



	
	At the commencement of the argument the plaintiff conceded that imputations 6(a) and 8(a) should be struck out, and I have noted this in my rulings. The remaining imputations under challenge are imputations 6(b) and 8(b), 6(e) and 8(e) and 6(f) and 8(f).
	


Imputation 6(b) and 8(b)


	
	This imputation is drawn from the headline “ASIO tracks Aussie’s trip to Russia with hate”. This headline is a somewhat laboured play on words for the name of the 1963 James Bond film “From Russia with Love”. (That title was intended to be ironic, as the film was made at the height of the Cold War, when there was little love lost between Russia and the West.) While the phrase has not achieved the status of a saying warranting its inclusion in any dictionary, it is a phrase generally connoting something to do with Russia, but otherwise without any definable meaning.
	
	
	The difficulty is how to extract a meaning from this headline in the context of the matter complained of. Counsel for the defendant submits that, while the use of the actual words from the matter complained of may be permitted where those words accurately encapsulate the sting of the libel, this is not one of those occasions, relying upon Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [121]. As Hunt A-JA explained:
	


“[121] In Petritsis, Samuels JA said (at 191) that imputations will invariably be a distillation rather than a restatement of the words which were published. That this must be so is a necessary consequence of the facts that (a) words are but instruments by which people express and convey their meaning (Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd, at 266), but that (b) outside of legal documents, it is recognised that the words used by people are imprecise instruments for that purpose: Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd at 171. Very rarely is the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff expressly stated in the matter complained of, rather is it more usually implied or to be inferred: Jones v Skelton [1963] SR 644 at 650. The charge is often to be read only between the lines (Lewis at 258), or by insinuation (Ibid at 280), or it may be so near the surface that it is hardly hidden at all, or it may be more difficult to detect: Ibid at 278. But what is clear, beyond the possibility of any contradiction, is that in very few cases will the words of the matter complained of plainly identify the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff of which he complains.

[122] In Feros v West Sydney Radio Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, 22 June 1982, unreported), Samuels JA (with whom Moffitt P and Reynolds JA agreed) said (at 5):

“It is not always sufficient that an imputation should repeat the language of the matter published. Sometimes that will be enough, but more often an imputation must distil rather than recapitulate.”

Samuels JA went on to say (at 6):

“There are two matters of general relevance which the proceedings raise. It is essential that imputations should be clear and precise. This standard will often not be met merely by adopting the language of the matter published. It must be borne in mind that the purpose of an imputation is to specify the meaning which the language of the matter, which may be imprecise or rambling and prolix, is alleged to convey. I add also that the elucidation of the meaning of an imputation should not be left to an application for particulars. Hence an imputation may need to be couched in terms significantly different from those which the matter employs. Further, a plaintiff may rely upon as many imputations as he desires, provided that they do not infringe the requirements of Pt 67 r 11(3). This subrule does not justify or entail rolling up a number of separate and independent defamatory assertions into one imputation.””


	
	This warning about the limitations placed upon the entitlement of a plaintiff to use the exact words of the matter complained of has been cited and followed many times (see, for example, Waller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 611 at [21]). Its precise application may vary; as McCallum J noted in Haddad v Nationwide News Pty Ltd; Cheikho v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 2027 at [9]:
	


“That jurisprudence is easy to record, but more difficult in the application. There is always room for argument as to the extent to which a clear defamatory sting is captured in words lifted from the matter complained of, or whether the plaintiff must go further in distilling the sense in which those words would be understood by the ordinary reasonable reader.”


	
	McCallum J considered, as do I, that the answer is to be found by applying the principles set out by Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 137. The task is to determine whether the imputation using the actual wording is sufficiently clear, both for pre-trial and trial purposes, in putting the defendant and the tribunal of fact on notice as to the particular act or condition the plaintiff alleges is attributed to him, and the resolution of this issue is effected by careful consideration of the language of the matter complained of.
	
	
	The difficulty is that the term “to Russia with hate” does not convey with precision any act or condition. Mr Rasmussen agrees that the matter complained of does not indicate the persons or organisations for whom the plaintiff feels hate, or even that hatred is felt, but submits that the reference to “hate” in the headline gives rise to an imputation of “to Russia with hate” in the same way as Gleeson CJ’s poster “X is disgusting” gives rise to an imputation in those terms. Beyond that, Mr Rasmussen submitted, the court should not require any further precision, arguing “the river cannot rise higher than its source”.
	
	
	I do not accept that submission. The imputation, in its present form, fails to reveal to anyone, and not merely the ordinary reasonable reader, what the meaning complained of is; even Mr Rasmussen could not identify it. The imputation in its current form therefore has a tendency to cause embarrassment in the pleadings and should be struck out pursuant to UCPR r 14.28.
	


Imputations 6(e) and 8(e)


	
	The matter complained of clearly states that the pro-Russian rebels the plaintiff has joined are accused of shooting down MH 17, and that Cossacks have close links to Russian President Putin, as they have become his “unofficial shock troops” (paragraph 7). However, the plaintiff is described as questioning why the investigators were there, as “There was no reason why Russia would shoot down a plane”. He states that it was “very disgusting” of the Prime Minister to “jump to conclusions and start accusing Russia”. The clear inference is that the plaintiff does not accept that the plane was shot down by the Russian side of the conflict in the Ukraine, not that he condoned the shooting down of the plane by the Russians (or by any other organisation, including the pro-Russian rebels he had joined) on Russia’s behalf.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen made two alternative submissions as to capacity. The first was that the plaintiff was merely saying that the Russians did not shoot the plane down, and not the pro-Russian rebels he had joined. If so, he could be taken to have condoned what the pro-Russian rebels did while complaining about the Prime Minister jumping to conclusions and accusing Russia. I find this submission convoluted and self-contradictory, and to involve an exercise in leaps of imagination well outside the capacity of the ordinary reasonable reader, even a loose-thinking one, to perform.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen’s second submission was that, while the contents of paragraph 11 were antidote, the rest of the matter complained of was bane: Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd at [142]. However, the plaintiff repeatedly states that he has not broken any Australian laws and that he was just there to “help people” (paragraph 12), and others state that his military experience has been “part of his training” in Australia. The picture painted is one of the plaintiff as a naïve and foolish person, not of a person who condones the shooting down of a civilian aircraft. This is not a case of bane and antidote; the clear message is that the plaintiff does not accept what the Prime Minister and others are saying (impliedly correctly) is true.
	
	
	As is noted below, whether an imputation of this kind arises will depend upon a careful examination of the text of the matter complained of. This is why I have come to a different conclusion about whether this imputation is conveyed by the editorial, which is more loosely worded and which excludes the statements made by the plaintiff set out in paragraph 11.
	
	
	This imputation is not capable of being conveyed and will be struck out.
	


Imputations 6(f) and 8(f)


	
	An imputation that a plaintiff is guilty of an act cannot arise at the same time as an imputation that the plaintiff is reasonably suspected of an act. Either one or the other is conveyed, and the correct method of pleading such imputations is for the imputation of suspicion to be pleaded as a “fall-back” imputation. Accordingly imputations 6(f) and 8 (f) will be pleaded as fall-backs to imputations 6(i) and 8(i).
	


The remaining imputations


	
	Those imputations not the subject of challenge will go to the jury.
	
	
	A challenge was made to the use of the term “Australian citizen” in these imputations, as well as in the imputations pleaded for other publications. Since these matters complained of describe the plaintiff’s conduct as “un-Australian” (paragraph 18), this argument was raised in a somewhat faint fashion. For the same reasons as are set out in the judgment Boikov v Dailymail.com Australia Pty Ltd [2015] NSWDC 192, I reject these submissions. All imputations will go to the jury with the term “Australian citizen” included where those words have been included in the drafting. 
	
	
	This brings me to the challenges to the imputations in the third matter complained of, namely the Editorial.
	


The third matter complained of – The Editorial, Daily Telegraph


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the third matter complained of are as follows (paragraph 10 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff flew to the Ukraine to fight.
	
	
	The plaintiff is under ASIO watch because he flew to the Ukraine in order to join the pro-Russian rebels.
	
	
	The plaintiff condones the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s participation in the fighting in the Ukraine is dangerous for Australia.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s participation in the fighting in the Ukraine is dangerous for Australia because it inevitably brings those conflicts to our own land.
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by the Editor of the Daily Telegraph of having broken the laws of Australia by travelling to the Ukraine to fight in a foreign war.
	
	
	The plaintiff is reasonably suspected by ASIO of having broken the laws of Australia by travelling to the Ukraine to fight in a foreign war.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a terrorist of the same class as Islamic militants fighting in Syria and Iraq.
	



	
	The imputations challenged are imputations 10 (c), (f) and (g). I formally note that all other imputations will go to the jury, as will the imputations from the fourth matter complained of, which are not the subject of challenge.
	


Imputation (c)


	
	The message in this short editorial is written in different terms to those of the first and second matters complained of, and it is important not to conflate the texts of these publications.
	
	
	The headline and following three paragraphs discuss the “deeply worrying development” of Australians joining foreign militias, including local members of the Russian community “joining the fighting in the Ukraine”, “particularly” as “the very group” supported by the plaintiff being “understood to be responsible for shooting down” MH 17. The editorial ends by extending the same plea to the Russian community as the newspaper had previously extended to “our Islamic community”.
	
	
	I agree with the defendant’s submissions that the use of the word “condone” requires knowledge of the act. The description in paragraph 4 of the concern arising “particularly because” the very group the plaintiff has joined is understood to be responsible is sufficient, on a capacity basis, to convey an imputation that the plaintiff knew about (and thus condoned) the shooting down, in that he not only joined the group but remains there.
	
	
	This imputation is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	


Imputation (f)


	
	Is it defamatory to say that a person is reasonably suspected by the Editor of the Daily Telegraph of having broken the laws of Australia?
	
	
	In Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671, Hutley JA explained the reasons why it was imperative for the holder of the suspicion to be identified as a person with sufficient authority to render the suspicion defamatory:
	


“An accusation from certain quarters may be a compliment, or at least carry no reflection upon the reputation of the accused. The cases in which the defamatory import of accusations have arisen are all where the accusation was by legitimate authorities. Thus, in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234, the defamatory meaning was that the plaintiffs were suspected by the police (see at 239).

In Lang v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1970] 2 NSWR 408, the defamatory meaning was alleged to arise out of an actual criminal trial; in Rochfort v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1972] 1 NSWLR 16, the alleged defamation arose out of a criminal charge; in Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (1982) 56 ALJR 808; 42 ALR 487, the defamatory material was in the report of a police investigation, arrest and expected charge. It would seem to me that the identification of the persons making the accusation is not a mere matter for particulars; for a report of making an accusation to be capable of defamatory meaning, it must identify the accusation coming from some authority whose status can make it stick without more.

A more difficult issue is presented by imputation (h). I would think that it is at least open to a jury to infer that the status of a Royal Commission is such that a report that a person has been accused by it is defamatory, unless justified.”


	
	Imputations of suspicion generally refer to suspicions by police or serious investigatory bodies such as the ICAC. An accusation from the Editor of the Daily Telegraph may not necessarily be a compliment, but it would be insufficient to reflect upon the reputation of the plaintiff.
	
	
	This imputation is incapable of being defamatory and is struck out.
	


Imputation (g)


	
	The capacity of this imputation is not challenged; what is argued is that it should be pleaded as a fall-back to imputation (a). It is, however, an imputation of conduct very different to (a), in that it refers to being reasonably suspected by ASIO, and is thus capable of arising at the same time as imputation (a),
	


The fifth matter complained of – The Australian


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the fifth matter complained of are as follows (paragraph 14 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, trained with rebels in Donetsk, Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is waging war in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is one of the mystery rebels keeping the Australian Federal Police from collecting human remains and evidence from the MH17 crash site.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is fighting with pro-Russian fighters in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, has committed a serious crime by going to fight in the war in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, by waging war in the Ukraine is no better than the Jihadists fighting in the Middle East.
	


The sixth matter complained of – The Australian Website


	
	The imputations pleaded to arise from the sixth matter complained of are as follows (paragraph 16 of the statement of claim):
	



	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, trained with rebels in Donetsk, Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is waging war in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is one of the mystery rebels keeping the Australian Federal Police from collecting human remains and evidence from the MH17 crash site.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, is fighting with pro-Russian fighters in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, has committed a serious crime by going to fight in the war in the Ukraine.
	
	
	The plaintiff, an Australian citizen, by waging war in the Ukraine is no better than the Jihadists fighting in the Middle East.
	



	
	The imputations challenged are imputations (b) and (d). I formally note that all other imputations will go to the jury, noting as well as my earlier findings concerning the use of the term “Australian citizen”.
	


Imputations (b) and (d)


	
	The defendant submits that these imputations do not differ in substance and Mr Rasmussen, effectively conceding as much, selected imputation (d). Imputation (b) is accordingly struck out.
	


Special damages and Costs


	
	The defendant sought particulars of the claim referred to as “special damages”.
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen said that the claim for special damages appeared to have been inserted in error, but submitted that his client should be allowed to leave it in, in case such a claim was made. His client was overseas and difficult to contact.
	
	
	If no particulars of special damages are provided in accordance with the timetable provided in the orders, the defendant will be entitled to seek to have it struck out.
	
	
	The defendant enjoyed considerably greater success than the plaintiff in these rulings.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28 imputations 6(a) and 8(a) are struck out.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28, imputation 6(b) and 8(b) are struck out.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 28.3, imputations 6(e) and 8(e) are not capable of being conveyed and will be struck out.
	
	
	Imputations 6(f) and 8(f) are to be pleaded as fall-back imputations to imputations 6(i) and 8(i).
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 28.3 imputation 10(c) is capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 28.3 imputation 10(f) is not capable of being defamatory and is struck out.
	
	
	The defendant’s objections to imputation 10(g) pursuant to UCPR r 14.30 are dismissed.
	
	
	Pursuant to UCPR r 14.28 imputations 14(b) and 16(b) are struck out.
	
	
	All remaining imputations not challenged will go to the jury.
	
	
	The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs of and incidental to the argument today.
	
	
	Amended statement of claim in 7 days.
	
	
	Proceedings stood over for directions to 10 September 2015 at 2 pm, noting that the defendant may join in the application to strike out any claim for special damages unless such claim is particularised.

2767647,R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2015] NSWSC 1299,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused have each applied to restrict or confine the Crown case to misrepresentations referred to by the Crown in the Crown’s opening. The burden of the application is that each of the accused has been misled by the scope of the opening to believe, and to conduct their respective cases so far based upon the belief, that the Crown had abandoned so much of its case as had not at that time specifically been mentioned. That is said to be so notwithstanding the extensive anterior written particularisation of the Crown case over some years preceding the commencement of the trial. The Crown’s response to the application has been to contend that the opening presented to the jury was no more and no less than a summary of the case that the jury might be expected to hear, and that detailed reference to the precise terms of every representation upon which the Crown relied in support of its case was not, and should not be taken to have been, a modification of the case that has long been known to the accused and their legal advisers. For the reasons that follow, I consider that the Crown’s position on this application is unassailable and that the application should be refused.
	


Background


	
	The Crown presented an indictment charging:
	


“Between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 December 2002 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere [the accused] did conspire with each other and divers other persons with the intention of dishonestly influencing a Commonwealth public official, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, in the exercise of his duties as a public official.”


	
	In brief compass, Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy were respectively the legal and accounting architects of tax minimisation schemes promoted for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 tax years. Although the schemes had various differences in each of these years, they were in essence all designed to provide participants with a tax deduction in the relevant year of $500,000 for an initial cash outlay of only $125,000 or 25 percent of the proposed total contribution. The money was to be used for the production of whisky in a Scottish distillery. The unpaid sum of $375,000 in each case was to be financed by a loan secured by promissory note payable in twelve years and drawn on what was described as a finance company by the name of Chambers Finance Limited.
	
	
	In the years in which the schemes were current and thereafter, Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy became engaged in discussions with the Australian Taxation Office about them. Participation in the schemes had been promoted upon the basis of the tax deductible status of both the cash contributions as well as the loan funds. In the events that occurred, the Australian Taxation Office did not issue a favourable Product Ruling for any of the schemes and declined to acknowledge that the contributions to the schemes were deductible. The Crown alleges that in the course of what amounted to negotiations between the Australian Taxation Office on the one hand and Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy on the other hand concerning the refusal to grant tax deductible status to the participants’ contributions, Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy conspired between themselves and with others to make statements to the Commissioner or his representatives that were false and dishonestly intended to influence the Commissioner.
	
	
	The relevant Crown Case Statement was filed on 1 April 2011. It contains as many as 48 alleged misrepresentations between [316] and [363]. Some of these are no longer pursued.
	
	
	On 19 March 2012 the Crown prepared and provided to the accused a document entitled “Outline of the case the Crown will present at trial.” Paragraphs 1 to 10 inclusive of that document are as follows:
	


“Object and substance of the conspiracy

1. Essentially the Crown case concerns an agreement to make false representations to tax officers in the course of an audit by the Australian Taxation Office (‘ATO’).

2. Ross Edward Seller and Patrick David McCarthy together with Phillip Egglishaw and Philip de Figueiredo entered into an agreement to make false representations to officers of the ATO with the intention of dishonestly influencing them to approve and accept deductions claimed in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 income tax returns of taxpayers who had participated in whisky schemes in these years. The representations were to convey false and misleading information regarding:

(i) the association of the accused with and the relationship between the entities involved in the schemes;

(ii) Chambers Finance Limited and

(iii) Grant McKenzie Hong Kong Limited.

The tax audit in which the misrepresentations were made

3. To establish the significance and context of the alleged misrepresentations the Crown will prove the nature and details of the tax minimisation schemes which came under investigation by the ATO in the period 2000-2003 inclusive.

4. Annexed to this outline are three diagrams of what the Crown intends to prove in this regard. (NB: These diagrams are revised versions of similar diagrams provided to the defence on 3 February 2012. They are in draft and may be amended in minor respects prior to the commencement of the trial).

5. To prove these transactions the Crown intends to tender a folder containing transaction documents for each of the three years in which the schemes were implemented, which support the description of the schemes shown in the diagrams.

6. These transaction documents have been examined by Quincy Tang, of the ATO, who will be a witness at the trial. Mr Tang has also analysed transaction documents which record the funds flows and the quantity of whisky actually produced each year. The Crown does not intend to tender all of the documents examined by Mr Tang, just sufficient to support his conclusions and to verify the correctness of the diagrams.

The subjects of the misrepresentations

7. The Crown will prove that when the ATO was investigating the deductibility of the participants’ contributions to these schemes, in particular during the calendar years 2001 and 2002, information was sought from both Seller and McCarthy.

8. The Crown expects to prove that they conspired with each other (and other persons) to provide false and misleading information to the ATO auditors, particularly Mr Michael Walsh.

9. The case will endeavour to prove that the conspiracy was directed to the making of misrepresentations in relation to the following two companies (whose status and role were of importance to the ATO auditors in the conduct of the investigation). In particular the conspiracy concerned misrepresentations about the following aspects of the companies:

(i) Chambers Finance Limited:

(a) whether it was a bona fide finance company;

(b) whether it was independent of the promoters and managers and of the schemes;

(c) whether it was independent of other entities involved in the schemes.

(ii) Grant McKenzie Hong Kong Limited:

(a) the nature of the company’s undertaking and activities and its background;

(b) whether it was independent of the promoters and managers of the scheme.

10. These two companies were of importance to the ATO in relation to the determination of how the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (C’th) and/or the 1987 Act applied and in particular whether the provisions of Part IVA of the 1936 Act applied.”


	
	Paragraph 11 of that document then proceeded to outline a very detailed particularisation of the several overt acts that are alleged by the Crown to constitute the conspiracy. Each of these particularised acts is cross-referenced to a nominated paragraph in the Crown Case Statement. There are 26 such acts particularised in this way. It is impractical to include the detail of this paragraph in these reasons.
	
	
	Following receipt of that document the Crown also provided particulars of the basis upon which it asserted that the alleged representations referred to in paragraph 11 of its outline were said to be false. Those particulars of falsity were provided in the following terms:
	


“Particulars of falsity

In relation to Chambers Finance Limited (‘Chambers’):

(a) the representations conveyed the false impression that Chambers was a financier, whereas in fact Chambers:

(i) was not a financier;

(ii) had no assets;

(iii) had no funds under management;

(iv) had no assets under management;

(v) had no ability to fund the loans;

(b) the representations conveyed the false impression that Chambers was based in the United Kingdom and was similar to a merchant bank, whereas in fact Chambers:

(i) was a shelf company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands;

(ii) was not independent of other parties to the arrangement;

(d) the representations conveyed the false impression that GMHK had agreed to have the initial cost divided into a cash component and to use a funding arrangement in order to increase the production of whisky that would otherwise have been possible, whereas in fact:

(i) no loan funds were contributed towards the production of the whisky;

(ii) no loan funds were advanced to the venture.”   


	
	By comparison with these details and particulars, the Crown opened the case to the jury in terms that included the following:
	


“The representations relate to a number of subject matters. I will tell you about them now. They will probably make a little bit more sense a little later when I show you some documents including some diagrams that include company names and flow charts which show the relationship between these companies but to give you the headlines now so you can see where we are going with this case, the headlines really are that the misrepresentations related to two companies and so there were effectively two groups of representations. Thirdly, representations in relation to the independents of the companies and individuals involved in these whiskey schemes so in effect three categories of representations.

The first of those relates to a company called Chambers Finance Limited and I expect you will hear that mentioned numerous times during this trial. The representations in relation to Chambers Finance Ltd were whether or not that company was a bona fide finance company. Bona fide is another way of saying real legitimate finance company. In addition there were representations made about whether or not Chambers Finance was independent of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy. The promoters of these schemes, independent of some of these companies who you see on the flow charts are the managers of the schemes and independent of the other entities involved in these Tax Minimisation schemes. So in effect was Chambers Finance a finance company and, secondly. Was it independent?

The second one relates to Grant McKenzie Hong Kong. Grant McKenzie Hong Kong. The representations in relation to this company again relate to whether or not it was independent of the promoters and managers of these schemes and, secondly, the nature and background of that company's business. Thirdly, the third general category of representations, is whether or not the other entities involved in these schemes and there are a number of companies both here, in Hong Kong, and registered in the British Virgin Islands, whether or not those entities were all independent of one another.

…

Mr Seller also told the Tax Office in his correspondence following requests for information about Chambers Finance he said in his letter Chambers Finance provided vendor finance for the project and that that finance was for the payments due to Speyside Distillery. In other words he represented the finance component was paid or to be paid to Speyside Distillery. The Crown says that is a representation you would have seen from the document that is showing the flow of funds in red going to Scotland but none of the finance funds going to Scotland that that representation was not true. Other things were said by Mr Seller in this letter and you will eventually see that when it goes into evidence, I am not omitting those now because it is not important, but I am highlighting the most significant parts.

…

You will see paragraph 41 that once Mr Seller became aware of an audit in relation to the affairs of some of his participant taxpayers he wrote a letter on 5 June and that letter, you will see towards the top of page 9, has some relevant representations in it about the finances controlled by an independent third party. I expect the evidence will establish that Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy were in fact the controllers of Chambers Finance and in fact there was some evidence that they drafted letters on behalf of Chambers Finance.

He also represented these finance arrangements were at arm’s length, you will see that in B, the financing was not between related parties, there was no connection between the parties and relevantly in E, almost all of the contribution of the participants was expended on production.

Those terms ‘expended on production’, can I suggest, when compared with the agreement, production refers to production of whiskey, that is almost all of the $500,000 misrepresented went into whiskey.

I am not going to take you through all of these paragraphs, some are less significant than others but can I take you to paragraph 43 where we see Mr McCarthy first dealing with the Tax Office. He sent an email to Mr Walsh, the auditor, commenting on a draft report. You see amongst other things Mr McCarthy said Grant McKenzie Hong Kong was controlled independently. He told the Tax Office that that company had expertise into the whiskey industries and dealing with distilleries.

Paragraph C of paragraph 43, you will see Mr McCarthy represented Grant McKenzie agreed to have the initial cost and that term is defined in the agreements to be the $500,000, the total amount, divided into two, that is cash component and to use the funding agreement. Relevantly, you will see Mr McCarthy told the Tax Office this was done to increase the production.

“Production"", can I suggest to you, once you have seen the documents, can only be a reference to producing whiskey, in other words he was representing that the cash component and the finance both went to the production of whiskey. The Crown says that was a misrepresentation. No finance found its way into whiskey barrels.

In D, the funding agreement was for the purpose of significantly increasing production. Representations in E about control and in F relevantly that Chambers Finance was independent and linked to other parties only by contractual arrangements.

…

To paragraph 59, on 5 November 2002, Mr Seller prepared a letter that went to the Tax Office that referred, the Crown says, relevantly to the costs of raw materials in the production of whiskey. Commissions and all other expenses were paid for using the funds both contributed in cash and using the financing arrangement.

I emphasise now and when you get the document, I will emphasise again, the cost of raw materials and other things were paid for at least in part using the financing arrangement. With respect, that representation was false because the financing arrangement did not contribute at all to any raw materials as you will have seen from the flow chart which showed only the cash component, the 25% found its way to Speyside and Mr Seller also indicated it was incorrect the funds borrowed were not available to be advanced to the venture.

…

All of which, the Crown says, at the time they made the representations, they knew were untrue. The Crown also says that Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy involved others in their dishonesty including Strachans, Mr Egglishaw, Mr De Figueiredo and Mr Robinson, who they asked to sign letters on the letterhead of Grant McKenzie Hong Kong and others to make representations on their behalf they knew were untrue and would be used to mislead the Tax Office.

…

The Crown case is that you can infer from their conduct, from their letters, from their dealings with the Tax Office that they were acting together and that they were acting in accordance with this agreement to send misleading information to the Tax Office.

…

In addition to those communications, the Crown will rely on the knowledge that Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy had from their dealings with the Tax Office that the Tax Office would play some significance in these issued, that they were asking these questions about the finance, about Grant McKenzie Hong Kong for a reason relevant to the audit, in other words Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy knew that these questions were important to the Tax Office and that their answers had to be honest. In that context, can I suggest to you it is important that you take into account Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy are people of some sophistication.”


	
	The particulars upon which the Crown relies were also referred to in other documents exchanged with the legal representatives for Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy but none is critical to the present analysis.
	


Submissions of Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy


	
	The burden of the proposition advanced for Mr Seller and Mr McCarthy is that the opening failed to refer to some particulars in terms or at all or that it failed to make clear that the references that were in fact made to arguably incorrect and therefore misleading statements were all to be relied upon as part of the Crown case in any event. In support of that argument, reliance was placed upon Danny Mok (1987) 27 A Crim R 438 at 439ff:
	


“More importantly, the way in which the conspiracy was ultimately left to the jury by the trial judge was not how the case was apparently opened by the Crown Prosecutor…

An accused person is entitled to have identified with precision the transaction upon which the Crown relies; he is entitled to be apprised not only of the overt acts alleged but also the legal nature of the charge against him and the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge: Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 489, 495, 501-502. A charge of conspiracy does not differ in this respect from any other charge. The accused is unable properly to plead to a charge unless he knows what is the precise case which is the basis for the charge preferred against him…He can hardly plead to a charge of conspiracy unless he knows precisely with whom it is going to be alleged that he conspired and the scope of the conspiracy alleged.

It has long been considered a cardinal requirement of the criminal law that an accused should be given proper particulars, and the courts possess an inherent authority to require the Crown to furnish particulars of the charge…

In a conspiracy case, each accused is entitled to particulars of the persons with whom it is going to be alleged that he conspired and as to the specific scope of the conspiracy alleged. Even where the particulars are not sought, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the Crown Prosecutor to give those particulars in the course of his opening address – at the latest.”


	
	The accused contended that it would lead to a miscarriage of justice if the Crown were now permitted to rely upon matters not opened on as matters about which the accused are alleged to have made deliberately false representations with the intention of influencing a public official.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown emphasised that detailed particulars of representations have been provided over the course of the six year history of these proceedings. They have been unambiguous and consistent. The outline referred to at [6] above cannot be read in isolation. The document as a whole makes it clear that the categories of representation to which it refers are all separately relied upon and that the introductory summary does not, and is clearly not intended to, derogate from its operative effect that is otherwise apparent from reading it.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there could never be grounds for complaint that the Crown had failed in any relevant respect to particularise the case adequately or sufficiently. He submitted that the case had in fact been particularised ‘”to within an inch of its life.”
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that there had been no departure from the particularised case in the course of the opening. The Crown opened to the jury on the basis that the representations fell into groups according to their corporate subject matter. This was clear at least from the written aide memoire provided to the jury in the course of the opening to which the Crown referred and to which the accused did not object. The Crown emphasised that it did not expressly or by implication limit itself in opening the case to only some of the particularised representations. So much is said to be clear from the transcript extracted above.
	
	
	The Crown contended in these circumstances that there could be no genuine doubt about the case that the accused had to meet. In any event, both Mr Walsh and Mr Maloney from the Australian Taxation Office were cross-examined by counsel for the accused in detail upon the credit facilities, the promissory notes and the drawing requests. If representations concerning any of these issues were thought to be outside the particularised case it was never suggested to these witnesses that this was so. The issue of whether or not and when the obligation fell upon Chambers Finance Ltd to pay money secured by the promissory note was squarely raised in that cross-examination. That suggested that the accused were well aware of the significance and relevance of representations touching these issues.
	


Disposition


	
	In my opinion there is no answer to the Crown’s submissions. The Crown case has been particularised in exquisite detail over a long period. Documentary refinements of the allegations over time have only served to isolate and confine them with equal clarity. If the Crown opening created any surprise for the accused it was slow to materialise in the course of the trial and only became manifest in the terms of the present application.
	
	
	Mok and related cases support principles that are not in doubt. The facts of the present case do not, however, demonstrate any breach of or departure from those principles. I did not personally get an impression in listening to the Crown’s opening that the case being presented was in any sense a departure from that which the Crown case statement had outlined in very explicit terms. The conduct of the case on all sides since then has encouraged me in that view.
	
	
	This is not an example of what is perhaps the more usual defence complaint, that the Crown has opened its case too widely or that the evidence has not matched the opening rhetoric. On the contrary, the accused argue that they have been somehow led or misled into believing or assuming that the Crown had modified its case or abandoned parts of it. I do not accept that. The Crown opening was necessarily confined within acceptably economical limits to the structure of the case it proposed to make out. It was not required to refer in detail to each and every allegation, and certainly not by way of a detailed recitation of the case particulars. There has not in my opinion been any departure from what is acceptable in the circumstances.
	
	
	I am not prepared to accede to the application.

	The indicative sentences in the case of each of the applicants were reduced from what they otherwise would have been on account of the utilitarian value of their pleas of guilty. In Akbari's case, there was a 25 per cent reduction for counts 1 and 2 and 15 per cent for count 3. In Nasiri's case there was a 25 per cent reduction for both counts.
	
	
	Mr Akbari seeks leave to appeal against sentence upon the following grounds:
	


1   The learned judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant's mental illness

2   The learned judge erred in his consideration of the objective seriousness of count 1, the principal offence

3   The sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	Mr Nasiri seeks leave to appeal against sentence upon the following grounds:
	


1   His Honour erred in finding that the offenders had materially differing roles

2   His Honour erred in failing to give adequate weight to parity principles

3   His Honour erred in his finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 1

4   The sentence was manifestly excessive

Facts

Demand money in company with menaces


	
	The victim of this offence was an Afghan man who was the owner/operator of a smash repair business at Hornsby. On the evening of 13 July 2013 he received a call from a man who demanded $40,000 be paid within a week. The man said that he knew that the victim had a wife and children and threatened to blow up his shop. He warned the victim not to contact police as there would be consequences. He said ""they"" had 4000 foot soldiers; ""no one on the face of the earth"" could save him; ""they"" would hurt the victim; and they would blow up his shop. This call was made from a telephone service subscribed using a false name and address.
	
	
	Late on the night of 16 July 2013 the victim received a call from another phone subscribed with false identification details. The victim described the voice as the same as in the earlier call. He told the caller that he could not pay any money. He was told that if he wanted to know who ""they"" were, he should attend a meeting the following evening at North Granville. The victim agreed to do so in order to appease the caller. He had not reported the threats to police at this point because he feared reprisals.
	
	
	The victim attended the carpark of a fast food restaurant at North Granville on the evening of 17 July 2013 where he saw four males standing together. The victim was directed to approach them. The ensuing conversation included the men claiming that they were from the Brothers for Life criminal gang. Reference was made to the demand for $40,000. The victim protested that he could not afford to pay. He was told to go, but warned that ""we'll deal with you later"". He was told that he would be hurt; his shop would be blown up with him in it.
	
	
	One of the four males (“X”) was later identified and was charged. The victim said that he recognised his voice from the earlier phone calls.
	
	
	The victim received a call from X the following day (again from a phone subscribed with false information). He was asked whether he intended to pay the money. The victim terminated the call. He received a call from the same number two minutes later but he did not answer it.
	
	
	A third party reported the essence of these communications with the victim to the police and an investigation by the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad commenced. The victim was contacted but he said he did not wish to report the matter because he was fearful of reprisals.
	
	
	Almost six weeks later, on 26 August 2013, the applicants came to the victim’s workshop. They were wearing clothing with Brothers for Life insignia. The following exchange took place:
	


“Akbari:    I’ve got my friend here and we are here to speak to you

Nasiri:    You obviously know where we are from now. We are not here to intimidate you, we want to talk to you nicely. You meet with us and you know what this is about. You have to pay money. There were twenty of us who were ready to come down but I wanted to come and talk to you nicely about your final decision. You have two options you either pay us $10,000 in the next 24 hours and we will never come back, or you give us $1,000 a week for 15 weeks. I give you my word we won’t come back. 

Victim:    What are my other options?

Nasiri:    You don’t really have other options, this is it. We will be back in the next 24 hours and ask you what you want to do this time. 

Victim:    Alright I will see you in the next 24 hours.”


	
	After the applicants left the victim contacted a solicitor and arrangements were made for him to report the matter to police.
	
	
	The following day, 27 August, the applicants returned to the victim’s workshop. Nasiri, but not Akbari, was again wearing clothing with Brothers for Life insignia. Police surveillance was in place. Nasiri demanded that the victim pay $10,000 as a “donation”. When the victim told him he operated a small business and could not afford to pay, Nasiri told him to obtain a loan. He also told the victim that he had stopped “other people” from coming to the workshop. The victim repeated that he could not afford to pay and asked what would happen if he did not. Nasiri told him that this was “not going to end good”. Akbari said, “If I go to tell that to the big guy … I swear to the Koran it is not going to end good”. Nasiri told the victim that they would leave and go and speak to their leader. He also said that there were 300 of “them”.
	
	
	In a subsequent photographic identification procedure the victim identified the applicants as the persons involved in the events of 26 and 27 August. There was no evidence that they were involved in the earlier events.
	


Participate in criminal group


	
	The victim was told by X in the phone calls on 13 and 16 July 2013 and at the meeting at North Granville on 17 July that there were a number of people acting together to obtain money. X was in the company of three males when he met with the victim on 17 July. X was acting in concert as part of a criminal group with those males on 17 July and with the applicants on 26 and 27 August 2013 for the purpose of extorting money from the victim. The applicants and X all claimed to be part of the Brothers for Life gang and told the victim that people would be sent to either assault him or to damage his business premises unless he paid the money that was demanded.
	


Arrests


	
	Akbari was arrested when he reported to a police station on 11 September 2013 as part of bail conditions in respect of another matter.
	
	
	Nasiri was arrested at his home on 21 September 2013.
	


Accessory after the fact to aggravated robbery (Akbari only)


	
	This offence occurred at an earlier time; on 21 June 2012. The victim, in the company of his girlfriend, was engaged in the supply of a relatively small quantity of cannabis in the vicinity of a shopping area at Cherrybrook when the ""purchaser"" assaulted him and stole $90 worth of the substance and $10 from his wallet. Akbari was present when this occurred but the Crown accepted that he had no forewarning of the robbery. However, immediately after the principal offender had left, the following exchange occurred:
	


“Akbari:    “Our boss owns the pizza store, and he’s part of the Hells Angels and he’s getting pissed off with people stealing his business.”

Victim:    “OK.”

Akbari:    “What did you say?”

Victim:    “I said OK.”

Akbari:   “I don’t mind you coming for coffee or getting food at Cherrybrook Shops but if I ever see or hear about you dealing in Cherrybrook again, I’ll shoot you.””


	
	The statement of facts included that Akbari said this to deter the victim from reporting the incident to police and to hinder the apprehension of the principal offender.
	


Form 1 – Akbari – Intimidation (x 2)


	
	These offences relate to the intimidation of the victim and his girlfriend in relation to the robbery matter.
	


Form 1 – Nasiri – drive whilst suspended


	
	Nasiri’s driver’s licence was suspended on 30 July 2013. He was seen driving on 27 August 2013.
	


Personal circumstances – Akbari


	
	Akbari was born in Afghanistan in 1986, when the country was at war. Members of his family were killed in the conflict and he was exposed to violence from an early age. When he was 8 or 9 he was sexually assaulted by a stranger and claims to have experienced ongoing nightmares as a result of these assaults.  He came to Australia at the age of 16 in 2003 with his mother and four siblings. (His father had disappeared when he was 10 or 11.) He had problems adjusting to life in Australia because of his poor English skills. At school he was sometimes called a “terrorist”. He was expelled from school at the end of Year 11 for fighting.
	
	
	Akbari has a criminal record, although, prior to the present offences he had not been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In 2007 he appeared in the Local Court for driving offences. He has been convicted of resist police, drug offences, offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception, larceny and shoplifting. He was on bail for the robbery matter at the time of committing the demand money with menaces offence.
	
	
	A report of Dr Tom Jones, psychologist, was tendered at the sentence hearing. Akbari told Dr Jones that he started using marijuana at the age of 17 or 18 because he found that it helped him escape from painful feelings. On weekends he would binge on alcohol. In 2010 he started using the drug known as “ice” and occasionally cocaine. Over time, he became increasingly dependent upon ice and alcohol and would go to any lengths to obtain money to buy drugs.
	
	
	Akbari gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. He said that at the time of the present offending he became involved with Brothers for Life. He involved himself in some of their activities and they in turn supplied him with drugs. He told Dr Jones that he was willing to do whatever was asked of him in order to be accepted.
	
	
	Dr Jones diagnosed Akbari with post-traumatic stress disorder attributable to sexual abuse, wartime exposure and family disruption. He also found that in his mid to late teens Akbari developed a major depressive disorder and anxiety and that he met the criteria for a diagnosis of substance abuse.
	
	
	Akbari's brother-in-law, Mirwais Siddiqui, gave evidence that, while he had known Akbari for some years and had seen a lot of him, he had no idea he was using drugs or was associated with the Brothers for Life. He said that Akbari was the only member of the family to have been in trouble but that he had seen positive changes since he had been in custody and confirmed that the family was supportive of him.
	


Personal circumstances – Nasiri


	
	Nasiri was born in Afghanistan but fled to Pakistan with his parents and four siblings at a young age. The family settled in Australia in 2003 when Nasiri was 12 years old. He was enrolled in a mainstream high school but left in Year 10 to commence an apprenticeship as a panel beater which he did not complete.
	
	
	Nasiri has a criminal record, first appearing in the Children’s Court in 2007 for an offence of robbery in company. He was put on probation. In September 2011 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months for two counts of robbery in company. The present offences were committed when Nasiri was on parole. His parole was revoked and he served the balance of the term from 21 September 2013 until 15 March 2014.
	
	
	At the time of the offending Nasiri lived with his family. His father is in poor health after suffering a stroke. His father also suffers from Parkinson’s disease and depression.
	
	
	Nasiri told a probation and parole officer that he does not consider himself a member of Brothers for Life and that he does not have ongoing contact with any of its members.
	


The applicant Akbari

Ground 1 – Error in failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s mental illness


	
	Submissions on behalf of the applicant Akbari drew attention to the following passage from the judge's sentencing remarks where his Honour was discussing the applicant's conduct in relation Count 1:
	


""The offending by Mr Akbari occurred against a background of illicit drug use. Whilst drug taking may provide the context in which the offender associated with members of the 'Brothers for Life' criminal group, I am not of the view that drug taking significantly reduces the moral culpability of the offender. The conduct of the offender was purposeful. There is nothing before me upon which it could be concluded that the offender's judgment was significantly impaired.""


	
	The applicant accepted that his Honour's statement that drug taking did not, of itself, reduce moral culpability was in accordance with well-established sentencing principle. Reference was made to Dr Jones’ findings that Akbari suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had developed a major depressive disorder with associated anxiety in his mid to late teenage years.
	
	
	It was contended that these mental health issues led the applicant to turn to drug use which in turn led to him committing the present offences. The applicant submitted that this established a causal link between the applicant’s mental health issues and his offending which might make him a less suitable vehicle for general deterrence, or might indicate that a custodial term may weigh more heavily upon him. It was submitted that his Honour’s failure to give consideration to the applicant’s mental illness in those respects led his Honour into error.
	
	
	In the course of oral submissions, it was accepted by counsel for the applicant that these matters were not put to the sentencing judge. Nonetheless, the applicant maintained the submission on the basis that the applicant’s mental health issues were “front and centre” in the material before his Honour.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge’s consideration of the applicant’s mental health issues was entirely appropriate in light of the submissions made to him. Special circumstances were found on account of, inter alia, the applicant’s mental health issues and drug use. The Crown pointed out that the applicant’s submissions in this Court regarding the unsuitability of general deterrence and the potentially onerous nature of custody had not been put to the sentencing judge. The Crown highlighted the sentencing judge’s remark during the submissions on sentence that “general deterrence needs to be reflected in [the sentences]”. No issue with that remark was raised in the subsequent submissions by senior counsel then appearing for the applicant.
	


Determination


	
	Akbari had mental health issues which, in part, led to his drug use. His drug use, in part, contributed to his association with the Brothers for Life gang. His association with that gang contributed to his commission of the offence in Count 1. In these circumstances, to say that his mental health issues were causally related to his offending is such a tenuous proposition that it is little wonder that such a submission was not advanced in the court below.
	
	
	There was no error in the judge not finding that there was such a link and, as a result, not reducing the weight to be given to general deterrence in the assessment of sentence. There is no merit in this ground.
	


Ground 2 – Error in consideration of objective seriousness of count 1


	
	The applicant submitted that for the following reasons his Honour erred in characterising the offending in count 1 as “offending of an extremely serious kind”:
	


1.   The amount of money sought, being $10,000 is not high for offences of this nature.  There was evidence that others had attempted to extort $40,000 from the victim.

2.   It is not uncommon that threats are made to the safety of the victims and/or their families in this kind of offending.

3.   There was not an extended course of contact with the victim.  There were two visits over two days by the applicant and his co-offender.

4.   The “in company” element of the aggravated form of the offence was established by the presence of only one other person, which, it was submitted is “significantly less threatening” than if a group of several persons were present.


	
	It was submitted for the Crown that appropriate regard was had to these matters in determining the objective criminality of the offending. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge clearly indicated to counsel that he considered the present offending to be a serious form of the offence. It was highly relevant that counsel did not seek to dissuade his Honour from that view.
	


Determination


	
	The statement by the learned judge that ""the offending is of an extremely serious kind"" needs to be understood in the context in which it was made. It appears in the transcript of the sentencing remarks under the heading, ""Assessment of the Objective Gravity of the Offending"" and the sub-heading, ""Demand money with menaces: Akbari and Nasiri"". His Honour referred to the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament for the offence as being 14 years. He referred to the applicants both being on conditional liberty (but he noted a short time later that this was not relevant to objective seriousness). He then made the impugned statement. It was immediately followed by a detailed explanation as to why extortion of business owners is a very serious matter. He concluded under this sub-heading by referring to the importance of general deterrence and denunciation.
	
	
	His Honour proceeded under a new sub-heading, ""The particular conduct of the offender Akbari"". In this context he referred to there being no evidence that the offender was aware of the earlier threats associated with the demand for $40,000. He noted that the offender was to be sentenced for his role in the demands made on 26 and 27 August 2013 for $10,000. He accepted that there was merit in a submission that Akbari played a lesser role than Nasiri; the latter having done most of the speaking when the conversation on 27 August was recorded by the police. He said that some adjustment to the sentence was necessary to reflect this, although it should not be substantial, noting that the offenders were in company with the common aim to create substantial fear in the victim and that Akbari's presence was designed to achieve that purpose. It was at this point that his Honour referred to the differences in the applicants' criminal histories and noted that this was not relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness. His Honour concluded with comments about the relevance of Akbari's illicit drug use: see above (at [33]).
	
	
	The applicant is only critical of a single statement in the course of his Honour's review that I have just summarised.
	
	
	The offence of demanding property with menaces with intent to steal (whether or not in company) is most usually encountered in incidents which are spontaneous, where there is some brief physical assault, or a threat of same, and a demand for property of relatively modest value that is in the immediate possession of the victim, for example, money, a wallet, a mobile phone or the like: see, for example Newman v R [2012] NSWCCA 69; McMenemy v R [2009] NSWCCA 50; R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304; R v Smith [2004] NSWCCA 95; 144 A Crim R 577; Regina v Daetz; Regina v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216; 139 A Crim R 398; R v Wilson [2002] NSWCCA 65.
	
	
	Where the offence is committed in its aggravated form (""in company"") and is a premeditated attempt to extort a substantial amount of money from a legitimate business owner under threat of harm to be inflicted by a substantial number of members of a criminal gang, the description of the offence by the sentencing judge, broadly speaking, as being ""of an extremely serious kind"" cannot, in my view, be gainsaid.
	
	
	Having regard to the judge having then proceeded from that overall observation to make an assessment of the specific case at hand as it related to the particular offender, I cannot discern error.
	
	
	I would not uphold this ground.
	


Ground 3 – the sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant referred to the findings regarding the objective seriousness of counts 2 and 3 to support this ground. It was argued that the additional criminality in count 2 was very slight and accordingly the indicative sentence for count 2 should have been minimally accumulated or entirely concurrent with the sentence in respect of count 1. A similar submission was made in relation to count 3. It was also submitted that in relation to count 3, any upward pressure because of the need to take into account the two offences on the Form 1 should have been minimal. It was conceded in oral submissions that partial (notional) accumulation of the indicative sentences was appropriate but submitted that accumulation of around 10 months was outside his Honour’s discretion.
	
	
	A complaint was made that the judge did not take into account that the offence in count 1 is capable of being disposed of in the Local Court. It was suggested that this may have been influenced by his Honour's assessment of the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon the matters argued in support of Grounds 1 and 2 as well as referring to statistics from the Judicial Commission in support of his overall submission of manifest excess.
	
	
	The Crown simply submitted that the indicative sentences for counts 2 and 3 were within range; that careful consideration was given regarding partial accumulation which disclosed no error; and that the applicant’s reliance on statistics in these circumstances is unhelpful.
	


Determination


	
	I have previously indicated that there was no error in relation to the applicant's mental health issues as asserted under Ground 1. It is appropriate at this point to note that in the context of discussing Akbari's rehabilitation prospects, the judge accepted his ""mental health issues required treatment as they are likely to have a causal relationship with his illicit drug use"". He considered that a lengthy period of parole supervision would assist ""to ensure he pursues treatment upon release"". Special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found, justifying a shortening of the non-parole period of the sentence and enlargement of the parole period because ""he will require intensive supervision upon his release"". I note that the non-parole component is 60 per cent of the head sentence compared with the usual 75 per cent.
	
	
	The applicant's complaint that the judge did not take into account the availability of summary disposal in relation to count 1 cannot be upheld. No such submission was made to his Honour, although such a submission was made in relation to the Form 1 offences taken into account in relation to count 3. The offence in count 1 was simply too serious to contemplate disposition in the Local Court and it is unsurprising that senior counsel did not suggest it.
	
	
	The submissions based upon the Judicial Commission's sentencing statistics are unpersuasive. I accept that the indicative sentence for the offence in count 1 is high when compared with other sentences that have been imposed for offences against s 99(2) of the Crimes Act. The facts and circumstances of those other offences are unknown (and no attempt seems to have been made to identify them, even though some details of the cases and any published judgments are linked to the statistical display). Having regard to the significant level of seriousness of the offence and the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament of 14 years, a starting point of 5½ years before reduction on account of the applicant's plea of guilty is not beyond the bounds of the judge's sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The complaint about the level of notional accumulation of the indicative sentences must also fail. The sentence for count 1 was indicated as 4 years 2 months and the aggregate sentence is 10 months higher. An argument that accepts some degree of accumulation but contends that it should have been something less than 10 months does not pay sufficient heed to the discretionary nature of the sentencing task.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence passed upon Mr Akbari is manifestly excessive in the sense that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]. I would reject this ground.
	


Conclusion in relation to the applicant Akbari


	
	I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.
	


The applicant Nasiri

Ground 1 – Error in finding that the offenders had materially different roles


	
	Senior counsel for Nasiri submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to materially distinguish between the roles of the applicants. It was submitted that their roles were identical and were simply carried out in different ways. The objective criminality was the same for both applicants. The applicant Nasiri relied on the following facts:
	


1.   Neither Akbari or Nasiri knew of the earlier threats on 16-18 July

2.   Both attended the victim’s premises twice, together

3.   Both held themselves out to be members of Brothers for Life

4.   Both conveyed to the victim that serious consequences would flow from failure to comply with their demands.


	
	It was accepted by senior counsel for Nasiri that in relation to the last of these points Nasiri said “some more words” (T9.2) than Akbari but it was contended that the effect of their presence and behaviour at the victim’s premises was ultimately the same. For these reasons, it was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to take into account principles of sentencing which apply to participants in a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the assertion of a material distinction between the two offenders overstated the actual finding of the sentencing judge. In written submissions, the Crown referred to the fact that his Honour found that any difference in sentence “should not be substantial”.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that during the sentence proceedings counsel for Akbari submitted that Nasiri played a more “domineering role”. Counsel for Nasiri did not challenge this submission. In oral submissions, senior counsel for Nasiri contended that there was no authority to support the proposition that the applicant Nasiri should be bound by the submissions made by counsel for Akbari in Akbari’s favour.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that in differentiating between the head sentences for count 1 his Honour appropriately considered the differences in the respective subjective cases and the fact that Nasiri committed the offence whilst on parole (whereas Akbari committed the offence whilst on bail).
	


Determination


	
	This ground requires attention to a particular passage of the judge's sentencing remarks. His Honour indicated that he accepted a submission made by senior counsel for Akbari that he played a lesser role than Nasiri when they attended the victim's workshop. He said the transcript of the recorded conversation on 27 August 2013 indicated that Nasiri played ""a more dominant role in the demands and threats"". He continued:
	


""Some adjustment in the sentence to be imposed is necessary to reflect the differentiation in the roles, however the difference should not be substantial.""


	
	It was necessary for the judge to consider the comparative criminality of each offender. It would have been wrong for him to have ignored this on the simplistic basis that they were both participants in the one joint criminal enterprise. In Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609, Gibbs CJ said:
	


""It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account."" (Emphasis added)


	
	This was cited with approval most recently in the High Court in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [31] (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ). See also the very useful discussion of sentencing participants in a joint criminal enterprise in A Dyer and H Donnelly, “Sentencing in complicity cases — Part 1: Joint criminal enterprise”, Sentencing Trends and Issues, No 38, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, 2009.
	
	
	The indicative sentence for count 1 for Nasiri was 4 years 10 months and for Akbari it was 4 years 2 months. The starting points before the reduction on account of the pleas of guilty were 6½ years as compared to 5½ years. It is clear, however, that this differentiation was not based solely upon the assessment of their respective roles. After making the statement I quoted above (at [64]) his Honour continued:
	


""The differentiation in the head sentences imposed between offenders, for the offence of demand property in company with menaces, also reflects the fact that the criminal antecedents of Akbari and Nasiri differ and, whilst both were subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of this offence, Mr Nasiri was on parole for serious robbery offences.""


	
	A comparison of the criminal histories of the applicants can be based on the trite observation that Akbari had previously received penalties by way of fines, community service and a bond whilst Nasiri had been placed on probation in the Children's Court for an offence of robbery in company and had been imprisoned for 3 years in the District Court for two further robberies in company with his guilt for another such offence taken into account. It would have been wrong for the judge to make no distinction between them on this account. Further, it was clearly open to the judge to find it was a more serious aggravating feature of Nasiri's case that he committed the offence in count 1 whilst on parole for serious robbery offences.
	
	
	Having regard to those matters, the differentiation made as to the roles played by each of the applicants must have been quite minimal. The difference between this, and the contention by senior counsel for Nasiri that the roles were ""identical"" does not bear further consideration.
	


Ground 2 – Error in failing to give adequate weight to parity principles


	
	In written submissions counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge fell into error in three ways leading to a marked disparity having regard to the sentence imposed on Akbari: by finding a material difference in the offending; by failing to take into account that Akbari had a history of violence associated with robbery and by not sentencing in accordance with the findings that the applicant had a greater level of remorse and insight into his offending than Akbari. It was also submitted that his Honour erred in altering the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period to a lesser extent in the applicant's case than for Akbari.
	
	
	In oral submissions, it was contended on behalf of the applicant that there was in fact very little difference between the applicant’s offending while on parole and Akbari’s offending whilst on bail. Ms Wass SC described the circumstances of the applicant’s offending as “unusual” (T11.49) having regard to his associations with Brothers For Life (developed while he had been in custody) and the fact that he was working, living with his parents and caring for his father at the time of the present offending.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant was unable to establish a justifiable sense of grievance or marked disparity for the following reasons: there was no real difference between the two offenders in relation to remorse; his Honour was guarded regarding the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation; the difference in the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period was justified having regard to Akbari’s drug and mental health issues and the recommendation of supervision in the Pre-Sentence Report (in the applicant’s case, the Pre-Sentence report indicated that limited intervention would be offered).
	


Determination


	
	I have previously indicated that it was open to the judge to differentiate between the offences based upon role (minimally), criminal record and the nature of the conditional liberty of which they were in breach.
	
	
	In Akbari's case, the judge also took into account in his favour that he was remorseful and that, with continuing treatment, he had good prospects of rehabilitation. In Nasiri's case he also accepted that there was remorse but he was less confident about his rehabilitation prospects.
	
	
	In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, after quoting passage of the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Lowe v The Queen set out above (at [66]), continued (at [32]):
	


""A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive.""


	
	There were differences in the cases of the two applicants. The distinctions his Honour made were open to him. Any disparity that might be discerned upon a minute analysis of the differing features is certainly not, in my view, one that can be characterised as ""marked"", ""glaring"" or the like: HL v Regina; YG v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 43 at [39] (Hoeben CJ at CL, Bathurst CJ and Bellew J agreeing).
	
	
	I would not uphold this ground.
	


Ground 3 – error in consideration of objective seriousness of count 1

Ground 4 – the sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	In relation to these grounds, the applicant adopted the submissions made on behalf of Akbari (being grounds 2 and 3 in Akbari’s application for leave). I have previously indicated my rejection of them.
	


Conclusion in relation to the applicant Nasiri


	
	I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.
	


Orders


	
	In the case of each of the applicants I propose the following orders:
	


1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by R A Hulme J, and with his reasons.

		07 September 2015",2015-09-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767661,New South Wales Crime Commission v White [2015] NSWSC 1349,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	By summons filed with the leave of the Court this morning the New South Wales Crime Commission, the plaintiff, seeks orders against the defendant, John Charles White, pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”). Those orders are sought with respect to a number of items of property which are set out in two schedules to the summons. The Commission has filed a Statement of Facts and Circumstances in accordance with r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005, and tendered and relied upon an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 7 September 2015.
	
	
	In his affidavit Mr Spark refers to and exhibits a number of documents which are annexed to his affidavit.
	
	
	Section 10A of the Act provides for applications such as this to be heard ex parte and the application is being heard and dealt with in the absence of Mr White.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 7 September 2015 Mr Spark deposes that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act. He is a person authorised in writing by the Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A and Pt 4 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark has had access to material produced as a consequence of a Crime Commission and New South Wales Police investigation into the defendant, Mr White, and Mr Spark has become aware of information upon the basis of which he concludes that there is a reasonable basis to suspect, and he holds such a suspicion, that Mr White is involved in serious crime related activities as defined by s 6 of the Act.
	
	
	Those serious crime related activities are the supply of prohibited drugs being cannabis in an amount which is not less than the large commercial quantity specified for that prohibited drug. Such an offence falls within s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I am satisfied that it is a serious criminal offence pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark has made a number of inquiries of the New South Wales Police and obtained information as to the alleged activities of Mr White. Mr White has been the subject of an investigation by New South Wales Police involving both physical and electronic surveillance of a number of persons. Mr White’s conduct was monitored and it was established that he is the owner of a private aircraft. Police investigations established, and Mr Spark believes and suspects, that Mr White has been involved in the transport of large quantities of prohibited drugs into the State using the aircraft of which he is the proprietor.
	
	
	During August 2015, investigators discovered that the defendant was engaged in the planning of and negotiation for an arrangement for moving a large amount of prohibited drugs across the border from South Australia into New South Wales, with the defendant using his private aircraft (which is known as a Sting single engine aircraft) to transport a significant quantity of two particular drugs.
	
	
	Some 100 pounds of cannabis was to be moved from South Australia to the north west of New South Wales, together with a significant quantity of a particular drug called trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine. A further quantity of methylamphetamine was also part of the consignment from South Australia to Deniliquin. The defendant was to be paid a fee of some $25,000 for his role in the transportation of the drug.
	
	
	Surveillance of various persons involved in this criminal plan captured images of persons loading the defendant’s aircraft with the drugs, subsequent to which the defendant flew his aircraft out of South Australia and into New South Wales. He was arrested on landing in this State. His aircraft was searched and the drugs to which I have referred were discovered and seized.
	
	
	The defendant is said to have made a number of admissions to the New South Wales Police upon his arrest. Those admissions had been recorded electronically.
	
	
	Trafficking drugs, particularly in such large quantities and with multiple types of drugs, are very serious offences and are likely, to result in a substantial gaol penalty should a conviction ultimately be recorded.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court concludes that the suspicion held by the authorised officer, Mr Spark, is reasonably held. I am satisfied on the evidence provided that the suspicion to which Mr Spark deposes is reasonably held and that the relief claimed by the plaintiff ought to be granted.
	
	
	Accordingly I am prepared to make the orders which the plaintiff seeks.
	


Orders


	
	Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor is noted) and considering that, having had regard to the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 7 September 2015, there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions stated therein, the Court orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (except as provided in Orders 2, 3 and 4 below) no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt otherwise to deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in s 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of John Charles White, including his interest in the property specified in Schedule One and Schedule Two hereto (“the restraining order”).
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 the restraining order be varied to allow John Charles White or any other person (“the vendor”) to deal with the interest of John Charles White in the property specified in Item One of Schedule Two hereto (“the Whyalla property”) for the purpose either of completing the sale of the Whyalla property or of selling the Whyalla property at a price agreed in writing by the Plaintiff (“the sale of the Whyalla property”).
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 the proceeds received from the sale of the Whyalla property may be applied to pay the following:
	



	
	the amount necessary to discharge any registered mortgage secured over the Whyalla property;
	
	
	reasonable legal and conveyancing costs on the sale of the Whyalla property;
	
	
	any reasonable agent’s commission on the sale of the Whyalla property;
	
	
	any fee payable to a registered valuer for a valuation of the Whyalla property;
	
	
	any rates or other adjustments or monies reasonably payable under any Agreement for Sale; and
	
	
	any other expenses incurred with the consent in writing of the Plaintiff, the giving of such consent to be in the absolute discretion of the Plaintiff.
	



	
	Pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, the net proceeds of the sale of the Whyalla property (after the payment of monies mentioned in Prayer 3 above) shall be paid, by bank cheque, to the NSW Trustee and Guardian, to be held by it until further order.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 John Charles White shall be examined on oath before a Registrar of the Court concerning his affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest.
	
	
	Leave is granted to the Plaintiff to obtain from the Registry dates for the examination ordered in Order 5 above.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 10B(2) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 the New South Wales Trustee and Guardian shall take control of all the interest of John Charles White in the property specified in Item Two of Schedule Two hereto.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 John Charles White shall furnish to the Plaintiff, within twenty one (21) days after service of a sealed copy of these orders on John Charles White, a statement verified by oath or affirmation of John Charles White setting out the particulars sought in Schedule Three hereto.
	
	
	Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and John Charles White to apply on three (3) days’ notice.
	
	
	The costs of obtaining these orders shall be costs in the cause.
	
	
	Pursuant to r 36.4(1)(a) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof.

		14 September 2015",2015-09-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767665,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 1306,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, A2, KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, are to stand trial upon charges, including allegations of female genital mutilation (“FGM”) contrary to s.45(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 and (alternatively) assault occasioning actual bodily harm, whilst in company, under s.59(2) of that Act.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that the Accused persons are criminally responsible, in one way or another, for the alleged mutilation of the clitoris of two young girls, C1 and C2. The Crown proposes to call C1 and C2 as witnesses at the trial. C1 and C2 are the daughters of the Accused, A2.
	
	
	In advance of the trial, issues have arisen for determination concerning the competency of C2 to give evidence, the compellability of C1 and C2 (if competent) to give evidence because of s.18 Evidence Act 1995  and, if the girls are not compellable witnesses, the capacity of the Crown to have admitted at trial accounts given by each of them to the police by operation of s.65 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	On 6 August 2015, I expressed my rulings and conclusions on these issues as follows (PT206-7):
	



	
	for the purpose of s.13 Evidence Act 1995, I am satisfied that C2 is competent to give sworn evidence at the trial of the Accused persons;
	
	
	I overrule the objection under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 by C1 and C2 to giving evidence at the trial of the Accused persons (in particular, A2);
	
	
	given the conclusion reached concerning the s.18 objections, it is not strictly necessary to express a view concerning the Crown application under s.65 Evidence Act 1995 (although a brief view will be expressed on the issue).
	



	
	I indicated that I would publish my reasons for those conclusions at a later time. These are my reasons.
	


The Charges Against the Accused Persons


	
	KM is charged with the following offences:

	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, whilst in the company of another person, assaulting C2 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	Mr Vaziri is charged with the following offences:
	



	
	between 12 August 2012 and 9 October 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by KM and A2 of the serious indictable offence of mutilating the clitoris of C1 contrary to s.45(1)(a) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by KM and A2 of the serious indictable offence of, whilst in company, assaulting C1 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	between 12 August 2012 and 9 October 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by KM and A2 of the serious indictable offence of mutilating the clitoris of C2 contrary to s.45(1)(a) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	in the alternative, between the same dates and at the same place, being an accessory after the fact to the commission by KM and A2 of the serious indictable offence of, whilst in company, assaulting C2 thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm contrary to s.59(2) and s.347 Crimes Act 1900.
	


A Short Introduction to Relevant Persons and Events


	
	The Accused in this matter are:
	



	
	A2, the mother of C1 and C2;
	
	
	KM, a retired midwife who, on the Crown case, conducted the FGM procedures; and
	
	
	Mr Vaziri, the highest Dawoodi Bohra authority in Sydney, who preaches and teaches at the Auburn Mosque.
	



	
	According to the Crown Case Statement (“CCS”), the Accused are members of the Dawoodi Bohra community. The Dawoodi Bohra community is a world-wide subsect of Shia Islam. “Khatna” (sometimes referred to in Crown materials as “Khatana”) is a term used within the community to describe female circumcision.
	
	
	On 19 July 2012, a report was received by the Department of Family and Community Services stating that a procedure amounting to FGM had been performed on a child in the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	Thereafter, an investigation was undertaken in which C1 and C2 were spoken to in recorded interviews.
	
	
	C1 was born on 19 October 2003. It is the Crown case that FGM was performed upon C1 between October 2009 and August 2012.
	
	
	C2 was born on 26 October 2005. It is the Crown case that FGM was performed upon C2 between January 2012 and August 2012.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that A2 was present during the FGM procedure conducted on the girls, and that she encouraged KM to perform the FGM procedures. The Crown contends that A2 is liable for the FGM procedure conducted on her daughters as she was an accessory before the fact, a principal in the second degree and a party to a joint criminal enterprise with KM.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that KM performed the FGM procedure on each of the girls and is a principal in the first degree.
	
	
	The Crown contends that Mr Vaziri encouraged witnesses to lie in their police interviews and encouraged members of the community to tell police that they did not believe in or practise female circumcision. On the Crown case, such actions were performed, directly or indirectly, to assist A2 and KM in avoiding police detection. As such, the Crown contends that Mr Vaziri was an accessory after the fact to the offences of A2 and KM.
	


The Pretrial Hearing on these Issues


	
	The hearing of evidence and submissions concerning these issues took place on 17 and 18 June 2015. Ms Noman SC appeared for the Crown. Mr Sutherland SC appeared for A2 and Mr Vaziri. Mr Bouveng of counsel appeared for KM. The Court granted leave to Mr Gow of counsel to appear for C1 and C2.
	
	
	Tendered by the Crown at the hearing were the following items:
	



	
	Exhibit PTA - a Crown bundle of documentary material relevant to the issues arising under ss.13, 18 and 65 Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	Exhibit PTB - a DVD containing the record of interview conducted with C2 on 29 August 2012;
	
	
	Exhibit PTC - a letter of instructions to Dr Susan Pulman, psychologist, together with a report of Dr Pulman dated 16 April 2015 with respect to C2;
	
	
	Exhibit PTD - a letter of instructions to Dr Pulman together with the report of Dr Pulman dated 16 April 2015 with respect to C1;
	
	
	Exhibit PTE - a document entitled “TI Summary/Schedule” indicating telephone intercept evidence and its suggested relevance to issues under consideration in this judgment;
	
	
	Exhibit PTF - a DVD containing the record of interview conducted with C1 on 29 August 2012.
	



	
	Mr Gow tendered the following material:
	



	
	Exhibit PT1 - a bundle of material including letters of instructions and reports dated 20 November 2014 and 9 March 2015 of Dr Gary Banks, psychologist, concerning C2;
	
	
	Exhibit PT2 - a bundle of documents including a letter of instructions and report dated 14 November 2014 of Ms Alison O’Neill, psychologist, concerning C1;
	
	
	Exhibit PT3 - Crown notice dated 12 May 2015 for the purpose of s.306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986 concerning C2;
	
	
	Exhibit PT4 - Crown notice dated 12 May 2015 for the purpose of s.306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986 concerning C1.
	



	
	No oral evidence was given by any witness. On 18 June 2015, I examined C2 as part of the process of determining her competency to give evidence (PT57-66).
	
	
	No documentary or other evidence was tendered by the Accused at this pretrial hearing.
	
	
	Counsel furnished detailed written submissions on these issues and spoke to their submissions at the hearing.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Provisions contained in the Crimes Act 1900, the Evidence Act 1995 and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 will be mentioned in this judgment. It is appropriate to set them out at this point in the judgment.
	


Section 45 Crimes Act 1900


	
	Section 45 Crimes Act 1900 was enacted in 1994 by way of the Crimes (Female Genital Mutilation) Amendment Act 1994.
	
	
	Section 45, as it stood at relevant times between 2009 and 2012, was in the following terms:
	


“45    Prohibition of female genital mutilation

(1)    A person who:

(a)    excises, infibulates or otherwise mutilates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another person, or

(b)    aids, abets, counsels or procures a person to perform any of those acts on another person,

is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.

(2)    An offence is committed against this section even if one or more of the acts constituting the offence occurred outside New South Wales if the person mutilated by or because of the acts is ordinarily resident in the State.

(3)    It is not an offence against this section to perform a surgical operation if that operation:

(a)    is necessary for the health of the person on whom it is performed and is performed by a medical practitioner, or

(b)    is performed on a person in labour or who has just given birth, and for medical purposes connected with that labour or birth, by a medical practitioner or authorised professional, or

(c)    is a sexual reassignment procedure and is performed by a medical practitioner.

(4)    In determining whether an operation is necessary for the health of a person only matters relevant to the medical welfare of the person are to be taken into account.

(5)    It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the person mutilated by or because of the acts alleged to have been committed consented to the acts.

(6)    This section applies only to acts occurring after the commencement of the section.

(7)    In this section:

authorised professional means:

(a)    a registered midwife, or

(b)    a midwifery student, or

(c)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person authorised to practise midwifery by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the functions of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, or

(d)    a medical student.

medical practitioner, in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia, includes a person authorised to practise medicine by a body established under the law of that place having functions similar to the Medical Board of Australia.

medical student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the medical profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a medical practitioner in that place.

midwifery student means:

(a)    a person registered as a student in the nursing and midwifery profession under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law, or

(b)    in relation to an operation performed in a place outside Australia - a person undergoing a course of training with a view to being authorised to be a midwife practitioner in that place.

sexual reassignment procedure means a surgical procedure to alter the genital appearance of a person to the appearance (as nearly as practicable) of the opposite sex to the sex of the person.”


	
	In 2014, the maximum penalty for an offence under s.45 was increased from seven years to 21 years’ imprisonment: Crimes Amendment (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2014.
	


Provisions of the Evidence Act 1995


	
	Sections 12 and 13 Evidence Act 1995 are relevant to the issue of C2’s competence to give evidence. Those provisions state:
	


“12    Competence and compellability

Except as otherwise provided by this Act:

(a)    every person is competent to give evidence, and

(b)    a person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is compellable to give that evidence.

13    Competence: lack of capacity

(1)    A person is not competent to give evidence about a fact if, for any reason (including a mental, intellectual or physical disability):

(a)    the person does not have the capacity to understand a question about the fact, or

(b)    the person does not have the capacity to give an answer that can be understood to a question about the fact,

and that incapacity cannot be overcome.

Note. See sections 30 and 31 for examples of assistance that may be provided to enable witnesses to overcome disabilities.

(2)    A person who, because of subsection (1), is not competent to give evidence about a fact may be competent to give evidence about other facts.

(3)    A person who is competent to give evidence about a fact is not competent to give sworn evidence about the fact if the person does not have the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, he or she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence.

(4)    A person who is not competent to give sworn evidence about a fact may, subject to subsection (5), be competent to give unsworn evidence about the fact.

(5)    A person who, because of subsection (3), is not competent to give sworn evidence is competent to give unsworn evidence if the court has told the person:

(a)    that it is important to tell the truth, and

(b)    that he or she may be asked questions that he or she does not know, or cannot remember, the answer to, and that he or she should tell the court if this occurs, and

(c)    that he or she may be asked questions that suggest certain statements are true or untrue and that he or she should agree with the statements that he or she believes are true and should feel no pressure to agree with statements that he or she believes are untrue.

(6)    It is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a person is not incompetent because of this section.

(7)    Evidence that has been given by a witness does not become inadmissible merely because, before the witness finishes giving evidence, he or she dies or ceases to be competent to give evidence.

(8)    For the purpose of determining a question arising under this section, the court may inform itself as it thinks fit, including by obtaining information from a person who has relevant specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience.”


	
	Section 18 Evidence Act 1995 governs the issue of compellability of C1 and C2. Sections 18 and 19 of that Act state:
	


“18    Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally

(1)    This section applies only in a criminal proceeding.

(2)    A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required:

(a)    to give evidence, or

(b)    to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant,

as a witness for the prosecution.

(3)    The objection is to be made before the person gives the evidence or as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the right so to object, whichever is the later.

(4)    If it appears to the court that a person may have a right to make an objection under this section, the court is to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of this section as it may apply to the person.

(5)    If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any objection under this section in the absence of the jury.

(6)    A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that:

(a)    there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence, and

(b)    the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.

(7)    Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:

(a)    the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,

(b)    the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,

(c)    whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,

(d)    the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,

(e)    whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.

(8)    If an objection under this section has been determined, the prosecutor may not comment on:

(a)    the objection, or

(b)    the decision of the court in relation to the objection, or

(c)    the failure of the person to give evidence.

19    Compellability of spouses and others in certain criminal proceedings

Section 18 does not apply:

(a)    in proceedings for an offence against or referred to in the following provisions of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998:

(i) section 222 (Endangering children in employment),

(ii)    section 223 (Certain employers of children to be authorised),

(iii)    section 227 (Child and young person abuse),

(iv)    section 228 (Neglect of children and young persons), or

(b)    if the person could be compelled to give evidence in proceedings under section 279 (Compellability of spouses to give evidence in certain proceedings) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

Note. This section differs from section 19 of the Commonwealth Act.”


	
	If C1 and C2 are held not to be compellable witnesses under s.18, the Crown seeks to rely upon s.65 Evidence Act 1995 to adduce evidence of their videotaped records of interview (Exhibits PTB and PTF).
	
	
	Section 65 is in the following terms:
	


“65    Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(1)    This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2)    The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a)    was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or

(b)    was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or

(c)    was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or

(d)    was:

(i)    against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii)    made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

(3)    The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:

(a)    cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or

(b)    had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

(4)    If there is more than one defendant in the criminal proceeding, evidence of a previous representation that:

(a)    is given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and

(b)    is admitted into evidence in the criminal proceeding because of subsection (3),

cannot be used against a defendant who did not cross-examine, and did not have a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine, the person about the representation.

(5)    For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:

(a)    could reasonably have been present at that time, and

(b)    if present could have cross-examined the person.

(6)    Evidence of the making of a representation to which subsection (3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by:

(a)    the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or

(b)    if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or

(c)    the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording.

(7)    Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:

(a)    to damage the person’s reputation, or

(b)    to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or

(c)    to show that the person is liable in an action for damages.

(8)    The hearsay rule does not apply to:

(a)    evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or

(b)    a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

(9)    If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:

(a)    is adduced by another party, and

(b)    is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made.

Note. Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary is about the availability of persons.


	
	There are a number of terms in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 which are relevant to the present issues.
	
	
	The terms “child” and “parent” are defined in Part 1 of the Dictionary:
	


“child means a child of any age and includes the meaning given in clause 10 (1) of Part 2 of this Dictionary.

parent includes the meaning given in clause 10 (2) of Part 2 of this Dictionary.”


	
	Clause 10 of Part 2 of the Dictionary relates to the terms “children and parents”:
	


“10    References to children and parents

(1)    A reference in this Act to a child of a person includes a reference to:

(a)    an adopted child or ex-nuptial child of the person, or

(b)    a child living with the person as if the child were a member of the person’s family.

(2)    A reference in this Act to a parent of a person includes a reference to:

(a)    an adoptive parent of the person, or

(b)    if the person is an ex-nuptial child - the person’s natural father, or

(c)    the person with whom a child is living as if the child were a member of the person’s family.”


	
	Clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary concerns “unavailability of persons”:
	


“4    Unavailability of persons

(1)    For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:

(a)    the person is dead, or

(b)    the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence, or

(c)    the person is mentally or physically unable to give the evidence and it is not reasonably practicable to overcome that inability, or

(d)    it would be unlawful for the person to give the evidence, or

(e)    a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or

(f)    all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or secure his or her attendance, but without success, or

(g)    all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.

(2)    In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact.”

Provisions in Criminal Procedure Act 1986


	
	The Crown has served notices upon the Accused persons under s.306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (Exhibits PT3 and PT4) indicating an intention to adduce evidence of previous representations in the form of the recorded interviews with C1 and C2 on 29 August 2012, together with extracts of certain conversations recorded by listening device in which C1 and C2 are said to be participants. Division 3 of Part 6 of that Act (ss.306R-306Z) provides as follows:
	


“306R Evidence to which this Division applies

(1)    This Division applies to evidence of a previous representation of a vulnerable person made in the course of an interview during which the person is questioned by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.

(2)    To the extent that this Division applies to cognitively impaired persons, this Division does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made before the commencement of this Division.

306S Ways in which evidence of vulnerable person may be given

(1)    Subject to this Part, a vulnerable person may give evidence of a previous representation to which this Division applies made by the person in any criminal proceeding wholly or partly:

(a)    in the form of a recording of the previous representation made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the previous representation was made and that is viewed or heard, or both, by the court, or

(b)    orally in the courtroom, or

(c)    if the evidence is given in any proceeding to which Division 4 applies - in accordance with alternative arrangements made under section 306W.

Note. See section 306ZA.

(2)    Evidence in the form of a recording given by a vulnerable person under subsection (1) (a) is not required to be served on a party to any proceeding (including proceedings in relation to apprehended violence commenced under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007).

(3)    Nothing in this section affects the giving of evidence by means of a written statement for the purposes of Division 3 of Part 2 of Chapter 3.

Note. See also section 306ZN.

306T    Wishes of vulnerable person to be taken into account

(1)    A person must not call a vulnerable person to give evidence of a previous representation to which this Division applies made by the vulnerable person by means other than a recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the previous representation was made unless the person has taken into account any wishes of the vulnerable person, considered in the light of:

(a)    in the case of a child - the child’s age and understanding, or

(b)    in the case of a cognitively impaired person - the person’s cognitive impairment.

(2)    However, subsection (1) does not permit a person to require a vulnerable person to express the vulnerable person’s wishes in relation to the matter.

306U Vulnerable person entitled to give evidence in chief in form of recording

(1)    A vulnerable person is entitled to give, and may give, evidence in chief of a previous representation to which this Division applies made by the person wholly or partly in the form of a recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the previous representation was made and that is viewed or heard, or both, by the court. The vulnerable person must not, unless the person otherwise chooses, be present in the court, or be visible or audible to the court by closed-circuit television or by means of any similar technology, while it is viewing or hearing the recording.

The court may order that a transcript be supplied to the court or, if there is a jury, to the jury, or both, of all or part of evidence of a previous representation to which this Division applies made by a vulnerable person that is given in the form of a recording if it appears to the court that a transcript would be likely to aid its or the jury’s comprehension of the evidence.”

An Extended Account of the Crown Case Against the Accused Persons


	
	It is appropriate to set out, in some detail, the case against the Accused persons, drawn principally from the CCS (Exhibit PTA, Tab 1). This will serve to place the accounts of C1 and C2 in context, together with providing an account of other evidence upon which the Crown relies. The place of the accounts of C1 and C2 in the Crown case generally is a topic touched upon in submissions concerning s.18 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The CCS recites the circumstances in which an investigation of the Accused persons commenced in July 2012 and steps taken to progress the investigation, including interviews and the use of surveillance device warrants and telephone interception warrants.
	


Persons Interviewed and Charged


	
	On 9 September 2012, A2 participated in interviews with police and was charged with offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	On 9 September 2012, A1, the husband of A2 and father of C1 and C2, participated in interviews with police and was charged with offences under s.45. A1 was discharged at committal proceedings with respect to these charges on 6 February 2014.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, KM was charged with two counts under s.45 Crimes Act 1900. She exercised her right to silence and did not participate in an interview.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, Mr Vaziri participated in an interview with police and was charged with two counts of being an accessory after the fact to FGM contrary to ss.45 and 347 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Other persons were interviewed by police and charged with FGM offences. In this category were A3, paternal grandaunt of C1 and C2, A4, the paternal aunt of C1 and C2 and A5, the paternal grandmother of C1 and C2. Each was charged in September 2012 but the charges against each person were later withdrawn by the Crown on 15 September 2013. A6, a person who resides with A3 was charged as well, but that charge was withdrawn by the Crown on 15 September 2013.
	
	
	Hussein Karimjee is a solicitor and a member of the Dawoodi Bohra community. On 31 July 2013, Mr Karimjee was arrested by police. He declined the opportunity to take part in an interview. He was charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice. Mr Karimjee’s matter is listed for trial before the Parramatta District Court in November 2015.
	


The Alleged FGM Procedures on C1 and C2


	
	The CCS (paragraphs 16-31) summarise the Crown allegations with respect to the FGM procedures.
	
	
	On 29 August 2012, C1 (born 19 October 2003) was interviewed at her school by Detective Senior Constable Christine McDonald and a FACS case worker, Alison Wishart. No other person was present during the interview. C1 was eight years old at the time.
	
	
	During her interview (Exhibit PTA, Tab 4), C1 explained her knowledge of the term “Khatna”. She stated that “Khatna” was when “they give you a little cut down there”. She explained that she knew what “Khatna” was “because it’s happened to [her]”, detailing that when she was seven years old, she had her private part cut by an unknown female at her grandmother’s house.
	
	
	C1 recalled being taken into a bedroom and placed on to a bed. She described that, before the procedure took place, she was “nervous” and was told “imagine a place” she liked. C1 chose to picture herself as a “princess in a garden”.
	
	
	C1 told police that “it hurt” when her “private part [was] cut”. The CCS indicates that it is unknown whether C1 was anaesthetised during the procedure, however she recalled opening her eyes stating that “because of imagining the garden I felt a bit funny, and I felt I was on a bed in the garden with them all around but I shook my head a bit”. She also stated that she “felt happy because it was over”.
	
	
	C1 also stated that whilst this procedure occurred, there were a number of women, including her mother, A2, A5 (her paternal grandmother), A3 (her paternal grandaunt) and another unknown female surrounding her to “calm [her] down”. On the Crown case, the unknown female was KM.
	
	
	Following the procedure, C1 recalled being told to drink lots of water and being handed a glass of lemonade before being taken to have a shower. She remembered being “scared” of the shower, as she thought it was going to hurt.
	
	
	During her interview, C1 also provided police with information regarding the procedure being conducted on her younger sister, C2. She stated that the last time she saw the person who performed the procedure on her was “when she had to do that thing to my sister”.
	
	
	When questioned further about C2’s procedure, C1 believed it had occurred “some time this year” (2012). She stated that she had travelled to Auburn with her mother and her sisters where they met the unknown woman who had previously performed the procedure on her. C1 then had to travel with the unknown woman, directing her back to the family home in Baulkham Hills.
	
	
	C1 recalled watching a movie downstairs in her home with C2, and a male child who accompanied the unknown lady (said to be the grandson of KM). Whilst they were watching the movie, A2 called out for C2 to come upstairs. C1 then saw C2 go upstairs, where she believes she was with the unknown female, her mother and A4 (her paternal aunt).
	
	
	C2 (born 26 October 2005) was also interviewed at her school by Detective Senior Constable McDonald and Ms Wishart on 29 August 2012. She was six years old at that time.
	
	
	During her interview (Exhibit PTA, Tab 5), C2 indicated that a procedure was conducted on her, in her parents’ room, in her home in Baulkham Hills. She recalled lying down on a white cushion and stated that she “felt hurting … in [her] bottom”.
	
	
	C2 could not particularise who was in the room at the time the procedure took place. She also could not state who conducted the procedure, only saying that it was “a woman”.
	
	
	After the procedure, C2 recalled speaking to her father, A1, who told her “it’s OK”. C2 also believed she spoke to her sister about the procedure, but she could not recall what was said.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that C2’s FGM procedure took place during the July 2012 winter school holidays. During this time, call charge records show that A2 contacted KM seven times between 26 June and 18 July 2012.
	
	
	On 3 September 2012, C1 and C2 were examined by Dr Susan Marks from the Child Protection Unit at Westmead Children’s Hospital. Dr Marks was unable to confirm or deny whether the girls had been circumcised. She reported that she could not exclude that a WHO classification Type 1 or Type 4 FGM procedure had been conducted, as she could not visualise the head of the clitoris on either child.
	
	
	Dr Marks asserts that if there had been a small cut to the head of the clitoris, it would have been painful at the time, but would have healed in three to five days. Dr Marks also confirmed that any cut or nick to the clitoris would include, at the very minimum, the removal of skin cells.
	
	
	According to the CCS (paragraph 31), a cultural expert and member of the Dawoodi Bohra community stated that “the practice of Khatna [within the Dawoodi Bohra community] is a small cut to the tip of the clitoris and the chances of scarring would be slim”. She asserts that it is only when Dawoodi Bohra women get older that they start to realise the problems “regarding the sensitivity and hypersensitivity” caused by the practice.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by A2 in Conversations and Police Investigations (CCS, paragraphs 32-48)


	
	At 2.18 pm on 29 August 2012, Ms Wishart advised A2 via telephone that C1 and C2 had been interviewed. At that time, Ms Wishart arranged for A1 and A2 to attend the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad at 4.30 pm the same day for a voluntary interview with herself and Detective Senior Constable McDonald.
	
	
	A number of conversations referred to hereafter are said to have been recorded under warrants issued pursuant to the Surveillance Devices Act 2008 or the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth).
	
	
	When A2 collected C1 and C2 from school on 29 August 2012, she spoke to the children about their interviews. When C1 explained what she told the police, A2 responded ""Yes ok. You told them everything.  I told you not to say, any one. I told you not to say. Now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you my child this is a big secret, never tell anyone"". This conversation was recorded by a surveillance device which had been placed in a vehicle being driven by A2 at that time.
	
	
	Later on in the afternoon, another conversation took place between A1, A2, C1 and C2 whilst the family were travelling in another motor vehicle. During this conversation, A1 tried to convince C1 that she had not been “cut”, to which C1 responded “Yes, once they asked for scissors … I saw scissors … they do something with scissors'? She asked me don't we do with scissors … do not we do with scissors with something?”.
	
	
	After dropping C1 and C2 with a carer, A1 and A2 drove to the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad. Whilst they were still in the vehicle, on their way to the interview A1 told A2, “We can say that, yes we called this lady for check up to make sure that they haven't had anything done. Say this way, that we called to check them if anything is being done, because they go to Africa and is been done there.  We go to India and Africa and we always do up there. … When they came for check up, we called all the family members and she knows that lady as she is nurse. She is used to, and we normally the ladies don't check children as it is not our subject the children …”.
	
	
	Once at the Parramatta Child Abuse Squad, A1 and A2 were interviewed separately by Detective Senior Constable McDonald and Ms Wishart. The interviews were not electronically recorded, rather contemporaneous notes were made by Detective Senior Constable McDonald. No one else was present during either interview
	
	
	Whilst A1 was being interviewed, A2 contacted her mother, alerting her of the situation with the police. Whilst talking to her mother, A2 stated, ""Our daughters khat … circumcision, we get them circumcised, don't we, about that, for us, you know, it has now become a government matter over her"" and “[we] got it performed for our daughters, didn't we, for the seven years old!"".
	
	
	When A1’s interview was finished, he returned to the waiting room and had a conversation with A2. During this conversation, A1 again discussed with A2 what she should and should not say to the police, stating, ""Do not tell them we got information that [C1] and [C2]’s circumcision have been done here"" and, ""If they ask you, tell them, you do not know what happened in it"".  He enquired whether C1’s procedure took place last year, and told A2 to tell police that his mother had told them to have the girls circumcised but they refused. A1 also asked, “In us do they cut the skin … or do they cut the whole clitoris?” To which A2 responded “No … they just do a little bit … just little”.
	
	
	When A2 was interviewed by police, she indicated that she was aware that the practice of FGM was illegal in Australia, and that she was aware that some of her friends and family had had the procedure performed upon them in Africa. She explained the different types of FGM and stated that, in the Dawoodi Bohra community, the practice is only for a “bit of skin [to be] removed”. She stated that she had discussed the practice with her daughters whilst they were holidaying in Africa in 2012, but stated that she did not want her daughters circumcised. When A2 was asked the reason why her daughters would say they have been cut on their private parts, she stated, “I think it’s just the checking that they are getting confused” and that “[we] got them checked at different times by [KM]”.
	
	
	A2 indicated that C1 was examined around the first term school holidays in April 2012, and C2 during the winter school holidays in July 2012. She said that C1 was examined by a female person known as “[KM]” at their family home in Baulkham Hills. She stated that A4 and A5 were also present during the examination. A2 stated that when C2 was examined, the persons present were believed to be A3, A5 and A6. A2 also indicated that during an examination, the underpants are removed and it is “just having a check down there to make sure everything is ok down there”. A2 recalled that KM said ""Everything's alright"", which made her believe her daughters had not been circumcised.
	
	
	After their interview on 29 August 2012, A2 telephoned KM. KM had been made aware of the police investigation earlier in the day by A1. During the conversation, A2 told KM that C1 explained everything to police - that she had been circumcised and that her procedure had occurred in Australia. She stated that C2 did not know anything about her procedure. A2 also stated that she told police that if the children had been circumcised, the procedure would have occurred in Africa. The two women then discussed how the police found out that C1 and C2 had been circumcised, speculating that someone from within the community must have told them.
	
	
	Following her conversation with KM, A2 called her mother and they discussed what was told to police. A2 stated she told police the procedure could have taken place in Africa, when C1 and C2 were with their grandparents. She also explained that the police went to see C1 and C2, and ""[C1] in fact told everything"". Upon hearing this, A2’s mother stated, “Did you not teach [C1] not to speak?"" and A2 responded ""Did teach her, but these people of ours, those people in fact are trained ... to get the information out from everyone”.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, A2 telephoned A3 and explained the police investigation. During the conversation, A2 stated ""We got [C1], [C2] circumcised didn't we … first time happened at yours and the second time was here only. Named mummy, … and all”. She also informed A3 of the story she must tell if questioned by the police explaining, ""If any questions arise at all, you are just to say that 'yes, we were there ... it did happen, but just checking occurred'. And I haven't said yours that it happened at your house; I said that you were at our house and happened in this year. This is slightly a little lie”.
	
	
	On the same morning, A2 had another conversation with both C1 and C2 whilst they were together in a motor vehicle. During the conversation, she tried to find out how the police knew what had happened, stating, ""We just want to know, that how they came to know about it. We are just checking that you haven't said it by mistake to any friend or teacher”. A1 was not in the vehicle during the discussion.
	
	
	After the conversation referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, A2 telephoned A1. During the conversation, A2 stated C1 told police that, ""We performed it in Wollongong” and that she has phoned A3 to inform her of the investigation. She explained that she told A3 that they have to ""save Aunty [KM]"" and that she is only to tell police ""[KM] has just checked everything … if anything would have happened, it has happened in Africa”. The couple also discussed that they did not tell police that anything occurred at A3’s home. They agreed that they would eventually have to tell the police an examination occurred at A3’s home because C1 had already told them that. A2 also stated, ""If we all will remain together, those people do not have evidence of any kind to incriminate”.
	
	
	On 4 September 2012, the day after C1 and C2 were examined, A2 received a telephone call from KM. The Crown asserts that it is apparent from the conversation that the women believed that the examination of C1 and C2 by Dr Marks went well (the results of this examination are detailed at [60]-[61] above). KM stated to A2, ""Then it is good that, because I had the knowledge that those people would not be able to see anything [during the examination]”. A2 explained that the case was not closed and there would be an ongoing investigation by the police and FACS separately, however she believed that without any physical evidence, the police would not be able to take the matter further. At the end of the conversation, KM told A2, ""Especially now do explain to [C1] that if they ask anything all … in the school … .just to say as this that, ’I do not have the knowledge, call my mother the matter is finished'”.
	
	
	During the conversation, A2 and KM also speculated about how the police could have found out about the procedures. KM suggested A4 told someone stating, “[A7] tells me 'mummy' ummm [A4] is certainly quite friendly with everything in the mosque ... perhaps ... she could have uttered by mistake because [she] trusts everyone instantly, all her friends ... She is not of a type who would speak... although she was there’”.
	
	
	On 7 September 2012, A2 was arrested and charged with two counts of FGM. At the police station, A2 participated in an ERISP during which she stated that she had a very limited knowledge of FGM, as she had only heard about the topic in newspapers and during conversations with her friends and family who had had the procedure performed on them in Africa. A2 asserted her belief that C1 and C2 had not been circumcised and reiterated that they must have become confused with the examination conducted on them by KM. She detailed that C1’s examination occurred “a couple years back” after a previous trip to Africa in 2008. C1’s examination was said to have occurred at A3’s house and C2’s at her own house. A2 stated that she had had C1 and C2 examined because, at their age, there was a risk of them having been circumcised when they were in Africa. A2 did not adopt what she had previously stated in her interview on 29 August 2012 in respect of the “Khatna” procedure.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by KM in Conversations (CCA, paragraphs 49-59)


	
	At 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012, KM received a telephone call from A1, informing her that C1 and C2 had informed the police about “Khatna”. KM became concerned that her name had been given to police and asked if they could just tell police that she only checked the children and “that was it”, commenting “there is no scar or anything there”. A1 confirmed that they would tell police that C1 and C2 were examined in case they had been circumcised in Africa.
	
	
	At 4.08 pm on the same day, KM contacted a Dawoodi Bohra Sheikh, Elder Jaffar. During this conversation, she stated, “With the permission of the Mullah, I was looking after seven year old girls. Now, this one girl has spoken something to someone in the school; then her mother and father have been called to the police. Then the girl's mother and father will give my name; I don't have the knowledge if the girl has named me ..."". She repeated this sentiment again during the conversation when she stated, ""I, with the permission of the Mullah, for many year I have been looking after the seven years old girls. You understand what I am saying don't you?"". During this conversation, KM also stated that she was too old to go to gaol.
	
	
	At 5.50 pm, KM received a telephone call from A2, informing her how the interview with police went. During the conversation, KM questioned whether C1 told police ""that it was done to her”, and A2 responded “yes”. KM informed A2 of the conversation she had with Elder Jaffar, explaining her belief that “this matter is of our community”. She also stated that she is “suddenly worried now"" and too old to have to sit in gaol.
	
	
	Between 7.35 pm and 8.28 pm, KM had a number of telephone conversations with her daughter, A7 and her husband, PM. During these conversations, KM explained that the police were investigating the circumcision of C1 and C2. She stated that someone had made a complaint about her, and that the police must have a solid tip or they would not have interviewed the children. KM also explained that this was the first that her husband would have heard of the situation.
	
	
	At 8.48 pm, KM and A7 had another conversation. During this conversation, A7 stated “I think whoever has done a report, it's; I mean, either it's been done against them [the As] or against you. But if it was against you then you've got to ask yourself that ‘wouldn't they have not [done] it some time ago?’ because you know; obviously; it's not; it's not the first time what you have done”.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, KM was contacted by Mr Vaziri. Mr Vaziri stated that “35,000” had been sanctioned for her, and that she must complete a form to send to London in order to receive a cheque. During this conversation, KM stated that she was really scared, so scared in fact that she rang Elder Jaffar and told him that she did not want to go to gaol.
	
	
	After C1 and C2’s examination on 3 September 2012, KM had a conversation with A7 and PM. During this conversation, the following exchange took place between the two women;
	


KM stated:   “She said that everything is well, for both of them”. [C1 and C2]

A7 stated: “Yeah, thank goodness ... now mum, don't do this again”.

KM stated: “No, No, I am not going to do anything now”.

A7 stated: “Yeah, now just refuse, if anyone asks. Just say ‘Now my hands are not good, and'”

KM stated: “Yes, I was telling these people also the same thing that ‘I shake a lot; my hands and I won't do it’. But they said ‘no please do it'. Anyway, whatever happened has happened, That's it, I am not going to do it now … now you see, those people will keep a perfectly close on this because they have warned them”.


	
	On 4 September 2012, KM telephoned A2. KM stated to A2, “Then it is good that, because I had the knowledge that those people would not be able to see anything [during the examination]"". At the end of the conversation, KM told A2, “Especially now do explain to [C1] that if they ask anything all … in the school just to say as this that, I do not have the knowledge, call my mother the matter is finished”. KM also speculated that A4 “could have uttered by mistake because [she] trusts everyone instantly all her friends … she is not of a type who would speak … although she was there”.
	
	
	On 10 September 2012, KM was contacted by A1 who informed her that the police were attending the homes of community members, giving them pamphlets and asking them questions about female circumcision. A1 repeated the story that must be told to police stating that everyone has been informed to say “no comment” if they are asked about the day of the procedure, and that KM only came to check C1 and C2. When KM was asked what she will say about using an instrument during the examination, she stated, “I will just say - that there was nothing my hand. Certainly, by no means I would just [do] something [to] all with the hand, hmmm, do that in this way to the lower [part] of someone else's daughter. Indeed, I look hmm, examined to a little extent by opening the cervix just in this way with the forceps”.
	
	
	On 13 September 2012, KM was arrested by police. At the police station, she did not wish to participate in an interview.
	
	
	At 2.53 pm on 13 September 2012, KM telephoned A1 and informed him of her arrest. KM told A1 that she did not tell police anything and wanted to confirm everyone “maintained one story only …that you invited me merely to examine”.
	


Statements Allegedly Made by Mr Vaziri in Conversations and Police Interview (CCS, paragraphs 6-71)


	
	At 3.04 pm on 29 August 2012, A1 telephoned Mr Vaziri, informing him that C1 and C2 had told the police about “Khatna”. A1 told Mr Vaziri, “Now it seem [C1] has already told them everything khatna-kharanat has happened”. He also stated that the police had requested an interview with both himself and A2. When asked by A1, Mr Vaziri agreed that the practice of Khatna was illegal in Australia. A1 asked Mr Vaziri what to tell the police, Mr Vaziri stated, ""This is my thought. Tell that we had gone in Milad and we had placed them at our neighbours … and then don't know what has happened”.
	
	
	At 6.18 pm on the same day, A1 telephoned Mr Vaziri again, informing him that the police had been told that any circumcision on C1 and C2 must have taken place in Africa and that a lady was only called to examine the children, to verify that they had not been circumcised. A1 also told Mr Vaziri that female circumcision is illegal in Australia and the police want to have C1 and C2 examined. Upon hearing this, Mr Vaziri advised A1 to seek legal advice. He also stated, ""Brother only one thing. Always keep providing the same oral testimony that you have said. Then; change in it; don't change it … Don't introduce any change in that nothing at all, not even a little"". During this conversation, A1 also advised that C1's circumcision was performed at A3’s house and C2's circumcision was performed at his own house. A1 also speculated that KM would be very anxious because she was the person who conducted the circumcisions.
	
	
	On 30 August 2012, Mr Vaziri telephoned KM. During this call, he informed KM that “35,000” had been sanctioned for her, and that in order to receive a cheque she had to complete a form that would be sent to London. During the conversation, KM informed Mr Vaziri that she was very scared about the police investigation and had telephoned another Elder, telling him that she did not want to go to gaol.
	
	
	On 3 September 2012, Mr Vaziri received a telephone call from Hussein Karimjee. Mr Karimjee informed Mr Vaziri that he had spoken to an Elder in London and that a document was being created to outline the community's attitude to FGM. Mr Karimjee instructed Mr Vaziri to tell police that the community does not agree with or encourage anyone to conduct FGM in Australia or any other country. Additionally, he recommended that KM no longer perform procedures within the community as she was more than likely being watched by police. Mr Karimjee also warned that no one from the community should go overseas for the purpose of having their daughters circumcised.
	
	
	During his conversation with Mr Karimjee, Mr Vaziri questioned what he should say “according to Sharia”. Mr Karimjee stated that mutilation and circumcision are not written anywhere and it is not encouraged within the community. He reasoned that the procedure performed within the community is so minimal that it cannot be seen as mutilation. Mr Karimjee stated that without further evidence, no one would believe the words of an eight-year old, however he also warned that the investigation is continuing and the people within the community needed to be cautious and alert as to what they should and should not tell police.
	
	
	On 6 September 2012, Mr Karimjee again telephoned Mr Vaziri and the two discussed Mr Vaziri's upcoming interview with police. Mr Vaziri stated he had been advised by another Elder to be confident in the interview. Mr Karimjee told Mr Vaziri that he should say, as far as he was aware, C1 and C2 were very quiet after they returned from Africa, so KM was engaged to verify that they had not been circumcised. Mr Karimjee informed Mr Vaziri that C1 had already advised police that many people came to Wollongong when her procedure took place, that scissors were used and that she was in pain for two-to-three days after the procedure. Additionally, Mr Karimjee stated that the medical examination “did not show anything” and therefore police had no evidence of a procedure taking place. At the end of the conversation, Mr Vaziri asked Mr Karimjee if there were any difficulties in him representing everyone involved, to which Mr Karimjee responded there would be no problem so long as everyone told the same story.
	
	
	At 6.09 pm on 10 September 2012, Mr Vaziri telephoned an unknown female member of the Dawoodi Bohra community. During this phone call, Mr Vaziri advised the unknown female that the police are going to the houses of community members and asking them questions about female circumcision. The unknown female stated that police had already been to her house, but she told police that she did not know the meaning of the work ""khatna"" and had no idea whether young girls were being circumcised. Mr Vaziri told the unknown female that, if the police return and ask any further questions, she is to say ""I am not saying … mean we do not do it”.
	
	
	At 6.42 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned a male Dawoodi Bohra community member known as A8. Similarly to the previous call, Mr Vaziri warned A8 that police are going to the homes of community members and asking them questions about female circumcision. During the conversation, Mr Vaziri told A8, ""If someone asking you or your wife this should your answer. 'We do not believe in it’”. Mr Vaziri told A8 to relay the message to his wife whilst he was still on the phone stating the police ""are leaving soon for information"". Mr Vaziri also stated, ""Which ever country you live, loyal to that country. That what should do”.
	
	
	At 8.57 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned Mr Karimjee. During this conversation, the two again discussed what Mr Vaziri would tell police in his interview. Mr Karimjee reiterated that Mr Vaziri was to say he does not teach or believe in female circumcision, warning that Mr Vaziri must repeat the phrase exactly to police. Mr Vaziri informed Mr Karimjee that the police had gone to the houses of the community members and handed out pamphlets. He also raised concerns that the police had found the community website.
	
	
	At 9.50 pm, Mr Vaziri telephoned Mr Karimjee again. During this conversation, Mr Vaziri raised concerns that there was no control over the situation. Mr Karimjee told Mr Vaziri there is no reason to worry, stating, ""What knowledge do those people have as to Your Honour's plan ... they do not have information as to what Your Honour's plan was"". Mr Karimjee repeated his warning that the community will have to take care now, to which Mr Vaziri responded, ""Yes exactly, in fact these people also have the information"".
	
	
	At 5.20 am on 13 September 2012, police officers attached to the investigation attended the Auburn Mosque and arrested Mr Vaziri. Mr Vaziri was conveyed to Auburn Police Station where he participated in a recorded interview. During the interview, Mr Vaziri stated that he had never heard of FGM, female circumcision or “Khatna” being performed on females. When Mr Vaziri was advised that the [As] had been charged the week prior with committing FGM on their children, he stated they had approached him after being arrested in order to obtain a “blessing” from the 52nd Dai Mutlaq (the highest living Dawoodi Bohra authority, who is based in India). Mr Vaziri then conceded this meant he had heard of FGM prior to walking into the interview room, but this conversation with the [As] was, in fact, the first time he had heard of it.
	
	
	Later in his police interview, Mr Vaziri stated that the first time he had heard of FGM was 4 days prior, when he was handed a pamphlet about it at the mosque. He stated he was completely against FGM and that if he ever found out about it happening in his community, he would report it to police. Mr Vaziri further stated that he never provided advice to the [As], he simply conveyed their request for a blessing to the 52nd Dai Mutlaq. He also stated that he is the highest Dawoodi Bohra authority in Sydney, but is not in a position to authorise any ritual involving FGM. He explained that the Quran dictates that Muslims must abide by the laws of the land they are living in. When asked if he was aware FGM is illegal in New South Wales, he stated that he did not need to know because it had never been an issue for him. He also stated that he did not know if the practice was illegal in India and he had never needed to know because he had never even come across it.
	


Other Witnesses Interviewed


	
	During the course of the investigation, police interviewed other persons, including A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, PM and A9, the interpreter present during the interview of Mr Vaziri. Each has refused to give a statement, but has been subpoenaed by the Crown to give evidence.
	


Some Issues in the Trial


	
	It is helpful to keep in mind the issues as to which C1 and C2 would be called upon to give evidence, and the extent to which there is controversy with respect to these matters.
	
	
	The issues in dispute at the trial were the subject of discussion during the pretrial hearing. On 18 June 2015, I enquired of Mr Sutherland SC (PT49-51) (emphasis added):
	


“HIS HONOUR: The next thing I wanted to raise was an issue arising from the submissions. In the Crown written submissions at para 15 the Crown foreshadowed what the defence case with respect to A2 and KM may be, concerning [C2]. The defence written submissions at paras 6 and 7 - 6 in particular - indicated what the issues at trial will include. Is there an issue in the trial and this is directed to Mr Sutherland and Mr Bouveng what is in issue at trial with respect to the Crown allegation with respect to [C2]? I'm looking at paras 6 and 7 to assist me to understand that. 

SUTHERLAND: Your Honour, the Crown submission flows from a discussion in one of the intercepted calls. The fundamental issue at trial will be the proposition that whatever took place involved no damage, injury or other physical intervention falling within the relevant statutory definition. 

HIS HONOUR: But is there an issue that something took place? 

SUTHERLAND: No. 

HIS HONOUR: I'm conscious that the cascading issues which I'm looking at here and will occupy some time relate to the accounts of [C2] and [C1], and the Crown seek to adduce evidence in one way or another of what each of the children said happened at a particular time in a room. 

SUTHERLAND: Indeed, yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there going to be any dispute that each child on separate occasions was in the room with certain people? 

SUTHERLAND: No. 

HIS HONOUR: And that some contact was made with their body? 

SUTHERLAND: No, there will not be a dispute about that, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: What is the dispute then with respect to [C2], firstly? 

SUTHERLAND: What it was that was done. 

HIS HONOUR: And with [C1]? 

SUTHERLAND: The same. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there any issue that A2 was present at the time on each occasion? 

SUTHERLAND: I don't believe so, your Honour. The short answer is no. 

HIS HONOUR: I don't think it's the Crown case that Mr Vaziri was said to have been present. Is that so?

SUTHERLAND: Correct, your Honour. He's charged as an accessory after the fact.

HIS HONOUR: As an accessory, yes.

SUTHERLAND: I think it can fairly be said not that we want to run off on this tangent at the moment but I think it can fairly be said that the substance of the allegation against him relates to conversations between him and a now Crown witness, an uncharged person, charged previously but discharged at committal, namely, [A1] himself. 

HIS HONOUR: That's the father?

SUTHERLAND: Father. 

HIS HONOUR: of [C2] and [C1]. 

SUTHERLAND: And [C1], yes, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: All right. 

SUTHERLAND: Mr Bouveng can speak for himself, but in relation to his client, the issues, I expect, are what is it that happened. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Well, I might just ask Mr Bouveng. Your client is alleged by the Crown to have been present and to have been the person who undertook the acts in question, I think. That's the Crown case, isn't it, against your client? 

BOUVENG: It is. 

HIS HONOUR: Is there any issue that your client was present on these occasions? 

BOUVENG: There isn't. 

HIS HONOUR: What is in issue then with respect to your client and the allegation of [C2]? 

BOUVENG: Precisely what Mr Sutherland just indicated on behalf of A2, that is, what is it that was done on those two occasions with [C2] and [C1], and whether or not what was done amounts to the act as raised under s 45 and s 59. 

HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right. That assists me just to have an understanding. I know that we're at an early stage but it will assist me to have that understanding.” 


	
	The Notice of Defence Response under s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, served on behalf of A2 and dated 29 June 2015, stated the nature of her defence in the following way:
	


“The nature of the accused person’s A2s defence is that she did not commit any of the offences. Specifically, A2 did not act in a criminal enterprise with KM who did not excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of the complainants, nor did KM assault either of the complainants occasioning actual bodily harm.”


	
	The Notice stated that A2 proposes to give consent under s.184 Evidence Act 1995 admitting the following matters of fact:
	


“*   That she was present when KM undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C1] at her request; and

*   That she was present when KM undertook an examination and symbolic ceremony on [C2] at her request.”


	
	The Notice of Defence Response dated 29 June 2015 on behalf of KM is to a similar effect.
	
	
	The Notice of Defence Response dated 29 June 2015 for Mr Vaziri includes a denial that he committed the offences, and an indication that he does not propose to give any notice of consent under s.184 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Accordingly, the issues presently under consideration should be approached upon the basis that there will be no dispute that C1 and C2 were examined by KM in the presence of A2, but there will be a denial that any form of procedure was undertaken on either of them which could fall within the terms of the FGM offence under s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	


Competence of C2


	
	No submission was made that C1 was not competent to give evidence. The psychological reports concerning C1 raised no question as to her competency to give evidence.
	
	
	However, a question has arisen concerning the competence of C2. It is appropriate to refer to submissions concerning this topic before moving to resolve it.
	


Overview of Submissions


	
	Mr Gow submitted, on behalf of C2, that she is not competent to give evidence but, if the Court finds she is competent, the Court should conclude that she is not competent to give sworn evidence pursuant to s.13(3) based upon her age and the mild intellectual incapacity with which she suffers.
	
	
	Mr Gow submitted, correctly, that there is little, if any, disagreement in the opinions expressed by Dr Banks and Dr Pulman with respect to C2. He submitted that the only limited point of difference between the opinions of these experts appears to lie in the area of C2’s actual ability to give evidence.
	
	
	It was not submitted by Mr Gow that C2 did not have the capacity to give an answer that can be understood to a question about the fact, for the purpose of s.13(1)(b). Rather, he submitted that the issue here surrounded s.13(1)(a), as to whether C2 has the capacity to “understand a question about the fact”. Whilst acknowledging that the test in s.13(1) sets the bar fairly low, Mr Gow pointed to evidence of C2’s intellectual disability and mental age of six. He submitted that C2 may fail, or be unable, to engage in the process of responding to questions about the fact.
	
	
	Mr Gow (and other counsel) referred to MK v R [2014] NSWCCA 274 at [70], where it was emphasised that a court considering competence under s.13 should follow a sequential mode of reasoning.
	
	
	After the examination of C2 by the Court on 18 June 2015, Mr Gow pointed to some features of her responses, but made limited submissions on the issues, noting that it was a matter for the Court to determine.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, having seen and heard C2 being examined, and after application of the relevant principles, the Court would be satisfied that she is competent to give sworn evidence.
	
	
	Apart from noting the psychological reports concerning C2 and referring to the relevant legal principles, Mr Sutherland SC and Mr Bouveng left it to the Court to form a view concerning the competence of C1.
	


Decision


	
	I have had regard to the provisions of s.13, the reports of Dr Banks and Ms Pulman (for the purpose of s.13(8)) and the observations I made of C2, together with her answers to my questions during the examination on 18 June 2015. I have considered the submissions of counsel on this topic.
	
	
	The logical starting point of s.13 is the presumption of competency established by ss.12 and 13(6): RJ v R [2010] NSWCCA 263; 208 A Crim R 174 at 179-180 [16]. From there, I have sought to apply the obligatory terms of s.13, using a sequential mode of reasoning, in accordance with RJ v R at 179-180 [14]-[23] and MK v R at [70].
	
	
	In accordance with MK v R at [70], strict compliance with s.13 is required. The Court must make a specific finding as to whether C2 is competent to give evidence under s.13(1). If C2 is found to be competent, the court must consider whether she may not be competent to give sworn evidence: s.13(3).
	
	
	In determining the competency of C2 by reference to s.13(1), I have had regard to the psychological evidence concerning her and her mental age. I accept that she suffers from a mild intellectual disability and that, as at the time of the assessment by Dr Banks in November 2014, C2 was operating at a cognitive and emotional level of a six-year old child. At the same time, I note that C2 is in her age appropriate year at school and is functioning in the normal school environment with additional learning assistance.
	
	
	I have had regard, as well, to what appears to be the confined topic in relation to which C2 would be called upon to give evidence, and the real issues in dispute with respect to that topic. Any likely questioning of C2 at trial ought not be complex or protracted.
	
	
	I am satisfied that C2 has the capacity to understand a question about facts pertinent to the relatively narrow issues in the trial, so as to satisfy the undemanding test posed by s.13(1)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	For the purposes of s.13(1), I am satisfied that C2 is competent to give evidence. She is now nine years of age. She was able to engage with me and answer questions on a range of topics.
	
	
	I have regard to the examination of C2 which I undertook on 18 June 2015. I sought to utilise questions framed in a way that a nine-year old child (with the intellectual disability and chronological age of C2), and with the limited language skills of a child can understand: R v RAG [2006] NSWCCA 343; MK v R at [69].
	
	
	Having found C2 to be competent to give evidence for the purpose of s.13(1) of the Act, I move to s.13(3) to consider the question whether C2 is competent to give sworn evidence. I sought to direct some questions to C2 to assist a judgment as to whether she had the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, she was under an obligation to give truthful evidence (PT62-63, 66). I am satisfied from the examination of C2, and the other evidence before the Court, that she has the capacity to understand that, in giving evidence, she is under an obligation to give truthful evidence.
	
	
	Having reached this conclusion, I express my satisfaction that C2 is competent to give sworn evidence at the trial of the Accused persons. In these circumstances, it is, of course, not necessary to move to consideration of competence to give unsworn evidence for the purpose of s.13(5) of the Act.
	


Compellability of C1 and C2


	
	Detailed submissions were made on the question whether C1 and C2 should be compelled to give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	At the outset, it should be noted that it is only because A2 is on trial that s.18 is engaged at all. If there was a separate trial of KM and Mr Vaziri, there could be no question of C1 and C2 being compellable witnesses against them. However, the Crown has presented a joint indictment against all three so that, for practical purposes, the compellability issue is to be considered in the context of a proposed single joint trial.
	


Overview of Submissions


	
	Mr Gow submitted that the Court should conclude that there is the likelihood that harm would or might be caused to C1 and C2, or to the relationship between C1 and C2 (on the one hand) and A2, if the children were required to give evidence against A2. Reference was made to aspects of the psychological evidence of Dr Banks, Dr Pulman and Ms O’Neill.
	
	
	He submitted further that the nature and extent of that harm outweighed the desirability of having the evidence given. He submitted that s.18(6)(a) involved a relatively low threshold, and that the Court should conclude that the risk of harm to the relationship between mother and daughters existed in this case.
	
	
	By reference to the factors contained in s.18(7), Mr Gow made the following submissions:
	



	
	section 18(7)(a) - although the nature and the gravity of the allegations are serious, the maximum penalty at the relevant time under s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900 was imprisonment for seven years;
	
	
	section 18(7)(b) - it was accepted that the evidence available from C1 and C2 was important to the Crown case, but counsel submitted that, in light of other evidence available to the Crown, the children’s evidence was of less importance so that it was not vital to the prosecution case;
	
	
	section 18(7)(c) - there was other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of C1 and C2 relate, which was reasonably available to the prosecutor - he referred to a series of recorded conversations between different persons which was particularised in Exhibit PTE;
	
	
	section 18(7)(d) - the mother/daughter relationship was a special one which, according to Dr Banks, is perceived to have “a special, sacred bond” - it was submitted that the relationship is even more important because C1 and C2 are not adult daughters of A2, but are vulnerable children of tender years, and still at an age where their mother plays a central role in their upbringing and development.
	



	
	No submission was advanced by Mr Gow by reference to s.18(7)(e) of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Gow submitted that, in undertaking the balancing exercise under s.18, the Court should conclude that neither C1 nor C2 ought be compelled to give evidence in the trial of their mother and others.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, with respect to s.18(6)(a), that some harm to C1 and C2 and their relationship with their mother, may have already occurred because the girls had committed themselves in August 2012 to a version of what happened when each of them was interviewed by police. It was submitted that giving evidence, in accordance with those accounts, will not necessarily exacerbate any harm.
	
	
	With respect to the factors in s.18(7), the Crown made the following submissions:
	



	
	s.18(7)(a) - the nature and gravity of the allegations are serious, with the maximum penalty for FGM under s.45(1) Crimes Act 1900 (at the relevant time) being imprisonment for seven years - the Crown made other submissions in the context of s.18(7)(d) (see [139](d) below) which overlap, as well, with s.18(7)(a) - it was submitted that C1 and C2 are not just witnesses, but the alleged victims named in the charges brought against their mother and others;
	
	
	s.18(7)(b) - C1 and C2 are both complainants who have participated in records of interview with police on 29 August 2012 - one of the central issues in the trial will be whether the Crown can rebut the suggestion that what occurred to both girls was merely an examination, and not any form of FGM - in C1’s interview, she confirmed that she was able to give direct evidence that some form of FGM occurred upon her, with her stating that she was hurt in her private parts when it happened and that it happened to her because it was part of her culture, and with her stating that her mother had told her what would happen before it happened, so she was not scared - she gave details that it included a cut to the private part (Exhibit PTA, Tab 4; Q/A390-445-448, 482-484, 596-600, 604) - in C2’s interview, she confirmed that she can give direct evidence that she had a cut on her private part, that it happened in her mother’s room when lying on a cushion and that it hurt her bottom when it happened (Exhibit PTA, Tab 5; Q/A194, 203-223, 232-233) - accordingly, the Crown submitted that the evidence of C1 and C2 was significant and important, noting that the medical evidence of Dr Marks was limited in that she did not state that FGM had definitively occurred, with the highest she could state being that she was not able to visualise the head of the clitoris on either girl, and therefore she was unable to exclude that her observation could simply be just a variation of the normal appearance of that part of the anatomy of the girls - nor did the electronically recorded material cover the areas which the accounts of C1 and C2 did;
	
	
	s.18(7)(c) - whilst noting that there is other evidence to be led in the trial (including the electronically recorded material), the Crown submitted that there was no direct evidence of the procedures occurring if C1 and C2 did not give evidence;
	
	
	s.18(7)(d) - the Crown acknowledged that C1 and C2 have a strong relationship with their mother and are dependent upon her given their age - however, the Crown submitted that the reality of most prosecutions involving FGM is that they will almost always involve child complainants being required to give evidence against family members, including one or both parents, given the context in which such conduct is likely to occur - the Crown submitted that this type of prosecution is analogous to domestic and child assault prosecutions, where the law is strong on the compellability of witnesses to give evidence - the Crown submitted that there is a particularly strong public interest to prosecute FGM matters to act as a deterrent to other persons who may be inclined to engage in such practices, and that it was important to send a clear message to the general public about condoning this type of behaviour.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that, when considering the balancing exercise in s.18, whilst harm might or could occur to persons or relationships, such harm did not outweigh the desirability of C1 and C2 being compelled to give evidence. It was submitted that their evidence was crucial and that there is a strong public interest to prosecute this type of matter. It was submitted that the balancing exercise under s.18(6) should lead to the conclusion that C1 and C2 should be required to give evidence at the trial.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused persons submitted that there was other evidence available to the prosecution apart from that of C1 and C2, and that this was relevant to the balancing exercise to be undertaken under s.18(6) and (7). Reference was made to the electronically recorded material in this regard. With respect to s.18(7)(a), it was said that there was no allegation of the use of physical force. It was submitted that the Court should find that C1 and C2 were not compellable witnesses for the purpose of this trial.
	


Decision


	
	Section 18 Evidence Act 1995 extends (relevantly) to a child the right to object to being required to give evidence as a witness for the prosecution in a criminal proceeding brought against the child’s parent. Where objection is taken, the Court is required to rule on it, applying the balancing test contained in s.18(6) and s.18(7) of the Act: LS v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2011] NSWSC 1016; 81 NSWLR 551 at 559 [35].
	
	
	Section 18(6)(a) sets a relatively low threshold. The issue is whether the Court finds that there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the proposed witness, or to the relationship between the proposed witness and the (related) defendant if the witness gives evidence. It is not necessary that the Court find that harm would probably or necessarily be caused. Rather, it is sufficient that there is a likelihood that harm might be caused.
	
	
	The statute does not define the word “harm” for the purpose of s.18(6). It appears, from the context in which the word is used, that it extends to harm to a relevant relationship, including psychological harm.
	
	
	If s.18(6)(a) is satisfied, the Court must consider whether the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given. In this regard, the Court must have regard to the non-exhaustive list of mandatory considerations set out in s.18(7) of the Act.
	
	
	Before referring to the psychological evidence, it is important to note that the psychologists were not informed of the particular allegations or charges in this case. This does not operate to devalue the opinions of the psychologists as to the prospect of harm. Rather, it emphasises that this issue will be evaluated by the Court upon the basis that the Court, and not the psychologists, is aware of the precise allegations. This aspect is important to a number of factors to be considered under s.18(7) of the Act.
	
	
	With respect to s.18(6)(a) concerning C1 and C2, there is a body of psychological evidence which indicates the prospect of harm occurring to each child if she is required to give evidence against her mother.
	
	
	Concerning C1, Dr Pulman stated that there was a likelihood that harm may be caused to her, and to her family relationships, if she was required to give evidence against her mother. Should she be compelled to give evidence, C1 may suffer psychological harm, including loss of self-esteem, anxiety and ongoing mental health concerns which could impact on her schooling, academic achievements, peer social relationships and capacity to form attachments throughout her life. With respect to potential harm to C1’s relationship with her mother, Dr Pulman spoke of the possibility that C1 may attribute blame and responsibility to herself (Exhibit PTD).
	
	
	Ms O’Neill expressed the opinion that C1’s psychological wellbeing, and her relationship with her mother, may be harmed by her giving evidence (Exhibit PT2).
	
	
	With respect to C2, Dr Pulman expressed similar opinions (to those about C1) concerning the likelihood of harm, if C2 was called upon to give evidence against her mother (Exhibit PTC).
	
	
	Dr Banks expressed the view that C2 would be likely to suffer harm if she was called to give evidence against her mother. Dr Banks emphasised the central role played by the mother in determining C2’s emotional, psychological, health, nutritional and educational needs and the role of a parent with respect to a child’s mental health, psycho-social adjustment and behaviour (Exhibit PT1).
	
	
	I am satisfied, on the evidence, that there is a likelihood that psychological harm might be caused to each of C1 and C2, and to the relationship between each of those girls and their mother, if each of C1 and C2 was called to give evidence. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the requirements of s.18(6)(a) are made out.
	
	
	It is necessary for the Court to consider next the nature and extent of that harm and whether it outweighs the desirability of having evidence given by C1 and C2: s.18(6)(b). This involves a consideration, in turn, of the non-exhaustive list of mandatory factors under s.18(7) of the Act.
	
	
	With respect to s.18(7)(a), I accept that the charges against A2 are serious in nature. The law characterises FGM offences as being serious. It may be said that offences under s.45 Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed by persons related to, or associated with, the young girls in question, and with the knowledge of a parent or parents. This is an important factor to bear in mind in the balancing exercise.
	
	
	It is notable that s.19 Evidence Act 1995 operates to exclude certain charges from the ambit of s.18 and the capacity of a person to seek to be excused from compellability under that provision. The rationale and operation of s.19 were considered in LS v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW).
	
	
	It was not submitted here that charges under ss.45 or 59(2) Crimes Act 1900 are caught by s.19, so as to preclude the operation of s.18. However, the rationale for s.19 may be of indirect assistance to the present application.
	
	
	The context in which the present charges arise is an allegation that FGM was carried out on each of C1 and C2 at the request of and in the presence of the mother, A2. There is a public interest in charges of this type being tried by reference to the adducing of all available evidence, including evidence of the alleged child victims.
	
	
	It will be evident that there is some additional tension in consideration of a s.18 application in a case such as this. There is evidence that harm is likely to be done to the children if they are required to give evidence against their mother. However, central to the Crown case against A2 and the other Accused persons is that each of C1 and C2 was subjected to an illegal procedure carried out upon the person of the child in breach of that child’s rights.
	
	
	The psychological evidence concerning the prospect of harm to the children is, in reality, unsurprising. As I have noted, the psychological opinion is not expressed with complete knowledge of the allegations brought here against the Accused persons. It may be accepted readily that harm might be caused to the children, and their relationship with their mother, if they are required to give evidence.
	
	
	However, the observation made in the preceding paragraph must be qualified by the fact that the evidence of C1 and C2 in this case will largely be given by the playing of the recorded interview undertaken with each child in August 2012. I bear in mind, as well, the relatively narrow issues in dispute in the trial. This does not appear to be a trial where a challenge will be made to the evidence of C1 and C2 on a credibility basis. Any questioning of C1 and C2 will be both limited and short.
	
	
	With respect to s.18(7)(b), I am satisfied that the substance and importance of the evidence of C1 and C2 is considerable. Although the Crown has available to it other evidence, including telephone interception and surveillance device evidence, that evidence is indirect in nature. Indeed, parts of the intercepted conversations require knowledge of what C1 and C2 said in interviews with police to permit a clear understanding of what is being said. The interviews of C1 and C2 provide direct accounts of what each girl said happened on the occasion in question. The recorded interviews of C1 and C2 were made in 2012, much closer to the events in question.
	
	
	The medical evidence available to the Crown is limited. In reality, the Crown case is based upon a combination of evidence, including the accounts of C1 and C2, the medical evidence and the electronically intercepted evidence. To remove the evidence of C1 and C2 from this equation would involve a very significant reduction of the Crown case against the Accused persons.
	
	
	With respect to the weight that may be attached to the evidence of C1 and C2, it is sufficient to note that the recorded interviews of each girl suggest the emergence of accounts from each of them which is likely to carry weight in the eyes of a jury.
	
	
	With respect to s.18(7)(c), I have mentioned already the other evidence available to the Crown. The other evidence does not, on its face, cover the areas of the accounts of C1 and C2.
	
	
	With respect to s.18(7)(d), it is important to keep in mind as well that C1 and C2 continue to live with their mother, father and family. This is not a situation where the girls are now separated from their mother. There is an ongoing relationship between mother and daughters which must be taken into account under s.18. This is not a case where there has been a breakdown in the relationship between the children and the mother as a result of these allegations.
	
	
	I have regard to the existence of the parent/child relationship at present. I accept that some harm is likely to be done to that relationship if the children are called to give evidence. That said, in the circumstances of this trial, I anticipate that the evidence of C1 and C2 will involve largely the playing of interviews already made. Each of the children has already taken that step in the investigation of the mother and the other Accused persons. There is no evidence that harm has resulted as a consequence of the children taking that step in the investigatory phase. Any further questioning of C1 and C2 is likely to be very confined in its nature.
	
	
	I do not consider that there is any factor under s.18(7)(e) which may give rise to disclosure of matters received by the children in confidence from their mother.
	
	
	I return to the question posed by s.18(6) of the Act. Having found there is a likelihood of harm for the purpose of s.18(6)(a), it is necessary to consider whether the Court finds that the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given. This ultimate question takes into account the mandatory factors identified in s.18(7) of the Act together with any other relevant factors.
	
	
	Section 18(6)(b) itself speaks of the “desirability of having the evidence given”. In a criminal trial, there is a public interest in the Crown having available to it to be called, all evidence touching upon the question of the guilt of persons accused of serious offences. Of course, where a witness falls within s.18(2), this consideration may give way in the exercise of the statutory decision making required under s.18(6).
	
	
	The balancing exercise to be undertaken in this particular case involves, in broad terms, the following competing considerations:
	



	
	the importance of the accounts of C1 and C2 to the Crown case on charges where their own right to personal and physical integrity is said to have been compromised by alleged criminal acts undertaken by their mother and others;
	
	
	the likelihood of harm being done to them and their relationship with their mother if they are called as witnesses, although with those adverse consequences being substantially limited by the manner and form of the giving of evidence by C1 and C2, and the content of their evidence given the limited issues in dispute in the trial.
	



	
	Having undertaken the balancing exercise required by s.18(6) of the Act, I do not find that the nature and extent of the harm to be done to C1 and C2 outweighs the desirability of C1 and C2 giving evidence, so that such evidence is available to the jury at the trial of the Accused persons.
	
	
	I decline the application by C1 and C2 under s.18 Evidence Act 1995. Each of C1 and C2 remains a compellable witness in the forthcoming trial.
	
	
	As would already be clear, the ruling which I have made operates upon the basis that each of C1 and C2 is a “vulnerable person” for the purpose of s.306U Criminal Procedure Act 1986, so that the interview conducted with each child may be utilised as part of the evidence of each girl at the trial pursuant to s.306V of that Act.
	


Crown Application Under s.65 Evidence Act 1995


	
	Having determined, for the purpose of s.18 Evidence Act 1995, that each of C1 and C2 should remain a compellable witness at the trial, it is not strictly necessary to consider the Crown’s alternative application based upon s.65 of that Act. However, given that the matter was fully argued, I will express my conclusion in this respect relatively briefly.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, if the Court held that C1 and C2 were not compellable for the purpose of s.18, each of them would be “unavailable” to give evidence for the purpose of s.65. I am satisfied that they would fall within Clause 4(1)(g) within Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act.
	
	
	The Crown has sought to require both C1 and C2 to give evidence. The Crown has resisted the compellability argument under s.18. If C1 and C2 were held not to be compellable, for the purpose of s.18, it may be concluded readily that the Crown had taken all reasonable steps to compel the person to give evidence, but without success.
	
	
	I do not accept the contrary submission that, as a matter of construction, the presence of cl.4(1)(b) in the definition means that witnesses held not to be compellable under s.18 are not capable of being “unavailable” for the purpose of the provision.
	
	
	In concluding that C1 and C2 were relevantly unavailable for the purpose of s.65, I would follow the reasoning of Beach J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Nicholls [2010] VSC 397; 204 A Crim R 306 at 311-312 [18]-[21]. Beach J ruled that a successful objection under s.18 Evidence Act 2008 (Vic) rendered a person unavailable for the purpose of s.65 of the Victorian Act. In reaching this conclusion, his Honour applied the decision of Hamilton J in Mindshare Communications Limited v Orleans Investments Pty Limited [2007] NSWSC 976 at [14]-[18]. Riley CJ reached a similar conclusion in Sanderson v Rabuntja [2014] NTSC 13 at [25]-[27]. With respect, I agree with the reasoning of Hamilton J, Beach J and Riley CJ on this issue.
	
	
	The approach adopted by Beach J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Nicholls was applied by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Fletcher v R [2015] VSCA 146. In that case, Dixon AJA (Weinberg JA agreeing) applied this reasoning so that a successful objector under s.18 of the Victorian Act was held to be unavailable for the purpose of s.65 of that Act (see [53]ff).
	
	
	Before me, some reliance was placed by Mr Gow and counsel for the Accused persons upon the decision in R v BO (No. 2) [2012] NSWDC 195; 15 DCLR (NSW) 317.
	
	
	In Fletcher v R, the Victorian Court of Appeal accepted that a statement taken by an investigator, before charges were laid, from a person who has successfully made a claim to be excused under s.18 could be relied upon by the Crown under s.65 of the Act. In this respect, the Court distinguished the decision in R v BO (No. 2). Dixon AJA said at [58]:
	


“I agree with the Crown’s submission that the form of the evidence considered in BO may explain the result in that decision, particularly the video recorded evidence given by the elder boy at an earlier trial. But here the statement was a written statement taken by an investigator before charges were laid. The process of making a statement during an investigation cannot be conflated with the process of giving evidence at a trial. The rules in respect of competence and compellability of witnesses to give evidence at a trial do not govern criminal investigation processes. Absent special arrangements, evidence that is ‘given’ is received by the court by being seen and heard from the witness box. That evidence does not exist until it is given. A document, such as a statement, may be tendered as an exhibit. An exhibit is also evidence in a trial, but while tender is a process of adducing evidence in a criminal proceeding, the process of creating the document tendered - in this case making a statement - is not. Making a statement to police is neither a process of ‘giving’ evidence, nor a process in a criminal proceeding as that term is defined by the Act.”


	
	I do not accept the submission of Mr Gow, adopted by counsel for the Accused persons, that a distinction can be made between a written statement of a witness and a recorded interview of a witness in this respect. The recorded interview is obtained during the investigatory stage. It will become evidence if admitted at the trial.
	
	
	Attention would then turn to s.65 of the Act itself. In this respect, consideration is to be given to the recorded interviews of C1 and C2. I have viewed the DVD recording of each interview and read the transcript of the interviews. If the point had been reached, I would have been satisfied that the relevant requirements of s.65(1) and (2) had been met.
	
	
	If the Court had upheld the s.18 objections taken by C1 and C2, I would nevertheless have allowed the Crown to rely upon the recorded interviews with C1 and C2 under s.65 Evidence Act 1995. In reaching such a conclusion, I would have applied the Victorian decisions which, in my view, bear directly upon the questions falling for consideration in this case.
	
	
	Given the conclusions reached by the Court, it is not necessary to say more upon this issue.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for these reasons that I made the rulings on 6 August 2015 set out at [4] above.

2767666,Masri v R [2015] NSWCCA 243,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: On 14 July 2014 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that alleged an offence against s 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (“the Code”). Section 135.1(3) provides that a person is guilty of an offence if the person “does anything with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss” to a Commonwealth entity. Section 11.2A of the Code (upon which the prosecution relied) sets out circumstances in which such an offence may be committed jointly with another person. Essentially, s 11.2A is the Commonwealth statutory adoption of the common law doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. It was on that basis that the appellant was charged.
	
	
	Initially, the indictment presented was as follows:
	


“Between about 30 December 2011 and 17 January 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did participate in an agreement with Omar Elomar to falsely represent that container number HDMU2571422 contained glass and aluminium frames with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss of customs duty to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.”


	
	At the conclusion of the opening address by the Crown prosecutor, a question was raised as to whether the indictment was duplicitous. After hearing argument, Bozic DCJ held that it was, and discharged the jury. He granted leave to the Crown to amend the indictment, which it did, rephrasing it in the following terms:
	


“Between about 30 December 2011 and 17 January 2012 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, was facilitating the release of container number HDMU2571422 and its contents with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which is a Commonwealth entity.”


	
	After a trial by jury, the appellant was convicted of the offence. Section 135.1(3) provides for a maximum penalty for the offence of imprisonment for 5 years. On 17 October 2014 Bozic DCJ sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 16 months (commencing on the day sentence was imposed) and ordered that he be released at the expiration of 10 months, that is on 16 August 2015.
	
	
	The appellant now appeals against the conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. He has identified three grounds of appeal against conviction, and one against sentence. They are reproduced below.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown case, as opened to the jury, was circumstantial. A large proportion of the prosecution evidence was not in dispute and was put before the jury in the form of two Statements of Agreed Facts (Exhibits B and H), pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Put briefly, the Crown alleged that there was in existence a known method of fraudulent importation of goods, called “the piggyback” method. This involved the use of the name of a legitimate importer with a satisfactory record, who would, therefore, be less likely to attract a high degree of scrutiny from Customs authorities, who had in operation a risk “profiling” system, that enabled a lower risk profile to be assigned to regular and compliant importers. A fraudulent importation would then be forwarded to that importer, but intercepted before it could be delivered. By that means, the fraudulent importation would escape the scrutiny of Customs officers.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the appellant was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with another man (Omar Elomar) to import into Australia cigarettes in containers that falsely represented that the contents were float glass and aluminium frames, and thereby avoid the imposition of customs duties. In order to do so, they utilised “the piggyback” method. The Crown alleged that, in November and December 2011, Elomar, with the assistance of the appellant, arranged for the shipment of a container loaded with cigarettes to be consigned to Australia, addressed to a company called “Alternative Glass”. The container docked in Sydney on 11 January 2012 on board a ship called “the Cape Mondego”.
	
	
	A Customs agent was engaged to secure the clearance of the container through Customs. The agent was provided with false documents for the purpose. However, having become suspicious, the agent withdrew. Various steps were then taken to ensure that the clearance was achieved.
	
	
	On 13 January 2012 Customs agents examined, and then seized, the cargo.
	
	
	In opening the case to the jury, the Crown prosecutor identified the appellant’s participation as including:
	



	
	facilitating and dealing with the necessary “paperwork”;
	
	
	providing funds for import freight charges;
	
	
	obtaining an electronic delivery order (referred to as an “EDO”), necessary to secure the release of the container.
	


The Crown also alleged that, between the dates alleged in the indictment to have been the time at which the offence was committed, the appellant and Elomar were in frequent communication by mobile telephone. In their conversations, the two men used a form of code, designed to disguise their conversations in the event that they were subject to electronic surveillance. The communications were, in fact, under electronic surveillance and were recorded. The recordings, and transcripts thereof, made up a considerable part of the Crown case.


	
	Prior to the commencement of the trial, a ruling was sought on the admissibility of a body of evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely. This was evidence that, the Crown asserted, had the capacity to show that the appellant and Elomar had, on four separate occasions, previously been involved in importations of cigarettes in a similar way to that alleged against the appellant in the charge the subject of the indictment. Objection was taken to the admission of the evidence, and a voir dire was conducted. The trial judge ruled, on 4 July 2014, that the evidence relating to three, but not the fourth, of the previous importations would be admitted. That ruling gives rise to the second ground of appeal. It will be necessary to deal with the evidence, and the argument, in more detail below.
	


The defence case


	
	The appellant did not give or call evidence. As opened by senior counsel on his behalf, the issue was a very narrow one indeed. It was not in dispute that the cigarettes had been illegally imported, and that they had been illegally imported by Elomar. Nor was it in dispute that the appellant had, in the past, been (at least) involved in Elomar’s importations.
	
	
	In outlining the defence case to the jury (at the conclusion of the Crown opening), senior counsel said:
	


“One thing you are going to have to watch out for and it will become an issue in this case is this, there are a series of telephone calls prior to December the 30th. You will hear them probably tomorrow and that is Omar Elomar and Masri and others. And the conversations, quite frankly, is pretty shifty. They are clearly talking, you might think about the tobacco smuggling business …

Now that will paint a very bad picture for Mr Masri, as being a bloke who you might think is well and truly involved in the black market of cigarettes and maybe even containers. But he’s not charged with that. That evidence is there so you can, as Mr Crown says, see what the system is, so you can interpret the words, Dell, D, paperwork. It is going to be a hard job. And his Honour will give you a warning because the case is not about whether Mr Masri is the sort of person who might be involved in black market of cigarettes. The case is not about whether Mr Masri might have done something before, though you will form a bad opinion about him probably, if he has. The case is not about whether he knows people who are smugglers. What the case is about is this case. The one you’re dealing with. Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that he was facilitating the removal of a container in an agreement with Mr Elomar and others or Mr Elomar as part of a joint criminal enterprise to get the container off the docks.”

The appeal against conviction


	
	The grounds of the conviction appeal are pleaded as:
	


“1  His Honour erred in permitting the Crown to amend the indictment, in circumstances where the amended indictment was duplicitous;

2  His Honour erred in admitting evidence of other ‘piggyback importations’ as background/context evidence, on the grounds that such evidence was irrelevant, or inadmissible, or alternatively, should have been excluded pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995;

3  His Honour erred in directing the jury that substantial participation in the importation of containers, prior to the offence charged, could support an inference of continued substantial participation.”

The proposed ground of appeal against sentence is as follows:

“1  His Honour erred in sentencing the appellant, on the basis that the appellant’s role was not insignificant, in circumstances where his Honour was unable to make a finding as to the appellant’s role.”

Ground 1: duplicity


	
	The first ground of appeal against conviction may be stated simply. It depends upon the construction of the word “anything” as it appears in s 135.1(3). Section 135.1(3) is in the following terms:
	


“(3)  A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)  the person does anything with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to another person; and

(b)  the other person is a Commonwealth entity.

Penalty:  Imprisonment for 5 years.”


	
	The entire point of the ground is that the charge as framed is duplicitous because the Crown relied upon a variety of acts on the part of the appellant to sustain it. Implicit in the argument was that each individual act ought to have given rise to a separate charge.
	
	
	The appellant sought to gain support for the argument from two decisions of this Court. The first is Giam v R [1999] NSWCCA 53; 104 A Crim R 416. Mr Giam was charged under a section of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (s 178BB, now repealed) that created an offence of making “any statement” known to the maker to be false or misleading “in a material particular” with intent to gain financial advantage.
	
	
	What was alleged against Mr Giam was that he made two statements to a bank, the first that he was the secretary of a company, and the second that he was authorised (by the company) to enter into certain arrangements on its behalf. The Crown (State) asserted that both statements were false, and the jury was directed that all members of the jury had to be unanimous as to which (if only one) was knowingly false.
	
	
	Spigelman CJ (with whom Abadee and Adams JJ agreed) accepted a submission that the indictment was bad for duplicity. He nominated three reasons. The first was, conventionally, that a criminal statute is to be construed strictly. The second was that the word “any”, as it appears before “statement” pointed to “a degree of singularity”. The third (somewhat puzzlingly) was that:
	


“… the reference to the definite article in these crucial references to ‘material particularity’ is such as to identify the fact that a single statement is being referred to on the proper construction”

of the section. It is likely, in my opinion, that the reference to “the definite article” was intended to be a second reference to the singularity imported into the phrase “false or misleading in a material particular”.


	
	Importantly, his Honour went on to note a category of cases in which a single statement can be constituted by more than one utterance or representation.
	
	
	In my opinion the decision in Giam does not in any way advance the appellant’s argument. There is no equivalent “singularity” in what is made the subject of s 135.1(3) of the Code. “Anything” does not, in any way, equate to “a statement” or “a material particular”. The legislation under consideration in Giam was legislation which referred to “any statement” that is false in “a material particular”. The Crown there relied upon two separate statements, either of which could have founded the charge. But Spigelman CJ recognised that a single statement could be constituted by multiple utterances or representations. It will be necessary, in any individual case, to examine what it is that the Crown asserts. Each case will depend upon the terminology of the statute in question.
	
	
	The second authority to which reference was made was Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCCA 157; 139 LGERA 449. BGP Properties and its controller (a Mr Gordon) were prosecuted in the Land and Environment Court under s 118D(1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW), which relevantly provided:
	


(1)  A person must not, by an act or an omission, do anything that causes damage to any habitat … of a threatened species …


	
	The Summons against Mr Gordon, after amendment, was in the following terms:
	


“That between [date and place] he did, by an act, namely by slashing, clearing and/or crushing vegetation and/or constructing access tracks on Lot 1 DP 42613 and/or Lot 4 DP 248860, caused damage …”


	
	In pre-trial correspondence, the prosecutor confirmed that it would be the prosecution case that:
	


“(a)  slashing vegetation; and/or

(b)  clearing vegetation; and/or

(c)  crushing vegetation; and/or

(d)  constructing access tracks;

in and of itself caused ‘damage’ to the habitat of the relevant threatened species …”


	
	Giles JA (with whom Buddin J agreed) held that the amendment created “self-inflicted and self-confessed duplicity”. That was because:
	


“20  The [prosecutor] chose to use ‘and/or’, deliberately so according to the correspondence prior to the hearing of the application … It is evident that he proposes so to conduct his case as to maintain that an offence will be made out if he proves clearing vegetation without more, that an offence will be made out if he proves constructing access tracks without more, and so on, as the act or omission causing damage to the habitat; further, that an offence will be made out if he proves damage by activity on either of the lots … he alleges damage caused in a number of different ways, and the different ways are alternatives.”


	
	This was specifically the result of the manner in which the prosecutor proposed to conduct the case, by the series of alternatives set out. In the preceding paragraph Giles JA said:
	


“19  If [the prosecutor’s] case was that the damage to the habitat had been caused by the cumulation of a number of acts or omissions, a charge could have been framed in terms which enabled him to rely on the course of conduct … On the other hand, if [the prosecutor’s] case was that the damage to the habitat was caused by one act or omission, or alternatively another act or omission, the separate acts or omissions would mean separate offences.


	
	Far from assisting the appellant’s case, the decision in BGP confirms that reliance on a course of conduct is sufficient to avoid duplicity. That is precisely what the Crown in the present case relies upon.
	
	
	The word “anything”, although it appears in s 135.1(3), does not appear in the amended indictment (nor did it appear in the original indictment). What the Crown alleged, as is perfectly clear from the language of the amended indictment, is that the conduct attributed to the appellant as constituting the offence against s 135.1(3) of the Code was “facilitating the release” of the container. That is something that can be done by a multiplicity of individual acts, amounting to a course of conduct. It would be very surprising indeed if, on the proper construction of the legislation, an accused person could be charged with a separate offence in relation to every telephone call, every interaction with a co-offender, every dealing with documentation, every communication with a Customs agent, and every payment. Yet that would be the effect of acceptance of the appellant’s proposition. And it could hardly be in the interests of the appellant for the Court to adopt that position. He would be exposed to a separate penalty of imprisonment for 5 years in respect of each individual act.
	
	
	The proposition itself depends upon the construction of the word “anything”, and relies heavily upon the decision of Spigelman CJ in Giam. What must be recognised, and is of linguistic importance, is that “anything” is quite a different concept to “any statement”. In the latter, “any” has the effect of separating individual statements, each of which (to amount to a crime) must be false or misleading “in a material particular”; in the former, the composite notion is to encompass a variety of acts. In this case, the “anything” the appellant was alleged to have done was the facilitation of the importation. That was done by a series of acts, or as Giles JA said, a course of conduct.
	
	
	In my opinion there is no substance in Ground 1. I would reject it.
	


Ground 2: the admission of evidence of other “piggyback” importations


	
	The trial judge admitted evidence of three other importations in which the names of legitimate importers (of other types of goods) had been appropriated. All of these were in December 2011. He rejected the evidence of a fourth, and earlier, importation, on the basis that the appellant was not shown to have been involved in it, although Elomar was; that was an importation in the name of an entity called “Eccosit”. The importations in respect of which he admitted evidence were in the names of entities called “Pakplast”, “Alpha Tiles”, and “Livingstone”.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor identified the basis of the tender of the evidence as “background, context, and relationship”. He expressly disavowed reliance on the evidence as tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act. Objection to the admission of the evidence was taken on behalf of the appellant on the grounds:
	


(i)  that, notwithstanding the disavowal by the Crown prosecutor, the evidence was, properly characterised, tendency evidence, and the requirements of s 97 had not been met; if not admitted to prove tendency, the evidence was otherwise irrelevant;

(ii)  the evidence ought to be rejected under s 137 of the Evidence Act, its probative value being outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.


	
	Before turning to the specific matters raised in support of this ground, I make the following observations. It is worth reiterating that Ground 2 challenges the admissibility of the evidence. By s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), a conviction may be set aside on the ground of “the wrong decision of any question of law”. Such a ground is to be determined on the material that was before the trial judge at the time of the decision to admit the evidence. I make that rather obvious observation because of the following circumstances.
	
	
	The voir dire into the admissibility of this evidence was conducted on 1 and 2 July 2014, before the jury was empanelled. The transcript of that proceeding reveals that a good deal of evidence was tendered. In the opening stages, the transcript shows, the trial judge was presented with what was described as a “Statement of Facts of the Australian Federal Police”, and a “Schedule”. These were not marked as exhibits. The Crown then tendered what was described as a “Folder Volume 1” (Ex A), which, it appears, contained a number of witness statements. The Crown also tendered a “Statement of Facts” (Ex B); a “Schedule of Containers” (Ex C); and a “Volume of telephone intercepts together with the CD of the actual recording” (Ex D).
	
	
	On behalf of the appellant, a bundle of correspondence between legal representatives (Ex 1, p 649) and a “Bundle seized on execution of search warrant” (Ex 2, p 649). The transcript (656-661) reveals that the compact disc recordings of 16 telephone conversations were played to the court.
	
	
	Almost none of this material was provided to this Court.
	
	
	When, in the course of preparation of these reasons, it became apparent that the Statement of Facts and Schedule referred to did not accord with the two statements of facts in the evidence as admitted under s 191 of the Evidence Act (Exhibits B and H in the trial), efforts were made by the Court to obtain from the parties the correct document. Eventually, a Statement of Facts, which appears to be that to which reference was made, was provided. No document conforming with the “Schedule” was provided; nor were any of the other documents marked as voir dire exhibits, nor the compact discs. There was contained in the appeal materials the two “Statements of Agreed Facts under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995”, Exhibits B and H in the trial.
	
	
	Since the parties have evinced no interest in ensuring that this Court has available to it the material upon which the trial judge made his decision, and appear to have no concerns about the absence of that evidence, on which the admissibility ruling was made, it is necessary that this Court proceed to rule on the ground as best it can.
	
	
	The Statement of Facts that was eventually provided (not the Statement of Agreed Facts for the purposes of s 191) referred to evidence relating to the Pakplast, Alpha Tiles, and Livingstone Importations. It contained extracts of intercepted conversations involving the appellant and Elomar, sometimes with each other, sometimes with third parties. The Crown prosecutor relied on the conversations, inter alia, to show a “familiarity of language” between the appellant and Elomar, the relationship between them, and the nature of the transactions in which they were engaged. The evidence could be seen to show a pattern of conduct that put in context the evidence specifically referable to the Alternative Glass importation. There is one conversation that bears particular attention. On 29 December 2011, the appellant, when speaking to an unknown male, was recorded as saying:
	


“I got screwed too. Two man, fucking two”

and

“I got screwed two in like one week.”

The statement goes on to note that the unknown male suggested that the appellant change his occupation and become a partner in furniture removals, to which the appellant replied by saying that he had a house within the next two or three days for removal and for the unknown male to be on standby.


	
	The value of this conversation to the Crown is that, on 19 December 2011, the Pakplast importation had been examined by Customs officers and seized; and on 23 December 2011, the Alpha Tiles importation was similarly examined and seized. The reference to being twice “screwed” could be construed by the jury as a reference to those failed importations. The reference to “a house within the next 2-3 days for removal” could be construed by the jury as a reference to the anticipated arrival of the Cape Mondego bearing the Alternative Glass importation.
	
	
	In a further conversation which was recorded between the appellant and Elomar on 12 January 2012, Elomar was recorded as asking the appellant whether the appellant wanted him to bring “paperwork” to which the appellant responded “Yeah”. On the Crown case, the reference to “paperwork” was a reference to documentation associated with the importation in the name of Alternative Glass. On the following day, a further conversation was recorded between Elomar and the appellant, in which the appellant was recorded as saying “… get me the D tonight”. That, on the Crown case, was reference to the electronic delivery order, or EDO (referred to at [11] above). There was also evidence of a conversation between them on 15 January 2012 where the passage of a vessel was discussed which, on the Crown case, was a reference to the path of the Cape Mondego. Within that conversation was a further reference to “paperwork”.
	


The judgment on the voir dire


	
	In respect of the evidence concerning the Pakplast, Alpha Tiles and Livingstone importations, the trial judge said:
	


“If the evidence was restricted to the telephone intercepts and conduct in the period specified in the indictment, namely 30 December 2011 to 17 January 2012, and the evidence admissible was only that relating to the Alternative Glass importation, the jury would have before them evidence of four phone calls between Elomar and the accused, namely on 12, 13, 15 and 16 January. It would be in that context that they would then be asked to assess the Crown case in the context of the issue raised by the accused and they would do so on the basis that there was one apparent dealing between the accused and Elomar, and they would have to determine, in the light of the conversations particularly on 15th and 16th, whether there was the agreement of the kind alleged by the Crown.

In my view to restrict the evidence in that way would be highly artificial …”


	
	He proceeded to identify four independent bases justifying the admission of the evidence. These were:
	


(i) the evidence demonstrated “substantial participation” in the importation of containers in December 2011, that is, at a point close in time to the importation the subject of the indictment, and could therefore support an inference of continued participation;

(ii) the evidence threw light upon the nature and character of the association between Elomar and the appellant, who could be seen to be close associates, speaking in code; the evidence was therefore relevant to showing the extent of the appellant’s involvement;

(iii) the evidence was available to the Crown to negative an anticipated case on the part of the appellant that his involvement was limited to contributing $1000 “for something to do with the contents of the container”;

(iv) the evidence threw light upon the language - code - used by Elomar and the appellant during the intercepted telephone conversations.


	
	He rejected the objection based on s 97 of the Evidence Act. In reaching this conclusion, his Honour relied upon the decision of the High Court in Harriman v The Queen [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590.
	
	
	His Honour then considered the objection based on s 137 of the Evidence Act. Essentially for the same reasons, he concluded that the probative value of the evidence was “very high” as showing substantial participation, shedding light on the character of the association between Elomar and the appellant and capable of “creating a very different context in which to analyse the events in the period of the indictment”.
	
	
	He considered that any prejudice the evidence could cause to the appellant could be remedied by appropriate directions. He found, for the purposes of s 137, that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.
	


The argument on appeal


	
	The principal argument advanced in relation to Ground 2 was that the evidence is, properly characterised, tendency evidence within the meaning of s 97 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Throughout the voir dire, the Crown prosecutor was at pains to insist that the evidence was not tendered for a tendency purpose. It was stated, as set out above, to be tendered for the purpose of showing the context in which the appellant and Elomar were operating, the relationship between the two, and the extent of the appellant’s participation in the importation.
	
	
	“Tendency evidence” is evidence tendered for that purpose: see the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. However, the assertion by the tendering party that evidence is not tendered for that purpose cannot be conclusive, and it is necessary for the court to examine the real purpose of the tender of the evidence. The nature of tendency evidence was explored by this Court in Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303; 316 ALR 206 at [353]-[372]. Tendency evidence is evidence to provide a foundation for an inference that, because the person in question had the relevant tendency, it is more likely that he or she acted in the way asserted by the tendering party, or had the state of mind asserted by the tendering party, on an occasion the subject of the proceedings.
	
	
	That was not the purpose of the evidence the subject of this ground of appeal. It was, in the true sense, evidence tendered to establish, and capable of establishing, the context in which the events the subject of the trial took place.
	
	
	It was also submitted that Harriman was not authority for the admission of the evidence. It was pointed out (correctly) that Harriman was decided under an evidence law regime that predated and did not involve the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It is true that authorities decided under a different regime, or in NSW before the enactment of the Evidence Act, must be approached in the light of any changes made by the Evidence Act. However, once it is accepted that the evidence was not tendered under s 97, common law principles continue to be relevant. In Harriman, the High Court unanimously concluded, in relation to a trial of a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin into Australia, evidence that the accused and another person (apparently a co-offender, but the chief Crown witness) had a previous involvement in the sale of heroin was admissible as being highly probative of the criminal character of the association between the accused and the witness at the time of the importation the subject of the trial. The circumstances in Harriman can be directly related to the circumstances of the present case. The evidence was admissible on the principles stated by the High Court in that case.
	
	
	A further argument advanced in respect of this ground of appeal was directed to the third and fourth bases on which the trial judge determined to admit the evidence. It was submitted that it was not necessary, or even helpful, to understand the code used by the appellant and Elomar. It was submitted that the Crown had alternative means of proving the appellant’s involvement.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence in the Crown case did not consist merely of telephone intercept evidence, and further, that the Crown was able to explain the code used without resort to the evidence the subject of this ground.
	
	
	The simple response to that proposition is that it has never been the case that the Crown is shut out from adducing evidence because it has other evidence available to prove the same point. A further point sought to be made was that the codes used were not always consistent, and that there were other means by which the terms used in the conversations could be explained. Again, these are not answers to the admission of the evidence. To the extent that there were inconsistencies in the codes used, that was relevant to the weight to be attributed to the evidence. Moreover, the assertions of inconsistencies in the codes, and the assertions of other available evidence, were not the subject of any evidentiary references by which this Court could make an assessment of the validity of the challenge.
	
	
	Although detailed written submissions were provided in relation to this ground, the oral argument was muted. Indeed, an express concession was made, that if the “cracking of a code” argument failed, then the entire ground failed. That was, in my opinion, an appropriate concession. Since, in my view, the “cracking of the code” argument fails, then the concession has the necessary consequence that the ground fails. In any event, the principal basis on which the admission of the evidence was opposed was that the evidence was tendency evidence, and, in my view, that argument clearly fails. The four bases given by the trial judge for the admission of the evidence have not been shown to be erroneous.
	
	
	Similarly, the contention that the evidence ought to have been admitted or to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act must fail. The trial judge engaged in an entirely appropriate balancing of the probative value of the evidence, which he held to be “very high”, and any unfair prejudicial effect. He considered that appropriate directions could ameliorate any unfairness.
	
	
	In this context, it is of interest that, except in the limited way raised under Ground 3, no complaint is made of the directions he ultimately gave to the jury.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 2 of the appeal.
	


Ground 3: direction concerning substantial participation


	
	The direction about which complaint was made is as follows:
	


“But it is important to understand the limited basis upon which you can use that evidence. The Crown says the evidence in relation to those other containers is relevant in the following ways. First of all it shows in the period prior to 30 December substantial participation by Mr Masri in the importation of containers at a time very close in time to the importation of the Alternative Glass container and the Crown says to you that that evidence of substantial participation can, in the circumstances of this case, support an inference of continued substantial participation. That is the first way.”


	
	Although, on appeal, it was acknowledged that the direction “mirrors” the express reasoning of Brennan J (as he then was) in Harriman, it was nevertheless submitted that the direction was erroneous. It was submitted that the direction invited tendency evidence reasoning.
	
	
	The acknowledgment that the direction was drawn directly from the judgment of Brennan J in Harriman was correct and is fatal to the ground. The direction did not invite tendency reasoning; it invited reasoning along the lines expressly authorised in Harriman. There was no error in this direction. I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The proposed ground of appeal against sentence was narrow. It concerned a finding that the appellant was motivated by financial greed, and that his role was “not insignificant”. This was contrasted with an earlier observation by the trial judge that he could not be satisfied as to the precise role played by the appellant. It was not, therefore, it was submitted, open to the trial judge to assess the appellant’s role as “not insignificant”.
	
	
	I would reject this contention. The evidence showed various activities undertaken by the appellant, and conversations with Elomar, capable of being seen as “not insignificant”.
	
	
	In any event, the sentence imposed is not consistent with a finding of any major degree of involvement by the appellant.
	
	
	I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed;
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence refused.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Simpson J.

		08 September 2015",2015-09-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767674,New South Wales Crime Commission v Eid [2015] NSWSC 1341,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	This is an application brought by summons filed in Court today by the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeking orders pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets and Recovery Act 1990 (“the Act”) in relation to keeping restrained persons from dealing with property, the property being that listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the summons.
	
	
	The owner of the relevant property specified is Milad Eid. Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte and this application is proceeding on that basis.
	
	
	Tendered by the Crime Commission and relied upon in support of the application is an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 7 September 2015. Mr Spark is the Director of Financial Investigations with the New South Wales Crime Commission and he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act. He is authorised in writing by the Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10A and Pt 4 of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark deposes that he has had access to material produced as a consequence of an investigation conducted by the New South Wales Police into the defendant and financial information relating to the defendant. Mr Spark suspects that the defendant has been engaged in serious crime related activities as defined by s 6 of the Act being the commission of an offence of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, together with further offences of supply prohibited drugs under s 25(1) of the same Act and another offence of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. All of these offences are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of, or exceeding, five years, and they fall within the definition of a serious criminal offence pursuant to s 6(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark has made inquiries with New South Wales Police and determined that the defendant was charged by police on 26 August 2015 subsequent to an investigation by police. The defendant is said to be an unemployed man who resides at an address in Minchinbury which he recently purchased for the sum of $675,000 notwithstanding his unemployed status. The New South Wales Police commenced an investigation into the ongoing supply of heroin in the Mount Druitt area in March 2015 in relation to co-accused and physical and electronic surveillance was employed. The defendant is one of the persons who came to the notice of police as a consequence of that surveillance.
	
	
	The police have evidence to establish that the defendant has engaged in the business of supply heroin using a Land Rover Discovery motor vehicle registered to him. The co-accused regularly met with the defendant and would supply heroin in relation to the supply activity, with the defendant and other persons working in concert to distribute significant quantities of heroin to a large client base in the western Sydney area. The electronic surveillance which was conducted between 30 July 2015 and 26 August 2015 has recorded evidence of the defendant supplying heroin on a number of occasions sufficient to establish an ongoing supply per s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, on each occasion receiving financial or other material reward.
	



	
	The defendant was charged last month as noted and he is to appear before the Penrith Local Court on 25 September this year in answer to those charges.
	
	
	Having read the evidentiary material tendered and relied upon by the plaintiff I am satisfied that the suspicion held by Mr Spark is reasonably held. Section 10A(5) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court concludes that the suspicions held by the authorised officer is reasonably held, as I have concluded in this case.
	
	
	Accordingly I am prepared to make the orders sought by the plaintiff.
	


Orders


	
	Pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt otherwise to deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in s 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of Milad Eid, including his interest in the property specified in Schedule 1 hereto.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, Milad Eid shall be examined on oath before a Registrar of the Court concerning his affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which he has an interest.
	
	
	Leave is granted to the plaintiff to obtain from the Registry dates for the examination ordered in Order 2 above.

		11 September 2015",2015-09-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767680,Anderson v Ausgrid [2015] NSWSC 1308,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Justin and Melissa Anderson (the plaintiffs) own and live in a residential house on a property in Phoenix Road, Black Hill in New South Wales (the Property). After Christmas in 2010 they went to Barrington Tops for a holiday. While they were away a fire started in or around the meter box on the Property which spread and caused substantial damage to the house. It is agreed that the damage suffered (including property damage and consequential losses such as alternative accommodation) amounted to $819,676.50 (the Agreed Figure).
	
	
	About a month before the fire, Ausgrid (the defendant) had replaced one of the three meters in the meter box as it was faulty. The plaintiffs claim damages in the sum of the Agreed Figure from the defendant on the basis of alleged negligence and breach of contract, including breaches of terms implied by the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Ultimately only the claim in negligence was pressed. The principal issue in the case was the cause of the fire.
	
	
	A reference to the defendant in these reasons includes a reference to Ausgrid and its predecessors, including Energy Australia.
	


The Facts

The contractual relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant


	
	Because of the way the case was conducted it is not necessary to set out in any detail the terms of the applicable legislation, or of the connection or supply contracts between the plaintiffs and the defendant. It is sufficient to note that it was common ground that the defendant owned the individual meters inside the meter box (and was therefore responsible for defects within them) but did not own other electrical components with the meter box, or the cables or conduit leading to or coming from the meter box. The defendant also accepted that it was responsible for the installation of the replacement meter and therefore was responsible for any negligence associated with such installation.
	


The installation of the meters and the electrical wiring on the Property


	
	The plaintiffs and Christine, Melissa’s mother, purchased the Property in 2005. In 2007 they demolished the dwelling on the Property and constructed a new house. Christine lived at the Property from 2007 until about 2010 with Peter Belcher, whom she married in 2008.
	
	
	Mr Belcher, a technician who was accredited to do metering and underground supply work, conducted his own business under the name Port Stephens Electrical Contracting. I am not satisfied that he was accredited by the defendant since his accreditation to do the work may have come from the Department of Fair Trading or from another instrumentality. Nonetheless, there was no allegation that he was not authorised to perform the following electrical work on the Property.
	
	
	In 2007, over the course of about four days, Mr Belcher installed the electrical wiring on the Property. On 15 August 2007 he also installed the following three meters in the meter box, which was secured into the bricks of the side of the house:
	



	
		
			
			Number
			
			
			Phase
			
			
			Element/ Model
			
			
			Serial number
			
		
		
			
			1
			
			
			Single
			
			
			Single/ EM1000
			
			
			AMG032241
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Single
			
			
			Single/ EM1000
			
			
			AMG032242
			
		
		
			
			3
			
			
			Single
			
			
			Dual/ EM1200
			
			
			AMB592606
			
		
	



	
	As a consequence of Mr Belcher’s work, the meter box on the Property contained two single phase single element meters and one single phase dual element meter (which is able to control off-peak tariff load). It was a standard meter box with a high temperature tolerant meter board. The electrical installation, including the meters, was protected by 100A HRC (High Rupturing Capacity) fuses at the meter board. The service cable ran from the connection to the electricity network distributor conductor, down the power pole, then underground through the Property and up the inside wall of the garage before it entered the meter box from below and terminated at the upstream end of the service fuses. The upstream protection provided was by way of 200A fuses at the nearby electricity substation.
	
	
	I accept Mr Belcher’s evidence that the consumer mains cable which entered the meter box was completely sheathed in rigid orange conduit, including as it passed through the port at the base of the meter box. The cables went through cable-reducing links screwed to the back of the switchboard. The cables coming out of the links were then pulled together into a wiring loom and also screwed to the back of the switchboard. This loom then travelled approximately 60cm to the swinging switchboard panel and was secured, again, to the swinging panel. The effect of this arrangement was that the wires of the cable were secured three times. I also accept Mr Belcher’s evidence that the switchboard was checked and passed by the defendant.
	
	
	On 14 November 2009 the defendant removed meter 2 and replaced it with the following meter:
	



	
		
			
			Number
			
			
			Phase
			
			
			Element/ Model
			
			
			Serial number
			
		
		
			
			4
			
			
			Single
			
			
			Single/ EM1000
			
			
			AMG927421
			
		
	



	
	In about 2010 Mr and Mrs Belcher moved out of the Property, which they found to be too large for their purposes and went to live in Mrs Belcher’s unit at Nelson Bay, which they had previously used as a weekender and for holidays. Mrs Belcher sold her share in the Property to the plaintiffs, who moved in with their two children.
	


The most recent installation prior to the fire


	
	In November 2010 the plaintiffs received an electricity bill that was higher than expected. They contacted the defendant, which identified an error with meter 1, and informed them that the meter needed to be replaced. The job was allocated to Mark Bush, one of the defendant’s metering technicians. Mr Bush had been working for the defendant since he started as an apprentice in 1984. Between 1988 and 2002, when he worked as an electrical mechanic, his responsibilities included installing meters. He worked as an Installation Inspector between 2002 and 2006 after which he became a Metering Technician Grade 7. In that role he typically attended 5 to 6 properties every working day to install and replace meters. By the time he attended the Property to replace meter 1, he had performed thousands of meter replacements.
	
	
	In November 2010 Mr Bush was given the following job instructions by the defendant:
	


“plz take final read of AMG032241 and replace as it ha[s] a faulty capacitor. thanks”


	
	Although the text of this instruction was contained in a computer-generated document which Mr Bush had not seen prior to the proceedings, I infer that it accorded with the instruction that he was in fact given. Boris Kobal, who was, at the relevant time, the Manager of Metering Strategy and Technology, having previously been in charge of the Metering Technology Group, annexed the document to his witness statement which became his evidence in these proceedings. As Mr Kobal was not cross-examined, I do not regard the plaintiff’s submission that the document was back-dated or that its provenance had not been established as available.
	
	
	On 24 November 2010 Mr Bush’s first job was to attend the Property to remove meter 1 and replace it with the following meter:
	



	
		
			
			Number
			
			
			Phase
			
			
			Element/ Model
			
			
			Serial number
			
		
		
			
			5
			
			
			Single
			
			
			Single/ EM1000
			
			
			AMG118329
			
		
	



	
	Mr Bush had no recollection of replacing the meter. He had not been shown any of the photographs that are in evidence. He first became aware of the fire on the Property when he was asked for his hazard assessment sheet for the job. He was unable to recall when this request was made. When he was in the area to perform another job a couple of years ago he had, however, refreshed his memory by driving past the Property in order to remind himself of the location of the meter box.
	
	
	Mr Bush described his usual practice as involving the following: a visual inspection of the meter box to check for any obvious problems; if no obvious problems are observed, he turns off the main power switch, isolates the relevant meter and opens the panel within the meter box; he undoes the terminals and then unscrews the mounting screws which hold the meter in place. He then removes the meter and installs the new meter by putting the mounting screws back and tightening the connection between the wires and the terminals. He ensures that the terminals on the new meter are tightened before closing the panel within the meter box. He then re-energises the meter and checks its operation to ascertain whether there are any obvious signs of a problem, such as a flickering display or a noise suggestive of a bad connection. He then turns the main switch back on and checks the electricity supply to the installation. He estimated that the task of replacing a meter takes him in the order of half an hour.
	
	
	Mr Bush refuted the possibility that he had trapped anything, such as a cable, in the panel door, since that would have prevented his closing the door.
	
	
	I accept Mr Bush’s evidence that he would not have paid particular attention to meter 1 as he was instructed to replace it, rather than to repair it or identify any fault in it. I also accept that, had Mr Bush noticed anything untoward about the wiring or the meter box, he would have noted it. No such note was made.
	
	
	Mr Bush did, however, concede that, notwithstanding his own system whereby he tightened the connection between the wires and the terminals and then rechecked them, it was possible that one of the wires that went into the new meter had not been tightened sufficiently. He appreciated that tightening the terminal was the most important part of the job because of the potential for a bad joint to result in an increase in resistance, a voltage drop and deterioration of a joint which can lead to fire.
	


The fire


	
	On 29 December 2010 the plaintiffs left the Property for a holiday at Barrington Tops. At about 3am on 30 December 2010, a fire started at the Property. The neighbours were alerted to the fire by their dog, who barked near the meter box. They called Emergency Services, which attended and extinguished the fire. Notwithstanding the fire, the electricity supply to the premises was still operating, as evidenced by the Christmas lights, which remained illuminated. The defendant had to disconnect the electricity supply to the residence before the fire brigade could begin putting out the fire.
	
	
	Anthony Lawrence, a Senior Electrical Inspector employed by the defendant, attended the Property on 31 December 2010 to investigate the cause of the fire. Since about 1983 he has been responsible, in his role as an employee of the defendant, for ascertaining the cause of electrical fires. In the course of his inspection he observed a burnt orange conduit leading from the mains supply to the meter box on the Property. He cut away the burnt section of the conduit in order to examine it more closely. He considered that the conduit had burned from the inside out which he opined related to a fault in the conduit. He postulated a stone in the conduit or moisture in the conduit as being possible causes of the fault and considered that it might take years before damage to cables within a conduit resulted in electrical arcing (see below). He retained and photographed this section of conduit as an exhibit for his investigation. He recorded the following findings in the report of his inspection dated 31 December 2010:
	


“The consumer mains cable showed evidence of the severe beading and short circuiting of the phase and neutral conductors inside the conduit below the main switchboard.

From the on-site inspection, I could find no evidence to link the source of ignition of the fire with an electrical fault on the wiring of the dwelling, or appliance within the dwelling.”


	
	As the plaintiffs were outside the range for mobile telephone reception, Mr and Mrs Belcher were contacted. They drove from their home at Nelson Bay to the Property and spoke with Police. Mr Belcher gave a statement to Police on 30 December 2010. Although the statement referred to the fact that he had done the electrical work on the Property, it did not contain details of his construction of the meter box or the steps he had taken to thread the conduit that housed the consumer mains cable through the meter box or to secure the wires within the box. I accept that this statement contained only those matters about which Mr Belcher was questioned by Police and that they did not ask him about the details of the work he had performed. At the time Mr Belcher did the work he was expecting that the Property would be the home where he would live with Christine, his then wife-to-be. I am satisfied that he remembered installing the meter box and threading the conduit that housed the cable through the port and securing its constituent wires.
	
	
	On New Year’s Day in 2011 the plaintiffs returned home to discover the extent of the fire damage. They contacted CGU Insurance Ltd (CGU), their home insurer.
	
	
	The following day, Sunday 2 January 2011, Stuart Ritchie was asked by CGU to attend the Property with a view to determining the cause of the fire. He is a forensic consultant specialising in the origin and causes of fires and was formerly a crime scene investigator with the Police. In order to understand the significance of Mr Ritchie’s findings, and those of other experts who examined the vestiges of the fire and gave expert opinion evidence, it is necessary to set out some fundamental electrical concepts and an explanation of the configuration of the meter box on the Property.
	


Expert opinion evidence

Electricity: relevant concepts and technical matters

Fault as a condition precedent for an electrical fire


	
	It was common ground that an electrically-initiated fire cannot occur without fault either in the design or installation of either the electricity supply system or the electrical utilisation equipment. Electrically-initiated fires fall into two categories: a fire may either originate within the electricity supply system (which includes cables, the meter panel, power and light sockets and switches) or within the electrical utilisation equipment (which includes appliances and fixtures connected to the electrical supply system).
	


Replacement of a meter box


	
	In order to replace a meter, the metal door of the meter box (which is hinged on the top edge) is lifted to expose the panel. It is then necessary to remove the wooden panel that covers the meter which is to be replaced. There are three mounting screws that attach the meter to the panel which are held in place by nuts, which must be unscrewed. It is then necessary to release the screws that hold in place the wires that enter the meter from its lower side. There are two screws per wire. On the supply side there are two wires: one active and one neutral. Both screws must be loosened to release the supply wires. The old meter is then removed and the new meter is then screwed in place using the mounting screws.
	
	
	Once the new meter has been screwed in place, the two supply side wires (which at the ends are uninsulated to provide a good connection) are repositioned in the holes on the lower side of the meter box and screwed in place by the two screws for each wire to ensure that there is a good connection between the wire and the meter. If the wire is pushed up too hard and it is screwed down against the insulation (in which the wire is encased, except at the end), proper contact is not achieved, which has the effect of increasing the resistance of the joint.
	
	
	Once this task has been completed the panel is then repositioned over the meter and the door to the meter box is closed.
	


Passage of the current through the meter


	
	The purpose of a meter, as its name implies, is to measure the current that flows through from the electricity supply to the premises where it is used to supply power to appliances. The incoming conductors pass from the street onto the Property and into the meter box. The conductors comprise wires encased in conduit except at their ends where they enter the meters so as to make a good connection where the wires are screwed to the two connection points in the meter. The current flows from the incoming wires through the electronic circuitry in the meter, which calculates the power consumption.
	


Ohm’s law and other associated equations


	
	Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. The mathematical equation that describes this relationship is I = V/R, where I is the current (in amps, A); V is the voltage (in volts, V) and R is the resistance (in ohms, Ω). Accordingly, if the current is constant and the resistance increases, the voltage also increases.
	
	
	Power is equal to the product of voltage and the current. The equation is P (power) = V x I. Heat is the product of the square of the current and the resistance. The equation is H (heat) = I² x R. Thus where resistance increases, but current remains constant, the heat output increases.
	


The consequence of a poor connection on resistance


	
	The objective in a connection is to have minimum contact resistance. The effect of a poor connection is to increase resistance. As referred to above, one way in which this can occur is if the copper wire is pushed too hard into the hole. If the insulation rather than the copper wire itself is screwed down it creates a poor connection and the resistance at the connection is higher than it should be. Where current encounters a high resistance joint, the effect may be to cause a reduction in both current and voltage downstream from the joint. Because heat is proportional to resistance, a poor connection leads to an increase in the heat dissipated at the site of the poor connection. As oxidation is assisted by heat, the metal at the joint (the wire and the screw) tends to oxidise faster at a poor connection. The oxidation process in turn leads to the connection increasing in resistance, which in turn results in more heat being dissipated. At a certain point, this oxidation may cause the wire to corrode or fail, thereby depriving the current of a solid conductor. If sufficient heat is generated, the current can cause the gas to ionise, thereby permitting the electrons to pass through the ionised gas. This process is known as arcing, which is described below.
	


Arcing: its nature and cause


	
	Free electrons carry electric current through solid and liquid conductors. Under normal conditions gases do not have free electrons available to carry current. Before current can pass through gas, the gas molecules must be ionised. In ionised gas, known as plasma, electrons are freed from their molecules to carry an electric current. Ionisation of a gas occurs only at very high temperatures (5,000° C – 10,000° C). The term “arcing” is used to describe the flow of electric current through gas.
	
	
	Arcing temperatures may initially be achieved over tiny localised channels. However, once ionisation occurs, any differential in voltage along the channel will drive more current through the channel. The magnitude of current that flows in the discharge channel can vary markedly and can range between one milliamp (10-3) to a kilo-amp (103). The current will itself cause further ionisation by ionising electron-atom collisions. This will have the effect of sustaining the discharge, for as long as the voltage supply is available. This process results in a sustained high temperature in the gaseous discharge channel which may be in excess of 8,000° C, which leads to combustion or incineration of proximate materials. Electrode melting is a major characteristic of arc discharges. At arcing temperatures copper, which is a soft metal, will melt and form globules; steel, which is much harder, tends to become welded. Vaporisation also occurs.
	


The bath tub effect


	
	The “bath tub effect” is a term used to describe: the relatively high failure rate of products in their early life; the relatively low failure rate of such products through the so-called mid-life; and the increased failure rate of products late in life, as age and wear have an effect. The graph that plots time (on the x axis) against probability of failure (on the y axis) produces a shape that resembles a bath tub.
	
	
	Dr Colin Grantham, the expert relied on by the plaintiffs, (whose evidence is addressed in more detail below) explained that the reason for the high probability of initial failure was that it was during the early period of operation of the equipment or system that any manufacturing or installation defects generally manifest themselves. He said that the high probability of failure falls quickly as the manufacturing or installation are proved to be sound and then remains at a low level over most of the life of the equipment. However, as the equipment reaches the end of its life, the probability of failure starts to rise until failure ensues or the equipment is replaced.
	
	
	The length of the initial period depends on the nature and cause of the fault. For appliances and pieces of equipment such as meters, Dr Grantham considered the initial period to be short and to be typically measured in hours or days. However, where the fault is one of installation and the cause the creation of high resistance electricity connections, he considered the initial period to be longer and to be measured in days or weeks.
	


The initial investigation of the cause of the fire: Mr Ritchie


	
	Mr Ritchie ascertained that the most severe manifestation of the fire damage was inside the meter box. He saw several localised electrical responses (resulting in morphological changes) which indicated arc shorts within the interior of the meter box. Because of the number and distribution of such responses, he was unable to tell which one was the first and, therefore, which one was responsible for starting the fire. He was also unable to identify the precise mechanism for such a fault, failure or response.
	
	
	Mr Ritchie also examined (by visual inspection and touch) the entry points to the meter box where the conductors came into the meter box through holes in the bottom of the box and came out through the top of the meter box. He did not observe any signs (whether arcing or localised response) consistent with localised fault, failure or short circuit response at any point of entrance or exit, either to the conductors or to the body of the meter box. Mr Ritchie explained that an electrical response or arcing between the cable and the metal port would cause the wire to melt around the area of the port leaving copper deposits and, sometimes, fusion between the wire and the metal around the port. In such cases, there would be some consequential distortion of the metal aperture at the port, which could be detected by touch. He therefore excluded contact between the cables and the entry ports as a potential source of the origin of the fire.
	
	
	Mr Ritchie recorded that he had been advised by the plaintiffs of “no prior concerns with the premises, nor indications of recent repairs, rectifications or work”.
	
	
	Mr Ritchie’s conclusion was, accordingly, that something had gone wrong inside the meter box but he was unable to say what, and, in particular, whether the response was associated with either the extant conductors, the meter or associated components. He expressed his principal conclusions in the following summary paragraphs (the numbering of which derives from his report):
	


“[11]   The examinations revealed no evidence attributable to either a deliberate or a malicious human involvement.

[12]   The fire was determined to be the result of an electrical cause associated with a fault, failure or response to one of the electrical conductors or components within the meter box. The precise mechanism for such a fault, failure or response remains to be established.

[13]   We note the indicated involvement of the relevant authority and the replacement of the meter to the box shortly prior to the fire event. Further review and consideration of the significance of same, may be assisted by a review of any actions taken by the relevant electrical authority prior to the fire, and/or, by a review of the results of any scene examinations/investigations by, the relevant electrical authority, and by a review of the conduct of such activities via Professor Grantham.

[14]   In the interim, though speculative, it would be reasonable to consider that the development of the fire was likely associated with a scenario involving actions taken in relation to the alleged replacement of the meter.

[15]   The alternative would be a scenario of fire development independent to the alleged actions or involvement associated with the meter box and the alleged replacement/intervention by the relevant authority. No physical evidence attributable to an identifiable alternative scenario was detected.”

Dr Grantham’s investigation and opinion


	
	On Friday 7 January 2011, at the request of CGU, Dr Grantham inspected the Property, including the meter box. Dr Grantham is an electrical engineer with over forty five years’ experience in the field. He is currently a Professorial Visiting Fellow in the Energy Systems Research Group at the University of New South Wales. Dr Grantham observed the effects of sustained electrical arcing within the meter box, which he considered (having regard to the damage and the debris) to have continued for a significant period of time. He deduced that the fire had been a high burning one in that it spread upwards from the meter box into the roof space and then horizontally across the ceiling to the roof space void.
	
	
	Dr Grantham also went to the Police Station to inspect the exhibits which had been removed as part of the investigation into the cause of the fire, including the piece of conduit and cable that had been cut from the section below the meter box. He assessed the ports on the underside of the meter box and considered that they were not distorted, although there was debris and damage associated with the fire in their vicinity. Accordingly, he excluded contact between a cable as it entered the meter box and the metal ports at the underside of the meter box as a cause of the fire. In coming to his opinion, Dr Grantham assumed that the incoming cable had been enclosed in heavy duty conduit, as required by clauses 3.9.1 and 3.9.3.1 of the AS/NZS Wiring Rules and that, accordingly, there was no real possibility of the cable’s coming into contact with the port. He concluded that the cut section of the conduit and cable had been burnt by burning insulation and molten arc products produced by the fire and electrical arcing within the meter box. This in turn created a secondary electrical arc due to damage to the insulation between adjacent conductors.
	
	
	Dr Grantham also inspected the electrical wiring throughout the Property and considered that the plugs and connections had been installed to an appropriate standard and were in good condition.
	
	
	As a result of his inspection Dr Grantham opined that the fire had been caused either by the defendant’s defective installation of the meter in the box or by a defective meter. In his view, the timing and proximity of the work done in the meter box about a month prior to the fire (the replacement of meter 1 with meter 5), indicated that the work carried out by the defendant was the cause of the fire. He regarded defective installation to be more likely since had the meter been defective he would have expected it to fail within a shorter period. He regarded the period of one month as being: “typical of the time it takes for a defective electrical installation to develop into an electrical arc fault capable of igniting and destroying adjacent combustible material”. This remained his view at the hearing of the proceedings. He considered the period of five weeks to be consistent with the initial period of the bath tub effect.
	
	
	Dr Grantham subsequently prepared a report for the purposes of the proceedings (his initial report having been prepared for CGU) in which he largely restated his earlier view. He referred to notes he uses for the purposes of a course he conducts in Electrical Safety at the University of New South Wales. Because of its importance to his ultimate opinion, I propose to set out the section entitled “High resistance connection” in full:
	


“High resistance connection

Before it reaches the electrical load, the electrical supply wiring passes through electrical connections such as those in the supply meter panel, junction boxes, plug sockets, etc. If these connections are adequately secured, the resistance at the point of connection is low. However, if the securing screws are loose, the resistance at the point of connection is often high. Because the power is given by I2R, for the same current, which can be within the rating of the system, the power absorbed by the connection is correspondingly larger.

Because the current is normal, the fuse or circuit breaker cannot detect this type of fault, and the energy dissipated in the connection can be large, resulting in a subsequent rise in temperature. Eventually electrical arcing occurs at the connection and the fault is either detected, normally due to poor performance of utilization equipment, or alternatively the fault worsens and causes an ignition of adjacent combustible material.”


	
	In his oral evidence, Dr Grantham explained, by reference to the concepts in this section, how he considered the arcing occurred and that the time period was consistent with the bath tub effect.
	


Professor Baitch


	
	Professor Baitch was retained by the defendant to respond to Dr Grantham’s opinion. He has qualifications as a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering and a Master of Engineering Science (Electricity). He has extensive experience and expertise in electrical engineering.
	
	
	Professor Baitch did not inspect the Property or the meter box, which had been replaced some time before he was retained. He did, however, consider the photographs that had been taken by the Police, Mr Ritchie and Dr Grantham.
	


The “bathtub” effect


	
	Professor Baitch addressed the bathtub effect in response to Dr Grantham’s opinion. He said that for more sophisticated devices such as meters, which are required to have a high degree of reliability, the manufacturing process ensures that “infant mortality” (failure within the early stages) is negligible and that such failures occur within hours or days. However, he agreed with Dr Grantham that high resistance electrical connections typically manifest themselves within days or weeks. Nonetheless, he regarded the five-week period between the installation of the new meter and the fire to be outside the expected range of the initial period.
	
	
	In his report of 17 March 2015 Professor Baitch said of Dr Grantham’s conclusion that the fire had been caused by a loose connection in the meter that had been installed in November 2010:
	


“It is not related to any evidence. There is no evidence that points to the possibility that there was a faulty connection within the switchboard associated with the electricity meter or that the fire was caused by a fault within the meter. The conclusion is based purely on the coincidence of the fact that the work was undertaken a month before.”


	
	Professor Baitch regarded Dr Grantham’s hypothesis as a “simplistic opportunistic conclusion” which gave too much weight to the timing. He regarded the period of five weeks as being too long for it to be considered a bath tub failure. Further he considered that, because of the number of components within the meter box, it could not be concluded that the fire was caused by the meter or work associated with the meter as opposed to another component.
	
	
	Professor Baitch also considered Dr Grantham’s hypothesis to be unlikely because it did not occur during the Christmas period when the electrical loading on the installation would have been at its highest but rather on 30 December 2010 when no one was present and the load likely to be at a minimum. He also considered that, if there was a high resistance joint at the meter, it would have been evident in terms of voltage fluctuations and poor voltage conditions at the installation since the meter is a series connection carrying the whole current flow into the installation. He noted that there was no reference in the plaintiffs’ statements to their having observed voltage fluctuations in the period between 24 November 2010 and 29 December 2010 when they left for Barrington Tops.
	


Professor Baitch’s preferred hypothesis for the cause of the fire


	
	Professor Baitch examined the photographs and identified as a “weak point” the place where the cable entered the sheet metal switchboard since the port, or aperture, is a round hole with a sharp metallic edge. He examined the photographs of the section of cable that had been cut from below the meter box and opined that, because of the extent of the burning, it was more likely that it had been the site where the fire had started than anywhere else. He also observed that the fire had been upward burning, which was consistent with his hypothesis. He postulated that the wear and tear on the cable might have occurred because of the movement occasioned whenever the switchboard panel is opened and closed. The mechanism of the fault and its role in the fire is explained in the following passage from his report:
	


“The pressing action can occur while the conductors are resting against the edge of the switchboard. The rubbing action of the incoming cables occurs whenever the switchboard panel is opened. The cabling is usually looped up and then connected to the various devices on the switchboard. Accordingly, due to the opening and closing of the switchboard panel, if the insulation of the cable has been stripped too far back (which appears to be the case), and if the conduit does not actually enter into the switchboard (which again appears to be the case) and if a cable gland is not installed where the cable enters the switchboard (impossible to tell but usually not used in domestic installations) it is quite possible (indeed likely) that over a period of time the rubbing action eventually ends up in tracking, subsequent arcing and the development of the type of fire that is visible in this instance. This is due to the combination of the cable being poorly installed in the first instance, the pressing action against the metallic edge of the switchboards and the rubbing action due to the opening and closing of the switchboard panel.”


	
	Professor Baitch also explained why the power supply continued to the house, notwithstanding the fire as follows:
	


“This means that the fault is on the line side of the 100A HRC service fuses within the switchboard. This explains why the service fuse has not operated and the fire has continued and supply was maintained. The 200A HRC fuses installed upstream at the substation would require approx. 400A fault current to flow. It is quite likely that the fault current is less than the fusing current and thus would not operate.”

Exclusion of other hypotheses external to the meter box


	
	Professor Baitch was satisfied that the fire was initiated either below or inside the meter box. He was able to exclude the possibility that it was the result of other sources of fire external to the meter box.
	


Consideration of other possible causes of fire within the meter box


	
	Professor Baitch considered the most probable sources of heat sufficient to ignite the material in or around the meter box to be either: leakage currents caused by tracking; or heat energy associated with current flow and resistance in connections or conductors. Of these two, he considered leakage currents to be a “low probability”. He opined:
	


“For low voltage switchboards, the most likely cause of initial heat generation required for ignition is as a result of heat energy associated with current flow and resistance in connections or conductors.”


	
	He agreed with Dr Grantham that, since the installation was only three years old at the time of the fire, the possibility of a fault developing within the meter box installation itself was low.
	
	
	Professor Baitch considered that the fire could have been caused by some disturbance of the wiring occasioned when the panel in the switchboard was opened or closed. He explained that any of the wires in the switchboard could have worked loose or fractured. This in turn could have resulted in a high resistance joint generating heat and initiating a fire, which “could happen shortly after the action of opening and closing the switchboard”. Professor Baitch speculated that the panel might have been removed as a result of the plaintiffs’ concern about their electricity bills, although he accepted that it was “unknown” when the panel was opened, if at all. He also opined that, even if the panel was opened when Mr Bush came to replace the faulty meter in November 2010, “the loosening of a connection or a fracture of a wire on one of the other components would have nothing to do with the work undertaken” by the defendant because it would relate to the installation.
	


Professor Baitch’s summary of the possible causes of the fire


	
	Professor Baitch identified the following as possible (though not exhaustive) causes of the fire, which are additional to the two hypotheses for which Dr Grantham contended (a fault within the meter and a fault in the installation of the meter):
	



	
	Slight possibility that fire was initiated due to malicious or human involvement;
	
	
	A failure of the incoming supply cable due to its rubbing against the sharp metal edge of the switchboard where the cable enters the sheet metal switchboard which then resulted in arcing of the cable;
	
	
	Defect developing in wiring of the switchboard resulting in loosening of connections or a fracture of a wire;
	
	
	Other electrical equipment developing a fault;
	
	
	Poor connection on circuit associated with Christmas lights.
	



	
	Professor Baitch considered it to be “impossible to have any confidence as to the cause of the fire”. However, he identified, as the cause to which he would give most weight, the rubbing of the cable as it entered the meter box.
	


The joint report of the expert conclave (Dr Grantham and Professor Baitch) and the concurrent evidence


	
	The experts met in conclave on 6 August 2015. They gave concurrent evidence on the second day of the hearing. The areas of agreement and disagreement are summarised below.
	
	
	The experts agreed that the cause of the fire could not be determined with any certainty. They agreed that it would not have happened without some failure, either of equipment or installation.
	


Where the fire started


	
	The experts did not agree where the fire started. Their disagreement on this issue stemmed from their disagreement as to the cause of the fire, which is considered further below. Dr Grantham maintained his opinion that it had started inside the meter box and that the damage to the conduit and supply cable below the meter box was consequent on the falling of molten metal or other material from the fire which had started in the meter box. Professor Baitch maintained his view that the fire had started at the point where the incoming cable met the port into the meter box and that this accounted for the burnt conduit that had been cut by Mr Lawrence and removed from the scene.
	


Whether the meter was defective


	
	The experts agreed that the meter that was installed on 24 November 2010 was completely destroyed by fire and that it was, accordingly, not possible to say whether it was defective. Further, as no meter readings were taken between the time the meter was installed on 24 November 2010 and the time of the fire, it was not possible to ascertain whether the meter was functioning properly. Professor Baitch opined that it was not likely that the meter was defective. I infer from Dr Grantham’s evidence of the “bath tub” effect that he did not regard it as likely that the meter itself, rather than its installation, was defective. In these circumstances it is not necessary to address the evidence of Mr Boral as to previous instances involving this model of meter and the lack of precedent for such a model failing catastrophically such as to cause fire.
	


Whether the fire was caused by the defective installation of the meter on 24 November 2010


	
	The experts agreed that the fire could have been caused by the defective installation of the meter. Dr Grantham considered this to be the most likely possibility. However, Professor Baitch considered it to be unlikely.
	
	
	The experts agreed that the fact that the fuses (being the two 100A and the one 200A fuse) did not operate did not take the matter much further. That the fuses did not operate also suggested that the current was not particularly high, although it may have been higher than normal, since fuses, which are designed to prevent very large increases of current, can tolerate some increase in current. Professor Baitch said, of the circumstance that the fuses did not blow, that “really it just depends on a lot of factors, [and was] very hard to conclude”.
	
	
	Dr Grantham explained the basis for his hypothesis as follows. He said that, as the new meter had been installed five weeks before, its installation and condition had not been proven to be safe by the passage of time. Accordingly, the bath tub effect pointed to its being incriminated in the fire. As referred to above, he considered that a defect in the meter itself could be excluded because the initial period for the bath tub effect could be measured in hours or days for such equipment.
	
	
	Dr Grantham explained the postulated mechanism of failure by reference to the following example:
	


“Let's say if 10 amps of current flows through that 1 Ohm, we would get a drop of 10 volts.  Now, 10 volts is within the normal tolerance of the supply; the supply voltage is allowed to vary by 37 volts anyway, so that 10 volt drop is relatively small.  And the 1 Ohm would stay 1 Ohm for a reasonable period.  What would happen is, over a period of time, the connection would deteriorate because of this heat which we have commented upon, so heat would be produced at the joint and that promotes oxidation because it is a chemical reaction, and all chemical reactions are enhanced by heat. So we get oxidation at the electrical connection and the resistance would increase slowly over a period of time.  And maybe after five weeks it may have say got up to 3 amps, by which time now with the 10 amps of current the voltage drop is 30.  So this is a slow process.”


	
	Dr Grantham instanced two occasions from his experience where a poor joint had manifested itself weeks after the joint had been installed, including one for which he had been personally responsible.
	
	
	When it was put to Dr Grantham in cross-examination that 38 days was a long period of time for the process to occur, he responded:
	


“Not for this type of problem, because of the way I described it earlier.  In other words, we start off with a poor connection, but it still conducts electricity, so everything appears to be normal, but then it deteriorates.  And it deteriorates slowly, because it's an oxidisation process, and how rapidly it deteriorates depends upon (a) how bad the connection was in the first place.  It depends upon the magnitude of the current which flows, and it depends upon how frequently that current flows. So there are these three factors which influence how long this can take, and indeed it could take much longer than five weeks.  All I'm saying is five weeks is typical, based on my experience.”


	
	Dr Grantham said that such a process could occur with no discernible effects on electrical appliances or lights since voltage differences would not necessarily be sufficient to produce visible consequences.
	
	
	Professor Baitch, when asked to explain why he would expect the consequences of a poor connection to ensue in a shorter period of time than five weeks said:
	


“Well, it's all function of the actual time associated with the fluctuation of current heating and cooling.  And the heating and cooling process cause expansion and contraction, and expansion and contraction doesn't ‑ then causes the deterioration of the process, so it all happens ‑ initially ‑ slowly.  Although if it's a bad connection in the first instance it all happens very fast.  But if it's a developing one, it requires the ‑ sort of the development of that process, but, still, in my view, that five weeks is quite a long time.”


	
	Professor Baitch also rejected the likelihood of the defective installation of the meter being the cause on the basis that no voltage differences were noticed by the plaintiffs. He said that if there is a connection which is not a good one, the resistance will increase. If the current remains constant, the increase in resistance will lead to a voltage drop downstream from the connection (on the basis of Ohm’s law). Professor Baitch said that such a voltage drop would be likely to lead to the consumer noticing the effects of voltage fluctuations. However, he agreed that, if the voltage drop was not substantial, it is unlikely that the consumer would be able to detect the change from the appliances in use. Although some appliances, such as the hot water service or the television, are not particularly sensitive to voltage, small variations in voltage can lead to lights flickering. Professor Baitch’s opinion was that a “bad joint” would tend to deteriorate very rapidly. For this to occur over five weeks before catastrophic consequences ensued was outside his experience. He considered it to be unlikely, although not impossible, that defective installation was the cause of the fire.
	


Whether the fire was caused by rubbing of the exposed cable on the port underneath the meter box


	
	The experts did not agree that the fire could be caused by running of the exposed cable on the port underneath the meter box. Dr Grantham regarded the possibility as no more than fanciful (although, as is common with scientists, he was not prepared to use the term “impossible”). Professor Baitch regarded this scenario as the most probable. Their views have been set out sufficiently above.

	Although submissions were not addressed to the risk of harm or to reasonable precautions as required by ss 5B and 5C of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (the Act), I am satisfied that the risk of harm is the risk that the defective installation of a meter box will give rise to the risk of fire. The probability that harm will occur if care is not taken is significant. The seriousness of the harm is substantial. The burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm is not great since all that is required is that the technician responsible for the installation take care to ensure a good connection. The social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm is high, as the provision of electricity, and the accurate measuring of such use, is of great benefit to society.
	
	
	The principal issue is one of causation: not that an identified breach caused harm, but whether the negligence that caused the harm was an act or omission of the defendant, of the plaintiffs, or of a third party.
	
	
	Section 5D and s 5E of the Act, so far as relevant, provide as follows:
	


“5D General principles

(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises thefollowing elements:

(a) that the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and

(b) that it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person’s liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).

(2) In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.

…

5E Onus of proof

In proceedings relating to liability for negligence, the plaintiff always bears the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, any fact relevant to the issue of causation.”


	
	Factual causation is confined to the application of the “but for” test for causation: Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5; 246 CLR 182 at [18] and Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375 at [16]. Unlike a case such as Curtis v Harden Shire Council [2014] NSWCA 314; 88 NSWLR 10 (Curtis), the present is not one where the question is whether a patent breach probably caused the harm. In cases such as Curtis, the question is whether, but for the patent breach (for which the defendant was responsible), the harm would have occurred. In the present case the question is whether the plaintiffs have proved that the fire started because of a breach attributable to the defendant (defective installation of the replacement meter) rather than a breach attributable to someone other than the defendant, it being accepted that the fire would not have started but for a breach. Both categories of case are to be determined by reference to the “but for” test.
	
	
	The plaintiffs’ case was that the fire was caused by a poor connection between an incoming wire and the new meter that was replaced on 24 November 2010. There was no issue that, if this was proved on the balance of probabilities, factual causation was established (s 5D(1)(a) of the Act). Nor was it contended that it was inappropriate for the defendant’s liability to extend to the plaintiffs in those circumstances (s 5D(1)(b) of the Act). The defendant accepted that it would be liable, if the plaintiffs proved, on the balance of probabilities, that defective installation of the meter was the cause of the fire, since it accepted that it owned the meter and that it was responsible for the work undertaken by Mr Bush on 24 November 2010.
	
	
	In considering the issue of causation, it is necessary to look at the competing hypotheses. As the High Court (Dixon, Williams, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ) said in Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd (1951) 217 ALR 1 (Bradshaw) at 5:
	


“Of course as far as logical consistency goes many hypotheses may be put which the evidence does not exclude positively. But this is a civil and not a criminal case. We are concerned with probabilities, not with possibilities. The difference between the criminal standard of proof in its application to circumstantial evidence and the civil is that in the former the facts must be such as to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence while [in] the latter you need only circumstances raising a more probable inference in favour of what is alleged. In questions of this sort where direct proof is not available it is enough [if] the circumstances appearing in the evidence give rise to a reasonable and definite inference: they must do more than give rise to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is mere matter of conjecture … But if circumstances are proved in which it is reasonable to find a balance of probabilities in favour of the conclusion sought then though the conclusion may fall short of certainty it is not to be regarded as a mere conjecture or surmise.


	
	It is also necessary, as the defendant submitted, to guard against the so-called post hoc propter hoc fallacy: namely, that proof that Event A was caused by Event B is not established merely by showing that Event A followed Event B: see the discussion in Nguyen v Cosmopolitan Homes [2008] NSWCA 246 at [58] – [70] and especially at [62] per McDougall J, McColl and Bell JJA agreeing. I note, however, that, in the present case, both experts accepted the scientific basis for the bath tub effect and its appropriateness in determining causation. This effect relies on temporal sequence as a basis for hypotheses of causation. Where the bath tub effect applies, the temporal connection is not a fallacy, but rather an accepted integer in the scientific reasoning that underpins the theory behind the effect.
	
	
	The inability on the part of the plaintiffs to show precisely how the fire started is not fatal to proof of their case: Bendix Mintex Pty Ltd v Barnes (1997) 42 NSWLR 307 at 317 per Mason P, citing Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst (1940) 64 CLR 538 at 563-564, 569; Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez (1976) 50 ALJR 720.
	


The hypotheses discarded by the experts as being unlikely


	
	Although Professor Baitch suggested in his report that his list of possible causes was not exhaustive, some hypotheses were rejected as being of such low probability as to warrant their removal from contention.
	
	
	Foul play was not regarded as a viable hypothesis as there was no evidence of it and the meter box was regarded as an unlikely site for its perpetration. A defect in the meter itself was also rejected as the infant mortality period for the bathtub effect for devices of such sophistication is measured in hours or days rather than weeks. The experts also rejected as unlikely the fire’s being related to a defect in a wire not associated with the installation of the meter. They also considered it to be unlikely that the fire had been caused by a fault developing in other electrical equipment in the meter box in the absence of evidence that there had been work on such equipment or that the operation of any piece of equipment had been compromised. That the premises were relatively new and that there had been no prior electrical incidents to the knowledge of the plaintiffs was also relevant. There was some reference to the hot water system being replaced in 2009 but the evidence did not establish whether the switch inside the meter box was replaced at that time. There was no suggestion that anything occurring in 2009 would have been within the initial period of the “bath tub” effect in any event. The Christmas lights were also ultimately excluded from contention as a cause of the fire since they were connected to the phase not affected by the fire.
	


The principal hypotheses


	
	Following the extensive analysis and consideration engaged in by the experts, both individually and together, the only real contending hypotheses advanced were: Professor Baitch’s hypothesis that the fire started at the port to the meter box where uninsulated cable rubbed against the metal; and Dr Grantham’s hypothesis that when the meter was installed the wire was not properly connected. These will be addressed in turn.
	


Professor Baitch’s hypothesis that the fire started at the port to the meter box


	
	I am satisfied, on the basis of Mr Belcher’s evidence, that the incoming cable was encased in heavy duty conduit and other insulation when it entered the lower port of the meter box and that Mr Belcher complied with the Wiring Rules when he installed the cable.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Mr Ritchie and Dr Grantham that there was no evidence of distortion around the ports on the underside of the meter box such as would support the theory that abrasion between the cable and the metal port had caused localised arcing. I prefer Mr Ritchie’s evidence, which was based on contemporaneous inspection, which included running his finger around the edge of the port to see if distortion could be detected, and that of Dr Grantham (which also included visual inspection of the site including the meter box) to that of Professor Baitch, whose conclusions were based on photographs. Although it is permissible for experts to have regard to photographs, examination of photographs, even of the quality of those in evidence in the present case, does not afford the same opportunities for proper investigation as does a site inspection. Accordingly, Professor Baitch was at a relevant disadvantage.
	
	
	I accept the evidence of Mr Ritchie and Dr Grantham that the damage to the conduit in the area immediately below the meter box was caused when molten products and burning insulation had fallen onto the conduit from the fire which had started in the meter box.
	
	
	I reject Professor Baitch’s hypothesis that contact between the cable and the metal port was either the point at which the fire started, or its cause. I do not regard his hypothesis as a “conflicting inference” in the sense in which that phrase was used in the passage from Bradshaw set out above or as a “competing hypothesis” as that phrase was used in Luxton v Vines (1952) 85 CLR 352. Indeed I regard Professor Baitch’s hypothesis as having been excluded from contention by the evidence referred to above.
	


The hypothesis that the installation of the meter was defective


	
	For reasons given above, both experts accepted that defective installation of the meter was a possible cause of the fire. Acceptance of the hypothesis that the installation of the meter was defective requires a finding that Mr Bush probably failed to secure the connection properly between the incoming wire and the connection in the meter. While he had undoubted expertise and experience to perform the task, it is a matter of common experience that people when required to perform a task repeatedly over years can, on occasion, succumb to a momentary inadvertence or error. In the present case, the risk of a poor connection arose from the fact that the defendant committed the performance of the task of replacing the meter to a “fallible human agent”: Smith v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 342 per Taylor J.
	
	
	I accept Dr Grantham’s hypothesis as to the way in which the fire was probably caused, including his evidence that the 38-day period between the installation of the replacement meter and the fire was within the bath tub effect, and that it was not atypical, having regard to the incremental and progressive process that caused the resistance at the joint to increase. I do not accept Professor Baitch’s evidence either that the timing was mere coincidence or that it was an unlikely cause. In my view, Professor Baitch’s assessment of the likelihood of Dr Grantham’s hypothesis was compromised by his preference for his own hypothesis, which I have rejected.
	
	
	I accept Dr Grantham’s hypothesis as the reasonable and probable explanation for the fire. I am persuaded that it is more probable than not that the fire was caused when the resistance at the joint where the wire was screwed to the replacement meter was such as to generate sufficient heat to ionise the surrounding gases, permitting arcing and the consequential fire. In reaching this conclusion, I appreciate the fact that no voltage differences were noticed by the plaintiffs in the period leading up to the fire. Nonetheless I accept Dr Grantham’s evidence that, because of the incremental nature of the process, such differences would not necessarily have been discernible in the time from 24 November 2010 to 30 December 2010. It is not necessary that other possible explanations for the known facts cannot be excluded: Fuller-Lyons v New South Wales [2015] HCA 31 at [47], including the cases referred to at footnote 49.
	
	
	In my view the plaintiffs have discharged their onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the fire was caused by the defendant’s negligence. They have proved factual causation (s 5D(1)(a) of the Act). Had scope of liability not been accepted (s 5D(1)(b)) by the defendant, I would have found that it was appropriate that responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the defendant. It is, accordingly, not necessary to consider s 5D(2), which was not, in any event, pleaded.
	
	
	Although the defendant pleaded s 5O of the Act, it did not make submissions directed to it. Nor did I understand it to submit that a faulty installation of the meter would accord with peer professional opinion as competent professional practice. Accordingly, it need not be considered further.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	The allegation of contributory negligence was relevantly confined to an allegation that the plaintiffs had failed to inspect the contents of the meter box and electrical installation other than the electrical meters in the meter box. As I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the fire was caused by a faulty connection in the meter box itself, the allegation of contributory negligence falls away.
	


Other matters: the pleading


	
	In final address, the defendant sought to rely, for the first time and without prior notice either in the pleadings or otherwise, on the following clause in the Standard Form Customer Supply Contract (Amendment No 4 June 2009) (the Supply Contract), which, so far as is material, provided:
	


“12.4   Exclusion of liability

(a)   Subject to clause 12.3, and as far as the law permits, we are not liable for any loss or damage you suffer (including; without limitation, where caused by any negligent or deliberate act or omission by us) arising from:

. . .

(iii)   any act or omission (including ones that are negligent or deliberate) of your distribution network service provider.”

(b)   To the extent that we have any liability to you despite the effect of clause 12.4(a), our liability (under contract, tort, or any other basis including, without limitation, where caused by any negligent or deliberate act or omission by us) is limited, as far as the law permits, as follows:

(i)   we are not liable for any indirect, economic, special or consequential losses or damages of any kind (including corruption of data losses, business interruption losses, losses of any profits or any other indirect costs of any kind; and

(ii)   our liability for other losses is limited to the lesser of:

(A)   the total amount billed to you for electricity supplied under this contract during the year that our breach, act or omission occurred which gives rise to the claim; or

(B)   $5,000 (GST-inclusive, if any),

for all claims you make in any one calendar year.”


	
	The defendant contended that it was, relevantly the “distribution network service provider”. It submitted, accordingly, that, even if the plaintiffs had proved that it was liable in negligence for the harm occasioned by the fire, such liability had been excluded by cl 12.4. Alternatively, it submitted that its liability should be limited to $5,000 pursuant to cl 12.4(b).
	
	
	The defendant contended that, as the plaintiffs had, themselves, relied on the Supply Contract, in part in support of their allegations that the defendant owed them a duty of care, it was not necessary that the exclusion clause be pleaded. I rejected this submission. I did not permit the defendant to rely on cl 12.4 as it had not been pleaded or otherwise notified to the plaintiffs. The Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 14.14 require a defendant to plead specifically any matter that, if not pleaded, may take the opposite party by surprise; or any matter that the party alleges makes the opposite party’s claim (or part of it) not maintainable. Clause 12.4 falls into the category of matters that must be specifically pleaded, both because if, not pleaded, it would take the plaintiffs by surprise and also because it may, if established, a complete answer to the plaintiff’s claim (subject to relief, if available, being granted to the plaintiffs under the Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW)). No application for leave to amend the defence to plead the exclusion clause was made. It is, accordingly, not necessary to consider further the effect of the exclusion clause.
	


Reliability of witnesses

Mr Belcher


	
	Mr Belcher’s evidence was challenged in cross-examination on the basis that his description of the work he had done when he installed the cables and the meter box was not included in the statement he gave to Police on 30 December 2010. I accept his explanation that he answered only those questions that he was asked by Police and was not asked about the work he had done to the Property before he moved in.
	
	
	Mr Belcher’s evidence was also challenged on the basis that he had a motive to say that he had installed the cable correctly since he did not want to be responsible for the fire that ensued years later, particularly in a home owned by his step-daughter and her husband in which they lived with their children. I accept Mr Belcher’s evidence as to the manner in which he installed the meter box and as to his enclosing the cables within conduit such that they were protected from coming into contact with the ports of the meter box. Notwithstanding the passage of time, I am satisfied that he recalled the job because he intended to live in the residence himself with his wife to be. I reject the submission that the reliability of his evidence was diminished by motive.
	


Mr Bush


	
	The plaintiffs contended that Mr Bush was an unreliable witness because he gave evidence that he had been given a written sheet relating to the job; whereas the defendant later conceded (in answer to a call for the document) that no such document existed. I do not regard this matter as reflecting adversely on Mr Bush’s credit. The timing of particular changes in work practices is not something which he could be expected to recall with any accuracy years later.
	
	
	I accept Mr Bush’s evidence as to his usual practice. It is to his credit that he accepted the possibility that he may not have tightened the connection sufficiently in the present case. Very experienced technicians, such as Mr Bush, are capable of momentary inadvertence or incomplete attention to the repetitive and routine task of tightening screws on a wire which may result in poor connection, either because the screw has not been tightened sufficiently, because the wire has been pressed too far into the hole thereby involving the insulation in the connection, or for some other reason.
	


Professor Baitch


	
	The plaintiff submitted that I ought not accept Professor Baitch’s evidence because he was unable immediately to identify the photographs that formed the basis for his opinion that friction between the incoming cable and the aperture on the lower side of the meter box was the most likely cause of the fire. Although it would have been preferable had Professor Baitch identified the photographs in his report, I do not regard it as adversely affecting his reliability that he required a few minutes in the morning adjournment to do so. The plaintiff also sought to impugn Professor Baitch’s evidence on the basis that it was inconsistent or that the wording of his report required some correction. I did not regard any of these matters as adversely affecting his credit or his reliability. The principal reason I did not accept his evidence as to the most likely cause was because I preferred the evidence of Mr Ritchie and Dr Grantham about the state of the holes in the metal box to Professor Baitch’s assessment based on the photographs.
	


Interest


	
	The plaintiffs claimed pre-judgment interest. There are various invoices in evidence referable for work done to the Property to rebuild it following the fire. However the dates from which interest should be calculated does not readily emerge. I propose to provide an opportunity for the parties to agree on an interest calculation, or to re-list it for my determination, in the event that they are unable to agree.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $819,676.50 plus pre-judgment interest to the date of entry of judgment, as agreed or determined by me.
	
	
	Direct the parties to notify my Associate of any agreed figure for interest or, failing agreement, the figure proposed by each party, and the contentions in support, within seven days.
	
	
	Unless an application for a different order is made in writing to my Associate within seven days hereof, order the defendant to pay the plaintiffs’ costs of the proceedings.

		09 September 2015",2015-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767688,State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 273,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The respondent, Brian James Donovan, has completed the term of imprisonment imposed upon him in respect of his conviction for the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the index offence). The crime of which Mr Donovan was convicted falls within the definition of a “serious violence offence” in s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the High Risk Offenders Act). Mr Donovan, therefore, falls within the definition of “violent offender” in s 4 of that Act.
	
	
	Section 5E of the High Risk Offenders Act provides that an offender is a “high risk violent offender” if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violent offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Section 5F of the High Risk Offenders Act provides for the making of an extended supervision order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a “high risk violent offender”. However, pursuant to s 5G, the Supreme Court may make an order for the continued detention of a high risk violent offender (a continuing detention order) if the Court “is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order”.
	
	
	A right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from orders made by the Supreme Court under the High Risk Offenders Act is provided by s 22.
	
	
	On 1 September 2015, McCallum J made an extended supervision order pursuant to s 5F of the High Risk Offenders Act. The order was made subject to conditions, including conditions that Mr Donovan refrain from using drugs or alcohol. That condition was of particular importance, given that Mr Donovan’s offending conduct in respect of the index offence occurred whilst under the influence of alcohol and that alcohol was a significant, but not invariable, aspect of his extensive record of prior convictions. Many acts of violence and, in particular, acts of domestic violence, which were described in the material before the primary judge as being of “escalating seriousness” were linked to Mr Donovan’s substance abuse: judgment at [24].
	
	
	Following the making of the extended supervision order, the State made an application for a stay of the order and, pursuant to the High Risk Offenders Act, s 18B, sought an order for the continuation of an interim detention order pending the determination of an appeal from McCallum J’s orders. It was the State’s contention that her Honour had erred in making an extended supervision order and that the appropriate order to be made in the circumstances of Mr Donovan’s offending history was a continuing detention order pursuant to s 5G.
	
	
	On 2 September, I ordered a stay of McCallum J’s orders and made an interim detention order as sought by the State, and reserved my reasons. At the same time, of its own motion, the Court gave the matter an urgent hearing date of 9 September 2015 for the hearing of the appeal. The matter raised serious questions of the liberty of the individual, Mr Donovan’s lawful period of imprisonment having expired on 25 July 2015, some five weeks previously, and of the public interest in the protection of the community.
	
	
	My reasons for granting the stay and continuing the interim detention order until the hearing of an appeal are as follows.
	
	
	In Woodlawn Capital Pty Limited v Motor Vehicles Insurance Limited [2015] NSWCA 227, I summarised the well-known principles by which a court will determine whether or not to grant a stay, as follows:
	


“7.   The applicant must demonstrate that there is a reason for the grant of a stay, or that the matter is an appropriate case, in the exercise of the Court’s discretion: Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 at 694. It is not necessary for the applicant for the stay to establish special or exceptional circumstances: Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation at 694.

8   … A stay is likely to be granted if the appeal would otherwise be rendered nugatory. The court considering the grant of a stay is not required to determine the merits of the appeal but usually considers whether the applicant has at least an arguable case ...”


	
	In the present case, the State submitted that her Honour erred in the following three respects in making the extended supervision order as opposed to the making of a continuing detention order. First, her Honour erred in her construction of “adequate supervision” for the purposes of s 5G. Secondly, her Honour erred in failing to provide reasons for her conclusion that she was not satisfied that an extended supervision order would not provide adequate supervision. Thirdly and in the alternative, the finding that the extended supervision order would provide adequate supervision was contrary to the weight of the evidence.
	
	
	The State submitted that there was a real risk to the safety of the community which justified the continuing detention of Mr Donovan pending the outcome of the appeal. The State submitted that the grant of a stay would give effect to the “primary object” of the High Risk Offenders Act as provided for in s 3(1), namely, the “safety and protection of the community”. Section 3(2) of the High Risk Offenders Act provides that the encouragement of rehabilitation of the offender is “another object” of that Act.
	
	
	The State contended that the evidence was that Mr Donovan presented a risk to the safety of the community should he be released. In this regard, McCallum J found that he presented an unacceptable risk of reoffending: see judgment at [62]; and has a propensity for violence: judgment at [72]. These findings are not, as I understand it, in dispute.
	
	
	An issue before her Honour was the proper construction of “adequate supervision” within the meaning of s 5G of the High Risk Offenders Act. The State submitted that the supervision to which an offender would be subject pursuant to an extended supervision order must be adequate to eliminate or substantially reduce the unacceptable risk of reoffending by the commission of a serious violence offence. Mr Donovan’s contention was that s 5G(1) is directed to the amelioration of the unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. He accepted that this required that an extended supervision order would be adequate to substantially reduce that unacceptable risk. As I see it, therefore, there was no real difference in approach to the proper construction of that section as between the parties.
	
	
	Her Honour considered that it was not necessary to define, in any more precision than the words of the statute, what constitutes “adequate supervision” for the purposes of s 5G. As her Honour remarked, at [55], the High Risk Offenders Act had left to the Court the evaluative judgment as to the degree of supervision that will be adequate in a particular case, having regard to the objects of the Act and the discretion as to whether to make a continuing detention order in any event.
	
	
	I do not consider it necessary to determine whether there is an arguable case that her Honour erred in her approach to the proper construction and application of s 5G, as I have concluded that there is a more pressing reason why a stay should be granted. As the State submitted, and as her Honour observed in her judgment, Mr Donovan has a propensity for violence. He has failed to complete various treatment courses, including a residential course relating to his drug and alcohol dependence. In the evidence before her Honour, a concern was raised as to whether he currently has the motivation or commitment to comply with any schedule of movements regime imposed upon him in respect of his management in the community. It was noted in evidence before her Honour that electronic monitoring would not preclude Mr Donovan from meeting with family, friends and others from whom he could access drugs.
	
	
	It was apparent from a reading of the psychiatric evidence before her Honour that whilst the two psychiatric experts, Dr Roberts and Dr O’Dea, did not disagree as to the role that alcohol played in Mr Donovan’s offending behaviour, there was a greater preference by Dr O’Dea for treatment in the community. Her Honour accepted that approach.
	
	
	This is not a case where, had a stay not been granted, the appeal would, in the language used in this area of jurisprudence, be rendered nugatory, as the Court could revoke the extended supervision order and make an continuing detention order. Nonetheless, questions of statutory construction and application aside, there is a question raised by the appeal as to whether the orders made by her Honour in the evaluative task required by the section should remain in force, or whether Mr Donovan should be made the subject of a continuing detention order.
	
	
	In circumstances where Mr Donovan is a person who continues to exhibit significant risk factors in relation to violent offending, I formed the opinion that the Court should give primacy to the safety and protection of the community by granting the stay, and should make orders consequential upon the granting of a stay as sought by the State. I confirm the orders made on 2 September 2015 as follows:
	


1.   Direct a stay of the extended supervision order made by her Honour Justice McCallum on 1 September 2015;

2.   Order pursuant to s 18B(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) the defendant is subject to an interim detention order commencing at 11 am on 2 September 2015 which expires at 12 pm on 9 September 2015 or upon further order of this Court, whichever is the earlier;

3.   Order pursuant to s 20(1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim detention order referred to in order 2 above;

4.   Order pursuant to s 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW) that the Commissioner cause Brian James Donovan to be produced to the AVL rooms at Bathurst Correctional Centre at 10.15 am on 9 September 2015;

5.   Leave granted to the applicant to amend para (4) of the notice of motion returnable 1 September 2015 to read s 18B(1) not s 18C(1);

6.   Matter set down for hearing at 10.15 am, 9 September 2015.

	BATHURST CJ: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: Roy Chidiac (the applicant) pleaded guilty to an indictment that contained four counts. He asked that a further matter on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentence. The applicant also pleaded guilty to two matters that were placed on a s 166 certificate.
	
	
	Colefax SC DCJ (the judge) sentenced the applicant in the District Court at Parramatta, on 15 August 2014. The judge imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 7 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 5 months.
	
	
	The applicant lodged an appeal that identified four grounds. However, at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, Grounds 1 and 3 were abandoned. The Grounds of Appeal that remain are as follows:
	


Ground 2: His Honour erred in imposing an aggregate sentence that reflected a total accumulation of the sentence on count 4.

Ground 4: The aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

The Charges


	
	The judge imposed an aggregate sentence for all of the offences pursuant to s 53A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Section 53A(2)(b) requires a judge to indicate the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence. Section 44(2C) provides that there is no need to indicate the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence, unless it is required by s 54B. The court is obliged by s 54B(4) to make a written record of the non-parole period it would have set, for an offence to which a standard non-parole period applies, if a separate sentence of imprisonment had been imposed for that offence. However, the failure of a court to comply with s 54B does not invalidate a sentence.
	
	
	There was only one count on the indictment that carried a standard non-parole period, namely count 3, which was an offence of possession of an unauthorised firearm.
	
	
	The four counts on the indictment and the indicative sentences imposed by the judge were as follows:
	


Count 1: This was an offence of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. The offence involved the applicant allowing his premises to be used to manufacture methylamphetamine. In indicating a sentence for this offence, the judge took into account the matter on the Form 1, which was an offence of knowingly take part in the supply of 9.78 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy), contrary to s 25(1)/29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The sentence indicated by the judge was imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months.

Count 2: This was an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(1)/29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. The total amount of prohibited drugs that were seized on the applicant’s premises was 175.51 grams of methylamphetamine and 9.78 grams of ecstasy. The applicant was sentenced on the basis “that he allowed those pills to be on his premises knowing they were to be supplied” (ROS 5). The judge indicated a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years that he said would have been served concurrently with the sentence for count 1.

Count 3: This was an offence of the possession of an unauthorised firearm, namely a .22 calibre revolver contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced on the basis “that he knew the firearm was in his home and that he allowed it to remain [in] it” (ROS 5). The judge indicated a sentence of 3 years imprisonment that he said would have been partially accumulated with the sentences imposed in counts 1 and 3. The judge did not indicate a non-parole period.

Count 4: This was an offence of doing an act with intent to persuade the applicant’s former wife, a potential witness in the applicant’s trial, not to attend as a witness contrary to s 323(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant’s offending behaviour concerned a series of text messages sent by the applicant to his former wife. The maximum penalty for this offence is 7 years imprisonment. The judge indicated a sentence of 3 years 6 months imprisonment, which he said would have been totally accumulated upon the sentences imposed for counts 1, 2 and 3.


	
	In relation to the matters on the s 166 certificate, the indicative sentence was one month’s imprisonment. The judge declined to impose a sentence for the offence of possession of ammunition.
	
	
	The judge sentenced the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8 years. After applying a discount of 10 per cent for the pleas of guilty, the sentence was 7 years 2 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 5 months commencing on 19 September 2013 and expiring on 18 February 2019. A balance of term of 1 year 9 months was set, which expires on 18 November 2020. His Honour declined to find special circumstances.
	


FACTS


	
	A statement of agreed facts was put before the judge, which may be summarised as follows:
	
	
	On 9 February 2012, officers from the Department of Immigration attended the applicant’s premises to take his uncle into immigration custody as he had overstayed his visa. The immigration officers were accompanied by NSW police officers. Whilst immigration officials were speaking to the uncle in the lounge room, the police officers waited in the kitchen where they observed on the kitchen table a small bowl containing cannabis, two mobile phones, $90 in cash, a box containing a large number of plastic resealable bags, a set of digital scales, a plastic resealable bag containing brown tablets embossed with the word “Ecky” and a plastic resealable bag containing white tablets.
	
	
	The police found under the kitchen table several containers containing substances, a large glass container with liquid in it and a portable glass cooker. When the police officers went into the laundry, they saw a large glass flask in the sink. This was a reaction flask with approximately a 20 litre capacity.
	
	
	A detailed search of the premises by police, on 9 and 10 February 2012, found in the kitchen a plastic resealable bag containing 11 brown-coloured tablets stamped “Ecky” (later established to be 2.56 grams of ecstasy with 19 per cent purity), a set of digital scales, $90 in cash, numerous Sudafed, Tylenol and Telfast tablets, various containers containing liquid granulose substances or residue, a white box containing clear plastic resealable bags in which were white tablets also marked “Ecky” (later established to be 172.4 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 17 per cent) and a black bag containing a revolver.
	
	
	Police found in the dining area a plastic container and several resealable plastic bags containing brown, beige and white tablets (later established to be 30 ecstasy tablets weighing 7.22 grams, the purity of which was not tested). Also found were eight beige tablets (later established to be 3.11 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 6.5 per cent).
	
	
	Other items including filter papers, a respirator, facemask, glass coil condenser and a 200 litre drum of ethanol were found on the property.
	
	
	A forensic chemist who attended the scene formed the opinion that pseudoephedrine was manufactured in the premises and consequently methylamphetamine was manufactured from the pseudoephedrine. The forensic chemist calculated the total quantity of the pure pseudoephedrine to be 35.7 grams. He opined that theoretically such a quantity of pseudoephedrine could potentially produce 32.2 grams of pure methylamphetamine, but realistically it would be somewhere between 16 and 26 grams of pure methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The total amount of methylamphetamine seized was 175.57 grams and the total amount of ecstasy was 9.78 grams.
	
	
	The revolver found on the premises was a .22 short-calibre seven-chamber revolver, which was in working order.
	
	
	On 14 February 2012, the applicant was charged with the drug and firearm offences. A brief of evidence was served, which included a statement from his former wife, Mrs Chidiac. A trial date was fixed for 23 September 2013. Between 13 and 17 September, the applicant sent Mrs Chidiac a series of text messages. He asked her if she had been subpoenaed. When Mrs Chidiac confirmed that she had, the applicant sent her a series of abusive text messages. The judge found that the “clear purpose of which was to discourage the former wife from giving evidence at his trial” (ROS 6).
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	The applicant did not give evidence before the judge. His subjective circumstances were derived from the report of Anthony Diment, a psychologist, which was tendered by the applicant.
	
	
	In referring to the psychologist’s report, the judge said that the applicant was born in Lebanon and came to Australia when he was five years old. His parents were good and hard-working people who had contributed to Australia through that hard work.
	
	
	The judge noted that the applicant had left school in year 10, had swiftly completed a tiling apprenticeship and had been “in useful employment constantly from that time” (ROS 7).
	
	
	His Honour said that the applicant started using illegal drugs in his late teens. Initially the drug of choice was marihuana but in his early twenties he commenced using ecstasy. However, cannabis had been a constant drug of usage by the applicant.
	
	
	The judge recounted that the applicant married in his late twenties and had a son who was seven years old. His Honour noted that the applicant was very upset by the break up of the marriage and at about the same time, he started increasing this use of ecstasy and to smoke ice. His Honour observed that the applicant apparently had some untreated long-term depression, but apart from that he had no mental health issues.
	
	
	The applicant was born on 7 September 1979 and was 34 years old at the time of sentence. His prior criminal history disclosed two offences of possession of prohibited drugs (2001) for which he was convicted and fined. As to the applicant’s criminal record, the judge said (ROS 7):
	


“Somewhat surprisingly for a man who has had a long term drug habit he has no, relatively no prior convictions. He has two minor drug offences from 2001 for which he received fines and he is to be treated as if he, in effect, he were a relevant first offender and to obtain the leniency that goes with that.”

Some findings by the judge


	
	The judge regarded the two drug charges (counts 1 and 2) and the possess firearm charge (count 3) “to be below, but certainly not at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness” (ROS 6). As to count 4, the interference with the witness offence, his Honour regarded this offence “to be at the mid-range of objective seriousness” (ROS 6). His Honour said that the two matters on the s 166 certificate were towards the bottom of the range.
	
	
	When sentencing the applicant for count 4, the judge observed that the applicant’s trial was aborted because of the text messages. His Honour noted that the applicant was on bail at the time the text messages were sent which was “a serious aggravating factor” (ROS 6). His Honour said that Mrs Chidiac made a statement to police indicating that the text messages caused her fear and intimidation and that she no longer wanted to give evidence on behalf of the police.
	
	
	The judge regarded the failure of the applicant to give sworn evidence of remorse to be significant. His Honour was not prepared to accept expressions of remorse through the psychologist’s report. His Honour considered the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation to be “cautiously reasonable” having regard to his “long and good work career” and “strong family support” (ROS 8).
	
	
	None of the judge’s findings were challenged upon appeal.
	


Dealing with the Appeal

Ground 2: His Honour erred in imposing an aggregate sentence that reflected a total accumulation of the sentence on count 4.

Ground 4: The aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Argument


	
	It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. The applicant recognised that Ground 2 was in reality a particular of the applicant’s complaint that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the judge’s findings of the objective seriousness of counts 1, 2 and 3 and submitted that it was difficult to see how the indicative sentences, particularly in relation to the two drug offences, reflected these findings. This was more so when the applicant was to be treated as a first offender and his prospects of rehabilitation could be regarded as cautiously reasonable.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the applicant pointed to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics that were said to demonstrate, in respect to count 1, that only 12 of 24 people have been sentenced in the District Court to full-time imprisonment and only one offender has been sentenced to a longer term than the applicant’s indicative sentence. In relation to count 2, the applicant said that less than 50 per cent of people are imprisoned for that offence. The applicant argued that the “the indicative sentences are plainly unjust, not reasonable” (T5, 8-17).
	
	
	The applicant complained that it was difficult to see how the indicative sentence for count 4 reflected the judge’s assessment that it was at the mid-range of objective seriousness with the applicant’s subjective features. The applicant contended that there should have been some partial accumulation of the sentence for count 4 and not total accumulation.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there was a rational basis for his Honour’s decision to totally accumulate count 4, as this offence involved a specific victim and completely different offending that had occurred more than 18 months later, whilst the applicant was on bail for the drugs and firearm offences. The Crown argued that the criminality of doing the act, with intent to persuade a witness not to attend, simply could not be encompassed in the criminality of the other offences. The Crown submitted that the decision to notionally accumulate count 4 was clearly open to the judge in the exercise of his discretion.
	
	
	Another submission was that the indicative sentences for counts 1 and 2 were not in any way inconsistent with his Honour’s findings of objective seriousness. The Court was reminded that the maximum sentence for these offences was 15 years imprisonment. The Crown contended that his Honour’s indication that both the manufacture (count 1), and supply offences (count 2), were notionally entirely concurrent, was very favourable to the applicant as there was additional criminality represented by the applicant allowing the substantial quantity of methylamphetamine in the form of pressed pills, to be on his premises knowing that they were to be supplied.
	
	
	In relation to the statistics relied upon by the applicant, the Crown contended in oral submissions that they are “of extremely limited utility… particularly given that there are no statistics kept in respect of aggregate sentences” (T10, 31-37). The Crown observed that even if the indicative sentences were assessed as being excessive, that did not necessarily mean that the aggregate sentence was. The Crown argued that the aggregate sentence had not been demonstrated to be unreasonable or plainly unjust.
	


Decision


	
	The applicant must show that the aggregate sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust in order to make good his complaint that the sentence is manifestly excessive: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. In Beale v R [2015] NSWCCA 120, Beech-Jones J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreed) observed at [78]:
	


“As expressed this ground correctly recognises that it is the aggregate sentence that must answer the description of being manifestly excessive (“unreasonable or plainly unjust”: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]). Merely because an indicative sentence for one of the offences might answer that description would not necessarily warrant that conclusion in relation to the aggregate sentence as a whole; the materiality of any error in the indicative sentence to the overall aggregate sentence still needs to be demonstrated (PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242 at [44]; SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [40]).”


	
	Intervention by this Court is not warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57].
	
	
	One of the arguments advanced in oral submissions by the applicant was that the indicative sentences announced by the judge had been discounted by 10 per cent for the pleas of guilty. On this basis, the starting point for the indicative sentence for count 1 was said to be 5 years. This argument should be rejected as it does not stand happily with the judge sentencing the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 8 years and then after applying a 10 per cent discount reducing the head sentence to 7 years 2 months. It is evident that each of the indicated sentences was not discounted by the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Little weight can be placed on the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics referred to by the applicant. In offences involving the manufacture and supply of amphetamines (less than the commercial quantity), there is a broad range of weight and purity of the drug that is not identified by the statistics. Furthermore, the role of offenders in the commission of such offences can vary greatly. The statistics do not identify whether other offences on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence or whether there were aggravating features, such as being on conditional liberty at the time of the offending, that were factors in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Where aggregate sentences are imposed, the limited use of sentencing statistics becomes more apparent. The indicative sentences are not the actual sentence that is imposed. Moreover, the Judicial Commission statistics do not extend to a number of different sentences that overlap or to an aggregate sentence: Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 at [8] and [87].
	
	
	I do not agree with the applicant’s argument that the indicative sentences of 4 years 6 months for count 1, and 4 years for count 2, were inconsistent with his Honour’s finding that these offences were below, but not at the bottom of the range of objective seriousness (see [26] above).
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each of these offences was 15 years imprisonment. For count 1, the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he allowed his premises to be used to manufacture methylamphetamine, the amount of which the forensic chemist opined was realistically somewhere between 16 and 26 grams of pure methylamphetamine. These estimated amounts were between three times and slightly above five times the indictable quantity of the prohibited drug. Taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug has long been regarded as a serious crime. Although the applicant’s role was confined to the provision of his suburban premises in which the methylamphetamine was to be made, this was a fundamental step in the commission of the offence. Moreover, the judge took into account the offence of supply of 9.78 grams of ecstasy that was on the Form 1.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, the offence for count 2, involved additional criminality as the applicant allowed a significant quantity of methylamphetamine in the form of pressed pills (175.51 grams) to be on his premises knowing they were to be supplied. Furthermore, the judge’s indication that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 were notionally to be served concurrently was, in my opinion, generous to the applicant if that was what his Honour actually did.
	
	
	The indicative sentence for the possession of an unauthorised firearm, namely a .22 calibre revolver was 3 years. The purpose of s 7(1) of the Firearms Act, which is reflected by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years, is to deter and punish the possession of unauthorised firearms: R v Dusan Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [14]. The applicant knew that the firearm was in his home in circumstances where he had allowed the premises to be used for the manufacture of methylamphetamine and there was a significant amount of that prohibited drug for supply. The revolver was in working order.
	
	
	Taking into account those personal circumstances that were favourable to the applicant, I consider that the sentences indicated for the first three counts on the indictment were within the proper exercise of the judge’s sentencing discretion.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint that the indicative sentence for count 4 did not reflect the judge’s finding of mid-range objective seriousness is without substance. Interference with a potential Crown witness is a serious offence as it undermines the administration of justice. As has been previously said by this Court, general deterrence is paramount for such offences and the conduct should be denounced: Malicki v R; R v Malicki [2015] NSWCCA 162 at [60].
	
	
	An aggravating factor the judge appropriately took into account was that, at the time the applicant tried to persuade his wife not to attend as a witness, he was on bail for the drug and firearm offences: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Another complaint was his Honour’s indication that the sentence for count 4 would have been totally accumulated upon the sentences for counts 1, 2 and 3. The difficulty for the applicant in advancing such an argument is that the indicative sentences are not actually imposed, but merely indications of what the judge would have done if he had separately sentenced for each count: Cullen v R [2014] NSWCCA 162 at [26]. This is plainly demonstrated in the present case as the undiscounted head sentence would have been more than 8 years if the judge had partially accumulated the sentence for count 3 on the concurrent sentences for counts 1 and 2 and then totally accumulated the sentence for count 4.
	
	
	In any event, I agree with the Crown’s submission that it was open to the judge to totally accumulate the sentence for count 4 as it involved criminality which was distinct from the other offending, involved a specific victim and was committed 18 months later whilst the applicant was on bail. In my view, the judge was entitled to find that the criminality for count 4 could not be encompassed in the criminality of the other offences: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41.
	
	
	Whatever might be said about the indicative sentences, the real focus of the complaint of manifest excess must be upon the aggregate sentence actually imposed by his Honour. I am of the opinion that an aggregate sentence of 7 years 2 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years 5 months, properly reflects the totality of the applicant’s offending. Such an aggregate sentence falls within the proper exercise of the judge’s discretion. I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.


	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Price J.

		11 September 2015",2015-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767701,CLC v R [2015] NSWCCA 248,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: In November 2013 the applicant was convicted of four offences involving one complainant, being his step-granddaughter. The four charges arose out of two incidents which were alleged to have occurred between 1 January 2009 and 4 September 2009. The applicant sought leave to appeal from those convictions on the sole ground that the verdict of the jury in respect of each charge was unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. [1] 
	
	
	The application was not limited to a ground which involves a question of law alone and hence leave was required. [2]  Leave was not opposed and should properly be granted. The grant of leave depends not only upon the concession by the Director of Public Prosecutions, but also on two further factors. First, a charge of aggravated indecent assault against a young child can (and did in the present case) raise serious questions as to whether the evidence of the child alone was sufficient to support a conviction on the criminal standard of proof. Secondly, the case raised a procedural question as to whether it was necessary or appropriate for this Court to view the video recording of two police interviews with the complainant which constituted her evidence in chief.
	
	
	In these reasons the applicant has been anonymised and the name of the complainant and family members omitted to ensure compliance with the prohibition on the publication of information identifying persons who are, or were at the time of the offending, under 18 years of age. [3] 
	


Factual and procedural background


	
	It is necessary to outline briefly both the procedural and factual background to the charges and the trial. The complainant was eight years and four months old at the time she was first was interviewed by Detective Senior Constable Emma Greig of the Joint Investigation Response Team at Emu Plains. The complainant said that the applicant had assaulted her on more than one occasion during the course of that year, which was Year 3 of her schooling. The complainant said that the assaults took place at her Nan’s home, identifying Nan as her mother’s mother and the applicant as her Nan’s husband (her mother’s stepfather). She said that her grandfather had been “touching my rude part”. [4]  She said that her grandfather would shut the door of the room where she was playing on the computer, have her take her pants and undies off and spread her legs. She said that he then touched her vagina (a word she understood and used) with his fingers (outside, not inside) and put his head between her legs and “kissed my rude part”. [5]  There were different accounts given in the course of the interview as to how often this happened and in what circumstances.
	
	
	The prosecution originally proceeded on the basis of one count, involving an allegation of sexual misconduct in relation to a particular child on three or more separate occasions, contrary to s 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), an offence known as “persistent sexual abuse of a child”. In the course of the present trial, the indictment was amended so that the applicant was ultimately arraigned on five counts involving three separate occasions.
	
	
	Of the three separate incidents the subject of the separate charges, the first was said to have occurred when the complainant was playing on a computer in a room occupied by her Aunt Jessie. The second was said to have occurred in her grandmother’s bedroom, whilst she was watching “The Simpsons” on television. On each of these occasions the touching and kissing the vagina were charged as separate counts. A third incident was said to have occurred in the grandmother’s bedroom when she, the applicant and the applicant’s 13 year old son were wrestling on the bed. This involved one count of touching her vagina. The applicant was found not guilty (by a unanimous verdict) with respect to the last count. He was convicted of the two counts in relation to each of the other two incidents (by a majority verdict).
	
	
	The lapse of time between the complaint and the trial (more than four years) was caused by an earlier trial, resulting in a verdict which was set aside by consent on appeal, with an order for a retrial. The applicant served a period of some 16 months in custody between his original sentencing and the orders on appeal. Following the second trial, he was re-sentenced on 19 May 2014 and has been in custody since that time. The commencement of the second sentence was adjusted to take account of the earlier period of custody, with the result that the non-parole period will expire on 19 September 2015. [6] 
	
	
	Of importance for the present appeal, there was a second interview conducted with the complainant on 23 July 2010. A central theme of the applicant’s submissions was that the complainant appeared to have no recollection of the incidents of which she had given an account in the first interview. When cross-examined about the second interview, her explanation for the omission to repeat her earlier account of the allegations was that she “forgot”.
	


Hearing of appeal


	
	The applicant’s written submissions filed prior to the hearing of the appeal included a detailed analysis of the evidence of the complainant in her first interview, inconsistencies between her first and second interviews and references to the explanations given by her in cross-examination at trial, which were said to be unpersuasive. In the course of argument, the Court noted that it might have a difficulty in assessing the evidence of the complainant, based solely on the transcript in order to determine whether the jury could and should have accepted her evidence as sufficient to establish the charges beyond reasonable doubt. Counsel was asked whether the Court should view the video recordings of the interviews. [7] 
	
	
	Although counsel did invite the Court to view the video recordings, he expressed some hesitation with respect to the cross-examination of the complainant. Forensically, that hesitation was understandable: by the time she gave evidence at the trial she was well into her fourteenth year and the transcript suggested a degree of care and maturity which were not apparent from the first interview. The Court also raised with counsel the discussion as to the appropriateness of viewing video recordings in the judgment of Simpson J in SKA v The Queen, [8]  together with the observations of the High Court on a further appeal in the same matter. [9] 
	
	
	Following the hearing, counsel for the applicant filed a short note in effect withdrawing from his position in the course of argument and stating that he did not seek to have the Court view either of the interviews or the recorded cross-examination of the complainant. Counsel for the Director adopted the same position, submitting that the appeal could be determined by reference to the transcript of the interviews and the trial.
	
	
	It is appropriate in the first instance to deal with the appeal on the basis proposed, namely by reference to the transcript alone. However, for reasons which will be explained below, I do not think that, at least in the circumstances of this case, the matter should be allowed to rest there.
	


Challenge to complainant’s evidence


	
	The written submissions identified the grounds of complaint as falling within seven separate categories, described as follows:
	



	
	the inconsistencies within the first JIRT interview;
	
	
	the general nature of the complainant’s response to questions about specific incidents during the first JIRT interview;
	
	
	the inconsistencies between the first and second JIRT interviews;
	
	
	the apparent ability of the complainant to remember things at trial in 2013, which the complainant claimed to be unable to remember in 2009 or 2010;
	
	
	the nature of the complainant’s responses to questions at trial which bring into doubt the reliability of her evidence at trial more generally;
	
	
	the claims made by the claimant which were proven to be inaccurate, and
	
	
	the inconsistencies between the evidence of the [claimant] and that of her mother and her adult neighbour, Rachel, concerning what the complainant told her.
	



	
	It is convenient to deal with the matters in the order in which they were raised, dealing separately with (a) the first interview, (b) the second interview, (c) the trial and (d) other alleged inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
	


(a)   the first interview


	
	Forensically, it was convenient for the applicant to isolate and, to an extent, compartmentalise the different aspects of the evidence. That course was not entirely artificial: it reflected the order in which things occurred at the trial. Nevertheless, the jury must ultimately have seen each part in context. Thus, quite properly, they would have considered the evidence given by the complainant in the first interview having regard to her mother’s evidence as to how the interview came about. The interview took place on Tuesday, 8 September 2009. The mother’s evidence was that the complainant told her on the morning of Friday, 4 September 2009 as they were preparing to go to school the substance of what had happened with her grandfather. She also gave evidence that she spoke to her ex-husband on that day and they both went to the police station. She gave evidence of her distress.
	
	
	The prosecutor then took her to the following Monday (7 September) and elicited evidence that she had spoken on that day with her neighbour, Rachel, and also again with the complainant, who had told her “a little bit more about what happened” and “said that she told Rachel that she hates it when he goes on her.” [10]  The next day she took her daughter to the police station.
	
	
	The cross-examination of the mother focused on a statement that she had made to police on 9 September 2009 in which it was suggested that in the first conversation the complainant had told her that “her grandfather touched her rude part, but nothing about [the complainant] telling you her grandfather kissed or put his mouth on her rude part”. [11]  It was also put to her that, in her statement on Wednesday, 9 September, she had said she had overheard a conversation between the complainant and Rachel two days earlier in which the complainant had said to Rachel “I hate it when Gang-gang goes down on me.” [12]  The cross-examiner suggested that it was most unlikely that she had ever heard the complainant use the expression “go down on me”. It was also put to her that, as regards the initial complaint, she had had to “tease it out of her” and yet the complainant had allegedly blurted a similar statement out to their neighbour. [13] 
	
	
	The mother was also cross-examined to the effect that she had had drug-related illnesses in 2008 and was continuing to receive treatment through 2009, with which she agreed. [14]  She also agreed that she had been worried “at that time” that she might lose her children and that the complainant might wind up living with her step-father and mother. She agreed that her step-father had said something to her to the effect that if she did not “clean up [her] act” she might lose the children for good. [15]  It was also suggested to her that the complainant was missing “a lot of days of school.” [16]  She ultimately agreed that the complainant had missed four days, being on average one day a week, in the month before the complaints to the police.
	
	
	Neither party troubled to place before the Court the transcript of the addresses which might have indicated how this evidence was left to the jury. On one view counsel was hinting at a possible motive for the mother to concoct a story with her daughter in order to falsely allege sexual misconduct by the mother’s step-father, so that the complainant would not be sent to live with the child’s grandmother and step-grandfather. However, no express suggestion to that effect was put to either witness. In the summing up, the trial judge stated: [17] 
	


“There is one other matter, going to the possible motivation of the complainant’s mother. That was dealt with just before lunch by Mr Gartelmann [counsel for the accused], and he pointed to the evidence of the psychotic episode, her illness, the worry that she might have that her daughter be taken away from her. Those matters are suggested as a possible motivation for her having her daughter make these allegations to police and explains why nine months later she has forgotten all about them.”


	
	On the appeal there was no criticism of the summing up in any respect and it may therefore be assumed that the matter was left by counsel for the accused in the way explained by the trial judge. The reference in that context to forgetting the allegations nine months later was a reference to the second police interview with the complainant. For reasons which will be explained shortly, it is quite unlikely that the jury would have treated the second interview as demonstrating such forgetfulness. The jury were correctly advised by the judge, following the passage set out above, that it was not for the accused to prove motivation. The direction continued:
	


“It is not for the accused to establish why any complainant or indeed anybody else – including the complainant’s mother – would lie or make up stories. There is no onus on the accused at all to establish such a motivation or to prove that the complainant lied. It is for the Crown to prove to you, beyond reasonable doubt, that you would accept [the complainant’s] account of what happened and that account itself establishes the offences charged.”


	
	The neighbour Rachel also gave evidence. She said that she had been a neighbour of the complainant and her mother for about a year prior to September 2009, had known the children well and had babysat them and had them to stay at her place. Her daughter had played with the complainant. [18]  She gave evidence that she knew the complainant’s step-grandfather as “Gang-gang” because, when she was young, she could not say “grandpa” properly. Rachel stated that the complainant had said to her “Gang-gang … went down on her.” [19]  She agreed that the complainant appeared nervous at that time, appeared to be rubbing her hands together or wringing her hands, that her mother was not present and that she had later told the complainant’s mother. She agreed that she had never heard the complainant use that language before, nor had she heard anybody say similar words in the complainant’s presence. She agreed that “it seemed something out of the blue”. [20] 
	
	
	Although it might have been open to counsel to suggest that this was a fabrication, or that other words were used, neither proposition was put to the neighbour. Despite the mother’s apparent confusion as to how she came to know of that complaint, there is nothing in the transcript to suggest that the jury would have had any reasonable doubt that such a complaint was made at that time.
	
	
	The first interview with the police undoubtedly involved internal inconsistencies, key aspects of which will be mentioned shortly. However, the description of the conduct complained of was consistent throughout. It was that the applicant had placed his fingers on the complainant’s vagina and had placed his mouth on her vagina. There was no prevarication in that regard. She was asked whether she knew the difference between inside and outside her vagina, agreed that she did and stated that he put his fingers “outside not in my hole.” She was also asked whether she had ever touched his clothing; she agreed that his clothing always remained on. [21] 
	
	
	The main inconsistencies related to how often these events had occurred. The officer attempted to have the complainant identify both the period in which the conduct had occurred and also particular occasions. Thus, the first exchange was in the following terms:
	


“Q76   Now, when was the last time something happened?

A   About, he, he’s done it, like, for weeks.

Q77   Mmm.

A   Weeks and weeks. He, he always does it at, when we go to nan’s house, at Saturday. Every Saturdays.

Q78   So you go to nan’s house every Saturday?

A   Yeah.

…

Q82   … So you said this has been happening for a number of weeks. OK.

A   Yes.

Q83   So, so why don’t you tell me the first time that it happened?

A   I don’t really get it.

Q84   OK. Do you remember the first time something happened?

A   Nuh.

Q85   Can you tell me about the last time something happened?

A   I don’t want, I don’t know what you mean?

Q86   OK. How many times has something happened with your grandfather?

A   Heaps of times.

Q87   Heaps. OK. So why don’t you tell me about one of the times that you remember?

A   I don’t remember.”


	
	After inviting the complainant to go back over the circumstances in which it occurred (her playing on the computer at her grandmother’s house and her grandfather coming in, telling her to place her legs wide apart and touching her rude part), the following questioning took place:
	


“Q113   Only Gang-Gang and you. Did this happen this year or last year or something else?

A   Every year.

Q114   It happened every year?

A   Yeah.

Q115   So this time, this one time that we’re talking about that I want to think about because I know it happened a lot of times and I want to talk to you about all the times that this has happened to you –

A   I don’t think it’s every year I just don’t understand.

[Some further questions involved a degree of confusion or upset on the part of the complainant.]

Q120   That’s OK darling. Do you remember, has this happened, these things happened this year, what year are you in [at] school?

A   Year 3.

Q121   You’re in year 3. … Did things happen when you were in year 2.

A   No.

Q122   No. So it’s happened you’ve always been in year 3?

A   Yeah.

Q123   OK. What school do you go to?

A   Dawson Public School.”


	
	The officer then asked further questions about where the complainant would sit, the taking off of clothes, spreading her legs and touching her, with moving fingers. She got the complainant to confirm that “the rude part” was her vagina. The questioning then continued:
	


“Q165   Your vagina. How does, how many times has he put his mouth on your vagina?

A   Once.

Q 166   Once.

A   Yeah.

Q167   He’s done it once?

A   Yeah.

Q168   OK. Tell me about that time, what does he do?

A   I don’t know.

Q169   That’s OK. The time that he put his mouth, his mouth on your rude part, on your vagina was it before or after he touched you with his fingers?

A   Before.

Q170   Before. ….

…

A   And he does it for a long time.

Q173   Yep. And what about the time that he used his mouth on your rude part. Tell me about that?

A   He sometimes does it after when he puts his hand, sometimes he does it after.

…

Q183   So, how, so has he put his mouth on your vagina once or more times?

A   More times.

Q184   More times.

A   Yeah.

Q185   OK. Now, and you said that it can happen before or after he puts his fingers on your rude part.

A   Yeah.

Q186   … I need to know how many times do you think he has put his lips on your rude part?

A   Twice.

Q187   Twice.

A   Yeah.

Q188   Twice or more [than] twice?

A   I think more than twice.

Q189   Don’t really remember?

A   Yeah.

Q190   But it’s been more [than] once?”


	
	There was more of this uncertainty, to similar effect. Nevertheless, the complainant clearly described separate incidents, when she was playing on her computer and when she was watching television in her grandmother’s bedroom. It was these which were the subject of the four charges which resulted in guilty verdicts.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the complainant “did not have any real recollection of the number of alleged incidents.” That proposition may be accepted: however, the language used overall in what was a reasonably lengthy interview (for an eight year old) was consistent with there being multiple incidents. On my reading of the transcript of the interview, the real difficulty that the complainant had was in isolating one particular occasion in her mind and focusing upon it. The confusion appeared to result from her description of the conduct as repetitious, which led to the questioner seeking to have her identify one particular occasion. That she had difficulty in separating out one specific occasion did not suggest to me (on a reading of the whole transcript) that there was any doubt that the conduct as described occurred on a number of occasions.
	
	
	The complainant had been told by the applicant that it was a secret between them and that she should tell no one, not even her mother. (That was evidence which was not challenged in cross-examination.) The neighbour gave evidence in cross-examination that the complainant was nervous when she spoke to her about what her grandfather did to her; her mother gave evidence, also unchallenged as to the detail, that when her daughter revealed her secret, she was worried that she would not be believed, [22]  and that she might get into trouble. [23] 
	
	
	Towards the end of the first interview, the questioner asked a number of general questions about the circumstances in which the conduct had arisen, including where other people were in the house. She then returned to a very general question which resulted in the following evidence:
	


“Q271   Has Gang-Gang ever done anything else?

A   No but sometimes Mitchell [a 13 year old son of the applicant] comes in and Gang-Gang, Gang-Gang tackles me and Mitchell and we’re playing and sometimes Gang-Gang and Mitchell’s gone and Gang-Gang comes and Gang-Gang still like on me and then he sometimes goes into my rude part while no one’s looking.

Q272   OK. When did that happen? Do you remember a time when that happened?

A   Nuh.

…

Q276   OK. And you were tackling and where were you, where were you –

A   We were tackling on the bed.

Q277   Which bed?

A   My nan’s bed.

…

Q279   Yeah and then what happened?

A   And then, and then Gang-Gang tackles us. He takes his glasses off and he tackles me and Mitchell and sometimes tickle us. Then Mitchell goes and shuts the door and then Gang-Gang goes, I’m here and he’s on me tackling me and then he touches my rude part.

…

Q281   … Does he touch you on top of your clothing or underneath your clothing or something else?

A   Underneath.

Q282   Underneath. So what did he do this time, did he pull your pants down –

A   Yeah.

Q283   – or did you pull them down.

A   He didn’t put my pants down he just, just went inside.”


	
	This evidence constituted the third incident, the subject of the fifth count. It was the evidence which was not accepted beyond reasonable doubt by the jury, which unanimously acquitted of this charge. There were reasons, noted below, which would be sufficient in themselves to explain such a doubt; however, I would have entertained a reasonable doubt, on the basis of the transcript alone, the incident being quite different from others described by the complainant in the previous questioning and coming, almost as an afterthought, at the end of a long interview. In addition, the conduct, which appeared to describe a passing episode which may have been quite short, did not necessarily entail a deliberate offence of the kind described elsewhere.
	


(b)   the second interview


	
	The second interview took place some 10 months after the first; it was conducted by a different police officer, Constable Justine Wilson, although Senior Constable Greig was in the recording room and able to communicate with the officer undertaking the questioning. Having due regard to the proper limits on leading questions in the course of a police interview with a complainant, it is nevertheless difficult from reading the transcript to identify the purpose of the interview. The applicant relied upon the fact that the complainant, at the trial, agreed with the proposition: “You knew that you were going there to talk about what you say your grandfather did to you, didn’t you?” No doubt that was true, but what she would actually expect to say would depend upon what questions were asked of her. There is no evidence that she was given any clear indication as to the purpose of the interview, nor, for example, whether (and if so why) she was expected to repeat what she had already told the police in some detail and which had, to her knowledge, been recorded.
	
	
	There were two occasions where the questions appeared to invite attention to specific matters which had arisen in the first interview, and it will be necessary to refer to them shortly. However, the primary focus of the applicant’s case was the failure of the complainant to repeat the allegations which she had made during the first interview. This was said to be revealed by the evidence she gave at trial.
	
	
	In cross-examination counsel for the applicant explored in some little detail the questions which had been asked by Constable Greig at the first interview. She was then taken to the second interview and, having identified that she had watched and listened to the recording, the following exchange took place: [24] 
	


“Q. You heard that Justine asked you about when you were in your Aunt Jesse's room and on the computer, didn't you?

A. Yeah.

Q. You didn't say anything to Justine about your grandfather touching you when you were in Jesse's room on the computer to Justine, did you?

A. No.

Q. Did you forget what you'd told Emma about what your grandfather did in Jesse's room?

A. I think so.

Q. But if your grandfather had touched you on your rude part as you called it in Jesse's room when you were on the computer, you wouldn't forget about that, would you?

A. No.”


	
	The precision of those questions did not properly reflect the meandering nature of the questioning in the second interview. There simply was no question which would readily have given rise to a repetition of the complaints about her grandfather. The nature of the questioning at the second interview can be inferred from the following exchange:
	


“Q32   … So when you spoke to Emma [Constable Greig] last time, you said that you were in at your grandfather and grandmother’s place, where’s that?

A   Um, Mt Druitt.

…

Q34   O.K. So you were playing the computer.

A   Yep.

Q35   Where were you playing the computer?

A   Um, in my auntie’s room, Jess, my auntie’s room, Jess.

Q36   O.K. And what were you playing on the computer?

A   Ah, this will kind of be embarrassing but playhouse ….

…

Q39   O.K. Is that on your auntie’s computer or is it on the internet through your auntie’s computer or something else?

A   Yeah, yeah, internet.

…

Q42   … So when was that?

A   Um, ages ago but I don’t really remember and I always go, um, to my Nan’s house on Saturdays.

Q43   O.K. So you always go to your Nan’s house on Saturdays. So that day when you were in your auntie’s room playing the computer - - -

A   Yeah.

Q43   --- who else was in the house?

A   Um, my mum and my little baby brother, …. was talking to my Nan and [the applicant], he was at work, he was at work - - -

…

Q47   … So what sort of time of day was this?

A   Um, I think it might have been in the, yeah, it was in the afternoon.

…

Q52   … So that day you were playing the computer - - -

A   Yeah.

Q52   --- before you went to Grandmother’s house and played the computer - - -

A   Yeah, yeah.

Q 52   - - - what were you doing that morning?

A   Um, I [was] at my mum’s house and I was having breakfast and Daniel was having Weetbix ….

Q55   So is this what usually happens or what you remember happening that morning?

A   Yeah, that’s what I remember was happening in the morning.

…

Q59   … Emma, do you want me to try and get closer or O.K., all right. So that was that day. O.K. So there was a second time that you told Emma about, O.K., and you were watching television.

A   Mmm.

Q60   Do you remember that incident?

A   Um, no.

Q61   No. O.K. So whereabouts at your, are they grandma and grandpa …”


	
	The questioning then led into the time she had spoken in her first interview about watching television in her nan’s room. The idea that any of the foregoing questioning would have reasonably led the complainant to think she was being invited to repeat what she had said in the first interview would be fanciful. Her failure to do so did not diminish the cogency of her descriptions in the first interview.
	
	
	Returning to the trial, counsel for the applicant then raised a different topic: [25] 
	


“Q. I want to ask you now about when you talked to Emma about when you were in your nan's room watching The Simpsons on TV. Do you understand that?

A. Yeah.

…

Q. You told Emma that your grandfather touched you when you were in your nan's room watching The Simpsons on TV four or five times, didn't you?

A. Yes, I think so.

Q. I want to ask you now about what you told Justine about when you were watching TV at your grandfather's house. Do you understand that?

A. Yeah.

…

Q. You heard Justine ask you whether you watched The Simpsons on the TV in your nan's room. You heard her say that?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you hear yourself say you didn't think you watched the TV in Nan's room?

A. Yes.

Q. You said you watched The Simpsons on TV in the lounge room, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. So when you spoke to Justine and she asked you about watching The Simpsons on TV in your nan's room did you forget what you'd told Emma about that?

A. Yes.

Q. But if your grandfather had touched you while you were watching The Simpsons on TV in your nan's room some four or five times, surely you wouldn't have forgotten about that.

A. Yeah.”


	
	The questioning in the second interview on this topic went as follows:
	


“Q59   … So there was a second time that you told Emma about, O.K., and you were watching television.

A   Mmm.

Q60   Do you remember that incident?

A   Um, no.

Q61   No. O.K. So whereabouts at your [sic], are they grandma and grandpas, grandfather, grandmother, Nan and pop?

A   My, um, Nan and grandpa.

Q62   … So at your Nan and grandpa’s place - - -

A   Yeah.

Q62   - - - where are the TVs?

A   Ah, the um, [t]he lounge, these are the, um, that’s the lounge room and the TV will be just right there ….

…

Q65   Are there TVs anywhere else?

A   Um, there’s on, my, uncle’s room that’s - - -

…

Q67   All right. Any other TVs?

A   Ah, I don’t think so, no.

Q68   No. Is there a TV in your Nan and grandpa’s room?

A   No.

Q69   No.

A   Ah, actually, yes, there’s one, yeah, there’s just a small one near, um, their desk.

…

Q71   So last year you told Emma that you were in your Nan and grandpa’s room watching television.

A   No, no, not in my Nan’s room.

Q72   No, not in your Nan’s room. What do you mean by that?

A   I, I don’t think I was my Nan’s room, I don’t think so.

…

A   ‘Cause there’s lots of TVs and I don’t know, I just don’t remember very much.

Q74   … You told Emma that you were watching the Simpsons.

A   Yep.

Q75   Yep. Do you remember where you were watching the Simpsons?

A   I was watching the Simpsons in the lounge room where that TV was I told you.

…

A   And then after the Simpsons I would like have, um, dinner at 7.00, I, I think I have dinner at 7 o’clock and sometimes we have dinner there and sometimes we don’t. And, um, after dinner, I might ask my Nan if it’s all right to play in Jessie’s, on Jessie’s computer.

Q77   Ah hmmm.

A   And I’ll play lots of games.”


	
	This questioning was a little more likely to have elicited a repetition of the description of her grandfather’s conduct, but it did not do so. It is apparent that, by this stage of the questioning, the complainant appeared to think that the questioner was seeking general background information about practices and places. There was no reason apparent from the transcript why she would think otherwise and even if there were such a reason, it can hardly be said that her credibility was significantly affected by her failure to understand what was being sought, a failure which was entirely excusable.
	
	
	The second interview turned to two matters which were identified with some specificity and on which significant reliance is placed by the applicant. In the first interview, when seeking further detail, Constable Greig had elicited that the applicant would put his finger on the complainant’s lips (presumably to indicate that she was not to tell anyone), the questioning continuing:
	


“Q293   OK. So he doesn’t do anything else?

A   Nuh.

…

Q295   OK. So he only stops because you tell him to stop?

A   And he, and he does, and he does, Wanna have a little tickle one, he says that.

Q296   What does he say?

A   Little mouse, he says, Want a mousey, mousey. That means like a mousey call like pretending that he’s a mouse and crawling up my vagina.

Q297   OK. So that’s how he says to you, is that, Mousey, mousey. Is that what he calls it, does he say that every time?

A   Yep.

…

Q300   And you know what that means.

A   Yeah.

Q301   What does it mean?

A   It means do you want a tickle up your, up, down your rude part.”


	
	In the course of the second interview, immediately following the passage extracted at [37] above, the questioning continued:
	


“Q78   … There was a time that you told Emma about when you were playing mousey mousey.

A   Yeah.

Q79   And you'd just watched the Simpsons or you were watching the Simpsons or something like that.

A   Yeah.

Q80   Do you remember that time?

A   I don't think I was playing, what, what was mousey mousey, I don't think I was playing that.

Q81   You don't think you were playing that. O.K. All right. One of the times that, so, all right, last year when you came in and spoke to, get myself comfortable, when you spoke to Emma - - -

A   Yeah.

Q81   - - - do you remember the sorts of things that you talked to her about?

A   Um, not much.”


	
	In the course of cross-examination, counsel for the applicant noted her failure to connect the phrase “playing mousey mousey” with what she had said in her first interview. The same point was made on appeal by way of a submission that there was a significant inconsistency, suggesting that what she had said in her first interview was untrue.
	
	
	It might be inferred from the transcript of the second interview that she had not seen or heard the recording of the first interview, or seen a transcript of the interview. One problem with the second interview was that the questions were directed to her recollection of what she had said in the first interview: it would have taken a significant jump on her part to appreciate that what was sought (if it were indeed being sought) was a description of her grandfather’s conduct. Secondly, the questioning would often switch from recollection of what had been said in the first interview to the present tense – “are there TVs anywhere else?” Thirdly, and with respect to “mousey mousey”, it is tolerably clear from her answer that she thought it was a computer game. At the very least, the question asked about a game “you were playing”, not a game her grandfather was playing. If, as seems palpably clear, the questioner and the complainant were at cross-purposes, her failure to connect with the earlier statement in her first interview did little damage to her credit.
	
	
	The fourth and final passage in the second interview on which reliance was placed was more explicit. After some questions asked in the present tense about watching television, the questioning switched to the following topic:
	


“Q89   … So you also told Emma about an incident when you were wrestling with your grandpa and Mitchell.

A   Yeah.

Q90   And where were you guys wrestling?

A   Um, on, um, his bed and my Nan's bed.

….

Q93   O.K. And what time were you guys wrestling on the - - -

A   I didn't, I didn't know, I don't know.

Q94   You didn't know. O.K. So do you guys often wrestle, sometimes wrestle or something else?

A   Um, sometimes, um, I think my, my uncle and, um, grandpa always sometimes wrestles without me when I go and, and sometimes it's, it's the door shut and, um, and I would hear them and, and sometimes join in.”


	
	Again without leading, the questioner invited her to say whether she remembered anything else that happened. The answer is quite confusing, and it is far from clear whether she was still addressing her mind to wrestling. The answer related to something that occurred in her uncle’s room (not her Nan’s room) when she had accidently come close to a fan and almost hit it.
	
	
	Her attention having been specifically drawn to an incident involving wrestling, of which she had spoken in the singular in the first interview, without her recalling her complaint about her grandfather putting his hand inside her pants on that occasion, might well have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury about the veracity of her evidence in regard to that incident. In any event, the applicant was acquitted on that charge. That verdict suggests that the jury was attentive to the differences in evidence with respect to the different incidents.
	
	
	Not having entertained a reasonable doubt as to the veracity, reliability or cogency of her evidence in the first interview, except with regard to the third occasion of wrestling, there was nothing in the second interview which would have led me to change my assessment of the evidence as to the first two occasions.
	


(c)   recollection at trial


	
	The thrust of the cross-examination at trial was that if the incidents which she recounted in her first interview had occurred she would not be likely to have forgotten them 10 months later at the time of her second interview. The fact that she did not mention them in the course of the second interview meant that she had forgotten them. If she had forgotten them at the time of the second interview, that was because they did not occur. The cross-examiner also invited an explanation as to the inconsistencies noted above within the second interview. The cross-examination was partly as follows: [26] 
	


“Q. If your grandfather had kissed you or put his lips on your rude part you would remember if it was only once or a number of times, wouldn't you?

A. I think I forgot when I was eight.

…

Q. When you were talking to Emma about it had you forgotten how many times it happened?

A. Not sure. I think so.

Q. Is it possible you had forgotten how many times it happened because it never really happened?

A. It did happen, but I forgot.

Q. Is it possible that when you spoke to Justine, she asked you about wrestling with Mitchell and you didn't say anything about your grandfather touching you, you forgot to say anything because it didn't really happen?

A. I think it did happen and I forgot.

Q. Is it possible that when Justine asked you about watching The Simpsons on TV in your nan's room and you said you didn't think you did watch TV in your nan's room, is it possible you didn't say anything about your grandfather doing anything to you there because he didn't?

A. He did but I forgot.”


	
	The complainant’s answers read persuasively. When asked whether she forgot things she said, “I think I forgot”, or words to that effect. When asked whether things had never really happened, except for the wrestling incident, she was emphatic in her answer “it did happen” and “he did”. In relation to the wrestling, she was less certain, saying “I think it did happen”. This element of uncertainty with respect to the wrestling may have been the third element in the jury’s reasoning in entering a verdict of not guilty on that count. In respect of the other evidence, the jury would undoubtedly have taken into account the affirmative answers as to whether the conduct occurred.
	
	
	In substance, the gravamen of the contention that the evidence at trial was implausible depended upon the assumption that, at the time of the second interview, the complainant had indeed forgotten the substance of her complaints. For reasons outlined above, it is the assumption that is implausible.
	
	
	Finally, there were submissions that the complainant’s evidence should be seen as unreliable because of particular matters which arose in the course of the trial. The first passage relied upon related to her age, the submission set out the following evidence elicited by the judge on 5 November 2013: [27] 
	


“Q. And how old are you now?

A. I'm 12 years old.

Q. And when was your last birthday?

A. Last year.

Q. What date?

A. 10 May 2001.

Q. Right. So you're turning 13 next May, is that right?

A. Yes.”


	
	It was said to be “immediately obvious that the answer to the second and third questions above cannot be right.” Although that submission purported to make allowance for her age and nervousness, the fact was that she had stated both her birthday and her date of birth correctly. She may not have listened to the questions carefully, but that is all one can say. More importantly, the challenge has nothing to do with the jury’s assessment of the complainant’s credibility: the evidence was given on a voir dire, conducted for the purpose of determining whether the complainant was able to give sworn evidence.
	
	
	A second passage related to the complainant’s school. In her first interview she said she was attending Dawson Public School, and gave the name of her teacher. At trial, the cross-examiner, for reasons which are undisclosed, suggested that “[a]t about the time you went to talk to the police the first time you were going to a school called Colyton Public School.” [28]  She agreed. Shortly thereafter, counsel corrected himself and asked if it was in fact Dawson School, to which she also said yes.
	
	
	The submission based on this evidence was that “the complainant may have been prepared to agree with the proposition that was put to her, simply because it was put”. However, an alternative possibility was that the complainant had in fact changed schools and had forgotten which school she was attending at a particular time in 2009.
	
	
	Either way, the submission was curious. The first possibility, if accepted, would remove any advantage obtained by the applicant by way of concessions she made in the course of her cross-examination. The alternative possibility might have formed the basis for some questioning about her recollection of time, but nothing was made of it and there was nothing before the jury from which the jury could draw any such inference. The challenge was without substance.
	
	
	Finally, reference was made to a passage in which she was asked if she recalled what she had told the neighbour, Rachel, to which she had replied, “I think so.” She was then asked to give the best of her recollection of what she told Rachel and said: “I don’t know. I don’t remember.”
	
	
	No doubt, as it was submitted, the first question was “very straightforward”: however, a very straightforward question, especially one about recollection, can be difficult or even impossible to answer with precision. Her answer revealed uncertainty, which was sought to be exposed by the next question, successfully. In any event, the cross-examiner did not press further and nothing can be made of this exchange in terms of the complainant’s credibility.
	


(d)   claims proven to be inaccurate


	
	The only claim which was said to have been disproved related to the last weekend in August 2009 (namely 29 and 30 August), which was the weekend before Friday, September 4, being the date of the first complaint to her mother. It was accepted that the applicant had an alibi for the whole of that weekend.
	
	
	As has been stated earlier, the best efforts of Constable Greig had failed to identify with any precision the times that particular events occurred, other than that they occurred during the then current school year.
	
	
	The final questions and answers in the first interview commenced at Q310 when the complainant was asked, “What made you decide to tell mum after such a time?” The answers given were to the effect that she no longer wanted to keep the “secret” and that she felt obliged to tell her mother and felt better for having done so. The officer returned to the question of timing, asking about the last time something happened with the applicant, “did that happen a little time before” she told her mother. [29]  She agreed with that but then suggested that the reason for disclosing the secret on the Friday was that she was expecting to go back to her grandparents’ place the following day. The next questions and answers, upon which the submission of inaccuracy depended, were as follows:
	


“Q322   Did you go to Gang-Gang’s and nan’s the Saturday before?

A   Yep.

Q323   Did something happen the Saturday before?

A   Nuh I just done what I just told you like, he put his face and - - -

Q324   Yeah but did something happen, something did happen on the Saturday before last week?

A   Nuh.

Q325   Yeah. So you told mum on the Friday, did you go to nan’s the weekend before?

A   Yes.

Q326   You did? Did, do, did, did Gang-Gang play mousey, mousey on Saturday, the Saturday before?

A   (No audible reply)

Q327   Yeah. OK.

A   Every time he does it.

Q328   Every time. There wasn’t one weekend that something didn’t happen that you didn’t play mousey, mousey.

A   (No audible reply)”


	
	The form of Q327 suggests that, although there was no audible reply to the previous question, there may have been an indication by way of a visible response. (I will return to that possibility below.) The final question, again to which there was no reply recorded, although nothing seems to have followed, indicated a possible degree of scepticism about whether the answer to the previous question was to be taken as literally true.
	
	
	Given the previous 321 questions, and the answers thereto, and based solely on reading the transcript, I would infer that the complainant was saying that this was “always” happening, meaning, in a common colloquial form, it had had happened often. To her it was of little consequence whether it had happened two Saturdays before the interview or not. In any event, I would not read the exchange as demonstrating any intention to affirm that it happened on the last weekend in August. The charge was not directed specifically to that weekend, nor did the prosecutor contend (understandably given the alibi) that her evidence established an offence on that weekend. Relevantly, however, I would not accept the submission that an affirmative answer with respect to that weekend was intended, so as to demonstrate that the complainant was untruthful or unreliable in the rest of her statement. Apart from the evidence of the applicant to which it will be necessary to turn, and partly because of the imprecision of the complainant’s first interview, there was nothing which proved any particular to be objectively erroneous.
	


(e)   inconsistencies with the evidence of her mother and her neighbour


	
	The inconsistent accounts given by the complainant’s mother, and inconsistencies between her accounts and that of the neighbour Rachel, have already been identified. Unless, as the applicant submitted, the whole account was invented, it was clear that there had been a complaint prior to the complainant’s attendance at the police station on Tuesday, 8 September 2009. The complainant stated that she had told her mother of what had happened on the Friday preceding, whilst she was making her lunch for school. She did so, in substance, because she feared going to her grandparents’ the following day. It was not put to her in cross-examination that that was a lie or inaccurate. Accordingly, whatever the jury made of the discrepancies between the account given by the mother and that given by her neighbour, none of this evidence reflected poorly on the credibility of the complainant.
	
	
	As has been noted, the cross-examination of Rachel did not suggest that there was no complaint, nor even that their relationship was such that the complainant was unlikely to make a complaint to her. The focus of the cross-examination was on the actual words said to have been used, namely “goes down on me”. The cross-examination of the complainant’s mother was to the effect that she had gone to the police on Friday, 4 September, alleging that the complainant had said that the applicant had put his hand on her rude part, but that there had been no reference to putting his mouth or his lips there. There was also some cross-examination as to precisely when the mother spoke to Rachel, whether the complainant was with her at the time or not and the content of the conversation. Again, none of this suggested that the complainant had not complained either to her or to Rachel, nor was the complainant’s credibility affected.
	


(f)   combined effect


	
	The final submission put by the applicant was that the combined effect of all the difficulties identified previously was sufficient to taint each verdict of guilty on the basis that the jury should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the complainant’s evidence. However, that submission depended on acceptance of the individual challenges.
	
	
	In support of that conclusion, no analysis was undertaken of the applicant’s own evidence, but attention should be directed to it.
	


Evidence of applicant


	
	The evidence of the accused was to the following effect:
	



	
	he worked most Saturday’s between 7am and midday; [30] 
	
	
	the complainant had stayed at their home for a period of days or weeks in September 2008;
	
	
	the complainant and her mother and brother visited most Saturdays and stayed until teatime or dinnertime and sometimes for dinner;
	
	
	at some stage (no date was given) he had a conversation with the complainant’s mother to the effect that “if she doesn’t pull her act together you’re going to lose your children”;
	
	
	when the complainant visited, she sometimes watched television;
	
	
	there were five televisions in the house, including one in the lounge room, one in each of the three bedrooms and one on the back deck;
	
	
	the complainant watched The Simpsons on television and when asked where said, “lounge room and we’ll say, my bedroom or Nan’s bedroom”;
	
	
	he had entered the room when the complainant was watching The Simpsons but did not think he had closed the door;
	
	
	he had on occasion entered Jessica’s room when the complainant was playing on her computer, but did not think he had ever closed the door;
	
	
	on occasions he would wrestle with his son, Mitchell, but did not recall an occasion when Mitchell had left the room and he had closed the door;
	
	
	he denied ever touching or putting his lips to or kissing the complainant’s genitals;
	
	
	he had heard her evidence of “mousey mousey” which meant pretending to be like a mouse crawling up towards the complainant’s genital area and denied he had ever played such a game with the complainant;
	
	
	his mother’s 80th birthday had occurred on 30 August 2009 and he had left for Yamba in northern New South Wales to be with her on that occasion and was away for the whole weekend of 29 and 30 August.
	



	
	In cross-examination he:
	



	
	agreed that the conversation about the complainant staying with them would have occurred “around September 2008”;
	
	
	agreed that the complainant had on occasion joined in the wrestling with his son and him;
	
	
	was not able to say whether there were occasions when his wife, the complainant’s mother and his children were all out of the house on a Saturday and he was alone with the complainant;
	
	
	agreed that there may have been occasions when he spoke to the complainant about problems she was facing at school;
	
	
	agreed that there may have been occasion when he was alone with the complainant in Jessica’s room, when she wanted to show him something on the computer;
	
	
	denied, or did not think, that he had been with the complainant in Jessica’s room or in his room (also referred to as Nan’s bedroom) alone, with the door closed;
	
	
	agreed that the complainant and Mitchell (and possibly the complainant alone) may have been banished from the lounge room to watch The Simpsons in the bedroom because he did not like the program;
	
	
	in answer to a series of questions setting out the complainant’s evidence as to specific aspects of the offending, simply denied each aspect of the conduct with a simple, “No.”
	


Assessment of evidence


	
	For reasons already recounted, a reading of the transcript, assuming no assessment of the witness giving evidence can be undertaken, would persuade me that the complainant’s evidence as to the conduct of the applicant in respect of the four charges which were found proven was truthful, reliable and cogent. The second interview would not have raised a reasonable doubt in my mind as to the state of satisfaction formed on the basis of the first interview.
	
	
	So far as the other evidence was concerned, there was clearly some complaint made both to the complainant’s mother, on Friday 4 September, and to her neighbour, during the period 4-7 September 2009. I would not accept that there was a reasonable basis for thinking that either the complaints to the mother and the neighbour or the detailed account to Constable Greig were concocted or untrue.
	
	
	There remains a question as to whether a different view might be formed on the basis of the applicant’s evidence. Although the applicant conceded opportunity and relationship, he denied each element of the complainant’s account, including, for example, ever having heard the phrase “mousey mousey” before the charges were laid. [31] 
	
	
	It is, of course, entirely possible that his demeanour and appearance in the witness box might have given a force to his bland denials which does not appear from the transcript.
	
	
	It is also possible that viewing the evidence of the complainant might persuade me that she was not to be believed, or was unreliable. The jury had those benefits, but did not form such a view. The applicant’s submissions do not persuade me that there was any reason why the jury, on the material before it, should have entertained a reasonable doubt (which I have not formed) as to the truth of the complaints. Accordingly, on the basis of the case as presented, I would dismiss the appeal.
	


Viewing the video recording


	
	Having reached that conclusion, I was troubled by the possibility that the video recording of the complainant’s first interview might cast it in a different light. I was also concerned that the flow of the answers and questions, in some cases where there was no audible reply recorded in the transcript, suggested that there were visual clues which were not recorded. Further, the apparent confusion between questioner and complainant in the second interview might, on viewing a video recording, have demonstrated that the complainant was not confused, but evasive.
	
	
	In order to resolve these uncertainties, I took the view that it was appropriate to view the video recordings of each interview. (The recording of her cross-examination was not provided to the Court.) In taking that step I was fully conscious of the fact that it would not assist me to assess the evidence of the applicant. That the exercise would therefore be unbalanced was a factor which carried little weight because the purpose of viewing the video recording was to ascertain whether there might be any reason for not accepting the complainant at face value, on the transcript.
	
	
	In SKA in this Court, Simpson J noted that “[a]ppellate judges are not immune from the subtle (or not so subtle) influence of evidence given in videotaped form.” [32]  I appreciate the force of that proposition in relation to the question of balance, which has already been addressed. Otherwise, as a reason for not viewing a video recording, I would not be dissuaded on that basis. Placing the evidence before the jury in that form is in accordance with the statutory scheme for the presentation of evidence in such cases. [33]  If the jury can be trusted with such material, it must be the case that an appellate judge should be conceded an equivalent capacity for careful assessment. Indeed, the question of subtle influence was, as Simpson J said in the next paragraph, “really no more than a recognition of the long established recognition … that observation of witnesses can affect the impact of the evidence given.” [34]  That must be so: it is the foundation of a judicial system in which evidence is (for the most part) presented orally and where, in both civil and criminal proceedings, the appellate case law is replete with references to the advantages enjoyed by a trial judge (or jury) in assessing demeanour, credibility and reliability.
	
	
	The joint reasons in the High Court recognised that it is “usually sufficient for a review of the evidence” to be conducted on the papers. [35]  The concern expressed in relation to viewing a video recording focused on potential unfairness to the applicant. That is, of course, an important factor. But if reason can be identified to suggest that a viewing may be of assistance in forming the opinion required of the appellate court, the court should not be precluded from viewing the video recording, nor did the High Court (or Simpson J) suggest otherwise. The purpose must be identified and the Court must take seriously the risk of imbalance based on the viewing of part only of the evidence. On the other hand, it is not in the interests of justice to allow an applicant whose only ground of appeal requires the appellate court to form a view as to the effect of the whole of the evidence to deny the appellate court access to part of the record of that evidence.
	
	
	There are, of course, practical implications of taking such a step. While it appeared appropriate in the circumstances of this case, the burden caused by viewing the video recordings did not give rise to a practical burden. They were, in total, about one hour in length. Where the Court is invited to view lengthy video recordings, other considerations may arise. That was not so in this case and it is appropriate, in the absence of direction by way of standard practice, that these aspects should be considered on a case by case basis.
	
	
	Having undertaken a careful assessment of the written transcript, viewing the video recordings of the interviews was predictably revealing. For example, at Q154-Q163 in the transcript of the first interview, Constable Grieg had the complainant explain what the applicant did with his fingers when touching her vagina. When she stated at Q162 that “he moves those two fingers”, she was describing an action demonstrated by the complainant.
	
	
	When the officer was seeking an explanation of how he put his mouth on her vagina,  [36]  ending with the comment, “He’s like that, OK,” [37]  the video recording demonstrated that the complainant slid to a kneeling position on the floor at that point.
	
	
	In the following questions, Constable Greg attempted to have the complainant identify how often he had put his lips on her vagina. There was said to be no audible reply to the question, “but it’s been more than once?” but the video recording indicated the complainant nodding.
	
	
	There are a number of other examples, some of which might be inferred from the transcript, but in other cases that would not have been safe.
	
	
	More importantly, the complainant’s appearance was significant. She was clearly nervous and played with the zip on her jacket almost constantly through the interview, sometimes giving the appearance of wringing her hands, which may have explained why counsel for the accused suggested she might have been doing that when speaking to the neighbour, Rachel. More importantly, it would have been possible for the jury to resolve what appeared to be points of confusion in her evidence, but which might possibly have been evasion or even concoction. In this respect the video recording did not assist the applicant. It is sufficient to conclude that there was nothing in the video recording which would have supported a conclusion that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence she gave.
	
	
	A similar conclusion flowed from the video recording of the second interview. There were passages in which it was quite unclear whether the questioner was speaking to the complainant or to the officer out of sight and hearing, in the recording room. The video recording demonstrated long gaps in which it was clear that the interrogating officer was listening to instructions or gaining other assistance. It also became clear that points of hesitation and uncertainty which appeared in the transcript of the answers were the product of the questioning.
	
	
	Although the second interview took place only 10 months after the first, there was a remarkable change in the appearance of the complainant. Instead of having longish hair falling across her face, she had her hair pulled back from her face. She presented much more confidently. Again, however, the inferences drawn above as to the explanations for the form of the answers were confirmed in most respects. In particular, after viewing the video recording, I would not have drawn any inference favourable to the applicant’s case as to the doubt cast on the complainant’s credibility by the second interview.
	
	
	Because I have not viewed the cross-examination of the complainant (although I would have been happy to do so in the circumstances of this case) and because I have not seen (nor presumably is there) a video recording of the accused giving evidence, it is not appropriate to draw any further inferences from viewing the video recordings of the police interviews with the complainant. It is sufficient to conclude that they did not assist the applicant.
	


Conclusions


	
	I would propose that the Court grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	WILSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Basten JA and I agree with his Honour’s analysis of the evidence of the complainant at trial, and with his conclusions.
	
	
	Unlike the presiding judge, I did not view the recordings of the two interviews conducted by police with the complainant. Having read the transcript of the evidence, including that of the two interviews, I was left with no doubt as to the guilt of the applicant.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant pointed to purported inconsistencies between the complainant’s account of the offences in her first interview and that given in her second, I regard those matters highlighted by the applicant (and set out by Basten JA above) as saying more about the manner in which the complainant was questioned than about her credibility.
	
	
	Similarly, whilst some (minor) concessions were obtained from the complainant in cross-examination at trial, such concessions as were obtained principally arose from questions directed to what the complainant may have said on other occasions, and her memory of what she had said, rather than to what had happened. Her evidence as to what had happened was both consistent and persuasive.
	
	
	The verdicts returned by the jury were well open and I could not and do not conclude that it would be dangerous in all of the circumstances to allow the verdicts of guilty to stand: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant ultimately withdrew his invitation to the Court to view the recording of the complainant’s evidence (being both the two police interviews with her and the recording of the evidence given by her at trial, made for the purposes set out in Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986). In those circumstances, although I do not wish to address this aspect of the matter at length, I do wish to note my concern that it could become common for this Court to be asked to view recorded evidence from the original proceedings.
	
	
	There are obvious and probably significant ramifications for the workload of any appellate court asked routinely to view such material but, equally, there may be significant jurisprudential consequences for both the manner in which an appellate court approaches the determination of appeals, and for long established notions of the primacy of the jury.
	
	
	Suffice to say that, unless some compelling reason is advanced by an appellant as to why an appellate court should view recorded evidence from the original proceedings, I would not ordinarily regard it as necessary or even desirable that such a course be adopted.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge.
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Basten JA and Wilson J. As the judgment of Basten JA demonstrates there were significant inconsistences in the complainant’s account of what had occurred. Probably the most striking of these lay in the number of times she alleged the Applicant had interfered with her in one way or another although not insignificant were the differences in the Applicant’s account of the incident she originally said occurred in her grandmother’s bedroom.
	
	
	On the other hand, the complainant adhered firmly to her story of being abused in the ways that were the subject of the charges. Her evidence derived very considerable support from the evidence of complaint that her mother and the next door neighbour gave, evidence which, though it also contained inconsistencies was, in matters central to the prosecution, firmly adhered to.
	
	
	Furthermore a number of the complaints of inconsistency founded on the second interview are more apparent than real once one recognises that answers said to be inconsistent were commonly in respect of different topics – the complainant’s recollection of what she had said in the first interview and, on the other hand, her recollection of what had occurred.
	
	
	In the result, while there was undoubtedly material upon which the jury may have been persuaded not to accept the complainant, the fact remains that they did accept her. Her youth may well have been reasonably regarded as an explanation for the inconsistencies and I am not persuaded that the jury was not reasonably entitled to accept the substance of her evidence. Accepting that the grounds of appeal require this Court to make its own assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence, I am not persuaded that this Court should interfere – M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487; MFA v R (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v R (2011) 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	I have also elected not to view the video recordings of the complainant’s interviews with police which constituted her evidence in chief. Consideration of the transcripts has led me to the view that I did not need to see those recordings. I also have reservations about the appropriateness of doing so when, as ultimately occurred, both parties urged that the recordings not be viewed and I had seen nothing to indicate that thereby any miscarriage of justice would result.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

2767722,Crespin v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2015] NSWDC 212,"Judgment


	
	These are proceedings for defamation where the defendants have provided extensive particulars for the s 25 defence of justification. In support of that defence, the defendants seek to administer 25 questions (including sub-sets) in the form of interrogatories to the first defendant and 22 to the second defendant.
	
	
	Prior to the hearing of this application, the plaintiff conceded that the following interrogatories should be answered:
	


In relation to the first plaintiff:


	
	Interrogatory 2(a) (but not (b) or (c))
	
	
	Interrogatory 5
	
	
	Interrogatory 6 (a) – (c) (but not (d) – (e))
	
	
	Interrogatories 7, 8, 14, 15
	
	
	Interrogatory 17(a) (but not (b) – (c))
	
	
	Interrogatory 18 (a) and (c) (but not (b), (d) or (e))
	
	
	20 (a) and (b) (but not (c) or (d)0
	
	
	21 (a) and (b) (but not (c) or (d))
	
	
	Interrogatories 22 and 25
	


In relation to the second plaintiff:


	
	Interrogatory 2
	
	
	Interrogatory 3 (a) – (c) (but not (d) or (e))
	
	
	Interrogatories 6 and 7
	
	
	Interrogatories 14 and 15
	
	
	Interrogatory 17(a) (but not (b) or (c))
	
	
	Interrogatory 18(a) (but not (b) – (d))
	
	
	Interrogatories 19 and 22.
	



	
	As is noted below, Mr Rasmussen conceded, during the argument, that his clients should answer additional interrogatories.
	


The relevant rules and legal principles


	
	Rule 22.1 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) provides:
	


“Interrogatories 22.1

(1) At any stage of the proceedings, the court may order any party to answer specified interrogatories.

(2) An application for such an order must be accompanied by a copy of the proposed interrogatories.

(3) In the case of proceedings on:

(a) a claim for damages arising out of the death of, or bodily injury to, any person, or

(b) a claim for contribution in relation to damages so arising,

such an order is not to be made unless the court is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify the making of the order.

(4) In any case, such an order is not to be made unless the court is satisfied that the order is necessary at the time it is made.

(5) An order to answer interrogatories:

(a) may require the answers to be given within a specified time, and

(b) may require the answers, or any of them, to be verified by affidavit, and

(c) in circumstances in which rule 35.3 authorises someone other than the party to whom the order is addressed to make the relevant affidavit, may specify the person to make the affidavit, or the persons from whom the person to make the affidavit may be chosen, in relation to the interrogatories or any of them.”


	
	The use of interrogatories in defamation proceedings differs from the course taken in most other civil proceedings. Interrogatories have an important role to play in establishing (for a plaintiff) a wide range of issues including circulation and readership, inquiries prior to publication, and admissions relating to the defences. Imputations are similarly of assistance to defendants in seeking admissions, particularly where a defence of justification has been pleaded, which support the defendant’s case. In Bryson v Casey [2002] NSWSC 636 at [19] Simpson J, commenting on this use of interrogatories by a defendant, stated:
	


“[19] Perhaps the most important purpose of the interrogation process is to facilitate proof of the interrogating party's case. Skilfully administered interrogatories may achieve proof of matters which may otherwise take a number of witnesses and a great deal of time to prove. This is done simply by securing the admission by the interrogated party of the particular fact or facts. It is, of course, essential that the interrogatories relate to a matter in question, but this relationship may, on occasions, be indirect.”


	
	By reason of the importance of interrogatories in defamation proceedings, the restriction of interrogatories to a number less than 30 has never applied: Lewis v Page (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 15 December 1989). However, the new test of necessity in r 22.1 and changing case management views resulted in the placing of restrictions on the use of interrogatories in Practice Note SCCL 4 in the Supreme Court. In Wood v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1944 McCallum J explained the restrictions on interrogatories imposed by the Practice Note in the Supreme Court as follows:
	


“[4] ... The test posed by the Practice Note is that the Court will not order any party to answer interrogatories except where, after considering the draft proposed interrogatories, the Defamation List Judge forms the view that they are necessary for the resolution of the real issues in dispute in the proceedings. That formulation in the Practice Note was not intended to supplant the test stated in r 22.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), which states that an order that a party answer specified interrogatories is not to be made unless the Court is satisfied that the order is necessary at the time it is made. Rather, the object of the Practice Note was to focus the attention of the parties, by the sanction of having their interrogatories first considered by the Defamation List Judge, on narrowing the scope of interlocutory processes in an appropriate way.”


	
	Civil Practice Note 6 of the District Court mirrors many of the provisions in the Supreme Court, but not this provision. However, that omission is not intended to supplant or derogate from the test stated in r 22.1 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). This is intended to reflect the greater use of this court for non-media publications and by litigants in person, particularly where those litigants in person are defendants, forced to act for themselves due to the absence or unavailability of insurance. However, the same test applies, and there is simply more flexibility given to the parties in determination of the relevant issues.
	
	
	In conclusion, the test of necessity in r 22.1 cannot be satisfied merely by the fact that the imputations are relevant (Wood v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) at [6]) or by a claim that a party will be deprived of the opportunity to prove a case if the interrogatories are refused (at [7]). Additionally, when considering issues relevant to interrogatories, there is some authority to the effect that the issue of proportionality should be taken into account: Daniels v State of New South Wales (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 1164 at [2]-[6] (see also Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 890 at [2] and [9]), although this concept is probably already contained in the concept of necessity.
	
	
	Where objections are made to the answering of interrogatories which are of a similar nature in terms of the information sought, the general approach by courts is to deal with the imputations in groups (see for example, Wood v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) at [9]-[12]). That is the approach the parties have taken here and, while I have dealt with each interrogatory individually in the course of argument, I propose to summarise my findings in the same fashion as that adopted by McCallum J in Wood v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2). In particular, since many of the interrogatories to the second plaintiff mirror those for which answers were sought from the first plaintiff, I have made rulings in relation to the interrogatories administered to the first plaintiff which will apply to the interrogatories sought to be administered to the second plaintiff.
	


The basis of the objections


	
	The plaintiff’s solicitors in their letter of 5 August 2015 objected to answering interrogatories on the basis that they were “not relevant to any issue” and “not necessary” without further explanation. Although Mr Rasmussen supplemented these terse answers with additional written submissions, it is not a helpful way for parties to deal with objections to interrogatories.
	
	
	Many of the plaintiffs’ objections to answer on the basis of necessity fell away when the particulars of justification and certain of the discovery documents (notably the contract for sale), the categories of documents for discovery and the documents produced as a result were examined. In particular, claims of legal professional privilege in relation to preparation of a contract fell away when it became clear that the contract for sale did not include any indication that this document had been prepared by a solicitor (nor did any name for a solicitor appear), and the whole of the relevant files in relation to the notice to complete and notice to quit had been provided, a procedure indicating there had been waiver of any such claim.
	
	
	Additionally, many of the objections were inconsistent and confusing:
	



	
	As the list above shows, the plaintiffs conceded that they would answer certain interrogatories (for example, interrogatory 15 to the first plaintiff about whether the first plaintiff made an instalment payment) but objections were then made to the subsequent interrogatory commencing “If the answer to interrogatory is yes”. In the case of interrogatory 15, that inquires as to when the payment was made and asks for documents recording it. This robs the interrogatory of much of its ability to “facilitate proof of the interrogating party’s case” (Bryson v Casey at [9]).
	
	
	Similarly, the plaintiff is prepared to answer parts of the interrogatories (for example, interrogatory 17 to the first plaintiff about whether it was true that the first plaintiff had sufficient funds to complete the purchase) but not those parts requiring the information upon which that concession is made, or to attach or identify the documents containing that information. This similarly robs the interrogatory of its forensic value. Similarly, in relation to interrogatory 6, the plaintiffs were prepared to answer a question about what they said or wrote to Ms Zerkel but were not prepared to set out what she said or wrote in reply, which would have required the preparation of redacted emails and laborious reconstructions of parts of a series of conversations.
	
	
	The decision whether to answer the interrogatory or not appears entirely arbitrary in some cases. For example, the first plaintiff is prepared to answer certain questions about the Notice to Complete but not the Notice to Quit.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s objections to the request, in certain interrogatories (for example, interrogatories 2(b)((iii), 2(c)(iii)(B), 6(e), 16(b), 17(c), 20(d) and 24(c) to the first plaintiff), for the documents recording or evidencing certain events or payments to be attached were well-founded. The defendant is entitled to ask the plaintiffs to identify the relevant documents produced on discovery by discovery number, and not to use interrogatories as a means of obtaining further discovery. Additionally, the production of so many documents as part of the interrogation process may be oppressive.
	


The interrogatories the plaintiff need not answer


	
	Mr Rasmussen objected to answering interrogatories 2(b)(iii) and 2(c)(iii)(B) on three bases:
	



	
	Necessity;
	
	
	An attempt to obtain discovery in addition to the categories of discovered documents; and
	
	
	Legal professional privilege.
	



	
	Mr Jedrzejczyk tendered the contracts signed by the parties on 23 and 28 February 2011. No name or address is given for a solicitor and the requirement for all money under the contract to be paid to “a duly qualified legal practitioner or licensed real estate agent” in clause 4(b) has been crossed out. A reference to the “vendor’s legal practitioner” should have been crossed out in clause 13.1, in accordance with the instructions set out underneath clause 13.2, but it is not in dispute that at all relevant times the vendor, Ms Zerkel, never had a legal practitioner acting on her behalf on the sale of the property. The signatures are not witnessed by a member of the legal profession. In the absence of there being some evidence of a legal practitioner having drafted this document, it is hard to see how a claim for legal professional privilege could be maintained. Any assistance that the plaintiff received in relation to the preparation of the contract would be a matter not covered by legal professional privilege.
	
	
	While I am satisfied that the plaintiffs in those circumstances must answer questions about what part of the contract they prepared, or instructed some other person to prepare on their behalf, I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs should be obliged to provide copies of “any drafts of the contract”. If the plaintiffs prepared a series of drafts, or obtained a pro forma contract for sale and copied extracts from it, the necessity for examining that process by reference to these earlier drafts (assuming they exist) would not be relevant to any question in issue, let alone necessary for the disposition of issues in the case.
	
	
	However, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs should answer interrogatories as to whether they obtained legal advice in relation to the purchase of the property (interrogatory 3), when they obtained that advice (interrogatory 4(a)) and from whom (interrogatory 4(b)). Independent of any question of wavier, that information would not be covered by legal professional privilege.
	
	
	Interrogatory 9 required the first plaintiff to state whether he believed, when he signed the contract, that its terms were legally binding upon him. Mr Rasmussen submitted that this was a cross-examining interrogatory. However, one of the acknowledged objects of interrogatories is to diminish the burden of proof and it is thus not an objection to assert that the same information may be given in cross-examination: Cassegrain v Gerard Cassegrain & Co Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 241 at [20]-[36], cited in Howes v ACP Magazines Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1836 at [5] by McCallum J. I note, however, that in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd v Crown Melbourne Ltd [2012] VSC 493 at [68] Mukhtar AsJ took a contrary view. Whether or not the interrogatory is cross-examining informal content, it fails the necessity test as an answer is not necessary to the deposal of the issues, as well as amounting to a fishing expedition.
	


Redrafted interrogatories


	
	Interrogatories 23 and 24 provide:
	


“23. Did you enter into any agreement or settlement with the National Australia Bank in respect of:

(a) purchasing the Property;

(b) discharging the mortgage over the Property;

(c) assuming the mortgagor’s obligation to make repayments under the mortgage; and/or

(d) remaining in possession of the Property?

24. If the answer to interrogatory 23 is in the affirmative, then:

(a) What were the terms of that agreement?

(b) When did you make that agreement?

(c) Attach to your answer to this interrogatory a copy of any document recording or evidencing the terms of that agreement.”


	
	In the course of argument it transpired that these questions were directed at the basis upon which the plaintiffs had continued to reside in the premises following service of the notice to complete and/or notice to quit. I have accordingly granted leave to the defendants to administer interrogatories identifying these issues with more precision than the currently drafted interrogatories.
	
	
	Additionally, as is set out in my orders, I have indicated that answers to certain interrogatories (interrogatories 6(e), 16(b), 17(c) and 20(d)) may be answered by reference to the relevant discovered documents, rather than producing and attaching them.
	


The interrogatories the first plaintiff is directed to answer


	
	These are as set out in order 1 of the orders set out below.
	
	
	In considering each of these interrogatories, I have had the benefit of reading the defendants’ particulars, which meticulously set out the basis upon which a defence of justification is pleaded to each of the imputations. I have read the categories of discovery, and understand the approach to proof that the defendants intend to take at the trial. In particular, I have had the advantage of reading the contract one or both of the plaintiffs appear to have prepared (either in part or in whole) as well as signed, the terms of which are the subject of many of these interrogatories.
	
	
	For the reasons stated in the course of argument, I am satisfied that each of the interrogatories which I have directed the first plaintiff to answer is one which is “skilfully administered and likely to achieve proof of matters which may otherwise take a number of witnesses and a great deal of time for the defendants to prove in the present case” (Wood v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (No 2) at [9]).
	


The interrogatories administered to the second plaintiff


	
	The interrogatories the defendants seek to administer to the second plaintiff are identical to those proposed for the first plaintiff in most respects. Orders have been made conformably with my rulings in relation to the interrogatories proposed to be administered to the first plaintiff.
	


Costs


	
	These proceedings were listed for argument on 13 August 2015. The argument did not proceed on that day because the defendants’ submissions were both late and unhelpful, in circumstances where, as a result, neither the court not counsel for the plaintiffs were in a position to deal with arguments of an unknown nature, in circumstances where the time to be spent on these issues was agreed to be several hours in any event.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendants redrafted his submissions, and counsel for the plaintiffs provided submissions in reply which included a number of concessions. Nevertheless, the defendants were successful on nearly all issues in relation to both the application in relation to the plaintiffs’ interrogatories to the defendants (heard on 10 September 2015) and in this application today.
	
	
	Ordinarily, where a defendant has enjoyed success to the extent enjoyed by the defendants in these proceedings in two such applications, costs would follow the event. The question is what adjustment, if any, should be made for the loss of the 13 August hearing date.
	
	
	Given the unsatisfactory nature of the defendants’ submissions on 13 August 2015, the matter could not proceed and Mr Rasmussen submits that an order for indemnity costs should be made for that day in his client’s favour. This would so outweigh any application for costs in relation to the argument on 10 September 2015 and today that the fair result would be that each party should pay their own costs. Mr Rasmussen also noted that after the defendants’ submissions were totally redrafted, he had made a number of concessions, both before and during the argument today, as a result.
	
	
	Mr Jedrzejczyk submitted that the overwhelming success he had enjoyed in both applications warranted costs orders in his clients’ favour. That should not require adjustment other than in some very minor form in relation to the unreadiness to proceed on 13 August 2015.
	
	
	Civil Practice Note 6 requires parties to provide the court with an outline of submissions and a list of authorities in sufficient time for the issues to be known to all parties. The Defamation List is a busy list and time is at a premium. Legal representatives cannot take for granted that their opponents, or the court, can deal with applications “on the run”, particularly where applications can be time consuming (as is generally the case with arguments about interrogatories) and require careful analysis of the factual background as well as legal issues. Parties who do not comply with Civil Practice Note 6 should expect that a failure to do so will result in an adverse costs order being made.
	
	
	However, the adverse costs order should not be out of proportion with the degree of success of the application, and for this reason, the order I propose to make is that the costs of these applications (13 August 2015 and 10 September 2015) be the defendants’ costs in the cause.
	


Orders


	
	The first plaintiff is directed to answer interrogatories 1, 2(b)(i), 2(b)(ii), 2(c)(i), 2(c)(ii), 2(c)(iii) (excluding 2(c)(iii)(B)), 3, 4, 6(d) to 6(e) (noting that reference to “documents” in 6(e) will be satisfied by reference to the relevant discovery number), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 (noting the answer to 16(b) is to be made by reference to the documents produced on discovery and that this will constitute a sufficient answer), 17(b) and 17(c) (provided that the answer to 17(c) will be satisfied by reference to the relevant discovered documents), 18(b), 18(d), 18(e), 19, 20(c), 20(d) (satisfied by reference to the relevant discovered documents), 21(c) and 21(d).

	The first plaintiff is not required to answer interrogatories 2(b)(iii), 2(c)(iii)(B) and 9.
	
	
	The second plaintiff is directed to answer interrogatories 1, 3(d), 3(e) (satisfied by reference to the relevant discovered document), 4 and 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 (interrogatory 13(b) may be answered by reference to the relevant discovery documents), 14(b) and 14(c) (noting that 14(c) may be answered by reference to the relevant discovery documents), 16, 17(b), 17(c), 17(d) ( interrogatory 17(d) may be answered by reference to the relevant discovery documents), 18(c) and 18(d).

	The costs of this application and of the previous two occasions (13 August 2015 and 10 September 2015) are to be the defendants’ costs in the cause.
	
	
	Parties are to administer interrogatories in accordance with these orders on or before 29 September 2015 (14 days from today).
	
	
	Parties to answer interrogatories with verification on or before 30 October 2015.
	
	
	Parties have liberty to restore the matter if there are any issues as to the redrafted interrogatories contemplated by the orders made.
	
	
	Matter stood over to the Defamation List on Thursday 12 November 2015 for further directions.

		23 September 2015",2015-09-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767725,Application of Malcolm Potier (No. 2) [2015] NSWCCA 249,"Judgment OF THE COURT


	
	This Court gave judgment on 3 August 2015 in relation to a number of applications made by the Applicant: Application of Malcolm Potier [2015] NSWCCA 199. All the applications were dismissed.
	
	
	On 17 August 2015 the Applicant applied under r 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules to re-open the judgment of the Court. The basis of the application was said to be:
	


(a)   Mistake of law over the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to hear and

consider other related matters before the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

(b)   Mistake of fact over the status of the Applicant’s parole consideration;

(c)   Mistake of law over the rejection of the Applicant’s bail application;

(d)   Mistake of law in making findings and/or conclusions on ongoing matters currently before the Court giving rise to potential unreasonable prejudice.


	
	The Applicant provided what were described as short submissions together with copies of correspondence with the Registrar of the Court. The Applicant concluded those submissions by saying that should the application be accepted the Applicant be permitted a reasonable opportunity to file a comprehensive argument. Because of the nature of the jurisdiction under r 50C and the material already provided by the Applicant the Court declined to permit any further submissions.
	
	
	Rule 50C provides:
	


50C Power to set aside or vary order

(1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.

(2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under sub-rule (1) as if the order had not been entered.

(3) Within 14 days after an order is entered the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.

(4) The Court may not extend the time limited by sub-rule (2) or (3).

(5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.


	
	The jurisdiction under r 50C has recently been considered in two judgments of the Court. In Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152 Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreed) considered a number of cases relevant to the rule and concluded:
	


[28]   By reference to those decided cases, Rule 50C is of limited application with an emphasis on correcting obvious mistakes in language used or results that did not reflect the intention of the Court. Rule 50C has been used:

To correct a slip, being the omission of words to clarify an infelicitous or ambiguous expression. When doing so it was not altering the basis or rationale of the judgment as it was originally intended (R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSW CCA 195; 79 NSWLR 143 at [49].

To overcome agreed difficulties where there was a gap of three months from the conclusion of the notional sentence on a count and the commencement of the notional sentence on the next count and it was appropriate to remedy that slip (R v AB (No 2).

When the Court had not considered a ground of appeal (Baghdadi v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77).

To effect the orders proposed in the reasons for judgment with the correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence (Akkawi, Mark v R; Akkawi, Paul v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72).

To restructure sentences to achieve an aggregate non-parole period which reflected the Court’s intention (KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84).

To correct some minor accidental slips which included the numbering of the orders and some minor changes of wording, neither of which altered the substance of the reasons or the orders made (R v Ly (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 91).


	
	In Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 205 Adams J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said:
	


[39]   Rule 50C does not deal with the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction to reconsider and correct either its orders or its reasoning. It merely deals with the time frame in which such a jurisdiction may be exercised. It does not, in terms, deal with the possibility of reconsideration or variation after the time limits have expired, but reserves the general jurisdiction of the Court in this respect by sub rule (4). In the nature of things, the character and extent of the jurisdiction cannot be the subject of bright line distinctions: it is a matter of fact and degree. The fundamental rule is that there is no jurisdiction to rehear an appeal once determined, even before actual or constructive entry of judgment, though in certain circumstances particular issues might justify reconsideration, as where there is a misapprehension of fact or law, or a ground of appeal, necessary to final disposal of the appeal, has been overlooked or mistakenly not determined or there has been a denial of procedural fairness in the hearing of the appeal. It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of examples but it is clear that there is no jurisdiction to revisit the orders or reasons where the contended misapprehension is merely an assertion that a conclusion made following consideration of the matter by the Court is wrong, let alone where the applicant seeks, in effect, to argue a new ground of appeal. In short, the unsuccessful appellant cannot, in the language of Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; (1993) 176 CLR 300 (quoted above) have a backdoor appeal.

[40]   After judgment has been entered, nothing of substance can be changed, though this still permits changes to orders or reasons where the language of either mistakenly does not reflect the order contemplated by the reasons or the sense of the reasons themselves. It must follow that no second appeal can be had on the merits, still less can a subsequent Court of Criminal Appeal hear such an appeal from an earlier decision of the Court. The mere contention that some error of law or misapprehension of fact has affected the decision is immaterial. If what is sought is, in effect, a rehearing on the merits of a decided appeal by this Court, the only recourse is by way of further appeal, if special leave is granted.

[41]   As a useful guide, any application before the orders are perfected which requires more than a summary consideration and determination of the impugned judgment or order is likely to be outside the scope of the rule.


	
	In the light of those principles we now deal with the four matters raised by the Applicant.
	


(a)   Mistake of law over the Court’s inherent jurisdiction


	
	The mistake of law is said to arise because the Applicant (as he submitted) has always maintained that the Court of Criminal Appeal had jurisdiction to hear all matters. He submitted that the Court, being a division of the Supreme Court of NSW, has power and authority to consider all matters before it.
	
	
	The matter was considered at [44] of the principal decision. The Applicant’s submission is misconceived. No error is demonstrated.
	


(b)   Mistake of fact over the status of the Applicant’s parole consideration


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Court made a mistake of fact in finding that it was the Applicant who had sought deferment of consideration for parole.
	
	
	In the principal judgment the Court made an observation in passing at [55] that the Applicant had changed his approach from earlier persuading the Parole Board to adjourn consideration of his parole to asking for the hearing of the Parole Board to be brought forward. The evidence supported that observation. It was not a material fact but a background fact only in relation to determining the power of this court to issue a criminal justice stay warrant. Whether it is correct or not does not alter the determination made. There is no basis for the assertion of error.
	


(c)   Mistake of law over the rejection of the Applicant’s bail application


	
	The Applicant submitted that the Court acknowledged that any bail application to be considered would be after representations from the Crown and no such representations were before the Court. The Applicant submitted that if that was correct the Court could not decide the Applicant’s bail application, yet it did so.
	
	
	The transcript of the hearing before this Court included the following:
	


HOEBEN CJ at CL: There are also some documents relating to a bail application. Now both of those matters require, Mr Potier, representation by the Crown. The receipt of those documents by the Court was far too late to arrange for such representation.

APPELLANT: I understand entirely, your Honour, of course.

HOEBEN CJ at CL: We therefore will not be dealing with either of those matters today and I would ask you, given your submissions, not to raise those matters. What is likely to happen in relation to the 50C application is that it will be dealt with by the same Court, the same Bench that dealt with the appeal, and that Bench will also deal with any bail application.

APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour. If it is appropriate, may I have your leave briefly, if it is necessary, for to address the reasons as to why a bail application may or may not be relevant to the matters before the Court? I hope it won't, but perhaps I could just say I might need to raise that, with your consent, at later time.

HOEBEN CJ at CL: Well, there is no representation by the Crown.

APPELLANT: No, I understand that entirely.

HOEBEN CJ at CL: And we can't deal with that application today.

APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour.


	
	In the absence of any representation from the Crown the bail application could not be dealt with. The documents lodged by the Applicant for bail had been received too late for such representation to be arranged. The Applicant accepted that that was so and that the bail application could not be dealt with.
	
	
	There was no error in the Court refusing the bail application.
	


(d)   Mistake of law in making findings and/or conclusions on ongoing matters 


	
	The Applicant’s submission, in substance, was that this Court should not have considered the likely success of the Applicant’s r 50C application in respect of the judgment of this Court in Potier v R [2015] NSWCCA 130. To do so, the Applicant submitted, was a misunderstanding of law and created a future prejudice for the Applicant in respect of that other r 50C application.
	
	
	In the principal judgment this Court made it clear at [56] that it had jurisdiction under s 151 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to issue a warrant referred to in that section. The Court had a discretion whether to issue such a warrant. One consideration informing the discretion was whether there was likely to be any alteration to the judgment of this Court given on 3 June 2015. For reasons relying on Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) the Court’s opinion was that the judgment of 3 June 2015 was unlikely to be altered at least in a way that would result in a different outcome. That was a significant factor to be considered from the point of view of the Court’s discretion whether a warrant should be issued under s 151. No error is demonstrated in the approach that the Court took.
	


Conclusion


	
	None of the matters raised in this r 50C application is a matter appropriate to be dealt with under r 50C. The application attempts to re-argue matters already considered in the principal judgment. The application should be refused.

	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: The applicant, Michael Alexander Williamson, seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Frearson SC in the District Court at Sydney on 28 March 2014.
	
	
	An extension of time to apply for leave to appeal is required but it was not opposed by the Crown and should be granted.
	
	
	For four offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, and taking into account his guilt in respect of a further four offences, the learned judge imposed an aggregate sentence of 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years, which was backdated to the day the applicant went into custody (3 March 2014).
	
	
	All of the offences were contrary to provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and occurred whilst the applicant was the General Secretary of the Health Services Union in New South Wales (“the Health Services Union” or “the Union”). The details of the offences and the indicative sentences assessed for each of them are as follows:

	The applicant sought leave to appeal on the following grounds:
	


Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in that he failed to properly identify and quantify the application of the 25% discount available to the appellant in the construction of the sentence pursuant to s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in that he did not apply a 25% discount.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in that he failed to apply s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in that he failed to give effect to his finding of ‘special circumstances’.

Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in the application of general and specific deterrence – particularly in relation to mental health.

Ground 6: The sentencing judge erred in over-stating the seriousness of the offences.

Ground 7: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify the extent to which the applicant’s sentence was reduced on the basis of his assistance, contrary to s 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Ground 8: By reason of a combination of the above grounds, a greater sentence than required by law was imposed upon the applicant.


	
	Grounds 4 and 6 were abandoned at the outset of the hearing of the application. Ground 8 does not require determination, given that the Court's sentencing discretion would be enlivened if any of the preceding grounds were made good: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601.
	


Facts


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the District Court from which I have derived the following.
	
	
	The Health Services Union was funded by the contributions of its members and its role was to provide advice, assistance and advocacy to health professionals, workers in aged care, ambulance officers and workers in the private and public health industry. The applicant held the position of General Secretary from 1995 until 2012. He was the Chief Executive Officer and had charge of the general conduct, administration and business of the Union. He had the capacity to award contracts, to commit the Union to the purchase of goods and services, to employ and remove staff and to award pay rises. He was responsible for the oversight of the finances of the Union and its overall running for the benefit of its members.
	
	
	The applicant had a strong personality, encouraged loyalty and rewarded those who supported him. His authority and decisions were rarely challenged. Over the period during which he was in charge, the remuneration of those who worked in the Union increased to levels significantly above industry standards. His own income increased from $290,757 in 2005 to $513,294 in 2011. A concession was expressed in the agreed facts that his offending did not occur through any financial need on his part.
	


Count 1- Fraudulent Canme Services invoices


	
	Count 1 concerned the submission and payment of invoices for services purportedly provided to the Union by a business registered in the name of Julieanne Williamson, the applicant’s wife: “Canme Services”. The services were said to be the sorting, collating and scanning of old records; a service which was not only not required but not in fact provided. From July 2006 to June 2009 there were 22 payments to this business, each for $15,385. The total sum was $338,470. The cheques were all deposited into the bank account of Canme Services which was in Ms Williamson's name. That bank account received no other deposits aside from the payments made by the Union. A false explanation was later advanced to the effect that Ms Williamson had been working 60 hours per week at home sorting through dusty boxes of old documents.
	
	
	The proceeds of this offence were utilised by the applicant to maintain his family’s lifestyle, including payments on credit cards and for clothing, beauty products and services, mortgage repayments for various properties and private school fees.
	


Count 2 – Publishing false substitute Canme Services invoices


	
	Count 2 was committed in the context of an inquiry the Council of the Union instigated in September 2011 to investigate allegations that had been raised in the media about alleged financial mismanagement of the Union by the applicant. Mr Ian Temby QC and Mr Dennis Robertson FCA were engaged to carry out the inquiry (""the Temby inquiry""). A police investigation also commenced at around the same time.
	
	
	The applicant took a leave of absence but kept in contact with officers of the Union, including the Acting Secretary, Mr Peter Mylan, and the Chief Financial Officer, Mr Barry Gibson. He had access from time to time to the Union office but inveigled others to use their passes to permit him entry so as to conceal his attendance.
	
	
	The Temby inquiry sought documents in relation to the Canme Services payments. Mr Mylan had previously never heard of Canme Services. He had a meeting with the applicant who appeared shaken and uncomfortable when the topic of the inquiry's interest was raised. He asked, ""How do they know about that?"" He sought to persuade Mr Mylan that legitimate services had been provided. He asked Mr Mylan to tell the Temby inquiry that he was aware of this, saying to Mr Mylan, ""You have to do this one mate"". The applicant also told Mr Mylan that he (Mr Mylan) needed to sign off on the invoices authorising the work.
	
	
	In this meeting and in subsequent secret discussions, he also implored Mr Mylan to say and do a variety of other things designed to conceal the applicant’s wrongdoing.
	
	
	Apart from Mr Gibson, who had been unwittingly involved in making the cheque payments to Canme Services, no-one else in the Union was aware of Canme Services and what services it was supposedly providing. In response to a request by the Temby inquiry, Mr Gibson went looking for the Canme Services invoices which were supposed to be filed in the applicant's office but he could not find them. No invoices from other suppliers were found to be missing.
	
	
	A few days later, the applicant produced to Mr Gibson 15 invoices related to Canme Services which aligned with the missing invoices. The applicant asked Mr Gibson to endorse them with the date and cheque number and to apply an “approved” stamp for Mr Mylan to sign. Mr Gibson did as he was asked, later explaining that although he found it highly unusual he did not consider it appropriate to question the decisions or instructions of the applicant. Mr Gibson obtained Mr Mylan's signature on each of the invoices and provided them to the Temby inquiry.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact that the applicant ""created the replacement invoices for the purpose of suggesting to members of the Union, through those appointed to investigate its compliance with its own corporate governance rules, that work had been done in accordance with proper process when that work had not been done or approved in accordance with the proper process"".
	


Form 1 offences (re Count 2) – recruiting another to assist in carrying out criminal activity


	
	Taken into account in the assessment of sentence for Count 2 were two offences of recruiting another to assist in carrying out criminal activity. One involved asking a director of a company that provided IT support to the Union to delete files relating to Canme Services from the applicant's laptop computer so that they would not be forensically traceable. This was in September 2011, the day after an announcement that a police strike force had been formed to investigate matters relating to the Union. The man regarded the applicant as a powerful person who he feared as well as respected. He removed the files but later gave copies to the police. When they were analysed it became apparent that the original Canme Services invoices had been created on the applicant's laptop.
	
	
	A few months later the applicant found that there were still links on his computer to files relating to Canme Services. He again sought assistance from the director of the IT company to get rid of them.
	


Count 3 – defrauding the Union by facilitating the submission of false invoices


	
	In 2005 the applicant and the Union's procurement manager, Ms Cheryl McMillan, met with Mr Alfred Downing, a director of Access Focus Pty Limited. The applicant put a proposal to Mr Downing that the company inflate its invoices to the Union for the printing of the Health Services Union Public Health Award Book from $9 to $20 per book. Secret payments were then to be made to both the applicant and Ms McMillan.
	
	
	Between 2005 and February 2010, the company inflated its invoices as suggested, generally by about 20 to 25 per cent. They were paid by cheques signed by the applicant. Mr Downing retained a portion of the excess for himself and gave the balance in envelopes of cash to Ms McMillan. This occurred on at least 300 separate occasions.
	
	
	The applicant received about $600,000 in cash as a result of this fraudulent activity during the period December 2006 to February 2010.
	


Count 4 and Form 1 (re Count 4) – recruit another to assist in carrying out criminal activity


	
	Count 4, and the first offence on the Form 1 relating to it, involved recruiting John and Carron Gilleland to assist in carrying out criminal activity.
	
	
	Questions were raised during the 1995 election about excessive expenditure on the applicant's credit card. In 1997 he asked Ms McMillan to arrange a meeting with John and Carron Gilleland, directors of Communigraphix Pty Limited which printed a magazine for the Union's membership, ""Health Standard"". The purpose of the meeting was to ask the Gillelands to provide the applicant, Ms McMillan, and later Mr Craig Thomson, with credit cards. Mr and Ms Gilleland were concerned that they might lose the Union business, which was worth around $300,000 per annum, if they did not comply with the request. Accordingly, in 1998, they applied for American Express cards and provided the applicant, Ms McMillan, and later Mr Thomson, with supplementary cards which were used by them through 1998 and 1999.
	
	
	In April 2012 the applicant met with the Gillelands and told them of the police investigation. He gave them specific instructions to get rid of the credit card account statements with the intention of hindering the police investigation. Unbeknown to the applicant, the conversations were being covertly recorded.
	


Form 1 (re Count 4) – recruit another to assist in carrying out criminal activity


	
	Police executed a search warrant at the Union office in Pitt Street, Sydney on 2 May 2012. The applicant's personal assistant rang him. He called his son, Christopher Williamson, and asked him to take a suitcase out of the building past the police. The applicant thought that the police would not know who his son was but the calls were being intercepted.
	
	
	The applicant and his son were found a short time later in a car park attempting to hide the suitcase. It was found to contain an envelope labelled ""Canme"" that contained the fraudulent invoices the subject of Count 2.
	


Personal circumstances of the applicant


	
	The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings but relied upon the tender of a variety of testimonials, reports and other documents. The following is largely drawn from the convenient summary provided in the judge’s sentencing remarks.
	
	
	The applicant was the devoted father of 5 children, most of them adults, borne of the 33 year relationship with his now estranged partner. He came from a strict and fair upbringing in a close and supportive family environment. He retained strong support from his immediate family. The exposure of the present matter had impacted significantly upon them, especially upon the children, two of whom provided testimonials in which they described the profound effect upon the family and the guilt, shame and disappointment expressed by the applicant. Whilst obviously being mindful of sentencing principles concerning hardship to family and third parties (see, for example, R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510), his Honour later said that he would take into account that “there have been very severe impacts upon the family members”.
	
	
	The author of one testimonial said that the applicant had always used his best endeavours to serve the industrial interests of the Union; the judge observing that he had no doubt that the applicant did very good work in this respect. Another testimonial referred to the applicant supporting the rights of the underprivileged; the judge observing that he did not doubt that he was a compassionate man with many other good qualities.
	
	
	The applicant had 43 years of employment within the health industry. He had no previous convictions. The judge said that that he gave the applicant’s otherwise good character “substantial weight”.
	
	
	The applicant told the author of a Pre-Sentence Report that he had no current or historical issues with alcohol or substance abuse but the Community Corrections Officer added that the applicant’s ex-partner ""indicated that the lifestyle [the applicant] became accustomed to invited excessive alcohol consumption”.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report included that the offending was never the product of financial difficulty but that it was motivated by lifestyle, entertainment and a desire to provide better for his family. The judge regarded this as ""nonsense"", given the applicant's legitimate income, and said the ""real motive … was greed"". However, his Honour also noted that the applicant had not denied or sought to excuse his actions but accepted responsibility for them. He noted that the applicant had written a letter of apology to the Union and others who were victims of his offending and stated that he took this into account. He accepted that the applicant was remorseful.
	
	
	In a report by Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, it was recorded that the applicant said that his offending started out of a desire that his children avoid financial hardship, which the applicant had experienced as a child. The judge said this was incongruous, observing again how well paid the applicant had been.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Westmore that he became depressed after the investigations commenced; a matter the judge regarded as relevant to the offences committed in that period. The Pre-Sentence Report mentioned suicidal ideation at this time, adding that such impulses were under control in the context of the strong support the applicant enjoyed. This subject was mentioned in Dr Westmore's report as well and the judge said he would take it into account.
	
	
	Dr Westmore made the psychiatric diagnoses of “Adjustment Disorder with depressed, anxious and labile mood” and “Alcohol abuse (currently in remission)”. The judge noted that the first diagnosis arose because of the matters before the court.
	
	
	Dr Westmore referred to the applicant being “at risk” in gaol. He offered the opinion that he was at a very low to non-existent risk of reoffending.
	
	
	While noting the applicant’s adjustment disorder and depression, the judge said that “there is nothing that mitigates … or explains the offences”. He also found that “there is nothing in his background that … has any real significance in terms of explanation for the offences”. (One of the grounds of appeal is relevant to the manner in which his Honour had regard to the applicant’s mental condition and I will return to it.)
	
	
	Another matter the judge took into account was the applicant’s co-operation in the Union recouping some of its losses:
	


“I have material from Gerald Haynes, the secretary of the HSU, and there is reference to a consent judgment, likely bankruptcy, benefits that ensued to the union regarding the union getting access to the $600,000 in leave entitlements and the $1.1 million of superannuation. I also have a certificate of appointment of bankruptcy trustee.”


	
	The judge found that the applicant had “excellent” prospects of rehabilitation. He was satisfied that the applicant was not likely to reoffend, particularly in a manner akin to the present offences, although he added: “He will probably never occupy such a powerful position again in his life”.
	
	
	Another matter the judge took into account was the applicant’s “public humiliation … because it has had a significant physical and psychological effect”. He also accepted (on the basis of certain material in tab 8 of Exhibit 1 in the proceedings and the applicant’s “fragile mental condition”) that he would experience custodial conditions that would be “significantly more onerous” than usual, even though there was no evidence as to precisely what those conditions might be.
	


Ground 1 – failure to identify and quantify the application of the 25% discount for the pleas of guilty

Ground 2 – failure to apply a 25% discount

Ground 3 – failure to apply s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	These grounds relate to the same contention: that the sentences for each offence should have been, but were not, reduced by 25 per cent on account of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. Such a reduction is at the top of the guideline range indicated in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] (Spigelman CJ). The Crown conceded before the primary judge that such a discount should be allowed.
	
	
	In written submissions under the hand of Mr Agius SC (who did not appear at the hearing of the application), it was acknowledged that the judge had said that he would apply the “full 25% discount for the utilitarian aspect of the pleas of guilty”. However, it was argued that the practical effect of this was not made clear and that the judge had erred in “failing to quantify in the sentence the effect of the 25% discount applied”. It was said to be a logical corollary of the proposition that a percentage discount should be quantified, as his Honour did, that this should be demonstrated by the specification of starting points for the sentences before application of discounts.
	
	
	Reference was made in the written submissions to the “instinctive synthesis” approach to sentencing discussed in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357. It was contended that such an approach should first be applied, followed by the application of a discount for a plea of guilty which “is to be applied, quantified and expressly stated following the determination of an appropriate sentence”.
	
	
	It was also contended that the judge erred by referring at an early stage of his sentencing remarks to the 25 per cent allowance he would make for the pleas of guilty but not referring to it thereafter. This, it was contended, “strongly supports a conclusion that his Honour failed to apply the discount when it came time to fix sentences”.
	
	
	Specifically in relation to ground 3, it was contended (uncontroversially) that s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires that discounts for pleas of guilty are to be reflected in indicative sentences: see R v Cahill [2015] NSWCCA 53 at [107] (Johnson J).
	
	
	Mr Dhanji SC, who made further submissions on behalf of the applicant at the hearing, contended that when the 25 per cent was added back in to the indicative sentences, the results were so awkward as to suggest that the discount had not been applied to them at all. When that exercise is undertaken the starting points for each indicative sentence prior to discounting is as follows:
	



	
		
			 
			
			Indicative sentence
			
			
			Starting point
			
		
		
			
			Count 1
			
			
			4 years
			
			
			5 years 4 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 2
			
			
			2 years 6 months
			
			
			3 years 4 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 3
			
			
			5 years 6 months
			
			
			7 years 4 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 4
			
			
			1 year 8 months
			
			
			2 years 2.67 months
			
		
	



	
	It was submitted that the starting points for each of the sentences were so unlikely that it may well have been the case that the judge had either not applied a discount at all, or had erroneously applied the discount to the aggregate sentence. The latter was said to be a realistic possibility, given that the 7 years 6 months term for the aggregate sentence could well have been derived after application of a 25 per cent discount to a starting point of 10 years.
	
	
	For the Crown it was submitted that the judge was not required to do more than indicate what discount was allowed to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty. It was contended that the indicative sentences had been discounted with, it may be inferred, some rounding to achieve a sensible result. Rounding was encouraged by this Court so as to avoid sentences being expressed in periods of days as well as months and years. Thus, the Crown provided the following analysis:
	



	
		
			 
			
			Indicative sentence
			
			
			Increased by one-third
			
			
			Inferred starting point
			
		
		
			
			Count 1
			
			
			4 years
			
			
			5 years 4 months
			
			
			5 years 6 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 2
			
			
			2 years 6 months
			
			
			3 years 4 months
			
			
			3 years 6 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 3
			
			
			5 years 6 months
			
			
			7 years 4 months
			
			
			7 years 6 months
			
		
		
			
			Count 4
			
			
			1 year 8 months
			
			
			2 years 2.67 months
			
			
			2 years 3 months
			
		
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judgment was delivered some weeks after the sentence hearing. By the time the judge came to recite his reasons and conclusions he had obviously thought about all aspects of the matter. That is implicit in a judgment which has been reserved. Accordingly, I cannot accept the contention in the written submissions that the judge had forgotten about the discount because after announcing that there would be a discount early in his remarks, his Honour did not refer to it again. That submission implicitly relies upon an unrealistic notion that the order in which matters are referred to in the oral delivery of a reserved judgment reflects a process of thinking that is contemporaneous with the announcement of the reasons.
	
	
	The judge said that the applicant ""will receive a 25% discount for the utilitarian aspect of the pleas of guilty"". I am not prepared to do other than to take his Honour at his word. He obviously did not engage in a process of mathematical precision, no doubt heeding what this Court has said to discourage it in cases where sentences have been imposed in terms of years, months and days: see, for example, Rios v R [2012] NSWCCA 8 at [43] (Adamson J) and Akkawi v R; Akkawi v R [2012] NSWCCA 11. In the latter, Simpson J (as her Honour then was) observed:
	


""[101] I add one observation concerning the sentences imposed at first instance. In my opinion, the form of sentencing here undertaken (at first instance) is not to be encouraged. By this I refer to the imposition of sentences composed of years, months and days.

[102] I assume that this was done in order to apply the reduction in sentence of 15% referrable to the pleas of guilty. However, it is conducive to error, both at first instance and on appeal. In my opinion, justice is better achieved by the conventional means of sentencing in round figures. There is nothing in R v Thomson; R v Houlton that requires a mathematical approach of the precision here demonstrated.""


	
	I would reject these grounds.
	


Ground 5 – error in application of general and specific deterrence – particularly in relation to mental health


	
	Despite the statement of the ground including a complaint of error in relation to general deterrence, the written submissions by Mr Agius SC acknowledged that ""in cases such as this there needs to be some regard had for general deterrence"". Those submissions were devoted to a complaint that the judge ""did not take into account the ameliorating influences of the applicant's mental health condition when considering specific deterrence"". However, in oral submissions, Mr Dhanji SC confined the focus of the ground to general deterrence and only in respect of the assessment of sentence for counts 2 and 4.
	
	
	The offences in counts 2 and 4 were committed during the currency of the Temby and police investigations. It was in this period that the applicant began to experience the symptoms of anxiety and depression that gave rise to Dr Westmore's diagnosis of an adjustment disorder. Mr Dhanji accepted that it was open to the judge to find (as he did) that there was ""an absence of causal connection and in that sense moral culpability may not have been diminished"". It was submitted that this still left the question as to whether the applicant was an appropriate vehicle for deterrence of others. His Honour's finding of there being no reduction of moral culpability did not preclude such an outcome.
	
	
	In the course of dealing with this issue, the judge said ""I do not actually see the depression as being significant"". Mr Dhanji submitted that this was best interpreted in its context as a finding in relation to the significance of the depression to the sentencing exercise rather than the extent of the depression itself.
	
	
	The Crown's written submissions noted that his Honour took into account what he described as the applicant's ""fragile mental condition and psychological condition"" in finding special circumstances which brought about a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. In oral submissions it was contended that the findings made by the judge on this issue were open to him and were justified by reference to R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48.
	


Consideration


	
	The judge's reasoning in relation to this issue appears in the following passage from the judgment:
	


“As to the mental condition, that is said to be relevant to counts 2 and 4, in particular, the covering-up offences if I can use that general expression.

This is a problematic area and the consideration varies from case to case. Whatever I say about it it is bound to attract criticism. According to Dr Westmore there is no psychiatric explanation for the offences. There is no psychiatric excuse for the offences. There is nothing that mitigates the gravity of the offences.

I appreciate a mental condition, such as depression, may be relevant regardless of any causal connection with the offences and regardless of whether it constitutes an actual psychiatric condition. One question is whether the mental condition precludes the offender from being fully aware of the consequences of his actions.

The whole point of his actions was to escape liability. There is nothing to suggest that he was not very clearly and fully aware of the consequence of his actions, so the depression cannot be mitigatory in my view in terms of s 21A.

Does it in any way reduce his moral culpability? It does not. On the evidence he fully appreciated the wrongfulness of his actions at all times. It seems to me that general deterrence must have a very substantial part to play because the offender, with considerable deliberation and determination, set out to cover up his crimes and to hinder investigation. I do not actually see the depression as being significant. There may be many public policy reasons why depression that ensues as a consequence of a crime should not be taken into account, but I do not take that view. I simply make the finding that the depression does not significantly diminish responsibility for the crimes and it will not provide any significant amelioration of the sentences in those circumstances.”


	
	The Crown's submissions should be accepted. His Honour approached the issue in the manner discussed by Hunt CJ at CL in the concluding sentence of the following extract from his judgment in R v Wright at 50-51:
	


“It is an accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. In most of the cases in which that principle is applied, the offender has suffered from a significant mental illness or retardation, but such a condition is not a necessary condition for the principle to be applied. Considerations of general (or even personal) deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant, and the significance of the offender’s mental incapacity is to be weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. The reason for the principle is that the interests of society do not require such persons to be punished as severely as persons without that disability because such severity is inappropriate to their circumstances. The full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law which is attributed to the ordinary individual of adult intellectual capacities cannot be expected of a person whose intellectual function is insufficient to have that understanding. The means by which the courts give effect to that principle (as an instrument of social administration) is to moderate the consideration of general deterrence to the circumstances of the particular case. But, if the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and with knowledge of the gravity of his actions, the moderation need not be great.” (Emphasis added, citations omitted)


	
	It was a matter of discretion for the primary judge to determine what weight ought to be given to general deterrence. It is very clear that the judge was aware of the potential ways in which the applicant's mental condition may have affected the assessment of sentence. It is also clear that he gave the matter careful consideration. I am unable to discern error in the manner in which his Honour's discretion was exercised.
	
	
	It must also be observed that the applicant was represented in the District Court by senior and junior counsel who are criminal law specialists who often appear in this Court and are well versed with these types of issues. Submissions, both written and oral, were made and it was not contended at any point that the judge should give less weight to general deterrence on account of the applicant's mental condition.
	
	
	This ground must be rejected.
	


Ground 7 – failure to quantify the extent of reduction of sentence on account of assistance


	
	The focus of this ground was a discrete passage in the sentencing remarks:
	


""I also have tab 16 – I take into account the matters in s 23 of the relevant legislation, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The fact is when I look at all of that material it is of very limited significance. I do take into account in terms of cooperation, but I do not propose to separately quantify any discount.""


	
	Mr Dhanji accepted that it was open to the judge to find that the material was of ""very limited significance"". However, it was contended that having recognised that the material fell within the terms of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour was obliged to quantify a discount, at least in terms of a fixed period of time if not in percentage terms.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji also accepted that the judge had reasoned that the assistance was at a level at which no discount was warranted at all. He maintained, nonetheless, that once the judge “determined that it was within s 23”, s 23(4) operated in mandatory terms requiring his Honour to indicate the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in the absence of assistance.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant's argument under this ground raises quite a discrete point concerning s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which I do not accept. It is clear from the statement by the judge which is quoted above that he had regard to the provisions of s 23 and decided that he would not provide a quantified discount.
	
	
	Section 23 provides that ""a court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted"" etc (s 23(1)). It is not mandatory for a court to do so. Further, ""in deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty"" it must consider certain matters, including “the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance” and ""the nature and extent” of it (s 23(2)(b) and (d)). Then, if a court does impose a lesser penalty on account of assistance, it must say that it is doing so and state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed (s 23(4)).
	
	
	In this case, the judge simply considered whether such assistance as the applicant had provided, or promised to provide, warranted a lesser penalty and decided that it did not.
	
	
	As with the previous ground, it was no part of the applicant's case as presented by very experienced counsel in the court below that a quantified discount should be provided on account of assistance. There was nothing said in counsel’s written submissions and there was no mention made of it in oral submissions. The representative of the Crown referred to the subject and submitted that no discount should be provided. Senior counsel made submissions in reply to the Crown's but did not take issue on that point.
	
	
	This ground is devoid of merit.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	


1.   Extension of time to file notice of application for leave to appeal    against sentence until 7 May 2015 granted.

2.   Leave to appeal granted.

3.   Appeal dismissed.


	
	WILSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J and the orders proposed by him.

2767738,State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Brian James Donovan was arrested on 26 October 2011, and charged with recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon his former de facto partner, contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He pleaded guilty to that offence and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months (reflecting a discount of 25% for his plea). A non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months was fixed, but Mr Donovan was not granted parole. The entirety of Mr Donovan’s sentence expired on 25 July 2015.

The State applied for a continuing detention order pursuant to s 5G of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW), which confers power on the Supreme Court to make orders for the continued detention a class of offenders who have served their sentences of imprisonment in full.

In accordance with the requirements under the Act, a preliminary hearing was held, at which two qualified psychiatrists were appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of Mr Donovan. The Court further ordered that Mr Donovan be subject to an interim detention order for a period of 28 days commencing on the expiry of Mr Donovan’s sentence. A second interim detention order was made by the primary judge when judgment was reserved, and a third was made by the President following the commencement of the State’s appeal. Accordingly, Mr Donovan remained in custody when the appeal was heard, some 7 weeks after the expiry of his sentence. When the appeal was heard, the Court of Appeal renewed the interim detention order pending the determination of the appeal.

At first instance, Mr Donovan accepted that he was a “violent offender” for the purposes of the Act, by reason of his conviction for a serious violence offence. He also conceded that the primary judge was “likely to find that [he] is a ‘high risk violent offender’” for the purposes of the Act, however he opposed the imposition of a continuing detention order, submitting that adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order (which he did not oppose).

The primary judge found that Mr Donovan was a “high risk violent offender” as defined in s 5E(2) of the Act, namely a violent offender who the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability “poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”. However, the primary judge was not persuaded that the extended supervision order proposed by the State in the alternative to a continuing detention order would not provide “adequate supervision” of Mr Donovan, such that the power to make a continuing detention order was not enlivened. Accordingly, her Honour refused to make a continuing detention order, and instead imposed an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years.

The State appealed, submitting that the primary judge (a) erred in her construction of “adequate supervision” in s 5G of the Act, (b) failed to give primacy to the legislative object of the Act, being to ensure the safety and protection of the community, (c) failed to conduct an evaluative judgment of “unacceptable risk”, (d) failed to give reasons for her finding that Mr Donovan is unlikely to re-offend suddenly and catastrophically within days of his release, and (e) failed to give reasons for certain “pivotal” findings of fact.

Held by the Court, dismissing the appeal:

1.  The Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) confers power on the Court of Appeal to renew an interim detention order under s 18C of the Act pending the determination of an appeal: at [7].

2.  An appellate court would not set aside a primary judge’s decision not to make a continuing detention order under s 5G of the Act unless there exists an error, whether of law or fact, on the part of the primary judge: at [16]-[17].

Attorney-General (Qld) v Francis [2006] QCA 324; [2007] 1 Qd R 396; Attorney-General (Qld) v Lawrence [2014] QCA 220; Attorney-General for the State of Queensland v Yeo [2010] QCA 69; Nigro v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2013] VSCA 213; 304 ALR 535; Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575, followed and applied

3.  The phrase “adequate supervision” in s 5G of the Act is not “anchored” to the phrase “unacceptable risk” in s 5E of the Act: at [24], [67]-[71].

4.  Whether an extended supervision order will provide “adequate supervision” is an evaluative judgment to be undertaken by the court according to the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to the objects of the Act: at [72]-[77].

5.  Nothing in the Act displaces the privilege against exposure to a penalty, save for the obligation upon an offender to be examined by two independent experts in s 15(4). No inference adverse to an offender can be drawn in circumstances where the offender’s giving evidence would lead to him or her being cross-examined by the State with a view to eliciting evidence to support a continuing detention order: at [117]-[119].

Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42; 220 CLR 129; MH6 v Mental Health Review Board [2009] VSCA 184; 25 VR 382, applied

Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Boral Resources (Vic) Pty Ltd [2015] HCA 21; 89 ALJR 622, referred to

6.  The primary judge was in a position of considerable advantage to the Court of Appeal in evaluating the weight to be given to competing evidence, such that considerable deference was to be given to the assessment of the primary judge of the evidence: at [125]-[126].

7.  The State failed to demonstrate error in the primary judge’s evaluative judgment, which was undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Act, such that the appeal had to be dismissed: at [129].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The State has appealed, as of right, pursuant to s 22 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act), from a reserved decision of the primary judge delivered eight days before the appeal was heard. The primary judge, McCallum J, refused an application for a continuing detention order pursuant to s 5G of the Act, but made an extended supervision order pursuant to s 5F of the Act: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWSC 1254; [2015] NSWSC 1288.
	
	
	The respondent, Mr Brian James Donovan, has been in prison since his arrest on 26 October 2011 when he was charged with an offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon his former de facto partner, contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He pleaded guilty to that offence and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months (reflecting a discount of 25% for his plea). A non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months was fixed, but Mr Donovan was not granted parole. The entirety of Mr Donovan’s sentence expired on 25 July 2015.
	
	
	The State sought orders detaining Mr Donovan in prison for a further 2 years, not for any crime committed by him, but because the Act authorises, in certain circumstances, the making of “continuing detention orders” to a class of offenders who have served their sentences of imprisonment in full. The Act also authorises the making of “extended supervision orders” which also curtail, but less drastically, the liberty of an offender in the community after he or she has served the entirety of a term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Since 25 July 2015, Mr Donovan has continued to be held in custody pursuant to a series of interim detention orders made under s 18B of the Act. An interim detention order must not exceed 28 days in duration, but may be renewed, so long as the total period of detention does not exceed 3 months: s 18C. There have been three interim detention orders made pursuant to s 18B. The first was made by Schmidt J, on 3 July 2015, for a period of 28 days commencing on the expiry of Mr Donovan’s sentence: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWSC 877. The second was made by the primary judge on 19 August when judgment was reserved. It expired when her Honour’s judgment was given or on 17 September 2015, whichever was earlier (this order was made necessary by reason of the fact that the hearing before her Honour over two days took place only a week before the first interim detention order was to expire).
	
	
	The primary judge was not persuaded that the power to make a continuing detention order against Mr Donovan was enlivened. Instead, her Honour made an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years, which, in large measure, was not opposed. When judgment was delivered, very promptly, on 1 September, the primary judge renewed the interim detention order, pursuant to s 18C, for one further day in order to allow an orderly transition from custody to accommodation pursuant to the extended supervision order: State of New South Wales v Donovan (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1288 at [14].
	
	
	The third interim detention order was made on 2 September 2015 by the President following the commencement of the State’s appeal: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 273. That order expired at noon on 9 September 2015. The President also stayed the operation of the extended supervision order made by the primary judge.
	
	
	This Court renewed the interim detention order, on the State’s application, when the appeal was heard. We were satisfied that there was power to make that order, because in circumstances where the same Act confers both a right of appeal and the power to make interim orders, that power must extend to making interim orders pending the determination of an appeal. We were satisfied that the exercise of the power was appropriate, in circumstances where (a) counsel for the State had forcefully challenged the conclusion of the primary judge that “there [was] no suggestion that [Mr Donovan] is likely to reoffend suddenly and catastrophically” but had not been fully heard prior to the expiry of the existing interim order, and (b) it was apparent that there should be an orderly transition from custody to supervised release, which would not be achieved by releasing Mr Donovan on the afternoon the appeal was heard, with the prospect of his being returned to custody if the State’s appeal succeeded.
	
	
	The Court has afforded the parties an extreme degree of expedition having regard to the importance of the issues at stake, namely, Mr Donovan’s liberty and the safety and protection of the community. We acknowledge at the outset the assistance by way of written submissions provided, with the materials, shortly prior to the hearing of the appeal, in circumstances which reflect a significant amount of urgent work by Ms Sharp and Ms Avery-Williams, who appeared for the State, and Mr Johnston, who appeared for Mr Donovan, and those in the Crown Solicitor’s Office and in the Legal Aid Commission who instructed them.
	


Legislative regime


	
	The Act as originally enacted was confined to “serious sex offenders”. The Minister told the Legislative Assembly that it related “to a handful of high-risk, hard-core offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whilst in prison”. The Minister added:
	


“These concerns are compounded where the offender never qualifies for parole and is released at the end of their sentence totally unsupervised. The bill addresses this problem by allowing this small group of high-risk offenders to be placed on extended supervision, or, in only the very worst cases, kept in custody” New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 29 March 2006.


	
	The operation of the Act was broadened in 2013 by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013 (NSW). The Act now also applies to “violent offenders” who are “high risk violent offenders”. Division 2 of Pt 1A of the Act deals with such offenders. It is in the following terms:
	


“Division 2 High risk violent offenders

5E High risk violent offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order or a high risk violent offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2) An offender is a high risk violent offender if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.

5F Extended supervision orders for high risk violent offenders

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2) An order made under this section is an extended supervision order.

(3) An extended supervision order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk violent offender extended supervision order.

5G Continuing detention orders for high risk violent offenders

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the detention of an offender if the offender is a high risk violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.

(2) An order made under this section is a continuing detention order.

(3) A continuing detention order made under this section may also be referred to as a high risk violent offender continuing detention order.”


	
	It was common ground that Mr Donovan is a “violent offender”, by reason of his conviction for inflicting grievous bodily harm. Mr Donovan has a lengthy history of violence. He has a conviction for rape in 1994. But it was not contended that he would have fallen within the very limited category of serious sex offenders to whom the Act originally applied. The primary judge found, without strenuous opposition from Mr Donovan, that he fell within the relatively new category of “high risk violent offender”. (Although the amendments extending the operation of the Act were made after Mr Donovan’s conviction for inflicting grievous bodily harm, they apply to offences committed before the Act was amended: Sch 2 cl 11.)
	
	
	The finding that Mr Donovan was a “high risk violent offender” turned upon her Honour being satisfied to a high degree of probability that he would pose an “unacceptable risk” of committing a serious violence offence if, at the completion of his total term of sentence, he were not kept under supervision. Her Honour was so satisfied, and there is no appeal from that aspect of her decision. The manner in which the proceeding was conducted meant that it was not necessary for her Honour’s decision to address the different approaches which have been adopted to the meaning of “unacceptable risk”: cf Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152 at [41]-[44]. However, as will be seen below, both at first instance and on appeal the State relied on those approaches in support of its preferred construction of “adequate supervision” in s 5G(1).
	
	
	It is clear that the power to make an order under s 5F or s 5G is conditioned upon an offender being a high risk violent offender. That is to say, the power to make an extended supervision order – “extended” in the sense of extending beyond the term of imprisonment ordered in punishment of the crime – is premised upon the court being satisfied of an unacceptable risk of the offender committing a serious violence offence in the event that the offender is not kept under some degree of supervision. Section 11 authorises the court to attach conditions to an extended supervision order or interim supervision order, and sets out a wide range of possible conditions, including conditions as to reporting, residence, wearing electronic monitoring equipment, and not engaging in specified forms of conduct nor associating with particular people. The width of the power is well illustrated by the order made by the primary judge, to which reference is made later in these reasons.
	
	
	Section 5G goes further. Whereas the power to make an extended supervision order under s 5F is premised upon the court’s satisfaction of an unacceptable risk unless the offender is supervised in some way, the power to make a continuing detention order under s 5G requires the court to be satisfied that “adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order”. Even if so satisfied, s 5G(1) confers a discretionary power upon the Supreme Court to make a continuing detention order (“may, on application under this Act, make an order…”). It is convenient immediately to analyse some aspects of these provisions.
	
	
	First, it was common ground that s 5G(1) conferred a separate discretion upon the court to decline to make a continuing detention order, even if the court were satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. That distinction may be important for the purpose of an appeal. Appellate review of a decision not to make an order because of a failure to be satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order is different from review of a discretionary decision not to make an order even though the court is satisfied of that fact. One is discretionary in the ordinary sense of the word; the other well answers the description given in Norbis v Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518 by Mason and Deane JJ of the application of “a very general standard” which calls for “an overall assessment” in the light of a range of factors. The primary judge squarely rested her decision on not being satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order: see at [112].
	
	
	The State submitted, without reference to authority, that appellate review was to be conducted in accordance with Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531. Mr Donovan helpfully directed the Court to the statement by Keane and Holmes JJA (as their Honours formerly were) and Dutney J in Attorney-General (Qld) v Francis [2006] QCA 324; [2007] 1 Qd R 396 at [34] in respect of cognate legislation:
	


“It is to be emphasised here that the primary judge’s assessment ‘call[s] for value judgments in respect of which there is room for reasonable differences of opinion, no particular opinion being uniquely right’. It follows that it would be wrong for:

‘a court of appeal to set aside a judgment at first instance merely because there exists just such a difference of opinion between the judges on appeal and the judge at first instance. In conformity with the dictates of principled decision-making, it would be wrong to determine the parties’ rights by reference to a mere preference for a different result over that favoured by the judge at first instance, in the absence of error on his part. According to our conception of the appellate process, the existence of an error, whether of law or fact, on the part of the court at first instance is an indispensable condition of a successful appeal.’”


	
	That approach was followed at the appellate level in Attorney-General (Qld) v Lawrence [2014] QCA 220 at [25] and Attorney-General for the State of Queensland v Yeo [2010] QCA 69 at [42]. Those decisions are consistent with Nigro v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2013] VSCA 213; 304 ALR 535 and with the “substantial discretion” to which Gleeson CJ referred in Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575 at [19]. The same approach should apply here. Its principal significance in this appeal is that the primary judge saw the cross-examination of the State’s witnesses, especially Ms McCarroll, who favoured making a continuing detention order, and the independent experts, who did not.
	
	
	Secondly, the Act provides a lengthy list of mandatory relevant considerations in determining whether or not to make either form of order: ss 9(3) and 17(4). It will be necessary to return to these provisions in light of submissions made within ground 7 of the State’s appeal. The open-ended nature of the court’s assessment is confirmed by the fact that those sections also authorise the court to have regard “to any other matter it considers relevant”.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Act requires there to be a “preliminary hearing” on an application for a continuing detention order and obliges the court to make orders appointing at least two qualified psychologists or psychiatrists to conduct examinations of the offender for the purpose of furnishing reports to the court, and directing the offender to attend those examinations: s 15(4). That occurred in this case, and reports (and supplementary reports) were obtained from two forensic psychiatrists, Dr Samson Roberts and Dr Jeremy O’Dea. It was common ground that both men were well qualified to assess the central questions arising on the State’s application. Both men gave evidence before the primary judge.
	
	
	Fourthly, Div 2 of Pt 1A impinges upon the liberty to which an offender who has served his or her term of imprisonment is entitled. It does so in circumstances where “the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability” that “the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”. The premise of the power to curtail the liberty of an offender who has served the whole of the term of imprisonment is presupposed upon a court being very comfortably satisfied that supervision is required to prevent an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.
	
	
	Fifthly, s 5E(3) makes it clear that an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence can be a risk which is less than 50%.
	
	
	Sixthly, there is an important textual distinction between s 5E and s 5G. Section 5E requires the satisfaction of an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. The state of satisfaction required by s 5G(1) is not that there is a risk that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order but rather that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. That is to say, the power in s 5G presupposes an actual state of satisfaction by the Supreme Court not of the risk of something occurring in the uncertain future, but that something (namely, adequate supervision) will not be provided by an extended supervision order in the uncertain future.
	
	
	Seventhly, the onus lies on the State to prove that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.
	
	
	Eighthly, it is important to appreciate the different ways in which s 5E and s 5G operate. The state of satisfaction in s 5E(2) is the gateway to the power to make an order under s 5F or s 5G. That state of satisfaction is at a special level (“to a high degree of probability”), and applies to an assessment of likelihood (“unacceptable risk”) in the absence of any supervision. In contrast, the state of satisfaction in s 5G is at a lower level, and it applies not to any level of supervision, but to the level of supervision provided by the particular extended supervision order the court has in mind. To anticipate what follows, in those circumstances, there is real difficulty in “anchoring” the open-textured language of “adequate supervision” in s 5G(1) with the open-textured language of “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2).
	


Mr Donovan’s background and offending


	
	Mr Donovan had pleaded guilty to recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. The element of recklessness was attributable to the fact that he had been drinking alcohol, heavily, prior to attacking his former partner in his mother’s house. Mr Donovan threatened to kill his former partner, kicked her repeatedly in the jaw, fracturing it, punched her in the eye and stabbed her in the chest with scissors. The appalling nature of Mr Donovan’s behaviour emerges from a statement of agreed facts, which was tendered before the sentencing judge and reproduced in full by the primary judge at [15]:
	


“The Complainant opened the door and walked out onto the verandah, however the Accused grabbed the Complainant’s pony tail and pulled her back into the kitchen. This caused pain to the Complainant’s head and caused her to take about three steps backwards into the kitchen. The Accused shut and locked the door. The Accused said, ‘I’ll bash you if you don’t go back’. The [A]ccused pushed the Complainant with two hands to her chest down into a sitting position on a chair in the dining room. The Complainant pleaded, ‘Don’t hit me.’ The Accused said, ‘Nah, I’m not gonna hit ya.’ The Accused then immediately kicked the Complainant to the chin with his right foot approximately four times. The Complainant thinks she heard something crack in her jaw and felt immediate intense pain in her jaw. The Complainant put her hands up to protect her face and put her head down. The Accused was wearing white joggers whilst he was kicking her. While the Complainant was looking down, the Accused grabbed her by the hair at the back of her head and used her pony tail to face her head up to him and he said, ‘You better look at me or I’m gonna kill you,’ and punched the Complainant to the left eye with his right fist. [The] Complainant said, ‘Stop it, I’m sore in the jaw.’ The Accused said, ‘I’ll make you even worser,’ and punched the Complainant to the left eye area with a closed fist about five or six times. The Accused continued to punch her to the head and at some stage caused a deep laceration to her forehead, above her left eye. The Accused yelled, ‘I’m gonna kill ya’, grabbed a pair of long stainless steel hairdressing scissors from the kitchen table and held them in his fist with the point facing down and rushed at the Complainant, bringing his arm down in a hammer motion, stabbing the Complainant to the chest. The Accused stabbed at the Complainant twice, however only one of the motions penetrated the Complainant’s clothing, and caused a minor puncture wound to the Complainant’s chest, just above her right breast.”


	
	Mr Donovan said that he could not remember what he had done because of his state of intoxication. The offence took place when Mr Donovan had been released from prison on parole under a program of home monitoring. At the time of his crime, he was some 10 weeks into that program.
	
	
	It was for that offence that Mr Donovan was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months (reflecting a starting point of 5 years). The maximum sentence was 10 years’ imprisonment. There appears to have been no Crown appeal.
	
	
	Mr Donovan is now 45 years old, and has been in gaol for most of his adult life. The primary judge recorded that he had been born in Kempsey, and had lived as a child in Grafton in social housing. He had a supportive family. His father, who died in 2013, was a drug and alcohol counsellor within the local Aboriginal community. His mother gave evidence that she would like to have Mr Donovan live with her. Mr Donovan has two adult children with whom he has had little involvement.
	
	
	The State was critical of the lack of attention given by the primary judge to Mr Donovan’s past offending, and its seriousness. As noted above, her Honour reproduced the entirety of the agreed facts relating to his most recent offence. In light of the State’s criticism, it is appropriate to reproduce what her Honour said of Mr Donovan’s criminal history at [20]-[23]:
	


“Mr Donovan left school halfway through year 10. His schooling had been subject to several periods of suspension, including when he was sent to a boys’ home in 1983. After leaving school, he was not able to obtain fulltime permanent employment and evidently has a long history of unemployment.

Mr Donovan came to the attention of the criminal justice system at the age of 14. He was first convicted for acts of violence in 1987 when he was aged 17. On that occasion, he was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault of a sexual nature and two counts of assault. He was first incarcerated in 1988.

Since turning 18, Mr Donovan has been convicted of 11 violent offences in New South Wales and in Queensland, ranging from common assault to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm (the index offence). Some of the offences involved the use of weapons. He has also been convicted of rape in Queensland. Mr Donovan has a history of domestic violence offences.

Mr Donovan also has a history of failing to comply with conditions of supervision. Due to repeated breaches of good behaviour bonds, he was re-sentenced for a number of offences between 1988 and 2010. He has failed to comply with conditions of bail and parole largely by failing to report and to abstain from alcohol.”


	
	The State advanced very detailed submissions as to Mr Donovan’s criminal background (some 14 pages of written submissions at first instance), and submitted on appeal that aspects of his criminality had been insufficiently recognised by the primary judge. It will be necessary to return to this below.
	
	
	The primary judge summarised the links between Mr Donovan’s criminality and alcohol and drugs as follows at [24]-[26]:
	


“Mr Donovan has a significant history of alcohol and drug use. He has been using alcohol since age 12 and cannabis since age 13. His usage escalated and he began using heroin and cocaine at the age of 20. Several previous residential rehabilitation programs have been unsuccessful. Substance abuse (both alcohol and illicit drugs) is linked to much of his violent offending. However, Mr Donovan told Dr Roberts, one of the court-appointed psychologists, that he had been involved in 15 to 20 physical altercations where he had been unaffected by alcohol although he claims not to have initiated any of them. Mr Donovan also acknowledged to Dr Roberts a propensity to aggression even when unaffected by alcohol. Mr Donovan has spent periods of remand at Namatjira Haven and [Benelong's] Haven, undertaking counselling and an alcohol rehabilitation program during 1987 and 1988 but he did not successfully complete these programs. While in custody, he has undertaken treatment for alcohol and drug issues but did not successfully complete all programs. Mr Donovan has continued to use drugs in custody (even during treatment programs) and it was submitted by the State that he did not develop any real insight into his need to better regulate his emotions and avoid problematic alcohol and drug use in the future.

While on remand, Mr Donovan committed further offences while intoxicated and continued to drink and use cannabis. As a condition of a suspended sentence he received in 2009, Mr Donovan was directed to partake in a residential rehabilitation program. He refused to do [so]. During 2013 and 2014, he commenced the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program in John Morony Correctional Centre but was discharged in August 2014 for his ongoing drug use.

Mr Donovan has incurred several institutional misconduct charges whilst imprisoned. He has been sanctioned for assault and intimidation in custody. There is also evidence of two episodes of sexual misconduct in Queensland while in custody.”

Evidence before the primary judge


	
	The primary judge addressed the construction of the Act at [37]-[56], to which it will be necessary to return having regard to some of the State’s grounds of appeal. It is sufficient here to note that the primary judge rejected the State’s submission to read additional elements into the statutory language of “adequate supervision”, such that a continuing detention order must be made unless extended supervision would “eliminate or substantially reduce the unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence”.
	
	
	Her Honour then summarised a great deal of the evidence under the heading “Evaluation of the risk posed by Mr Donovan” at [57]-[89]. Most of those paragraphs were directed to the State’s evidence to the effect that an extended supervision order would not provide adequate supervision. It is not necessary to summarise their detail. Her Honour then turned to the evidence given by Drs Roberts and O’Dea. Both dealt squarely with the need for Mr Donovan to remain abstinent from alcohol if he were released. Both accepted that Mr Donovan would highly likely re-offend if he became intoxicated with alcohol or some other drug. Central to the opinions of both men was the fact that Mr Donovan could be prescribed medication to facilitate abstinence. Both addressed the difficulty that Mr Donovan was contraindicated for Antabuse, because of a heart condition. They gave evidence about alternative prescriptions, and about managing the risk posed by the contraindication.
	
	
	The substance of her Honour’s summary of the expert evidence provided pursuant to the Act was as follows (at [92]-[101]):
	


“Dr Roberts offered a dire assessment of Mr Donovan’s prospects of remaining abstinent from alcohol upon his release but noted that Mr Donovan has never been prescribed medication to facilitate abstinence. He recorded that Mr Donovan acknowledged that he would not ‘last too long’ in the community if he resumed drinking alcohol. He said:

[Mr Donovan] spoke of the problematic influence of associating with heavy drinkers and raised the prospect of rationing his alcohol consumption if he were to drink at home only. He then went on to acknowledge that this may be practical in the short term but inevitably a girl would coerce him into town or down to the riverbank and he would, in all probability, find himself back in a problematic situation. Notwithstanding his apparent insight, it has previously been documented that Mr Donovan’s claims to support management of his substance use in the community are very limited and his motivation to address this risk factor has been called into doubt.

Dr Roberts was cross-examined as to whether those remarks indicated that Mr Donovan was not taking responsibility for his actions. Dr Roberts responded (T58):

That is a way of looking at it, yes. In an ideal world he would refuse the propositions and stay at home and not drink and remain safe, but he’s acknowledging his frailty in this regard and his vulnerability and whether it’s a demonstration of his decision to abrogate responsibility or his vulnerability to have been taken over by his natural urges. It nevertheless leaves him vulnerable to getting into trouble.

At the time of his assessment, Dr Roberts expressed the view (without having any psychometric assessments available to him) that Mr Donovan’s presentation at interview indicated cognitive impairment. He had not then seen Mr Ardasinski’s psychometric assessments. Upon being told of those assessments, he accepted that Mr Donovan may not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. In my view, it was nonetheless clear that the doctor did identify a degree of poor functioning, which would hardly be surprising given Mr Donovan’s history of alcohol abuse.

Dr Roberts concluded that individualised therapy programmes could not reliably be expected to yield a useful outcome for Mr Donovan and that pharmacological treatment and behavioural management approaches ‘would form the mainstay of treatment’. He concluded his report with the following opinion:

Having regard for the totality of the available information regarding Mr Donovan’s history, the prospect of him maintaining abstinence from substances, in particular alcohol, in the community would seem negligible. The prospect of him successfully completing a drug and alcohol treatment programme in the community would seem equally poor. The value of compelling his participation in drug and alcohol programmes in custody, if he were to be subject to a continuing detention order, would be limited and, from a psychiatric perspective, would not be expected to alter his risk of relapse when ultimately released to the community.

Dr Roberts indicated that that opinion was only in part based on his initial view as to Mr Donovan’s suffering a cognitive impairment.

Dr Roberts impressed as a careful and intelligent expert. I accept his opinion on that issue. His evidence establishes a substantial prospect that a continuing detention order would not have the rehabilitative effect hoped for by Corrective Services and might ultimately prove to have served no purpose other than temporary prevention.

Dr Roberts’ report answered a series of specific questions posed. He considered that, in the absence of intoxication, Mr Donovan’s risk of engaging in a further serious violence offence is low to moderate. He said:

Use of alcohol would place him at almost certain risk of a further serious violence offence in response to perceived antagonism or overt confrontation.

Dr Roberts reiterated his suggestion that the daily administration of Antabuse (a drug which operates by creating an allergy to alcohol) would represent an approach that would have the greatest potential of supporting enduring abstinence.

Dr Roberts was specifically asked, if he thought Mr Donovan posed a risk of committing a serious violence offence that could not be managed in the community, to express a view as to the appropriate duration of a continuing detention order. He said:

If it is considered that the recommendations documented above cannot reasonably be implemented in the community, the prospect of Mr Donovan avoiding a future serious violence offence is poor. I am of the opinion that a further period of incarceration will not mitigate Mr Donovan’s risk when he is released in the future.

Dr O’Dea was equally emphatic as to the clear correlation between Mr Donovan’s alcohol abuse and the risk of his committing a serious violence offence; he was also equally pessimistic as to Mr Donovan’s prospects of remaining abstinent. However, like Dr Roberts, Dr O’Dea considered the best prospect of rehabilitation for Mr Donovan to be a residential rehabilitation programme in the community (para 84 of his report). Dr O’Dea had considerable concerns as to Mr Donovan’s ability to remain abstinent in the longer term and considered that, if he did not, he would be ‘difficult to manage adequately and appropriately with this risk in the community in the longer term’ (T73). Even so, he remained firm in the view that treatment in the community (rather than the custody-based [Violent Offenders' Treatment Programme (VOTP)]) was the most appropriate next step (T78). In particular, based on his review of the empirical research, he was not persuaded as to the likely efficacy of the VOTP.”


	
	The State was critical of the focus given in these paragraphs to the poor prospects of rehabilitation of Mr Donovan in prison. The State submitted that the primary object of the Act was the safety and protection of the community, not the rehabilitation of the offender. However, the summary given by the primary judge in these paragraphs reflected the fact that both independent experts focussed on rehabilitation.
	


The dispositive reasoning of the primary judge


	
	Her Honour gave careful consideration to whether the State had established that an extended supervision order would not provide adequate supervision at [102]-[112]. Most of the grounds of appeal challenge aspects of that reasoning, which in its entirety was as follows:
	


“It is clear enough that, if Mr Donovan were to return to his former drinking habits and lifestyle, he would probably pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. However, while there is plainly considerable ground for concern as to his real prospects of remaining abstinent, there is no suggestion that he is likely to re-offend suddenly and catastrophically within days of his release. As persuasively argued by Mr Johnston, if Mr Donovan slides back towards old ways, the supervision provided by the proposed extended supervision order will afford ample opportunity and occasion for appropriate reaction and intervention. Although there is ample evidence that Mr Donovan has failed to comply with conditions of supervision in the past, he has not previously been afforded the opportunity for such a high measure of structured support and supervision. The State’s submissions appeared to equate the risk of any lapse in rehabilitation with a risk of serious violence. In my view, the nature of the risk posed by this offender warrants a more sanguine approach.

The two independent experts appointed by the Court were jointly of the view that the custody-based treatment proposed by Corrective Services is unlikely to provide any better result than community-based rehabilitation. The empirical research relied upon by Ms Matsuo does not provide a basis for any different conclusion. The evidence of the psychiatrists has persuaded me that community-based rehabilitation is the preferable option for Mr Donovan.

The critical question is whether, in face of the risk of a lapse in that rehabilitation, the proposed extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision.

I am persuaded that it will. I return in that context to the question of motivation. It is recognised by Corrective Services that Mr Donovan is poorly motivated to undertake the VOTP in circumstances where that treatment was offered to him for the first time at a point when he could not complete it without consenting to stay in gaol beyond the term of his punitive sentence. That is hardly surprising. Unsurprisingly, Mr Donovan gets depressed in gaol. Mr Ardasinski’s opinion as to Mr Donovan’s poor motivation focussed on his motivation to complete the VOTP in custody (para 39 of his affidavit). The solution proposed by Corrective Services is to keep Mr Donovan in gaol even longer than the time required to undertake the VOTP so as to give him ‘motivational counselling’. I have no doubt as to the sincerity of that proposal but I do not think it is realistic.

As submitted by Mr Johnston, it does not follow from the fact that he is poorly motivated in custody that he is opposed to engaging with rehabilitation in the community – in fact he has said the opposite (para 39 of Mr Ardasinski’s affidavit).

Ms Sharp submitted that the Court could not accept that Mr Donovan is motivated to rehabilitate himself, since he did not give evidence. That submission must be assessed in the context that the State bears the onus on this application but, more importantly, it is doubtful whether such evidence would have assisted the Court to evaluate the likely future course of any rehabilitation. Inevitably, had he given evidence, Mr Donovan would have claimed to be highly motivated to do anything that will see him get out of gaol. Inevitably, in light of his past record of non-compliance, that claim would have been discredited in cross-examination. So much may be assumed. I think the Act contemplates that the Court will be better assisted on such issues by the several experts whose evidence forms part of the mandatory considerations under s 17(4), particularly the independent court-appointed experts.

I accept that well-qualified experts employed by Corrective Services have given careful consideration to the intractable problem posed by Mr Donovan’s addiction and its correlation with his propensity for violence. What I think is missing from their proposal is that it wholly overlooks the demoralising impact on Mr Donovan of being in custody. That is the issue which I venture to think has been more astutely assessed by the two independent experts.

It may well be that community-based rehabilitation will not be successful for Mr Donovan. This case offers no perfect or neat solution. But if rehabilitation fails, I am satisfied that there will be adequate supervision to detect the lapse in a timely way and react appropriately.

It is important in that context to consider the support offered to Mr Donovan by a non-government organisation, Tribal Dreaming, which offers a service to Aboriginal men who are released from gaol. Tribal Dreaming has assessed Mr Donovan to be eligible for its services. Its case workers are familiar with extended supervision orders and work in cooperation with Corrective Services. Its resources may be limited. I accept, as emphasised by Ms Sharp, that it will not be possible for any case officer to ‘shadow’ Mr Donovan but Tribal Dreaming plainly offers an important complement to the limited community-based intensive treatment made possible by the constrained resources of Corrective Services.

I do not think it is necessary for Mr Donovan to be ‘shadowed’ in order for there to be adequate supervision. As already noted, that is a view which equates the risk of his having a lapse in rehabilitation with the risk of serious offending, as if any lapse would inevitably produce a catastrophic result.

I am not satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. It follows that I must refuse to make a continuing detention order.”

The extended supervision order made by the primary judge


	
	The primary judge imposed an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years commencing 2 September 2015. The order involved some 49 numbered obligations, many of which turned upon the discretion of a Departmental Supervising Officer or “DSO”. These conditions are annexed to these reasons. The obligations imposed included the following.
	
	
	Electronic monitoring: Mr Donovan must wear electronic monitoring equipment as directed by his DSO. This equipment consists of a securely fitted anklet, known as a “Tracker”, which identifies its wearer’s location using radiofrequency global positioning system and global system for mobile technologies. The system is programed to send an alert to the “external and electronic monitoring group within Corrective Services NSW in the event that an offender leaves the designated premises during a period of curfew or otherwise than in accordance with a nominated scheduled movement”. There was evidence that if Mr Donovan attempted to remove the anklet, it would be detected.
	
	
	Schedule of movements: Mr Donovan must provide if asked a weekly plan of his movements three days before it is due to start, must give 24 hours’ notice of any change in the schedule of movements and must not deviate from that schedule except in an emergency.
	
	
	Accommodation: Mr Donovan must live at an approved address and must be at that approved address between 9 pm and 6 am each day unless some other arrangement is approved by his DSO. Mr Donovan must not permit any other person to enter and remain, or stay overnight, at that address without the DSO’s prior approval.
	
	
	Drugs and alcohol: Mr Donovan must not possess or use alcohol or illegal drugs or prescription medication other than as prescribed, must submit to drug and alcohol testing as directed by the DSO, must not enter any licensed premises without the DSO’s approval, and must attend and participate in programs and courses for drug and alcohol rehabilitation as directed by the DSO. He must not discharge himself from such programs and courses without the prior approval of the DSO. He must not associate with people who are consuming or are under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. If Mr Donovan starts a relationship, he is required to tell his DSO, who in turn may wish to tell that person about Mr Donovan’s criminal history.
	
	
	Weapons:  Mr Donovan must not possess or use any firearm, and must not carry on his person at any time after leaving his residence any knife, scissors or stabbing instrument without reasonable excuse.
	
	
	Communications: Mr Donovan must give his DSO a list of all communication devices, including phones, tablets, and computers, must obey any reasonable directions about the use of that equipment, and must authorise his telephone and internet service providers to share information with his DSO about his accounts.
	
	
	Search and seizure: Mr Donovan must submit to a wide range of searches and inspections of his body and premises by his DSO and must allow his DSO to seize anything which, inter alia, the DSO reasonably expects will compromise his compliance with the extended supervision orders or which his DSO reasonably suspects relates to behaviour or conduct associated with an increased risk of committing a serious offence.
	
	
	Appearance:  Mr Donovan must not change his name, or use any other name, must not change his appearance without the approval of his DSO, and must let Corrective Services photograph him.
	
	
	Medical intervention: Mr Donovan must advise his DSO of any healthcare practitioners that he consults and agree to those practitioners sharing information, including reports on his progress and information he has told them, with each other and with his DSO. That information is to be shared between all agencies involved in his supervision. If Mr Donovan ceases to take medication he is to notify the DSO within 24 hours.
	
	
	Obviously enough, the regime imposed by the primary judge over the next five years very considerably curtails Mr Donovan’s liberty and privacy. In large measure, the extent to which his liberty and privacy will be curtailed will depend upon decisions made by the DSO. Given the lengthy term of the order, it is appropriate that there be a measure of discretion.
	
	
	The regime has three other important features. Section 12 of the Act provides that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of an extended supervision order is guilty of an offence, whose maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years or 500 penalty units, or both. Moreover, a person who is found guilty of an offence under s 12 becomes a “supervised violent offender” and may be made subject to a further application for a continuing detention order pursuant to s 13C. Finally, Div 3A confers power upon the court to make “emergency detention orders” for the detention of an offender who is the subject of an extended supervision order, or an interim supervision order, who, because of altered circumstances, cannot be provided with adequate supervision, and who, without adequate supervision, poses an imminent risk of committing a serious offence.
	
	
	We turn to the grounds of the State’s appeal.
	


Ground 1 – construction of “adequate supervision”


	
	We address the three aspects of this ground of appeal in the order they were advanced by the State. The first was that her Honour had misapprehended the State’s submissions, the second was that her Honour erred in relying on the principle of legality in construing the Act, and the third (and most important) was that her Honour erred in failing to adopt the State’s construction of “adequate supervision”.
	
	
	The first aspect was that the primary judge misapprehended the submissions made on the construction of s 5G(1). The State claimed that this was apparent from the fact that her Honour, after dealing with (and rejecting) one formulation advanced by the State, turned, at [56], to what was described as “another formulation” contended for by the State. The criticism is unfounded.
	
	
	In writing, the State criticised her Honour’s identification of the State’s submission at [41] which was as follows:
	


“It was submitted by reference to that rule of construction that the word ‘adequate’ must be construed by reference to the primary object of the Act stated in s 3(1), to ‘ensure the safety and protection of the community’. It was submitted that safety is ensured where the risk is eliminated or at least substantially reduced. On that basis, it was submitted that adequate supervision must mean supervision ‘adequate to eliminate or at least substantially reduce the unacceptable risk that the offender will re-offend’. To that formulation there must, in my view, at least be added the qualification ‘by committing a serious violence offence’.”


	
	However, that paragraph was an accurate (indeed near verbatim) synopsis of paragraph 38 of the State’s written submissions at first instance dated 30 July 2015, which was as follows:
	


“Accordingly, the word ‘adequate’ must be construed by reference to the primary object of the Act which is stated in s 3(1) as being to ‘ensure the safety and protection of the community’. Safety is ensured where the risk is eliminated or at least substantially reduced. Accordingly, it is submitted that adequate supervision must mean supervision adequate to eliminate or at least substantially reduce the unacceptable risk that the offender will re-offend.” 


	
	It became obvious that the State has varied its approach to construction. This was most obvious in respect of the submissions advanced on the meaning of “unacceptable risk”. At first instance, the State’s submission was that “[t]he approach by Hoeben J [sic] [in Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152] (adopting R A Hulme J in Thomas) accords with the State’s submission as to the correct construction of the phrase” (Black 11T). The State added that “[a] balancing exercise of the sort contemplated by Davies J [in Attorney General of New South Wales v McGuire [2013] NSWSC 1862] is accordingly not within the intendment of the Act” (Black 12E). Mr Donovan at first instance accepted that it was likely that the Court would find that he was a “high risk violent offender” and noted that accordingly it would not be necessary for the court to resolve the differences recorded by Hoeben CJ at CL in McGuire, although it was “conceded that the approach of R A Hulme J in State of NSW v Thomas, preferred by Hoeben J [sic], is more consistent with the scheme of the Act” (Black 73F).
	
	
	Unsurprisingly, given the absence of any issue, her Honour did not analyse the competing constructions of “unacceptable risk” in s 5E(2).
	
	
	On appeal, the State adopted a different stance. The State contended that “a balancing exercise should be conducted, but not quite the one identified by Davies J” (transcript, 9 September 2015, p 25). It brought to the Court’s attention the most recent decision on “unacceptable risk”, State of New South Wales v Mackey (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1153, where (different) counsel appearing for the State had submitted that the approach adopted by RA Hulme J and Hoeben CJ at CL be followed. There followed this exchange:
	


“BEAZLEY P: But you’re asking us not to follow that line of authority?

SHARP: Yes, I’m asking your Honours to follow the balancing exercise but not to take into account that third factor ...”


	
	The foregoing is relevant not merely to demonstrate that at different times in this litigation the State has advanced differently formulated constructions, and that the criticism made of the primary judge’s reasons at [41], which after all merely identified one way in which the State advanced its case – in a way that was scrupulously accurate – was unfounded. It also bears upon whether this Court should attempt to resolve the divergent decisions at first instance in circumstances where the issue arises at best peripherally.
	
	
	The second aspect of this ground was the State’s criticism of reliance by the primary judge on the (so-called) principle of legality (at [52]-[55]). There is no occasion in this urgently expedited judgment to explore the limitations of some uses of this “principle”; cf Independent Commission Against Corruption v Cunneen [2015] HCA 14; 89 ALJR 475 at [88]. It is sufficient to proceed on the basis that an offender’s right to personal liberty after completing the term of imprisonment for which he or she has been sentenced was accurately described as “the most elementary and important of all common law rights”, which “cannot be impaired or taken away without lawful authority and then only to the extent and for the time which the law prescribes”: Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 292, a passage cited by the primary judge.
	
	
	Against this, it was submitted that her Honour failed to have regard to what had been said in Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [44], where this Court said that the “presumption is weakened in the present context and would not prevail over the clear and explicit language of the statute with its clearly stated protective and rehabilitating objects”. There are at least four difficulties with this submission.
	
	
	The first is that the passage in Tillman has been taken out of context. The question considered in Tillman was whether interim relief should be ordered. The Court expressly referred to the limitations in the Act confining interim orders to a 28 day maximum with no more than 3 months in total: at [44]. The succeeding paragraphs likewise referred to interim applications in terms (see [45] and [46]). Tillman is not to be read as saying that the principle of legality has no operation when a power to detain a person for a period of two years is being construed.
	
	
	The second is that it is one thing for the clearly worded statements of protection of the community on an interim basis to override a fundamental right such as the liberty of a subject. But the ultimate question in this appeal is whether the primary judge erred in failing to be satisfied that adequate supervision would not be provided by the 5 year extended supervision order in fact imposed. The open-textured word “adequate” is an unlikely candidate for the requisite “clear and explicit language”. Although the context was very different, in Goodman v Windeyer (1980) 144 CLR 490 at 502, Gibbs J said that “the words ‘adequate’ and ‘proper’ are always relative. There are no fixed standards, and the court is left to form opinions upon the basis of its own general knowledge and experience of current social conditions and standards”. That passage was repeated in Singer v Berghouse (1994) 181 CLR 201 at 211 and in Vigolo v Bostin [2005] HCA 11; 221 CLR 191 at [74].
	
	
	The third is that the State’s submission is contrary to appellate authority on cognate legislation, including Nigro v Secretary to the Department of Justice [2013] VSCA 213; 304 ALR 535 at [68].
	
	
	The fourth is that in any event the primary judge addressed the State’s submission squarely, and rejected it. Her Honour said at [56]:
	


“Another formulation of the correct approach contended for by the Crown was that the phrase ‘adequate supervision’ means supervision that is adequate to reduce the unacceptable risk to one that is acceptable. That analysis finds some support in the remarks of Adamson J (set out above) and is an unexceptionable statement, as far as it goes. However, it is an approach that may provide false comfort. If that were the task, it would still be necessary for the Court to undertake the evaluative judgment as to what is an acceptable risk in any particular case having regard to the objects of the Act. For those reasons, upon analysis, in my view the search for finer precision of the task posed by the statute should be resisted. Whether an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision is an evaluative judgement to be undertaken by the Court according to the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to the objects stated in s 3 of the Act, giving primacy to the object stated in s 3(1).”


	
	That paragraph is to be read with what her Honour said at [63]:
	


“An evaluation of the kind and degree of risk posed must be informed by a consideration of the risk factors set out in detail at paras 71 and 72 of Mr Ardasinski’s report. Those factors must also inform the assessment as to whether an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision.”


	
	The State accepted that the second passage at [63] accurately encapsulated the statutory test (its complaint was that “her Honour didn’t go on to evaluate the kind and degree of risk”: transcript, 9 September 2015, p 18, and see ground 2), but maintained that the first passage at [56] did not.
	
	
	We turn now to the State’s principal submission within this ground of appeal. It had two strands. It was put that “supervision can only be regarded as ‘adequate’ if it is effective to reduce the risk of serious violent offending such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk” (emphasis in original). The State added “[i]n other words, the supervisory framework must bring the risk within an acceptable level in order to tolerate the offender being in the community”.
	
	
	It was also repeatedly said that the State’s construction “anchored” “adequate supervision” with “unacceptable risk”, which was the occasion for this Court to resolve the conflicting decisions on “unacceptable risk”. Hence the following exchange:
	


“LEEMING JA: You draw to our attention this divergence in authority on unacceptable risk in other [cases] and ask us to resolve it, in an urgent appeal where her Honour found unacceptable risk, and there was no challenge about that, and you ask us to resolve that because you say that in order to construe adequate supervision in 5G we’d have to go back to unacceptable risk?

SHARP: Yes.”


	
	Both strands of the State’s principal submission on construction should be rejected. We deal with them in reverse order.
	
	
	Ordinary principles of construction confirm that “adequate supervision” is not “anchored” to “unacceptable risk” in the way submitted. Both terms entail evaluative judgments, but they serve different purposes and operate in different ways.
	
	
	It has already been observed that a different level of satisfaction is required by s 5E than is required by s 5G, that s 5E refers to the absence of any extended supervision while s 5G refers to the particular extended supervision order, that s 5G requires the State to establish the absence of a particular state of affairs (“adequate supervision”) while s 5E requires the State to establish merely a risk of a particular state of affairs. Those are strong textual indications that the words are not “anchored” together in the way submitted by the State.
	
	
	Further, the State’s submission is inconsistent with the discretionary aspect flowing from the opening words of s 5G (“The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order ...”). The substance of the State’s submission was that a continuing detention order must be made unless there ceased to be an unacceptable risk, because that risk had been eliminated or substantially reduced by reason of the adequate supervision afforded by the extended supervision order. That submission cannot stand with the undoubted discretion to make an order. (The likelihood or unlikelihood of the discretion being exercised matters not for present purposes; the point is that its presence undercuts the State’s submission.)
	
	
	We turn to the challenge to the rejection by the primary judge of the State’s submissions which were directed to imposing a gloss on open-textured statutory language, to the effect that “adequate supervision” would eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of serious violent offending.
	
	
	Asking whether an extended supervision order eliminates or substantially reduces an unacceptable risk provides limited assistance in answering the question whether such an order affords “adequate supervision”. It does not assist to replace one open-textured term “adequate supervision” by two (“substantial” and “unacceptable”). There is no textual basis for doing so, once it is appreciated that the “unacceptable risk” in s 5E is the risk of a serious violence offence were there no supervision at all, while the “adequate supervision” in s 5G turns on an assessment of the particular extended supervision order which is proposed.
	
	
	Another way of refuting the State’s submission is to observe that it sought to give legal meaning to “adequate supervision” by reference to other open-textured terms: “substantially reduce” what would otherwise have been an “unacceptable risk”. This Act is replete with definitions which interact with each other (notably, the definitions of “violent offender”, “high risk violent offender” and “extended supervision order”). However, the Act has also introduced two important undefined concepts, “unacceptable risk” and “adequate supervision”, into the key provisions. They are concepts which are apt to involve a wide-ranging evaluative assessment. It is unlikely in the extreme that there is the neat relationship between those two concepts posited by the State’s construction. If there were, why did not this carefully drafted Act simply say so?
	
	
	Her Honour was, with respect, correct to reject the State’s submissions on construction. The Act takes the intractable problem of an offender who has served his or her term of imprisonment but of whom there are fears of re-offending, and casts responsibility on the courts to determine whether supervision extending into his or her period of liberty will provide “adequate supervision”. By using such language in the context of this Act, the Legislature is to be taken to be leaving it to the courts to make an evaluative assessment. It should be applied in its terms.
	
	
	That said, the question of adequate supervision will involve a consideration of the likelihood of any offending conduct during the period of supervision, and, if so, its likely gravity. So to do is, as the primary judge recognised, in accordance with the primary purpose of the Act, being the safety and protection of the community.
	
	
	In short, we agree with the statement of principle by the primary judge at [56]:
	


“Whether an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision is an evaluative judgement to be undertaken by the Court according to the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to the objects stated in s 3 of the Act, giving primacy to the object stated in s 3(1).”


	
	Finally, once it is appreciated that “adequate supervision” is not “anchored” to “unacceptable risk” in the way in which the State contended, there is no occasion in this appeal, given its urgency, and the different approaches adopted by the State at first instance and on appeal, to express any views on the divergence of approach as to “unacceptable risk” in s 5E.
	


Ground 3 – failure to give primacy to the legislative object


	
	The State submits, by ground 3 of its appeal, that the primary judge failed to give primacy to the legislative object in s 3(1). Section 3 of the Act provides:
	


“(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2) Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The Act is to be construed in accordance with its text and so as to promote its purpose or objects. That said, the State, properly, conceded that s 3(1) cannot mean literally what it says, for there will always be some level of risk to the safety and protection of the community.
	
	
	There is no basis for construing the general object expressed in s 3(1) to impact upon the finely calibrated language in Div 2 of Pt 1A. The position resembles that to which Gleeson CJ referred in Carr v Western Australia [2007] HCA 47; 232 CLR 138 at [6]:
	


“[T]he underlying purpose of an Income Tax Assessment Act is to raise revenue for government. No one would seriously suggest that s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act has the result that all federal income tax legislation is to be construed so as to advance that purpose.”


	
	In Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union v Mammoet Australia Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 36; 248 CLR 619 at [40] it was said, by reference to Carr, that:
	


“That general rule of interpretation [that legislation should be construed so as to promote its purpose] may be of little assistance where a statutory provision strikes a balance between competing interests, and the problem of interpretation is that there is uncertainty as to how far the provision goes in seeking to achieve the underlying purpose or object of the Act. Legislation rarely pursues a single purpose at all costs. Where the problem is one of doubt about the extent to which the legislation pursues a purpose, stating the purpose is unlikely to solve the problem.”


	
	The expressed primary purpose of the Act is amply fulfilled by the fact that it confers power to curtail, and in relatively extreme circumstances deny, liberty to an offender who has served the entirety of his or her sentence. The precise circumstances when the powers to make an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order may be exercised, and the terms of those orders, are governed by the particular provisions conferring such power and the interrelationship between them. As already noted, the operative provisions are nuanced, including by expressly referring to different levels of satisfaction.
	
	
	That said, as noted above, and as recognised by the primary judge, the evaluative judgment as to whether an extended supervision order will provide adequate supervision will have regard to the safety and protection of the community, and therefore necessarily involve an assessment of the likelihood of re-offending and the consequences of any re-offending.
	
	
	As articulated in the State’s submissions, this ground was directed at least predominantly to the way the primary judge approached the exercise of power under the Act, as opposed to its construction. The State, properly, acknowledged that the primary judge recognised s 3(1) (at [49] and [56]). Insofar as the State’s submission was that her Honour did not apply the test formulated by her, it is addressed in ground 2 below.
	


Ground 2 – failure to conduct an evaluative judgment of unacceptable risk


	
	The State complained that although in [56] (and elsewhere in her reasons) the primary judge correctly formulated the test, her Honour failed to apply the approach there identified. The State contended that her Honour failed to conduct “an evaluative judgment” of unacceptable risk, because (a) she did not “quantify” the probability of re-offending, (b) she did not identify the gravity of the consequences of any potential re-offending, (c) she did not consider the circumstances in which the risk of re-offending may occur, and (d) she did not consider whether the supervisory framework was appropriate and adapted to the circumstances in which re-offending may occur and the gravity of the consequences of any such re-offending.
	
	
	During oral submissions, the State confirmed that what was said to be absent was not some (numerical) quantification of the possibility of re-offending, but a qualitative assessment. However, such an assessment is disclosed by her Honour’s reasons. Her Honour acknowledged at the outset that if Mr Donovan were to return to his former drinking habits and lifestyle he would probably pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence. Her Honour used the adjective “dire”. The essence of her Honour’s reasons was that the extensive supervisory regime proposed by the extended supervision order would detect any lapse in a timely way and react appropriately. That may or may not prove to be the case, but it was a conclusion which was open to her Honour to reach. The same reasoning undermines the remaining aspects of this ground. As seemingly they did at trial, the State’s submissions proceeded on the premise that the risk of a lapse in rehabilitation equated with a risk of serious violence. The primary judge addressed this squarely at [102]:
	


“[I]f Mr Donovan slides back towards old ways, the supervision provided by the proposed extended supervision order will afford ample opportunity and occasion for appropriate reaction and intervention. Although there is ample evidence that Mr Donovan has failed to comply with conditions of supervision in the past, he has not previously been afforded the opportunity for such a high measure of structured support and supervision. The State’s submissions appeared to equate the risk of any lapse in rehabilitation with a risk of serious violence. In my view, the nature of the risk posed by this offender warrants a more sanguine approach.”


	
	The State submitted that “[h]er Honour should have had regard to the evidence of the two independent experts” in undertaking a qualitative assessment of the probability of Mr Donovan re-offending, and pointed to the extremely pessimistic opinions both doctors expressed if Mr Donovan ceased to be abstinent. But it is quite plain that her Honour had regard, expressly, to those opinions. Indeed, they were central to her reasoning. The difference was that the State’s submissions focussed upon the high (indeed, near certain) risk of re-offending if Mr Donovan becomes intoxicated, and put to one side the “low to moderate” risk of an offence of serious violence if he does not.
	
	
	The State submitted that “[a]side from a very brief overview of Mr Donovan’s criminal antecedents at [21] and [22], there is an almost complete lack of consideration of the nature and circumstances of Mr Donovan’s past violent offending.” The submission should be rejected. It ignores what the primary judge said about his history, to which reference has been made above, including, especially, the reproduction of the entirety of the agreed statement of facts as to the appalling violence of the 2011 offence.
	
	
	The State submitted that the primary judge failed to consider the circumstances in which the re-offending may occur. Again, there is nothing in this. The primary judge formed the view, well open to her on the evidence, that re-offending was likely to be associated with abuse of alcohol or unlawful drugs. This was central to her Honour’s reasoning. Her Honour also referred to the fact that Mr Donovan told Dr Roberts that he had been involved in incidents of violence on around 20 occasions when unaffected by alcohol, although Mr Donovan maintained that he had not instigated any of those incidents, which had not led to criminal consequences.
	
	
	The State submitted that the primary judge failed to consider whether the supervisory framework was appropriate. This was developed in a number of ways. In oral submissions, the State emphasised the considerable discretion inherent in the extended supervisory order which it had proposed (“These conditions do give a large measure of discretion to the departmental supervising officer”). The submission might be thought to imply that because one could not be certain how the order would be administered by officers of the State, the State should succeed in discharging the onus it bears that the supervision would not be adequate. If indeed that was what was sought to be conveyed, then we do not agree. The Court should proceed on the basis that officers of the State whose function is to administer the order will do so efficiently and effectively, and in light of all of the evidence which the State has marshalled in support of this application (including, of course, the evidence that aspects of the supervision might not be water-tight). That was at least implicit in the reasons of the primary judge.
	
	
	The State submitted that the primary judge “apparently placed no weight on the detailed evidence of Ms McCarroll, the Manager of the ESO Team, who has vast experience in the efficacy of supervision orders, and who pointed to multiple shortcomings with the proposed supervisory framework.” The State emphasised her concerns about electronic monitoring, where Mr Donovan would live after 3 months at a Community Offender Support Program (COSP) at Malabar, and concerns about Mr Donovan’s ability to refrain from using alcohol and drugs if he were released. The State added that “[n]one of the concerns raised by Ms McCarroll in her affidavit were the subject of cross-examination” (Orange 27L).
	
	
	Neither submission is correct. First, the primary judge summarised the evidence of Ms McCarroll at [84]-[89], in a way that did not shrink from recounting her serious reservations. Her Honour also identified the limitations of Ms McCarroll’s views, which included that they were based on a report by the proposed DSO (Ms McCarroll, who was the most sceptical of the witnesses who gave evidence, had never met Mr Donovan). Her Honour referred in terms to the limitations of the supervision plan as perceived by Ms McCarroll (at [84]) and the limitations of electronic monitoring (at [87]), and observed at [88] that “[a] principal factor in Ms McCarroll’s concerns as to the likely efficacy of an extended supervision order was her opinion that ‘Mr Donovan does not currently have the level of motivation or commitment required to adhere to a schedule of movements’.”
	
	
	Further, contrary to the State’s submission, Ms McCarroll was cross-examined on those opinions. She agreed in cross-examination that there were supervising staff at the COSP 24 hours a day, that there was a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am, and that any movement from COSP would need to be approved. She agreed that she had no evidence to suggest Mr Donovan had rejected the notion of complying with a schedule of movement or electronic monitoring, and that her opinion was based on what had occurred in the past when Mr Donovan had been subject to less stringent supervision. She gave this evidence:
	


“Q: It would be the case that if a structured program which was highly restrictive of his movements would give some capacity to significantly reduce the risk of him committing an offence if you knew where he was at any moment, is that correct?

A: That’s correct.”


	
	She also agreed that her team had the training to undertake drug testing or breath testing, and that there was the capacity for random room searches at the COSP.
	
	
	In terms of accommodation, Ms McCarroll confirmed in cross-examination that there were at least two centres (Namatjira Haven and Benelong’s Haven) which had undertaken to assess Mr Donovan after he had been released from custody.
	
	
	Mr Johnston submitted of this evidence that:
	


“There certainly were limitations that were identified by Ms McCarroll about components of the supervision order, but it’s submitted the combination of factors together puts an overall plan together which is capable of significantly reducing risk. That’s why it was open for her Honour to come to the finding that she did at [102] and [109] that if there was a relapse to alcohol use, that it’s likely that it would be detected in those circumstances and detected before Mr Donovan committed a further serious violence offence, that the pattern of drinking would be picked up well before there was an escalation inevitabl[y] to violence.”


	
	That submission should be accepted. To be clear, we would attribute the factually erroneous submission advanced by the State as an accident attributable to the extreme expedition with which this appeal was prepared for hearing.
	
	
	There is a more general answer to this ground. One cannot read the reasons of the primary judge as a whole without concluding that her Honour gave anxious consideration to the likely effectiveness of the extended supervision order and whether, if Mr Donovan failed to adhere to all aspects of it, the regime would be likely to prevent further offending conduct. This is explicit in respect of the finding which is challenged by ground 4 of the State’s appeal.
	


Ground 4 – challenge to finding that Mr Donovan unlikely to re-offend suddenly/catastrophically within days of release


	
	Essential to the conclusion that the State had failed to show that an extended supervision order would not provide adequate supervision was the primary judge’s finding at [102]:
	


“However, while there is plainly considerable ground for concern as to his real prospects of remaining abstinent, there is no suggestion that he is likely to re-offend suddenly and catastrophically within days of his release.”


	
	The State submitted on appeal that there was no basis for that finding. In oral submissions, counsel for the State conceded that the submission had not been put in those terms at trial. Nevertheless, she referred to what she described as a pattern of “spontaneous and opportunistic” offending by Mr Donovan, especially when he was affected by alcohol or illegal drugs. As put orally:
	


“The violence is spontaneous. It comes from nowhere. There is a very rapid escalation and it can happen anywhere. For example, he has violently offend[ed] by punching a taxi driver in the head as the taxi driver was driving at around 100 kilometres an hour. He has offended by punching somebody in a pub. He has offended by attacking somebody he was in a sexual relationship with in a hotel. He has attacked one of his former partners in a petrol station, and so on. The idea that it can happen anywhere and the idea that he will use whatever comes to hand in order to perpetrate the violence – for example, on one occasion he grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed one of the female victims with the scissors; on another occasion he grabbed a screwdriver and stabbed one of his female victims in the arm.”


	
	Counsel emphasised that even while in prison, Mr Donovan had, repeatedly, obtained access to unlawful drugs, and observed that it would be all the easier for him to obtain access to alcohol if released from prison, even with the most stringent extended supervision orders in place. Finally, she observed that it mattered little that Mr Donovan would be subject to random testing and searching because the nature of his offending was such that by the time of a test or seizure, there was a real risk that he would have already consumed the alcohol and engaged in a further serious violence offence.
	
	
	Mr Donovan has an appalling history of violence, especially towards women, which is more extensive than appears from these reasons. Although there is no inaccuracy in counsel’s summary reproduced above, it is as well to give some context. Punching the taxi driver in his jaw and stomach took place in 1987, without serious injury. Punching a person in the pub took place in 1989, again without serious injury. The attack in the hotel took place in 2010, and caused injury to a woman’s mouth and throat. The attack in the petrol station took place in 2009, and involved damage to property but no physical injury to the woman. The attack with scissors was the reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm in 2011 which gave rise to his being a “high risk violent offender”, the facts of which are reproduced above, and amounted to violence of a completely different quality. The attack with the screwdriver took place in August 2001 although the victim did not report it until December that year.
	
	
	Most, if not all, of the attacks occurred when Mr Donovan was affected by alcohol or drugs (it is probable that it was all, but in some cases the materials do not disclose whether Mr Donovan was affected by alcohol at the time). Accordingly, while Mr Donovan’s individual offences may be characterised as “spontaneous and opportunistic” as submitted by the State, such a description is simply a reflection of the fact that his offending tends to have occurred when Mr Donovan was intoxicated. As set out above, this feature or “pattern” of Mr Donovan’s offending was dealt with at length by the primary judge.
	
	
	Mr Johnston pointed to a deal of evidence supporting a conclusion that Mr Donovan, upon being released from custody under less stringent supervisory conditions in the past, only relatively gradually relapsed into abuse of alcohol and re-offending. He pointed to the detailed risk assessment report prepared by Mr Ardasinski (a forensic psychologist employed by Corrective Services) following four 90 minute sessions over a week-long period in January 2015. Under the heading “Supervision Response”, Mr Ardasinski described a “cycle” of conduct which was a “pattern [which] ultimately results in new offending whilst under the influence”. Further, Mr Ardasinski referred, in the executive summary of his report, to the fact that Mr Donovan “has never before been adequately supervised in a community setting to monitor his transition to community-based responsibilities and restrict his alcohol and drug use”. He also referred to the absence of programs of “sufficient intensity” in the Grafton area where Mr Donovan’s family and other supports exist, and where Mr Donovan has previously been released. He acknowledged the possibility that a community-based treatment plan could be devised to address his risk. He confirmed that in cross-examination. He also confirmed that although it would be unsafe for Mr Donovan to be released into the Grafton area, resources were accessible within the city of Sydney, if he were released to the Malabar COSP, including access to psychological interventions.
	
	
	Take the most recent, and serious, example of Mr Donovan’s offending, on 24 October 2011. He had been released from custody on 15 August 2011, on parole. The terms of his parole were far less stringent than those contained in the extended supervision order made by the primary judge. Some five weeks later, Mr Donovan recommenced using alcohol and unlawful drugs. On 12 October 2011 he failed a urine analysis requested by his parole officer. On 14 October 2011 he told an officer supervising his parole that he had commenced drinking and using cannabis three weeks previously, and had failed to obtain a second script for Avanza (an anti-depressant). The following week he failed to report in accordance with his parole. That sorry account reflects the “cycle” to which Mr Ardasinski referred.
	
	
	Mr Johnston put the position as follows:
	


“What happens is that there is a gradual process by which he comes out, perhaps with ambivalent intentions, slides back into using alcohol and/or drugs; over time that usage increases. There are attempts at detection by Probation and Parole with varying degrees of success. There are referrals to attend appointments or rehab. He doesn’t comply with that. He gets into a spiral. He develops what’s referred to as a ‘fuck it’ mentality and believes he has nothing more to lose by continuing to drink. And then there are the concluding words, ‘This pattern ultimately results in new offending whilst under the influence, since in interview Mr Donovan acknowledged that he tends to “drink too much ... black out ... do things I don’t even remember”.’

It’s not describing an instantaneous and spontaneous commission of offences.”


	
	Further, the other experts who actually interviewed Mr Donovan (Ms Jeffress, and the two independent experts) did not express the view that supervised release was unachievable. Ms McCarroll’s concerns may well prove to be well-founded, but on this critical issue the primary judge was in a substantially advantageous position compared to this Court, in seeing the competing views being tested in cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Donovan’s history of re-offending, saddening as it is, supports the conclusion drawn by Mr Ardasinski that not only is the overwhelming majority of Mr Donovan’s serious criminality associated with misuse of alcohol or cannabis, but also that even in circumstances where the terms of his release into the community have been far less stringent than those ordered by the primary judge, some months have elapsed before Mr Donovan has become affected by alcohol and re-offended. The finding that Mr Donovan is unlikely to re-offend “suddenly and catastrophically within days of his release” is sustained by the evidence.
	


Ground 5 – failure to give reasons


	
	As the State advanced this ground orally:
	


“there was a failure to give reasons in relation to what we say are the pivotal findings of fact at [102] and [109] of her Honour’s judgment. There, her Honour found that the conditions of supervision could readily and quickly detect a lapse. I assume her Honour means a lapse in abstinence. Reasons were required for these findings, in view of the evidence of Ms Jeffress in her risk management report, and Ms McCarroll in her affidavit, that there were numerous limitations that both of them apprehended to the framework of supervision.”


	
	In [102] her Honour had referred to the proposed extended supervision order affording “ample opportunity and occasion for appropriate reaction and intervention”. At [109] her Honour was satisfied that if rehabilitation failed, there would be “adequate supervision to detect the lapse in a timely way and react appropriately”.
	
	
	As was submitted on behalf of Mr Donovan, caution should be exercised when assessing the adequacy of reasons, given the pressures placed upon the court by the timing and nature of the State’s application. The primary judge gave careful reasons, in a very short timeframe, dealing with thousands of pages of evidence, tendered in a hearing over two days, addressing the State’s submissions which occupied 71 single-spaced pages with 182 paragraphs and 241 footnotes. One reason for reproducing verbatim much of her Honour’s reasons, delivered within a fortnight of the hearing, is to illustrate how carefully they grapple with the essential evidence before her.
	
	
	The concessions obtained from Ms McCarroll in cross-examination, referred to above, are important. Ms Jeffress’ risk management report said that there would be the “most intensive supervision level” applied to Mr Donovan in the first instance and that the frequency of meetings, field visits, third party contacts and case plan reviews “will be adjusted in response to changing circumstances based on ongoing assessment of the offender’s risk”. Her Honour also referred, in [110], to the willingness of a non-government organisation, Tribal Dreaming, to provide an “important complement” to the supervision provided by Corrective Services.
	
	
	It is also to be recalled that the question as to which it is said that inadequate reasons have been provided is the likely ability of a supervisory regime to detect any lapse by Mr Donovan and respond promptly. That is precisely what is to be expected would occur through the large discretion reposed in the DSO and the adjusting responses to level of risk to which Ms Jeffress referred. There is little more than can be said by way of reasons. We do not regard it as necessary for her Honour to have explained in detail matters that are, with respect, perfectly obvious, such as that Mr Donovan would not be living at home, or indeed in Grafton, but in a COSP, or a residential rehabilitation centre, that he would be monitored electronically, that there would be restrictions upon his associates and movements, or that he would be subject to random testing for alcohol and drugs. We do not regard there to have been any failure on the part of the primary judge in failing to explain those self-evident matters.
	


Ground 6 – failure by Mr Donovan to give evidence


	
	This ground focussed on the question whether Mr Donovan was “motivated” to rehabilitate himself, as to which there was conflicting evidence from the experts called by both sides. The State submitted that the litigation was civil, that the ordinary rules of evidence applied, and that an adverse inference should be drawn because Mr Donovan did not give evidence about his level of motivation.
	
	
	There are two reasons, each sufficient of itself, why this ground must be rejected. The first is that no submission was made to undercut the self-evident force of her Honour’s observation at [107] that Mr Donovan’s evidence as to his future conduct would be self-serving. The Act anticipates the difficulties with the partisan evidence from both sides by requiring the appointment of independent experts to examine the offender.
	
	
	The second is that there is nothing in the Act to displace the privilege against exposure to a penalty, save for the obligation upon an offender to be examined by the two independent experts. No inference adverse to an offender can be drawn in circumstances where the offender’s giving evidence would lead to him or her being cross-examined by the State with a view to eliciting evidence to support a continuing detention order.
	
	
	Against this, Ms Sharp submitted (it is fair to say, tentatively) that because the purpose of the Act was protective, not penal, the privilege might not be available. We would reject that submission. The focus is not on the purpose of the Act or of an order made under the Act, but on the effect of an order. As the High Court said in Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42; 220 CLR 129 at [34], the question is not why the orders were sought or what purpose might be achieved by their making; “[r]ather, attention must be focused upon the nature of the orders that are sought”. That decision confirmed that an order disqualifying a director on account of his or her wrongdoing was a penalty for the purposes of the privilege. Although we accept that the order for detention for two years sought by the State is sought on account of Mr Donovan’s likely wrongdoing in the future if released, we would still conclude that the privilege applies. That accords with what was held in MH6 v Mental Health Review Board [2009] VSCA 184; 25 VR 382 at [26]. (The position is different in the case of corporations, as appears from Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Boral Resources (Vic) Pty Ltd [2015] HCA 21; 89 ALJR 622 at [1]-[2], to which reference was made in argument.)
	
	
	Mr Donovan’s immunity from giving evidence that would expose him to a penalty has, in part, been overridden by s 15(4) of the Act, insofar as he has been required to be examined by court-appointed psychiatrists or psychologists. But a person whom the State wishes to detain for a period extending after the term of his or her sentence is not required to go into evidence lest unfavourable inferences be drawn against him or her.
	


Ground 7 – failure to be satisfied that supervision would be inadequate


	
	The State submitted that her Honour’s failure to be satisfied was “against the weight” of the evidence. Although no separate ground of appeal was advanced, the State also submitted that the mandatory relevant considerations in s 17(4)(a), (d), (d)(1), (f) and (h) were not given any “real attention”. This aspect was not elaborated in writing. Orally, attention was confined to s 17(4)(h), which requires regard to be had to the offender’s criminal history and “any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history”. We deal with both aspects below, commencing with the only point developed orally.
	
	
	Plainly enough, the primary judge had regard to Mr Donovan’s extensive criminal history. At the forefront of her Honour’s reasons was the self-evident correlation between his criminality and abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. That was the only “pattern” identified in the State’s written submission to her Honour (“[i]t is clear that the offending involves a pattern of alcohol and drug use”), although orally it had also been said that “if a pattern is to be observed in relation to the violent offending, it may be said that the offending is opportunistic and spontaneous rather than planned”. On appeal, the State submitted that:
	


“The pattern is that alcohol and drugs are a clear trigger for violent offending, that the violent offending is spontaneous and opportunistic in nature, and that the violent offending occurs in a variety of places; it occurs in both public and in private.”


	
	The absence of planning and the breadth of offending conduct lead to a conclusion that there is no “pattern” save for the two matters observed by her Honour – the link between alcohol and drug use with violence, and the fact that “Mr Donovan also has a history of failing to comply with conditions of supervision” (judgement at [23]). The Act presupposes, by the use of the word “any” in s 17(4)(h), that there may be no pattern at all. There is no error in failing to have express regard to the absence of a pattern in the offending conduct.
	
	
	No complaint about the remaining paragraphs of s 17(4) was advanced orally, although the submission was not abandoned. It should have been abandoned, in light of the written submissions from Mr Donovan. Her Honour expressly had regard to the consideration in s 17(4)(a), the safety of the community, at [27], [28], [41], [54], [68] (where it was described as the “first mandatory consideration”) and [77]. Her Honour expressly had regard to the consideration in s 17(4)(d), statistical assessment, at [59] and [60] in some detail (referring to the static and dynamic variables, the Violence Risk Scale and the Static-99 scale). Her Honour expressly had regard to the consideration in s 17(4)(d1), reports prepared by Corrective Services NSW, when referring to Ms Jeffress’ report, and the other evidence before the Court. Her Honour expressly had regard to the consideration in s 17(4)(f), the level of compliance with obligations to which he was subject on parole, not least in [23] (“history of failing to comply with conditions of supervision”, “repeated breaches of good behaviour bonds”, “failed to comply with conditions of bail”).
	
	
	The State’s final submission, again not advanced orally, was that the finding was against the weight of the evidence, having regard to the past conduct of Mr Donovan, his continued use of drugs while in custody, the pessimism of the independent experts on his remaining abstinent, his ineligibility for all but two community-based residential programs, and his earlier breaches of supervisory regimes.
	
	
	However, the primary judge was in a position of considerable advantage to this Court. Her Honour had two days of hearing to see and evaluate the evidence, including cross-examination of the most important witnesses, which extended to concessions made by Ms McCarroll in cross-examination. Her Honour was impressed with the independent experts, who had examined Mr Donovan most recently. Dr O’Dea said that:
	


“I think the best approach for Mr Donovan is a residential rehabilitation program with strict supervision and monitoring so that that can adequately manage any relapses in his use ... My view is that even though he’s failed [rehabilitative programs] in the past, I think that’s the next step for him from fulltime custody into the community.”


	
	This Court is much less able to evaluate the weight to be given to the competing evidence given under cross-examination. Considerable deference is to be given to the assessment of the primary judge in those circumstances. It was for the State to establish error, in accordance with what was said in Attorney-General (Qld) v Francis referred to above. This it has failed to do.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	The question on appeal is not whether or not a continuing detention order should be made. Given that the law is the same and no fresh evidence has been sought to be adduced, the question is whether the State has shown error in the evaluative judgment exercised by the primary judge. An appeal is not the occasion to rerun the hearing. An appeal by the State under s 22 of the Act might be expected to be reserved for clear cases of error of fact or law. This is not such a case. This is a case where the primary judge, in circumstances of considerable urgency, grappled with the competing evidence and formed an evaluative judgment which was open to her.
	
	
	No one who has read the evidence in this litigation could fail to be aware of the real risk that Mr Donovan might fail to adhere to the conditions of his extended supervision order. It is plain that the primary judge was conscious of that possibility. There are cases where the intrusive supervision will enable a seemingly intractably unrehabilitated offender to cease offending. However, if Mr Donovan fails to take advantage of the support which the regime will give to him, he must know that a breach of the extended supervision order is a serious offence, which is highly likely to return him to prison for a lengthy period. In particular, given the evidence about likely offending if Mr Donovan becomes intoxicated, a breach of the prohibitions upon possession of alcohol or illicit drugs is apt to be regarded as a very serious breach of the order.
	
	
	The State having failed to demonstrate error, its appeal must be dismissed. In circumstances where the State is paying for both parties’ representation, it is not clear that a costs order is appropriate, but if Mr Donovan has a different view, application may be made in accordance with r 36.15 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	In terms of an orderly transition from custody to supervision, Mr Donovan pointed to the one day’s delay ordered by the primary judge, and said that he would not be heard against the Court taking that course. To that end, the existing stay, interim order and warrant should be extended until 11 am tomorrow, 17 September 2015. From 11 am, 17 September 2015, the extended supervision order made by the primary judge will resume being in force.
	
	
	The formal orders are:
	



	
	Appeal dismissed.
	
	
	Extend the stay of the extended supervision order until 11 am, 17 September 2015.
	
	
	Renew the interim detention order and warrant until 11 am, 17 September 2015.

		10 May 2016",2015-09-15 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2767745,R v Yousif [2015] NSWDC 407,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is yet another offence where an offender, whilst drunk, committed an act of violence. I have begun many remarks on sentence with those words over the course of my judicial career. The community, as well as the judiciary, are rightfully tired of drunken young people, usually men, resorting to violence, especially violence of a serious kind. For obvious reasons there must therefore be a substantial component of general deterrence in the sentence imposed for conduct which I will shortly describe.
	
	
	The offender is a member of the Sudanese community. There was a function held at the Chatswood Club by the Sudanese community on 6 October 2012. About 60 people attended, including the offender. In the early hours of the following morning there was something of a fracas involving two particular people. Matters settled down, although arguing continued apparently, but once time was called and the party goers began to leave, violence erupted.
	
	
	There were about 15 people outside the club. At one stage some punches were thrown, and a man by the name of Makin went to assist his friend, Mr El-Haj. The offender punched Mr Makin in his left eye using his right fist. Mr El-Haj was then hit with a ceramic plate across his right eye, and he fell to the ground. The offender and another man then began kicking Mr El‑Haj to his body while he was on the ground.
	
	
	Mr El‑Haj lost the sight of his right eye, however there is no suggestion that Mr Yousif was responsible for that injury and the Crown does not suggest that Mr Yousif should receive any extra punishment because of those consequences to Mr El-Haj. In such circumstances the victim impact statement tendered by the Crown is of limited utility. Not surprisingly, Mr El-Haj feels deeply about the loss of sight in one of his eyes and his victim impact statement concentrates on that injury. In circumstances where Mr Yousif is not criminally responsible for that injury I have had to place very limited weight on the victim impact statement, and as the Crown conceded for the purposes of sentencing, ignore this injury to Mr El‑Haj.
	
	
	This was not the offender’s first brush with violence, nor was it to be his last. He was on a Community Service Order for an offence of actual bodily harm at the time of this offence. Having been convicted of this offence, that Community Service Order was quashed, and three months imprisonment was imposed. After this offence he committed another offence of affray, receiving 28 days imprisonment.
	
	
	I should also mention that the offender spent some time in custody, bail refused, for offences which were later not proceeded with. However, he did spend one year and four and a half months in custody, bail refused, on this matter, as well as the other matter which was not proceeded with. In those circumstances I will take into account pre-sentence custody of one year, four and a half months. That of course - and I know I am stating the obvious - is a significant period of time in gaol.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at quite a late stage, shortly before the trial was about to commence. He was always able to plead guilty to the offence of affray but did not do so until late. No doubt this was because he was hoping to negotiate with the Crown that they drop the more serious charge on the indictment ultimately presented against him, which did relate to Mr El-Haj’s injury to his eye. The utilitarian value of Mr Yousif’s plea is therefore reduced from that which it would have carried if the plea of guilty had been entered earlier. In such circumstances I will impose a sentence which is 10% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Mr Yousif was, as I mentioned, born in Sudan. Fortunately he was not exposed to the traumatic events associated with the various civil wars which have taken place in that country. However, as he described things to Dr Nielssen, “I experienced war in my own house between my mum and my step‑dad.” His step-father was violent, both to his mother and to him. The family left Sudan and went to Cairo before his step-father came to Australia, and the rest of the family followed him afterwards.
	
	
	He dropped out of school during Year 10; commenced work as an apprentice to a painter; but his excessive consumption of alcohol meant that he could not really do what was required of him in that job. He now hopes to return to that occupation and will be studying at TAFE next year doing painting and decorating.
	
	
	Mr Yousif has been able to do some courses whilst in custody. He now recognises the problems which alcohol have caused him, and has not drunk alcohol for some time; there are thus prospects for his rehabilitation. They will be enhanced by the offender continuing to avoid alcohol and by studying, as he proposes to do.
	
	
	He is currently working five days a week doing concreting formwork, which also suggests that Mr Yousif is a different sort of person to the one who committed the offence for which I must now sentence him.
	
	
	I consider that a custodial sentence is required, but given the plea of guilty and given the circumstance that he spent one year, four and a half months in pre-sentence custody, I am satisfied that it is not necessary to return Mr Yousif to gaol. Mr McCallum made the submission that I would deal with his client by means of a suspended sentence of imprisonment. I will do that. The Crown did not speak in opposition to that outcome.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I impose a sentence of imprisonment of 20 months. That sentence is to be suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act on condition that Mr Yousif enter into a bond. The conditions of that bond are,
	



	
	That he is to be of good behaviour.
	
	
	He is to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	He is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.
	
	
	He is to inform the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.
	



	
	Mr Yousif, let me just explain to you what I have done. You are not going to go back to gaol today, but if you commit another offence in the next 20 months I will send you to gaol for this offence. You will also get sentenced for the next offence, but you will come back before me and I will send you to gaol for this offence. If you stay out of trouble you will not go to gaol, if you get into trouble you will go to gaol. So whether you go to gaol or not, it is not up to me, it is up to you. Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yeah.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you. Thank you both for your assistance.

2767747,R v Ligaiviu [2015] NSWDC 258,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: No one in the community could have failed to recognise that in recent times the drug ice has caused enormous problems, in particular as concerns its involvement in the commission of criminal offences. Very often, offences are committed by those addicted to ice in order to get money to fund their drug addictions. On other occasions people act under the influence of ice in criminal ways in circumstances where there is at least the good possibility that they would not act in that way were they not so intoxicated. The matter before me today is an example of the second of those types of offending.
	
	
	One of the things the consumption of ice can do is to cause the user to experience delusions. On 10 June 2014, the offender believed that the mother of his children, a person with whom he had a relationship but had separated, was in the unit next door to him having sex with the occupants of that unit. This was of course a complete delusion which came about because he had earlier that day consumed about .2 of a gram of methamphetamine.
	
	
	So he went to the unit and, knocked on the door. When the door was opened, he asked “What’s going on, why is there screaming and shouting”.
	
	
	The man who answered the door, one of the people who would become the victim of his offence, told him that he did not know what he was talking about, there was just he and his wife at home. The offender said “Don’t lie, I heard it all, I was standing here the entire time”. The occupant of the unit said “Everything is fine, don’t worry”. The offender walked away and the occupant closed the door.    
	
	
	However, he returned a little while later. Again he knocked on the door and again the door was opened. There was a further conversation in which the offender explained that he knew that his ex-partner was in the unit. The occupant tried to close the door and despite the efforts of the offender, he was eventually able to do so. This was, however, not the end of the matter.
	
	
	The offender went back to the unit from whence he had come, obtained a kitchen knife and for a third time knocked on the unit next door. He yelled out “Open the fucking door, let’s sort this out before it gets big”. Not surprisingly, the occupant said “I’m not opening the door, go back to your unit and calm down”. The offender’s response was to say “If you don’t open the fucking door, I’m going to do more than just smash it. Open the door, open the door” .It was at this stage that the offender forced the door open by shouldering it.
	
	
	The offender is a large and powerful man and so he was successful in smashing the door open. He walked into the unit waving the knife in a slashing motion. The male occupant stood in front of his wife to shield her whilst the offender approached them. He stood very close to the male occupant, only about 30 centimetres away, pointed the knife towards him and demanded to know where his wife was. He then began searching all the rooms calling out to his ex-partner “Kirsty, Kirsty, where are you?”
	
	
	After searching the unit he left and the police were called. He was seen by police and chased along the road. He did drop the knife in a nearby garden but was eventually caught. He went back to the police station, participated in an electronically recorded interview where he made what the statement of facts says are full admissions.
	
	
	To say this was a serious offence is something of an understatement. It was the sort of offence often described as a home invasion. In common with all offences of that type there was a threatened use of violence that went beyond being merely armed. The offender knew that there were people inside and it must have been a terrifying experience for those people whose home was invaded.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated break and enter with intent to intimidate whilst armed. That is a serious matter carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so he is entitled to a significant discount to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea, not quantified in percentage terms because it has been one of a number of factors which has led to me contemplating a different form of sentence from that I would have otherwise imposed.
	
	
	The offender was born in Fiji and remains a citizen of that country. He came to Australia when he was quite young when his parents migrated here. He had, as he reported to the author of the presentence report, an unremarkable upbringing where he experienced a positive home environment. One qualification to that is that when he was in his late teens his parents separated. The offender was close to his mother and not surprisingly there is at least the possibility that the experience of his mother leaving the family home had adversely impacted on the offender.
	
	
	The offender does have a criminal history including offences of some seriousness. He has spent time in custody in the past. His record certainly disentitles him to leniency on this occasion. Also, there is a history of non compliance with Court orders continuing up to the offender breaching the bail that he was granted for this very offence in relation to his residence at Odyssey House. It was a condition of his bail granted to him after he had spent five months and nine days in custody bail refused that he live at Odyssey House, but despite that he refused to comply with the conditions of residence there and so was asked to leave. Since then he has been living with his father.
	
	
	It is important to note that self-induced intoxication is not a mitigating factor. It does however explain his delusional state on the day he committed the offence. Since the commission of the offence, the offender reports that he has not used drugs and not abused alcohol. Of course, I only have his word for that. Mr Kozanecki led evidence from his client that he was a talented sportsman and suggested that being a sportsman of that standard was inconsistent with drug use. I do have to say, however, that there have been some well-known examples of talented sports people, being discovered to have been drug users.
	
	
	On the other hand there is nothing to suggest, nothing that the Crown can point to, to suggest that the offender has been using drugs and he has made some positive steps towards improving his conduct. He now has a job five days a week. A reference from his employer was tendered today. He is described as being a hard worker, reliable and a person who works well both in a team and on his own. The offender has expressed his remorse. I accept that he is remorseful.
	
	
	In deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender, I take into account a number of specific factors. Firstly, that he has spent five months and nine days in custody and about two months in a form of quasi custody. I take into account that there have been some changes in the offender’s conduct and there is at least a good possibility that he is telling the truth when he says he has not used drugs of recent times.
	
	
	Of course, the offender must still be punished. I certainly do not think that his custody and quasi custody are sufficient punishment to reflect the objective gravity of what he has done. To the contrary, this is an offence where general deterrence plays a significant role in determining what sentence to impose.
	
	
	It is my job to select the most appropriate sentence in all of the circumstances. I am satisfied that a sentence of custody is required but I am also satisfied that especially given his presentence custody, that is likely to be a sentence of two years or less. An intensive corrections order would both contain an element of punishment and promote the offender’s rehabilitation. It would also test the offender’s honesty when he says that he has given up drugs.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I will adjourn the matter and order an assessment as to the suitability of the offender to serve a sentence of imprisonment which I will impose upon him by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	The matter will be adjourned until 6 November at 10.00 am
	
	
	Now, Mr Ligaiviu, can I just say some things to you? Stand up please. What is going to happen is that in the next seven weeks someone from Corrective Services is going to come and assess you as to whether you are suitable to serve a sentence not in gaol but remain living with your father. Now, I know which one you would prefer to get, okay, but what you have got to do is make sure that you comply with the conditions of the assessment.
	
	
	I can tell you quite clearly, if you are not suitable, Mr Kozanecki will help me explain this to you later. If you are not suitable for an intensive corrections order, there is only one alternative and that is that you will go to gaol. Do you understand that? So you have got to do what you can to make sure you get an assessment which says you are suitable. Do you understand?
	
	
	I am going to make it a further condition of bail, I do apologise, a further condition of bail that Mr Ligaiviu use no illegal drugs whatsoever.
	
	
	So Mr Ligaiviu, if you are detected using drugs, it will be a breach of bail and that will work very much against you in the sentence that I impose upon you. Thank you.

		09 November 2015",2015-09-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767757,R v Sharpley [2015] NSWDC 371,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The job of a sentencing judge is to sentence according to both the offence and the offender. Let me start with the offender, Neil Sharpley. He is a man now 23 years of age who experienced some disadvantage as he was growing up and of more recent times as well. Although he had a good relationship with his parents, domestic violence was a feature of his upbringing. He left school early and is barely literate. He cannot read a book and struggles to read the sporting stories in a newspaper.
	
	
	He commenced using drugs at a fairly early age and indeed his major pastime seems at some stage to have been the consumption of cannabis. For a period of life that was virtually all he did. He has also been exposed to other poor influences involving harder drugs which he used himself and of course there is the ever present problem of alcohol. On top of this he may well have a psychiatric illness. He displays some symptoms consistent with some form of psychotic illness. And a final matter of evidence, which clearly is of some significance to him, concerns a hearing impairment from which he suffers.
	
	
	So Mr Sharpley is not the sort of person who should have imposed upon him a sentence where general deterrence is of prime importance. On the other hand specific deterrence is very important. Mr Sharpley has a criminal history involving offences of violence and has committed a very serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment for which I must now sentence him.
	
	
	His solicitor tells me that his first time in custody bail refused awaiting sentence has not been a happy one for him. I don’t wish to sound unkind but I am not at all disappointed to learn that. Mr Sharpley needs to be made very aware that if he continues to offend he will continue to go to gaol. If he wants to avoid repeating the experience of being separated from his family in an environment where violence is common place and there are threatening people all around him, then he must make the decision to avoid committing criminal offences in the future.
	
	
	I am to sentence him for an offence of robbery in company. This was an offence which was not planned and an offence where Mr Sharpley was far from the instigator. A taxi driver picked up two young people. He drove a short distance before they came across three other people including the offender. The driver stopped the taxi and the three people got in making a total of five passengers and the driver, four of them in the back seat. The taxi driver, not surprisingly, asked what was going on and said that he couldn’t take five people. A reasonable response at this stage would have been for someone to agree with the taxi driver’s proposition but this did not happen. The passengers objected to having to get out of the car and violence began.
	
	
	The taxi driver was hit with a plastic coke bottle. He got out of the car and said “I’m not taking you, you will have to get another cab”. He was then pushed in the chest by a woman by the name of Link-Hickey. Another of Mr Sharpley’s companions then began swearing and shouting at the taxi driver before hitting him, causing his nose to bleed. Ms Link-Hickey, who appears to have been the person primarily responsible for the commission of the offences and getting her friends into trouble, then grabbed the driver by his shirt and began shaking him. She pushed him, causing him to fall to the ground. It was at this stage that this offender Mr Sharpley joined in, punching the driver once to the right side of his face, splitting his lip and making it bleed.
	
	
	Ms Link-Hickey wasn’t satisfied with inflicting violence, she began screaming “Rob him, rob him, rob the car”. Mr Sharpley and a friend of his called Walford did so. One of them took the coin tray containing about $20 or $30. Another took the eftpos machine. They then ran away with Ms Link-Hickey being the last to leave. These events were frankly disgraceful. The taxi driver was set upon by a number of people at 1.30 in the morning in Waterloo when he made the very reasonable suggestion that he couldn’t take five people in his taxi.
	
	
	Mr Sharpley may not have been the instigator of these events but he doesn’t appear to have been at all reluctant to join in once Ms Link-Hickey began her disgraceful behaviour.
	
	
	Events such as these are unfortunately commonplace. There are some people in the community who regard the obligation to obey the law as not applying to them. Ms Link-Hickey appears to be one such person. Any sensible and decent human being would have firstly attempted to persuade Ms Link-Hickey to stop what she was doing and, secondly, have not joined in with her illegal activities. Mr Sharpley clearly was not that sort of person, at least on the night he committed this offence.
	
	
	But his decision of course has to be looked at in the context of his background. It is not correct to assume that all members of the community have the same ability to make rational decisions about their own behaviour. For this reason I will take into account Mr Sharpley’s background consistent with the principles of Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 and R v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58 in determining his moral culpability for his offending behaviour.
	
	
	Both of Mr Sharpley’s parents have died. He lives in Bathurst and was in Waterloo visiting family when he committed this offence. Upon his release from custody he plans to live with his girlfriend back in Bathurst. She has an attitude to illegal drugs which is commendable. She will be a positive influence for him. He has plans to work and to return to TAFE. If Mr Sharpley does do what he says he will then there good prospects for his rehabilitation. The problem is knowing whether he will actually do what he says he is going to do.
	
	
	I suppose I should mention the principle of parity. One of these five people was dealt with in the Children’s Court. She was put on a bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months. Of course Mr Sharpley should not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares that sentence with the sentence imposed upon him. But a number of features must be mentioned.    Firstly, the principles which go to sentencing in the Children’s Court are very different from the principles which bind me. Secondly, we do not know the factual basis on which she was dealt with in the Children’s Court. Nor do we know anything about her background or any of her other subjective features. Although of course the principle of parity applies it is very difficult to place much weight on a sentence in the Children’s Court in the absence of any knowledge as to the features such as I have mentioned.
	
	
	Mr Sharpley’s time in custody has been harder and will continue to be harder because of a number of features, including significant depression from which he suffers, and his hearing impairment. He has hearing aids but doesn’t like wearing them because he doesn’t want to be picked on.
	
	
	This offence occurred soon after Mr Sharpley’s mother had died. That led to an escalation in his drug use. It is to be hoped that once Mr Sharpley is released from custody he will understand the link between drug use and offending and make the decision, which is for him and him alone to make, that he will put his drug using days behind him, and that of course includes the drug cannabis. Daily use of cannabis while regarded by some as merely a pleasurable pastime will in Mr Sharpley’s case be inconsistent with his rehabilitation. He needs to do something with his life. He needs to study. He needs to work. He needs to have a reason to get up in the morning beyond simply a desire to resume smoking cannabis.
	
	
	Mr Skidmore, who appears for Mr Sharpley, made a submission based on his client’s desire that Mr Sharpley should be released from custody having spent already a significant time bail refused. Mr Skidmore referred to the Henry guideline judgment and made some submissions as to the difference between the guideline offence postulated in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 AcrimR 149 and his client’s case. I have had regard to the judgment and of course had regard to the various differences between the postulated situation and the present. There are a number. Mr Sharpley didn’t use a weapon and the weapon that was used was a plastic drink bottle. It was certainly not a dangerous weapon like a knife. The offence was unplanned and, as I have mentioned, Mr Sharpley was not the instigator, he followed the suggestions of others. His plea of guilty came at the earliest opportunity rather than a plea of limited utility as the Henry guideline refers to. In fact I should, at this stage, say that the sentence I am about to impose upon Mr Sharpley will be 25% less than it would have otherwise have been to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.
	
	
	There are special circumstances in this case. This is Mr Sharpley ‘s first time in custody. He suffers from a possible psychiatric illness involving voices and apparitions. It is in the community’s interest, including Mr Sharpley’s, that he be given as much support as possible upon his release from custody so that he can put his drug using and offending ways behind him.
	
	
	I impose sentence as follows: I set a non parole period of 15 months and a head sentence of 30 months to date from 15 July 2014. The non parole period will thus expire on 14 October 2015, on which day the offender is to be released to parole. It is a condition of his parole that he is closely supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and obeys without question all the reasonable requests and requirements. It is a further condition of parole that Mr Sharpley use no illegal drugs whatsoever, including the drug cannabis.
	
	
	Mr Sharpley, I am not sure whether you heard what I said, but you have got a little less than a month to do before you will be released to parole. Do you understand that? Right, 14 October you will be getting out. Once you get out you can’t use any drugs, because if you use drugs you will be back inside, as simply as that.

		24 February 2016",2015-09-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767760,Chapple v R [2015] NSWDC 355,"Judgment


	
	This is a case about deceptively obtaining money. In these kinds of cases it is sometimes a challenge to ask oneself: what is the criminal aspect to the conduct? Behaviour in financial matters can amount to the commission of crimes but the way in which that conduct becomes a crime or the reason it should be classified as a crime is not always clear. Some cases are more serious than others. The case I am dealing with this afternoon seems to be a less serious example.
	
	
	A man was a successful insurance broker. He built up a good client base. He was self-employed. He arranged insurance for his clients and sent them accounts which they paid. After some time he ceased to be self-employed and took a job with an insurance company or an insurance broker. He received a salary for that. At the same time he kept most, if not all, of his clients. In other words, instead of arranging the insurance for them personally, it was arranged through his employer but by use of his skill and services. As I said, he was paid a salary by his employer.
	
	
	The crime he committed was this. He continued to render accounts to his clients. His clients continued to pay the accounts. The accounts that he sent to his clients was for the work that he performed on their behalf through his employer. His clients, it seems, did not question the bills. They paid them.
	
	
	There is no suggestion of any complaints about the service which he provided. On the contrary the references amongst the papers make it clear that he worked extremely hard in his job and was highly valued in that area. But in what his counsel, Mr F D L Holles, described as a crime of omission rather than commission, he failed to tell his clients that they were no longer obliged to pay him a personal fee. He was paid a salary by his employer to do the same work that they used to retain him independently to do. He continued sending his former clients bills for six or seven or eight years. As I said, the bills were paid and he “earned” almost $60,000 from those clients in fees which they paid.
	
	
	The man’s name is Mark Chapple. He is now 53. At some stage he was reported to the police. The police interviewed him, he was cooperative and even supplied them an additional explanation but responsibly and in accordance with their duty, they charged him with offences. That is because he had committed the crimes.
	
	
	There were four sets of clients involved. Three sets were either individuals or couples, and the fourth set was a corporation. For each of the four, he was charged with two crimes. That is because the law changed part way through the period. For each set he was charged with obtaining money by deception against s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act (1900) (NSW). That has a maximum of five years imprisonment. For each set he was also charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception against s 192E(1)(b) of the same Act. That section has a maximum of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	His case came to court at the Tamworth Local Court. Mark Chapple pleaded guilty, to his credit. That entitled him to a discount in any sentence. His Honour Magistrate Holmes obviously regarded Mark Chapple’s criminal behaviour as very serious and for each of the eight offences his Honour imposed prison sentences of 18 months with a non parole period of six months. They were all to be served concurrently so the overall effective sentence was an 18 month prison sentence with a non parole period of six months.
	
	
	Mr Chapple has appealed to the District Court against the sentence. When that happens the District Court Judge reads the papers that were before the Magistrate and reads or hears any additional evidence which is called in the case before the Judge.
	
	
	In this case Ms G Wasilewicz who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is the respondent to the appeal, has tendered a pre-sentence report and Mr Holles has tendered up to date psychological and medical material and a reference from a prospective employer. Mr Holles also called his client Mark Chapple to give evidence.
	
	
	Mr Chapple acknowledged what he described as a “gross error on my part” that had brought to an end prematurely a long and successful career as an insurance broker. He acknowledged that when he finished with his employer he was on a salary of nearly $150,000 per annum. He acknowledged that he had brought shame on his family.
	
	
	When cross examined by Ms Wasilewicz he did not agree that he had rendered the bills because he felt that he was underpaid, but simply because he was maintaining a long-standing relationship with his clients who trusted him.
	
	
	Mr Holles also called Colin Baker who is a director of a business called The Package House Imports Pty Limited. Mr Baker has known Mr Chapple for some 15 years and knows about the charges he is facing. Mr Baker’s business has offered Mr Chapple the job of sales manager of the company. In exhibit 3 Mr Baker says that Mr Chapple’s “experience suits the role and we believe he would make a valuable contribution”. He made reference to his experience, particularly in the New England and the North West of New South Wales. They are prepared to put a lot of trust in his skills and ability.
	
	
	In addition to this Mr Chapple has good references from respectable members of the community who obviously know him well and who make it clear in their references that they know all about the conduct that led to the charges. They refer to the respect that he commands in the business field and his ethic of hard work. These people vouch for Mr Chapple’s character and acknowledge that the dishonesty is out of character.
	
	
	Mr Chapple has been seeing a psychologist who has diagnosed him as having a major depressive disorder and a generalised anxiety disorder. He is also being treated by his general practitioner and is on a medication regime.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report thought that Mr Chapple “lacks insight into his offending behaviour and appeared to minimise his role in the offences and the consequential impact on the victims”. He explained to the author of the report that he was “confused about his role” and his “perceived entitlement to charge customers for his services”.
	
	
	I come back to the observations I made in commencing these remarks on sentence. It is important in cases involving financial crimes to have a sense of what the criminal conduct is. These are not crimes that involve deceiving a person into parting with money whilst nothing is provided in return. Perhaps Mr Chapple’s own reference to being confused about his role illustrates what had happened. He continued behaving as he always had done in his business relationships, even though his source of remuneration had changed. He failed to tell his clients that they need not pay for his services any more.
	
	
	Mr Holles argued that the sentences could be suspended or combined with suspension orders and community service orders. I should add that the victims of these crimes have all been paid out by Mr Chapple’s employer’s insurer so, as Ms Wasilewicz fairly acknowledged, there is an aspect about this which suggests a victimless crime. Nevertheless these four sets of persons and corporations were deceived by his failure to disclose that they were not obliged to pay him any money and, to the extent that they trusted him, he failed to honour that trust. That is why essentially it is criminal behaviour. It is significant criminal behaviour and to my mind the more serious of the crimes, namely the offences against s 192E, should attract a sentence of imprisonment. However I would be inclined to accept Mr Holles’ submission, to which Ms Wasilewicz did not take exception, that the sentences could be suspended. It is clear that Mr Chapple has learnt his lesson. He has the opportunity to continue to offer his skill and experience by another employer who fully understands the crimes he has committed but is prepared to trust him to use his skill in another endeavour. I think for those reasons he should have a conviction but be able to spend his time back in the community. There needs to be some punishment in the sense of personal inconvenience and that is what is attractive about Mr Holles’ suggestion of a community service order. Again Ms Wasilewicz did not take exception to that proposal.
	
	
	It seems to me that the overall effective sentence of 18 months is, with respect, about right. Instead of one sentence I would propose to impose four cumulative sentences of four months. It seems that the tariff for community service orders would be about 150 hours. I have in mind four orders of 35 hours each, amounting to 140 hours. I am going to allow this appeal for the reasons that I have given.
	
	
	The formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine these appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences. In respect of the four counts against s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act, under s 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment I make a community service order in respect of each of those offences directing Mr Chapple to perform community service work for 35 hours. Those orders are cumulative so that the total number of hours would be 140.
	
	
	In respect of the four offences against s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, I fix a sentence of four months imprisonment for each of those offences. In respect of each of the offences, under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period and I direct that Mr Chapple be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for four months in respect of each sentence. The conditions of the good behaviour bond are
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour,
	
	
	That he notify the registrar of this court of any change in his residential address,
	
	
	That he attend court if he receives a notice to do so.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now any other orders before I explain it to Mr Chapple?

WASILEWICZ: I may have misheard, your Honour intends for each of those four months prison term.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’m thinking that yes.

WASILEWICZ: So the total term is sixteen months‑‑

HIS HONOUR: I know, I think I’ve got that wrong. Not sure how to get around it.

WASILEWICZ: Whether or not your Honour does an aggregate sentence of sixteen months for all of them and suspends it totally. Can’t suspend an aggregate sentence.

HOLLES: Can’t suspend it.

HIS HONOUR: No you can’t do an aggregate s 12.

HOLLES: Your Honour it occurs that perhaps the one involving the Doolin’s being the largest amount, and I think, is your Honour restricted to one accumulation or two?

HIS HONOUR: No, I’m not sure that I can accumulate for a suspended sentence. I think that your suggestion, the one involving the Doolin's, should - and then there’s one involving Hi-Tech‑‑

HOLLES: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: ‑‑and perhaps I should do it that way and.

HOLLES: If your Honour were to make one for sixteen months, the rest for four months and make them all concurrent.

HIS HONOUR: Sixteen months. I agree.

WASILEWICZ: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I think I just suspend them but making it clear that they would be concurrent yes. Yes, all right. I think that’s the answer. Do you agree Ms Wasilewicz?

WASILEWICZ: Yes, your Honour.


	
	I revise the orders in respect of the penalties for the offences against s 192E. In respect of the offence regarding the victims Doolin, I impose a sentence of 16 months imprisonment. In respect of the offence regarding Hi-Tech Park Homes I impose a sentence of twelve months imprisonment. In respect of the offences involving William Goodrich and Richard Goodrich separately, in each case I impose sentences of four months imprisonment. For each of those sentences of imprisonment, under s 12 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make orders suspending the execution of the whole of each sentence for the whole period and I direct that Mr Chapple be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for the term of each sentence.
	


HIS HONOUR: Can I do one bond? No, probably four bonds.

HOLLES: Separate bonds your Honour.


	
	Conditions of the bonds I have already specified. I notice that he is assessed as suitable for a CSO. I should direct that he report to the Community Corrections Officer at Tamworth on or before next Wednesday 30 September 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now I will explain that to your client in a minute but I think that’s all.

HOLLES: I think that ticks the boxes your Honour if I may use that expression.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

HOLLES: There is one matter your Honour, there was an order by the magistrate for compensation. As I understand it, the situation is this, that the people named as the victims on the various offences have been paid out. It may be that the person who paid out that money has a civil action against my client but I don’t see how this court can make a compensation order indeed the magistrate could have made a compensation order under those circumstances.

HIS HONOUR: Sounds right. Ms Wasilewicz, it may be that the insurer has a civil action, but I’m not sure I can order them.

WASILEWICZ: Well your Honour can order the compensation orders remain. Although the victims would be doubly enriched in doing so.

HIS HONOUR: That’s right. No, I wouldn’t do that.

WASILEWICZ: Matter for your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: No. I think I’ve set aside the sentences.

HOLLES: Yes, your Honour has. I was simply raising it for more certainty if it came to a head at a later time.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.


	
	For clarity I indicate as part of my order that the compensation order has been set aside.
	


WASILEWICZ: I think that settles it your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. Mr Chapple, come forward. Mr Chapple, you’ve won your appeal. I have set aside the gaol sentences but…well I have set aside the fact that you’ve got to go to gaol to serve them. You have still got prison sentences, you’ve got four prison sentences. 16 months, 12 months and two lots of four months but I have suspended each one. For the other four offences you’ve got community service orders for each, 35 hours for each of them, so that’s 140 hours. That is going to be inconvenient for you, particularly when you are going into your new job. But that’s the idea and every time you find yourself being inconvenienced and finding it a nuisance and that it is holding you back you think “Well, would I rather be in gaol than doing this?” That is the attitude that you do that community service with. Because it has been given to you instead of sending you to gaol and it is meant to be inconvenient because it is meant to be a punishment.

The prison sentences have been suspended and the conditions are that you have to enter a good behaviour bond and Mr Holles or his solicitor will take you in to sign you up this afternoon, just into the office here. You’ve got to stay out of trouble. Good behaviour means that. No drink driving, I mean you don’t have anything on your record. But nothing at all . If you change your address, you’ve got to let them know and if you get a notice in the mail saying to come to court you’ve got to turn up.

The most important thing to understand about a suspended sentence - which your lawyers will explain to you but I have to make clear - is if you breach the good behaviour bond even by a drink driving offence for example and you come back before me, my hands are tied. There’s very little I can do. Parliament has deliberately made it hard for me not to send you to gaol. It’s not like ordinary good behaviour bonds because it’s attached to a prison sentence. And when you come back, if you come back before me, you pretty well have to go to gaol. So you’ve got to bear that in mind, you’ve got to remain completely clean for sixteen months. I am not suggesting that will be hard. A person of your record, your age, won’t be a problem. And it is very good that you have got this job offer from Mr Baker. You can turn your life around, make a new start and, as I said in my judgment, you will be able to use the skills which you have developed. So good luck.

Application to exclude evidence; see transcript p 5,6


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Ajeev Krishan Prasad is to be arraigned on a charge alleging that he supplied a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine on 5 February 2014. The charge arises from the circumstances of a stop and search by police, particularly Senior Constable Janhke at 6.48pm on 5 February 2015 in Old South Head Road, Bellevue Hill.
	
	
	Objection is taken by the accused to the admissibility of particular text messages received on his mobile phone over several days up until his arrest and part of the conversations had by the accused with the arresting police.
	
	
	I do not propose to go through in chapter and verse the detail of the Crown case, but to summarise the situation as succinctly as I can, being under some pressure of time, as I understand the Crown case a car driven by the accused in which was also present Chee Hong, sitting in the passenger seat, was stopped for a random breath test and some inquiries to some defect in the car. A subsequent search of the car and the passenger has revealed Mr Hong to be in possession of a large sum of money, and to be in possession of, or appearing to have some immediate control over, a quantity of methylamphetamine which is the subject matter of the charge against the accused.
	
	
	The total quantity of methylamphetamine found in separate places, including in an area within the rear passenger door, as I understand it is something in the order of 16.8 grams. It is important to note that it is that methylamphetamine as identified by the learned Crown Prosecutor in his opening remarks, found within the car either in the possession of Mr Hong or purportedly under his immediate control, which is the relevant methylamphetamine for which the accused has been charged with supplying.
	
	
	In relation to this matter, the Crown case against the accused, Mr Prasad, is that he was involved in a joint criminal enterprise to supply the prohibited drug. As I would understand the Crown case, although I have not gone into the detail of the legal basis for the Crown's case against the accused.
	
	
	Whilst it may appear ostensibly on the evidence that Mr Hong had the relevant drugs in his possession, all the circumstances of the matter point to what the Crown would allege to be either joint possession by the two men, or possession by Mr Hong for the purposes of furthering a joint criminal enterprise between Mr Hong and Mr Prasad to supply the prohibited drug.
	
	
	Although the matter has not been specified in the indictment particularly, it may turn out that the way in which the case would be left to the jury is a case for joint criminal enterprise in respect of possession of a quantity of the prohibited drug deemed to be in the possession of the men for the purposes of supply. Be that as it may, the resolution to the matters with which I am concerned does not turn upon the specific way in which the Crown would prove ""supply"", beyond noting, as I've said earlier, the existence in the Crown case of a joint criminal enterprise or a case of joint possession.
	
	
	Yesterday I was provided with a bundle of documents and other material I heard oral evidence on the voir dire from Senior Constable Janhke. He specifically gave oral evidence in relation to the circumstances of the questioning of the accused and particularly the circumstances in which it came to pass ultimately that cautions were administered to the accused in respect of the alleged separate offences after events which are submitted to be on the evidence giving rise to a reasonable belief that the accused had committed an offence warranting the administration of a caution to the accused, that is a warning that he need not say anything in answer to questions asked of him by the police officer unless he wished but anything he did say may be used in evidence against him, to paraphrase the effect of the caution, the subject of specific reference in s 139 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The various documents I was given related to the subject matter of course of the oral evidence on the voir dire, but also of course were concerned with the admissibility of a number of text messages which have been identified as having been received on a mobile phone in the possession of the accused over a period of time from 21 January 2014 until after the accused came into the custody of the police. It is common ground in the evidence before me, putting aside the issue of the accused being stopped by Constable Janhke at approximately 6.48pm, that by 7.15pm the mobile phone to which I have just referred was in the possession of the police and the accused was unable to use it from that time onwards.
	
	
	I will come back to the issue of the admissibility of the text messages because it is an issue that raises the more detailed legal considerations. I will deal with at first the secondary objection, as it was described, the matter the subject of oral evidence from Mr Jahnke concerning some conversations with the accused. In the statement of Mr Jahnke prepared on 7 February 2014, he gives evidence of a number of conversations that were had between himself and Mr Prasad initially and then subsequently with Mr Hong. The conversations had with the accused at least, at the time of the stopping of the car and subsequently, were the subject of audio visual recording. The police officer had a device attached to him which would record the things that he said and people said in his presence. As I would understand it, although I have not seen the video recording, the video recording of relevant events occurred from within the police car.
	
	
	It turns out that from 7.03pm onwards the sound recording ceased to operate. Consequently I have evidence from Mr Jahnke that the conversations that are recorded in his statement up unto and including para 9, although para 9 itself does not contain any conversations, were recorded in his statement from the recording of the voices of himself and Mr Prasad. All subsequent conversations therein after appear in particularly in paras 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, et cetera are prepared by the Senior Constable from his memory or recollection of those conversations. No issues are taken in relation to that aspect of the Constable's evidence. That would appear to be not the subject of any specific legal issue that arises for determination on the voir dire. It certainly will no doubt be a matter that might need to be addressed in the presence of the jury.
	
	
	What is objected to specifically by counsel for the accused is part of the conversation with the accused occurring after the Senior Constable asked Mr Prasad, (see p 5 of Jahnke's statement dated 7 February 2014) ""Is there anything illegal in the car?"". The accused replied according to the statement, ""Yeah. There's probably an ice pipe in the back somewhere"". Then there is a typographical error in the statement. It would appear the constable said, ""Where did you say you were going again?"" but the transcript goes on to say the Constable said, ""Okay, as I said before, I'm going to search you. I'll just remind you that failing to comply may be an offence"". The response of the accused to that question and subsequent questions, down to the bottom of p 5 of the statement is the relevant portion of the statement which the accused seeks to have excluded through the submission of his learned counsel.
	
	
	What is essentially submitted is that in the context of the circumstances as the Constable then understood them to be, particularly from the time that the accused admitted that there was, ""probably an ice pipe in the back"", but taking into account other circumstances as well, the Constable was obliged to caution the accused. This he did not do, although later he did caution the accused.
	
	
	What is relied upon, particularly in respect of s 139 Evidence Act is, in the circumstances in the evidence of the Senior Constable, the provision within s 139(5) Evidence Act, that states that a person:
	


""Who is under arrest, includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating official for the purpose of being questioned if (b) the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do so … (c) the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she wished to do so.""


	
	Those are the particular matters referred to, although as I would understand the matter from the evidence that's emerged, I would imagine that counsel for the accused would also rely upon s139(5)(a):
	


""The official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person who has committed an offence that is to be the subject of questioning … ""


	
	I do not need to dilate upon the matter because I am quite satisfied it was admitted by the officer that the accused would not have been permitted to leave if he sought to do so. The accused, although not told he was under arrest, was constructively under arrest.
	
	
	Thus the terms of s 139(1) are engaged.  That relevant provision states:
	


""That for the purposes of s 138(1)(a) evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if...the person was under arrest for an offence at the time and the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered because of the office that he or she held to arrest the person and before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person, the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.""


	
	It is clear on the evidence on the voir dire that the accused, firstly, was under arrest. The questioning was conducted by an investigating official and the relevant questions and answers, the subject of objection which I have identified, occurred without a caution being administered.
	
	
	However that is not the end of the matter. Of course, s 139 is to be read in conjunction with s 138, of the Act. I pause for a moment to point out as I have already pointed out to the learned Crown and to counsel for the accused, that it seems to me with the greatest of respect that in the overall scheme of things there appears to be no particular adverse effect, beyond what is already available from other evidence, upon the accused by the admission into evidence of the relevant conversation the subject of objection.
	
	
	There would appear to be three relevant ""admissions,"" made by the accused in the impugned conversation. Firstly, that he was going to, ""Bondi"". He was meeting, ""A mate of his,"" referring obviously to Mr Hong and thirdly that $65 in his pocket was money that he told the police officer when asked, ""Why is this money down here in your pocket and not in your wallet"", ""I was going to go to the pokies and have a slap"".
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out of course the accused was driving the car on Old South Head, Bellevue Hill. He was heading in the direction of Rose Bay which is not too far away from Bondi. He asserted that he was going to meet a mate of the person who the Crown would say primarily in possession of drugs and cash, which appears to me to be unremarkable. His explanation for having $65 in his pocket, rather than his wallet, appears to be of no real significance. I discussed these matters briefly with learned counsel for the accused. He sought to rely upon their lack of adverse evidentiary value to the accused as being a matter I could take into account militating in favour of exclusion given the terms of s 138(3), that is the “probative value” of the evidence is very slight, and the evidence is not particularly important in the proceedings as I would understand it. That having been said of course it is conceded as I understand it that there was no deliberate or reckless impropriety, assuming of course, as I have said earlier, that I conclude that the action of not cautioning was relevantly ""improper"" as s 139 provides.
	
	
	The gravity of the impropriety or contravention in my view was not great. It was a fluid situation the officer was facing. He said himself he was forming particular views about the matter as it unfolded. He made observations of the manner, particularly of the co-accused, that raised suspicions in his mind, and of course the fact the accused said he ‘probably had an ice pipe’ in the car would have further raised suspicions.
	
	
	He made concessions in cross-examination about what his reasonable belief was at the relevant time that seemed to be inconsistent with the evidence that he gave in re-examination on the matter. I hasten to say that ultimately in the scheme of things, notwithstanding what I have said about the probative value of the evidence, to my mind it has almost complete lack of importance, my view is in the context of the terms of s 138(1), having concluded in the manner that I have that the evidence was improperly obtained or obtained ""in consequence of an impropriety"", and bearing in mind the Crown bears the onus in relation to the matter, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.
	
	
	Although in the scheme of things whilst technically there are admissions made the admissions themselves are of little evidentiary value. I have concluded on the balancing exercise, bearing in mind as I said the burden worn by the Crown, that the relevant portion of the conversation objected to should be admitted.
	
	
	That takes me to the issue of the admissibility of the text messages, I think it is important in relation to that matter to address the matter from the perspective of the learned Crown. I firstly note that I accept the submissions of the Crown as to what the Crown says is the legal position in respect of evidence sought to be admitted post Evidence Act, that previously was admissible for what could be called ""Harriman"" purposes (Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590). This was a decision of the High Court that permitted the admission of evidence of criminal conduct of an accused person occurring on occasions other than that the subject of the charge, if the evidence was relevant to establishing a matter other than the fact that the accused was a person of bad character or otherwise had a propensity to commit crimes of the type of which he is charged.
	
	
	To summarise the matter perhaps from the judgment of McColl JA in a decision that the Crown referred me to (R v Mostyn [2004] NSW CCA 97), Harriman v The Queen was a decision where each of the judges of the High Court in their various ways held:
	


""That the evidence of the accused’s prior involvement with another person in the sale of heroin was admissible on the ground that it was highly probative of the criminal character of the accused’s association with that person in Thailand (at the time or on the occasion of the commission of the offence for subject of trial).""


	
	Of course, when one reads what McColl JA neatly summaries at [129] - [133], her Honour particularises various bases upon which that may be so. Likewise in another judgment to which the Crown referred the Court, the decision of Quach [2002] NSW CCA 519 (the Crown gave me a copy of the Australian Criminal Reports version), in the judgment of Spigelman CJ. His Honour, particularly at [24] - [42], went in some detail to identify the various bases upon which their Honours in the decision of Harriman had concluded that evidence of what could be called prior or other criminal conduct was relevant to a fact in issue in the case.
	
	
	I need for the purpose of citing Harriman, perhaps only for illustration purposes, identify two passages from two separate judgments of that case to illustrate the summary provided by McColl J in the later judgment of Mostyn.
	
	
	Brennan J in Harriman identified the principle at p 594 in the following way,
	


“where evidence does show more than the mere commission of another offence or predisposition to commit an offence and is otherwise probative of the offence charged or of a fact in issue, there is no rule of evidence which compels its exclusion. If, as a matter of human experience, the evidence tends to establish the offence charge or a fact in issue posited … otherwise than by showing merely the commission of another offence or a propensity to commit an offence the evidence is admissible. I would therefore respectively agree with McHugh J that evidence of events which are part of the res gestae is admissible and will usually be admitted even if that evidence reveals the commission of an offence other than the offence charged”.


	
	I interpose this reading of that passage to point out, as the learned Crown properly pointed out to me, that notwithstanding the fact the expression “res gestae” has its origins in the common law, in the context of the provisions of the Evidence Act as Quach and Mostyn makes clear, evidence forming part of the res gestae may be admissible for the purposes submitted by the Crown. Providing, of course in the context of what I am concerned with, that the evidence does not establish a relevant tendency on the part of the accused in circumstances where the Crown otherwise does not rely upon tendency reasoning which is the case here, there being no ‘tendency’ notice served.
	
	
	Gaudron J stated the principle as follows, at p 613:
	


""Evidence which shows no more than the propensity of an accused to engage in criminal conduct of a particular kind, or that the accused is the sort of person likely to commit the offence charged, is not admissible to prove that he committed the offence charged...however the evidence which has a high probative value and raises as a matter of common sense and experience the improbability of the offence charged having been committed other than as claimed by the prosecution is admissible in a criminal trial, notwithstanding that it discloses prior criminal conduct or a propensity to commit the offence.""


	
	The reading of those passages, and other passages that have been cited by Spigelman CJ from Harriman, demonstrates the fact that the admissibility of the evidence on the basis of relevance (s 55 Evidence Act) turns upon the evidence having a purpose other than a purpose to establish either a ""propensity"" as it was expressed in common law terms, now called ""tendency"" under the Evidence Act (unless admissible for that purpose), or a purpose other than simply to show the commission of other offences by the accused in the relevant case.
	
	
	The objection of the accused hones in upon relevant text messages appearing in the schedule of text messages downloaded from the accused’s phone by police which would be the subject of opinion evidence from Detective Sergeant Adam Pierce. Detective Sergeant Adam Pierce's statement purports to identify various text messages and express opinions about whether those text messages are possibly concerned with, or consistent with, discussion of transactions relating to the supply of drugs.
	
	
	In fairness to the Crown's position it is important to note some of the matters that were identified by the learned Crown Prosecutor in his helpful submissions at the end of the voir dire yesterday. The Crown clearly submitted, as I accept, that the Harriman principle still applies, notwithstanding the subsequent enactment of the Evidence Act. The Crown is permitted to produce evidence relevant to the issue of ""relationship"" of the accused with his co-accused in the context of what the Crown alleges to be a “joint criminal enterprise” where a jury might end up concluding, absent other evidence, that the person who was in possession of the relevant drugs was not the accused but the man Hong. I point out, I hasten to say, that Mr Hong has pleaded guilty before me today in relation to the supply of the drugs subject of the indictment relating to this particular accused.
	
	
	Furthermore, the Crown submitted that in accordance with ‘Harriman principles’ surviving with the enactment of the Evidence Act, that evidence of what could be called ""res gestae"" that is evidence of a series of events related to a particular transaction the subject matter of the charge, would be admissible in accordance with the decisions of Mostyn and Quach amongst others. The Crown submitted that the evidence it seeks to rely upon of text messages, the subject of objection by counsel for the accused goes, to show that the accused was in the business of supplying prohibited drugs, either generally or specifically and it was also submitted that the relevant text messages show the relationship between the accused and the co-accused. This is in the context of what the Crown submitted to be a joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	The Crown fairly conceded that there are some difficulties for it to overcome. One difficulty identified was text messages that lacked a contemporaneity with the course of events which point to the existence of a joint criminal enterprise between the accused and Mr Hong to supply the particular drugs, the subject of the charge.
	
	
	The other particular matter the Crown fairly conceded in its submissions was the difficulty of establishing relevant matters particularly in respect of purported ""res gestae"" issues where particular text messages could reasonably be said to relate to drugs other than the drug ‘methylamphetamine’.
	
	
	It is in this context that particular text messages numbers 3668-3674, that is text messages sent to the accused's phone between 6.17pm and 8.19pm on 5/2/2014, were the subject of objection by the accused on a basis that the Crown fairly conceded had substance. That is, those relevant text messages might be regarded as not being concerned with the supply of methylamphetamine, but might be concerned with the supply of a drug shortly described as GHB. Mr Jahnke gave evidence today that the use of the expression ""drinkage"" in some of those messages would be understood by him, consistent with a COPS entry that he made in relation to the matter on the night of the accused's arrest, with inquiries being made about obtaining the drug GHB. A drug not the subject of charge in this case.
	
	
	I agree with the Crown's general submission that a number of the text messages, the subject of objection, might reasonably be seen to suggest, at least, inquiries made of the accused concerning the obtaining of prohibited drugs and could be considered by a tribunal of fact as indicating that the accused was in the business of supplying drugs. But the admissibility of the evidence does not turn upon establishing that matter by itself, unless the Crown sought to rely upon the issue of the accused supplying drugs on a regular basis as evidence in a relevant ‘tendency’ on his part that was admissible pursuant to s 97 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Ultimately, on examination of the various text messages noting the specific objections of counsel for the accused and the submissions made by the learned Crown, I have come to the conclusion that, firstly, the text messages, the subject of objection, do not fit within Harriman's principles, because what they may establish about the relationship of the accused with other people does not inform the relationship of the accused with the man Hong. In that respect, in the careful written submissions of the accused which I have not referred to at this point, Mr Munro for the accused accurately reflects the issue that is to be considered in the context of what the Crown says is ‘relationship evidence’. That is, whether there is evidence capable of establishing by reason of activities on other occasions the character of the relationship between the accused and Mr Hong, not anyone else.
	
	
	I have received no evidence nor any particular submission to suggest that the various text messages the subject of objection are in fact messages between the accused and Hong reflecting upon their relationship at the relevant time. As I have earlier pointed out, it was as McColl J succinctly stated that:
	


""Evidence of the accused's prior involvement with X (that is Mr Martin) in the sale of heroin was admissible on the ground that it was highly probative of the criminal character of the accused's association (read relationship) with X (Mr Martin) in Thailand in April 1987.""


	
	That is the time at which the offence for which Mr Harriman was on trial, the subject of the appeal to the High Court.
	
	
	Furthermore, the difficulty the Crown identified in his very helpful submissions about establishing anything of relevance to the charge in question by the accused's involvement in the supply of different drugs is another factor that militates in favour of exclusion. Thus, the conclusion I have reached is that the relevant text messages, the subject of objection by the accused, are not admissible because they are not relevant to a fact in issue to the trial.
	
	
	Alternatively, in my view, if they served the probative purpose asserted by the Crown and thus had relevance, it is quite clear, in my view, where such text messages might by reason of their timing or by reason of their content be sensibly concerned with criminal conduct other than that, the subject of the charge they are matters where the probative value is clearly outweighed by the unfair prejudice to the accused. But as I said, when it is all said and done, conceding all that has been said by the Crown in terms of the legal issues that I have to consider, the relevance purported to be established by the Crown in the context of the terms of s 55 Evidence Act 1995 is not demonstrated.
	
	
	Thus, in the circumstances of the matter as I have foreshadowed, I will only permit into evidence the relevant text messages that are not objected to by the accused. The other text messages are excluded on the basis that they do not demonstrate a relationship between the accused and Mr Hong. Alternatively, they are concerned with criminal activity other than that with which I am concerned in this trial and are thus irrelevant as merely demonstrating ""a propensity"" or a ""tendency"" theoretically at least, on the part of the accused to commit crimes generally.
	
	
	I should particularly refer to text messages 3675 and 3676. These text messages were received on the accused's phone at 8.24 and 8.28pm on 5 February 2014 when the mobile phone taken from him at 7.15 was in the possession of the police. The Crown seeks those text messages to be admitted on the basis, amongst other things, that in those text messages the reference to ‘HG’ might be interpreted as being a reference to someone indicating to the accused that he or she wanted half a gram of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Consistent with the ruling that I have made, notwithstanding the reference to the use of the expression, ""ur friend Malaysia"", which possibly could be a reference to Mr Hong as with ""ur friend"" in the second message, and notwithstanding the timing of the message, I am not satisfied that it is capable of being considered as a message that has a relationship to the course of the ‘joint criminal enterprise’ that the Crown alleges against Mr Hong and Mr Prasad in respect of the drugs that were found within the car. That is, as with the other messages, it is not part of the purported “res gestae”.
	
	
	Prima facie, it would appear to me to be concerned with another transaction. As I have said earlier, I am not able to conclude that it has the probative value of establishing any particular relationship between the accused and Mr Hong.
	
	
	Thus, those two messages and the other messages on the last page of the schedule attached to Mr Pierce's statement are within the character of text messages, the subject of objection, which I would not admit.

		29 January 2016",2015-09-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767801,Cheih-Wei Lin v R [2015] NSWCCA 264,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J and his reasons. I also agree with the supplementary remarks of RA Hulme J. The orders of the Court will be those which have been proposed by Bellew J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J for the reasons his Honour has given.
	
	
	There are some further observations that I wish to make about the ""capacity"" of the District Court to deal with this trial as scheduled.
	
	
	As learned senior counsel for the respondent reminded us, there is no common law right to a speedy trial: Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23. But it does not reflect well on the criminal justice system in this State that a person arrested and refused bail in February 2014 is not brought to trial until almost two years later. And the prospect of delaying the trial further so that it does not occur until the applicant has been in custody for well in excess of two years is, in my view, untenable.
	
	
	It is notorious that delays in the disposal of criminal cases in the District Court have lengthened in the past year or two and that, unless additional resources are made available, they will continue to worsen.
	
	
	This is a concern, not only for the plight of accused persons (who are presumed to be innocent) who are held on remand, usually in crowded conditions of maximum security with limited or no access to work, programmes and education. It is a concern for the plight of victims of crime, especially crimes involving sexual assaults, and particularly in relation to children, for whom there is an obvious interest in having cases determined at the earliest time. It is also a concern for the viability of prosecutions which often rely upon the accuracy of memories of witnesses as to the events in question.
	
	
	The present trend of deterioration in the capacity of the District Court to finalise criminal cases in a timely fashion is a matter of considerable concern. In my respectful view, it is contrary to the public interest for it to be allowed to continue.
	
	
	BELLEW J: By notice filed on 22 September 2015 Chieh-Wei Lin (“the applicant”) seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s. 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against a decision of his Honour Judge Townsden delivered on 18 September 2015. On that day, pursuant to an application made by the Crown, his Honour ordered (inter alia) that the trial of the applicant and a number of co-offenders, which was due to commence in the District Court on 19 October 2015, be vacated.
	


FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	On 5 February 2014 the applicant and a number of other persons were arrested and charged with offences contrary to the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) arising from the alleged importation into Australia of quantities of methylamphetamine between 23 November 2013 and 5 February 2014. The applicant was refused bail at the time of her arrest and has been in custody ever since. Committal proceedings were heard over four single days between September 2014 and March 2015. The matter came before the District Court for the first time on 10 April 2015 when a trial date of 19 October 2015 was set. At that time the Court was informed that the estimate of the trial was three weeks.
	
	
	On 15 September 2015 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions discontinued the proceedings brought against one of the alleged offenders, David John Allton (“Allton”). On the following day the Director signed a new Indictment, the effect of which was to include additional charges against the applicant and one of her co-offenders.
	


THE APPLICATION TO VACATE THE TRIAL


	
	On 17 September 2015 the Crown filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the trial be vacated. An affidavit in support of that motion, sworn by the solicitor with the carriage of the matter, stated that the estimated length of the trial was now six weeks. This was said to be because:
	



	
	the Crown case would now take five weeks to complete;
	
	
	interpreters were required for one or more of the accused;
	
	
	the legal representatives for the applicant's co-accused had indicated that they would put the Crown to strict proof on all matters;
	
	
	there were evidentiary issues to be resolved by way of a voir dire;
	
	
	the Crown expected to call approximately 50 witnesses, a number of whom were either interstate or overseas;
	
	
	the new indictment charged additional offences; and
	
	
	a significant amount of further material had been served and disclosed since the committal proceedings.
	



	
	The affidavit went on to state that ""the interests of justice would require that the trial date be vacated"" because:
	



	
	it was anticipated that Allton would now give evidence for the Crown;
	
	
	the Crown was yet to serve tendency and coincidence notices;
	
	
	the additional charges contained in the Indictment may give rise to a conflict which would necessitate separate counsel being briefed for each of the co-accused; and
	
	
	it was expected that further evidentiary material would be obtained and served by investigating police between now and the trial (such material being described by the Crown in the course of the proceedings before the primary judge as ""substantial"").
	


THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE PRIMARY JUDGE


	
	Counsel for the applicant opposed the Crown's application before the primary judge. He pointed out, with some force, that the applicant had been in custody for a period of 19 months and that the vacation of the trial date would be likely to result in her spending more than two years in custody awaiting trial.
	
	
	Counsel also informed the primary judge that when the matter was listed for trial in April, the applicant's solicitors had made arrangements for a witness to travel to Sydney from Taiwan to give evidence at the trial. Arrangements had also been made for members of the applicant's family to travel to Sydney for the trial. Counsel explained that all of those persons had purchased pre-paid air tickets which were non-refundable, such that they would be put to significant expense if the trial date was vacated.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also made it clear that at least for his part, he did not intend to put the Crown to strict proof. On the contrary, he expressed the general view that as far as the applicant was concerned, much of the Crown's evidence could be admitted by consent, although he acknowledged that this did not bind any of the co-accused.
	
	
	The solicitor representing the co-accused before the primary judge also opposed the application. He indicated that senior counsel briefed for the co-accused had turned his mind to the question of the possible conflict suggested by the Crown, and had concluded that there was no impediment in his representing all of the co-accused. He also indicated that on present indications, and based upon a conversation with the principal solicitor acting for the co-accused, he was of the view that the trial could still be completed within three weeks. He too pointed to the fact that the co-accused had been held in custody since February 2014, and he referred to the fact that at the present time trials were being listed to take place in the District Court in May and June of 2016. This, he submitted, gave rise to the distinct possibility that if the trial date was vacated. all of the accused would have spent more than two years in custody prior to trial.
	


THE REASONS OF THE PRIMARY JUDGE


	
	The primary judge firstly made reference to the submissions of counsel for the applicant in the following terms:
	


“Mr Wendler has made a number of submissions that I have to say do carry considerable weight. The most important, of course, is that his client, together with the other accused, are all held in custody and it becomes an intolerable situation to some extent where a person would be denied their liberty without any particular findings and remanded in custody pending the outcome of the trial which is likely to be approximately two years from the time they first went into custody.”


	
	His Honour went on to say:
	


“I accept that this is very much a concerning situation, but the reality is that the original estimate that was given for the trial was for three weeks. Even then I would have to say that the estimate was optimistic. Even though the situation changed in respect of one of the accused, given the change of the Crown case and given the further charges, appear to be quite distinct; in fact, there is no doubt that the trial would be in the order of six weeks. I make that (sic) without any hesitation on what I have read at this stage. It is not going to go within the three week period. Even if I adjourn the matter pending a number of orders, such as the tendency notice and all other evidence to be served, the reality is that the trial will not be finished within that period of time. Now, true it is that often trials will go over for a week or so, but this trial would, of course, be in (sic) double the original estimate and, although there appears to be some issues in relation to delay with the service of evidence that I have heard today which are concerning, the reality is the situation has changed in relation to the charges that have been laid. So, although I do accept the competing considerations, and I do, that they are matters of considerable substance, the reality is that in terms of the listing arrangements of the court there is simply no capacity to deal with the matter at that stage in October given the length of the trial, which I accept, but also given the fact that a significant portion of the evidence is yet to be served on each of the accused. In the circumstances and for those reasons, I am going to grant the application of the Crown.”

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT


	
	Counsel for the applicant accepted that the decision of the primary judge involved the exercise of a discretion attracting the application of the principles set out in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was “notorious” that criminal trials often exceed their estimate, sometimes significantly so, and that the possibility of that occurring in the present case was not a proper reason to vacate the trial, and thus delay the proceedings for a further six to nine months.
	
	
	Counsel also pointed to the prejudice which would arise in light of the travel arrangements which had been made (on the basis of the original trial date) by the applicant's family, and by a witness to be called in her case.
	
	
	In response to some of the matters relied upon by the Crown before the primary judge, counsel for the applicant submitted that:
	



	
	the fact that some of the accused might require an interpreter was not uncommon;
	
	
	the applicant did not require an interpreter in any event;
	
	
	there was no evidence before the primary judge of the nature and extent of any issues requiring resolution on a voir dire;
	
	
	the suggestion that the prosecution would call a particular number of witnesses was not informative, particularly in circumstances where there had been no discussions directed towards reducing the number of witnesses to be called; and
	
	
	the presentation of a new indictment did not have any practical effect on the duration of the trial.
	



	
	It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the primary judge had, in effect, subordinated the applicant's length of pre-trial custody to the convenience of the management, by the Crown, of its case. It was submitted that in all of these circumstances, the decision of the primary judge to vacate the trial was an error in principle which had precipitated an injustice to the applicant and her co-accused.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE CROWN


	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that it was incumbent upon the applicant to point to an error in principle on the part of the primary judge in the exercise of his discretion: Pirrottina v R [1996] 88 A Crim R 220 at 223.
	
	
	Senior counsel emphasised that a decision to vacate a trial necessarily involved the exercise of a discretion, and that in the context of the present case, where no express error on the part of the primary judge was asserted by the applicant, the question for this Court was whether the decision to vacate the trial was so unreasonable, or so plainly unjust, that it could be inferred that the primary judge had failed to properly exercise the discretion which the law reposed in him: House at 505.
	
	
	It was submitted that the primary judge had taken into account all relevant factors and had exercised his discretion in a way which did not reflect error. It was submitted by senior counsel for the Crown that his Honour's conclusion reflected a proper balancing of the various competing interests.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	It has long been accepted that a refusal of an application by an accused for an adjournment is amenable to appeal pursuant to section 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: R v Yuill (1993) 69 A Crim R 450; R v Balic (1994) 75 A Crim R 509; R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286. Although the present case involves the granting of such an application by the Crown there is, for the purposes of section 5F, no material distinction between the two. It follows that the decision of the primary judge is an interlocutory judgment or order to which section 5F applies. The Crown did not contend otherwise.
	
	
	Although a number of submissions were put to him by the parties, it is evident from the reasons given by the primary judge that he exercised his discretion to vacate the trial date on one basis, namely, that the trial would now be likely to exceed its original estimate. In my view, it is evident from his Honour's reasons that he gave primacy to a suggested increase in the length of the trial and allowed that circumstance to prevail over what he himself described as the intolerable consequence that the applicant would be detained in custody for two years awaiting trial.
	
	
	Although it is not desirable from the point of view of the administration of any Court, the fact remains that it is not uncommon for trials to exceed their original estimate. Whether this will occur in the case of the applicant and her co-accused is a matter of conjecture. Certainly the solicitor appearing for the co-accused before the primary judge expressed some view that the trial could be completed within its original estimate. However even if the view were reached that the trial would exceed that estimate, a determination which allowed that circumstance to outweigh the obviously significant, and adverse, consequences to the applicant was, in my view, one which was unreasonable and plainly unjust. The primary judge's determination reflects a failure to properly exercise the discretion reposed in him.
	
	
	It is also important to bear in mind that the consequences, to the applicant, of the vacation of the trial date were not limited to having to spend a further significant period in custody. The consequences extended to the significant inconvenience and the expense to which members of her family, and a witness whom she apparently wishes to call to give evidence in her case, would be put if the trial was vacated. Although counsel addressed the primary judge in relation to those matters, his Honour made no reference to them in his reasons. They were, in my view, clearly relevant to the exercise of his discretion. I am left to conclude that they were not taken into account.
	
	
	It is also significant, in my view, that in exercising his discretion his Honour found that there was ""simply no capacity"" for the court to deal with a six week, as opposed to a three week, trial. This was, evidently, a circumstance to which his Honour had regard in exercising his discretion. Needless to say, an increase in the estimate of a trial has the capacity to affect the administration arrangements of the District Court to some degree. However, there was simply no evidence before his Honour to support the finding that the Court had ""no capacity"" to deal with the trial at all. That, in my view, is a further reflection of the failure on the part of the primary judge to properly exercise his discretion.
	
	
	For all of these reasons I am satisfied that error is established.
	
	
	Having vacated the trial his Honour made consequential orders requiring the service by the Crown of a tendency notice within 14 days and the service of ""the remainder of the brief"" within four weeks. I have already noted that the applicant was arrested in February 2014, some 19 months ago. The trial date of 19 October was set 6 months ago. A suggestion that the ""remainder of the brief"" is still to be served at this late stage is wholly unsatisfactory, as is the suggested service of a tendency notice. In view of the conclusions I have reached, I propose that the entirety of the orders made by the primary judge be vacated and that the matter be remitted to the District Court for the trial to commence on 19 October 2015. Whether the Crown should be permitted to rely upon material or notices which are yet to be served will be a matter for determination by the trial judge.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted;
	
	
	The appeal is allowed;
	
	
	The orders of the primary judge are set aside; and
	
	
	The matter is remitted to the District Court of New South Wales for trial commencing on 19 October 2015.

2767806,Osborne v R [2015] NSWCCA 260,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Wilson J. 
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: This is an application pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Lakatos SC in the District Court at Sydney on 19 May 2014, for an offence of reckless wounding.
	
	
	The offence is contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period (“SNPP”) of three years is specified in the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“CSP Act”).
	
	
	The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of three years to date from 18 May 2014 and expiring on 17 May 2017. A non-parole period (“NPP”) of two years was specified. The earliest release date is 17 May 2016. As the ratio of sentence suggests, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances in the applicant’s favour pursuant to s 44(2) of the CSP Act.
	
	
	A single ground of appeal is advanced, that “the sentence is manifestly excessive”.
	
	
	The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 4 May 2015, a Notice of Intention to Appeal having been filed on 19 May 2014, and extended until 19 May 2015.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	The applicant was arraigned before his Honour and a jury panel on 18 March 2014. The indictment contained two counts, being one count of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and, in the alternative, one count of reckless wounding.
	
	
	The applicant entered a plea of not guilty to the more serious offence and a plea of guilty to the alternative charge. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the principal charge on 26 March 2014. Although there was general agreement as to the facts of the matter, it fell to his Honour to find the facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. No complaint is made by the applicant concerning his Honour’s conclusions of fact.
	
	
	The following summary is taken from the sentencing judge’s Remarks on Sentence (“ROS”).
	
	
	The offence occurred on the evening of Saturday 13 April 2013 at a hotel in Clovelly. The applicant and the victim of the offence, Jai Hitchcox, had separately attended the Clovelly Hotel, and each was drinking with friends in an upstairs bar area, adjacent to a dance floor.
	
	
	At around nine o’clock that evening the applicant went to the lounge bar to buy a round of drinks. Also at the bar purchasing drinks was Jarrod Farlow and Lauren Grdusiak. Both were friends of Mr Hitchcox. Although the evidence of precisely what was said was disputed, the applicant had some conversation with Ms Grdusiak, and subsequently Mr Farlow, which became, at least, tense.
	
	
	The victim approached the bar and, concluding that there was some sort of altercation between the applicant and his friends, stood immediately behind the applicant and demanded of him, “Mate, what’s the fucking problem”. The sentencing judge regarded that initial interrogative as “indicative of aggression”, rather than exclusively connected with the defence of his friends.
	
	
	There was some further conversation between the victim and the applicant, the content of which was disputed.
	
	
	After that the applicant, who had purchased drinks and had a schooner glass of beer in each hand, turned away from the bar. Without warning, he changed direction and stepped directly towards Mr Hitchcox, who had also moved away from the bar. Without any further exchange between the men the applicant raised both hands and forcefully pushed the schooner glasses into the victim’s face, with one glass smashing on impact into either side of Mr Hitchcox’s face. The assault was captured by security cameras in operation in the hotel.
	
	
	There was a short struggle between the men before the applicant fled, running towards an exit door, down a flight of stairs, and out of the hotel. He was pursued by security guards and apprehended a short distance away in Clovelly Road.
	
	
	Still in the bar area, Mr Hitchcox stumbled and fell to the floor. Hotel patrons gave what assistance they could and an ambulance was summonsed. The victim was taken to hospital. He had sustained a number of lacerations to both sides of his face and neck, and fragments of glass were embedded in the wounds.
	
	
	Upon examination treating doctors noted a number of injuries: a four centimetre wound to the right side of the face which had led to arterial bleeding; a second wound of similar size to the right aspect of the lip; two superficial lacerations respectively on the right and left sides of the throat; two wounds to the left side of the mouth; and a “W” shaped broad tear running from the left side of the nose to the left cheek, with the central component of the tissue of the left nostril torn. The injuries to the victim were described as “significant”, and there was extensive facial scarring as a result of them.
	
	
	The victim, who gave a victim impact statement to the sentencing court, said that he suffered from disturbed sleep, negative thoughts, anxiety and irritation as a result of the offence. He had been obliged to leave the job he had held for over three years, and he had lost his position as a professional junior rugby league footballer with one of the clubs in the National Rugby League. His future as a professional footballer had been set back by twelve months. A nascent modelling career had been jeopardised or ended by the facial scarring with which Mr Hitchcox had been left.
	
	
	Having been apprehended by security officers the applicant was soon after arrested by police and taken to Maroubra Police Station. He agreed to be interviewed, and admitted having “thrown” a glass into the victim’s face. He told the interviewing officers that Mr Hitchcox and Mr Farlow had threatened him and given him “grief”, and that Mr Hitchcox, whom he described as “bolshie” and “intimidating”, had pushed and prodded him.
	
	
	When asked by the police to explain his attack upon Mr Hitchcox, the applicant said that he had recently separated from his partner who had returned to her home in Canada; he was lonely; tired after a difficult week; and was feeling upset about a recent soccer injury. He blamed Mr Hitchcox for provoking him by his “quite unnecessary” conduct.
	
	
	Both men had been drinking, with the victim well affected by alcohol at the time, and the applicant regarded by police as moderately affected.
	


The Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant, in attacking the victim with the two schooner glasses, was acting from frustration or anger, after a degree of provocation had been extended to him.
	
	
	His Honour found that, although it was objectively not so, the victim had considered his friends to be under threat from the applicant, and he had intervened, as he thought, in their defence. His intervention was aggressive in tone, and the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant perceived it as such. Whilst his Honour did not conclude, as the applicant urged, that the victim in fact poked or prodded the applicant, he did find that Mr Hitchcox had waved his hand and fingers close to the applicant’s face, and that the applicant regarded this, not unreasonably, as provocative.
	
	
	The sentencing judge found that the applicant became increasingly annoyed at Mr Hitchcox, and agitated by the events and, losing control of his temper, lashed out at the victim. His Honour concluded that the use of two glasses as weapons aggravated the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant had moved towards the victim without warning, and struck him to both sides of his face intentionally, and being fully aware that he was holding a beer glass in each hand. Consistent with the verdict of the jury the sentencing judge held that, whilst the applicant had not intended to cause grievous injury, he had been reckless as to that possibility.
	
	
	Alcohol consumption by both protagonists played a role in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The injuries occasioned to Mr Hitchcox were extensive, required suturing, and left “significant scarring” to the face and neck. There had been adverse consequences for the victim’s equanimity, and for his employment prospects as a model and footballer.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant’s loss of control of his temper had been precipitated by his “fractious” emotional state, and by the display of aggression from the victim. Although the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant reasonably perceived that the victim’s conduct was provocative, he concluded that,
	


“[…] that provocation in my view in no way justified the serious assault which was actually perpetrated and was not a reasonable response to the provocation which was offered. Neither the norms of society nor the principles of the criminal law permit or countenance a very violent response to a comparatively low grade provocation.” (ROS 13)


	
	His Honour noted that the applicant’s conduct had been “very serious”. Although the applicant had submitted that a sentence other than a custodial term was appropriate, the sentencing judge concluded,
	


“I consider that the sudden, unprovoked, and serious assault using two beer glasses is a very serious offence which in my judgment warrants no less than a term of full-time custody.” (ROS 13)


	
	Having referred to the sometimes oppositional factors set out in s 3A of the CSP Act, the sentencing judge noted that, despite the many features in the applicant’s favour, his offence was “extremely serious” (ROS 16), and only a sentence of full-time custody could adequately address the criminality of the offence.
	


The Applicant’s Personal Circumstances


	
	The applicant’s subjective case was a compelling one, and the sentencing judge made a number of findings favourable to the applicant. He set out the evidence in detail in his Remarks.
	
	
	At the time of sentencing the applicant was aged 35 years; he was 34 years old when the offence was committed. He had no criminal history.
	
	
	Born in England, the applicant travelled to Australia in 2006 for a vacation, but he stayed on, and became a permanent resident. He retains the support of his family in England.
	
	
	The applicant completed tertiary studies in England, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Technology. He has undertaken further studies in Australia, and was in his second year studying for a diploma in arboriculture when sentence was imposed upon him. In a reference before the sentencing court his arboriculture teacher spoke of the applicant as an honest, conscientious, and hardworking man of steady disposition.
	
	
	The applicant was in permanent employment at the time of sentence, working as the Operations Manager for a Sydney arboreal firm. He was highly regarded by those with whom he worked, the principle of the firm having given evidence of the applicant’s good character during the trial.
	
	
	Other character testimonials before the sentencing court were uniformly positive, with the applicant described by the respective authors as responsible, caring, decent, reliable, and a “gentle soul”. The applicant was regarded as extremely remorseful by all those who provided a reference or report to the court.
	
	
	In a report prepared for the court by a Community Corrections Officer the applicant was noted to have accepted responsibility for his conduct, and demonstrated insight into it. He was assessed as at low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	The applicant told the Community Corrections Officer that at age 18 he began drinking alcohol on a regular basis, in some periods of his life consuming as many as ten “pints” of beer each week. Whilst a resident in Australia the applicant had a lower intake of alcohol, drinking about four standard drinks each week. He lessened his alcohol intake further after the commission of the current offence, recognising the role that alcohol had played.
	
	
	In February 2013 the applicant’s partner of four years left Australia for Canada, ending the couple’s relationship. The applicant attributed his mood on the day of the offence, at least in part, to the breakdown of this relationship.
	
	
	After being charged with the offence the applicant sought treatment from a clinical psychologist and, as at the date of sentence, he had attended some 15 sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy directed towards the low mood and feelings of depression and anxiety that beset him when awaiting the finalisation of the criminal proceedings. A report from the psychologist who had treated the applicant was tendered to the sentencing court on his behalf.
	
	
	The psychologist reported that the applicant exhibited features consistent with a diagnosis of “Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate”, in partial remission. The applicant had complained of feelings of worthlessness, an inability to concentrate, and being stressed and anxious about his future. He presented as remorseful for his conduct, and motivated to address his “issues”.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was insightful into his offending conduct and understood both the link between alcohol consumption and the offence, and the need to put strategies in place to prevent any reoccurrence of such aggression.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant was genuinely remorseful, and had displayed feelings of grief and guilt concerning his conduct. He accepted that the conduct was entirely out of character, and regarded it as most unlikely that the applicant would re-offend, assessing the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as both good, and optimistic.
	


Other Matters Relevant to Sentence


	
	As was submitted by both parties to be appropriate, the sentencing judge gave the applicant the benefit of a 25% reduction on the sentence that would have otherwise applied, because of the early plea. Although the matter had proceeded to trial in relation to the s 33 offence, the applicant had indicated prior to committal that he was guilty of the s 35(4) alternative offence. The plea of guilty with respect to that charge was thus an early one with considerable utilitarian value.
	
	
	His Honour gave consideration to a number of authorities relied upon by both the applicant and the Crown. The applicant had provided the sentencing court with the decisions of Wilson v R [2009] NSWCCA 73 and R v Towers [2000] NSWSC 420. The Crown relied upon R v Miria [2009] NSWCCA 68. The sentencing judge referred also to Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307, and particularly to [47] of that decision, which is, in part, as follows,
	


“The offence, popularly known as ""glassing"", is becoming so prevalent in licensed premises that there are moves on foot to stem the opportunity for the offence to be committed by earlier closing times and the use of plastic containers. The courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty.”


	
	Mr Sayin had pleaded guilty to and been sentenced for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to the former s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. That offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment of seven years. The applicant had become irritated with another patron who was talking during a live comedy performance in the bar of a Darlinghurst hotel. When the patron did not leave the bar as the applicant demanded of him, the applicant punched him once to the face. He was holding a spirit glass at the time. The glass smashed against the victim’s face, and he sustained a number of significant lacerations, together with two badly chipped front teeth and a fractured nose. The judge at first instance had imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment, with a NPP of three years. Absent the discount to reflect the plea of guilty, the starting point of the sentence would have been an overall term of five years and nine months.
	
	
	On appeal this Court concluded that the starting point of the sentence was so close to the maximum penalty that it was excessive, in that the offence could not be said to be in the worst category of matters of its type, particularly as the injuries fell well short of the sort of terrible and permanent injury that is encompassed by grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In R v Towers Grove J sentenced the offender for one count of malicious wounding contrary to the former s 35(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years, and which was included in Table 1 of Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1999 as an offence able to be dealt with summarily unless the accused or prosecutor elected to have the matter tried on indictment. Dealt with summarily a two year sentence of imprisonment was the applicable jurisdictional maximum.
	
	
	The offender had originally been charged with the victim’s murder but the Crown ultimately accepted a plea to the s 35(a) offence in full discharge of the indictment. In the circumstances, his Honour was conscious that, but for the more serious charge, the offender would have received summary jurisdiction. The offender had inflicted a number of cuts to the victim, with his Honour concluding that seven separate blows were landed upon the victim, whilst the offender was holding a piece of broken glass.
	
	
	The offender had spent ten months in custody on remand for murder. Having regard to that period of pre-sentence custody, Grove J imposed a three year good behaviour bond upon the offender.
	
	
	R v Miria was a Crown appeal against sentence imposed upon the respondent for a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 as it was at the material time, in 2008. The maximum penalty specified for that offence was 25 years imprisonment. A SNPP of seven years applied. The offence had occurred at a hotel, when the victim was endeavouring to leave. He had inadvertently bumped into another patron, and some words were exchanged. The respondent, who was not involved in the exchange, then moved towards the victim and swung his arm at him. He was holding a beer glass in that hand. The victim turned to avoid the blow, but was struck on the back of his head and to his neck. The glass shattered. Other than sharp pain, no injury is referred to in the judgment, although the plea of guilty to the offence establishes that grievous bodily harm was occasioned.
	
	
	At first instance, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment, suspended upon entering what was referred to in the judgment as “a recognisance to be of good behaviour,” more correctly, a good behaviour bond, for two years.
	
	
	The Crown appealed to this Court on a number of grounds, including a ground complaining that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. This Court concluded at [22] that,
	


“[…] allowing for all the aspects of the strong subjective matters found by his Honour, a sentence of 2 years imprisonment suspended from operation is so far below an appropriate range for offending in these circumstances that the ground that the sentence is manifestly inadequate should be upheld.”


	
	On re-sentence, and noting that the sentence would be less than it would have been if imposed in circumstances other than after a successful Crown appeal, this Court sentenced the respondent to a NPP of two years imprisonment, with a balance of term of two years.
	


Ground 1: The Sentence was Manifestly Excessive


	
	Although pleaded as a complaint of manifest excess, the applicant argued that the sentencing judge erred in “giving too much significance to the objective seriousness of the offence, and to general deterrence, and inadequate weight to the extremely strong subjective case” (applicant’s written submissions at p.7).
	
	
	With a starting point of sentence of four years imprisonment prior to the reduction allowed for the utilitarian value of his plea, the applicant argued that the sentence was excessive.
	
	
	In response, the Crown contended that the applicant’s offence was a very serious one, occasioning serious injuries. The strength of the applicant’s subjective case was acknowledged, but the Crown submitted that all relevant features had been taken into account by the sentencing judge, and the sentence imposed was one within the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	


Consideration


	
	The imposition of sentence following criminal conviction is a discretionary judgment. An appeal against sentence is an appeal against the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. The relevant considerations on appeal are those identified in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at [504]-[505].
	
	
	Is specific error shown? That is, was there an error of principle? Did the sentencing judge allow extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Did the sentencing judge fail to consider some material matter? Was there a mistake as to the facts?
	
	
	If no specific error can be identified, is the sentence imposed unreasonable or plainly unjust, that is, either manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate?
	
	
	The applicant pleads manifest excess and, although no specific error has been identified, three complaints are made by him.
	


His Honour Gave Too Much Significance to Objective Seriousness


	
	The applicant contends that the sentencing judge gave too much significance to the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The process of evaluating a sentence to be imposed is an instinctive one. As was noted in Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [34],
	


“The assessment of objective criminality when a standard non-parole period is provided should be approached intuitively based upon the general experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence at issue; R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]; R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [26].”


	
	A sentencing judge is required to identify all of the features relevant to the crime and the offender, have regard to any sentencing principles that may be applicable, consider the significance of each matter, and then make what is a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.
	
	
	What weight is to be given to the objective seriousness of a particular offence is a matter for the individual sentencing judge, although it is axiomatic that it must always be a matter of considerable importance.
	
	
	Only by giving proper attention to the seriousness of the crime can a sentencing court fulfil its obligations pursuant to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in particular, to ensure adequate punishment of the offender, to make the offender accountable, to denounce the offender’s conduct, and to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community.
	
	
	This was a very serious example of an offence of reckless wounding.
	
	
	In making an assessment of the gravity of the applicant’s crime, his Honour had regard to the immediate background to it, that being the altercation between the applicant and Mr Farlow, and the aggressive approach of Mr Hitchcox, the latter including Mr Hitchcox’s act of waving his fingers in front of the applicant’s face during the brief verbal exchange between the two. His Honour accepted that the applicant, not unreasonably, would have regarded this conduct as provocative.
	
	
	The sentencing judge (correctly in my view) noted that the small degree of provocation involved could in no way answer for the applicant’s response. The degree to which the provocation could have mitigated the offence was plainly small.
	
	
	Whilst this conduct preceded the assault by the applicant upon Mr Hitchcox, the two men had moved apart and away from each other at the point at which the applicant turned without warning and thrust the beer glasses, which were used as weapons, into the victim’s face. This was done, his Honour concluded, with force and intending to cause hurt, reckless as to the possibility of harm being occasioned.
	
	
	The injuries were extensive, with significant facial scarring resulting from the injuries.
	
	
	The element of recklessness for the purposes of s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 is made out by proof of intention or knowledge: s 4A Crimes Act 1900. In the applicant’s case, his Honour concluded that the applicant intentionally struck the victim in the face and neck with the two schooner glasses knowing that hurt would be occasioned (ROS p.12). This conclusion marks the offence as one involving a very high degree of recklessness.
	
	
	The “wound” that resulted from this forceful assault was very serious, particularly in the context of what is required for proof of that element of the offence. A wound is established upon proof of a breach of the sub-cutaneous or interior layer of the skin: R v Smith (1837) 8 Carrington & Payne 173. To be a “wound” for the purposes of an offence contrary to s.35(4) a laceration of no great significance would suffice. In R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 351 for example, this Court accepted, at [32], that a “split lip” from a punch to the mouth is a wound, albeit one of a technical nature.
	
	
	Although it was not necessary for his Honour to rank or categorise the applicant’s crime by reference to a notional range of gravity (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [29]) it is clear that he considered it to be a serious example of a s 35(4) offence. Given the deliberation and force with which the applicant intentionally thrust the two full glasses into a particularly vulnerable part of his victim’s body, the face and neck, and having regard to the number, depth, and severity of the wounds that were inflicted, that characterisation was well open to his Honour.
	
	
	Having made the assessment he did, the sentencing judge was obliged to give the gravity of the crime significant weight in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	It is difficult to see how “too much” significance could be given to this aspect of the sentencing process.
	


His Honour Gave Too Much Significance to General Deterrence


	
	In his written submissions, at [11], the applicant conceded that,
	


“What have been referred to as offences involving a ‘glassing’ have attracted significant and appropriate attention by this Court, particularly in relation to the need for sentencing courts to give effect to denunciation and general deterrence by stern sentences.”


	
	Indeed, so frequent have such offences become that they have attracted the colloquial title used by the applicant of “glassing”. In Sayin, cited at [46] above, this Court made it clear that sentencing courts “must impose very severe penalties”. The same statement has been adopted and repeated in other cases involving the use of a glass as a weapon: see R v Spooner [2009] NSWCCA 247 at [20], for example.
	
	
	Whilst his Honour concluded – in the applicant’s favour – that specific deterrence was not a relevant consideration, he was very conscious of the need for the sentence imposed to import a significant element of general deterrence.
	
	
	Arguably, in the seven years since Sayin was handed down, and despite the frequency with which similar statements have been subsequently made by the courts, the frequency with which offences of this nature occur has not diminished, particularly when they occur, as here, in licensed venues, where those involved are affected by alcohol.
	
	
	There remains a continuing need for the courts to emphasise the horror with which the community views the use of a glass as a weapon, particularly when the glass is wielded with force at the head or face of another. Such offences must be strongly denounced, and others deterred from committing like crimes by the imposition of stern sentences.
	
	
	I am not able to conclude that the sentencing judge gave the need for a sentence reflective of the principle of general deterrence disproportionate or erroneous weight.
	


His Honour Gave Inadequate Weight to the Extremely Strong Subjective Case


	
	The starting point for consideration of this aspect of the applicant’s complaint must be to again note the discretionary nature of the sentencing exercise. Matters of weight are very much matters within the province of the sentencing judge:  Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40].
	
	
	In his Remarks the sentencing judge set out the applicant’s subjective case in detail. He referred to the fact that the applicant, at age 35 years, had no criminal convictions, and gave this considerable weight. His Honour also noted the strong evidence of positive good character from those who knew the applicant, and the applicant’s strong employment history. He concluded, in the applicant’s favour, that the applicant was insightful, remorseful, and was very unlikely to offend against the criminal law again. The applicant’s offence was noted to be out of character and his prospects of rehabilitation were assessed as optimistic. The strong subjective case was the primary consideration in his Honour’s conclusion that special circumstances existed such that the NPP was fixed at two-thirds of the overall sentence.
	
	
	It is evident that his Honour gave careful and even anxious consideration to both the form of sentence, and to its term. That consideration was prompted in no small part by the recognition that the applicant was, in every respect other than in the commission of this offence, a highly regarded and valuable member of the community.
	
	
	I do not accept that his Honour did not give adequate weight to the applicant’s subjective case.
	


Is the Sentence Manifestly Excessive?


	
	It was his Honour’s difficult to task to arrive at an appropriate sentence in a matter where there were conflicting and contradictory elements which all bore upon the determination of the sentence to be imposed. The seriousness of the offence demanded heavy punishment, whilst the applicant’s previously unblemished character and good prospects required the extension of a measure of leniency and amelioration of sentence.
	
	
	His Honour was obliged to take into account all relevant factors and to arrive at a sentence which took proper account of each. As was noted in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27],
	


“Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.”


	
	There being no “correct” sentence, it is not sufficient that this Court might have exercised the discretion differently: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 19; 195 CLR 665 at [15]. It is for the applicant to demonstrate that there has been error of the kind identified in House v The King, even if only apparent in an “unfair and unjust” sentencing outcome.
	
	
	For my part, whilst the sentence may be regarded as a stern one, I do not regard error as having been established
	


ORDERS


	
	I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.

2767807,Cornish v R [2015] NSWCCA 256,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	HALL J: I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence imposed by Acting Judge Walmsley SC in the District Court at Armidale on 23 May 2014.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence pertained to eight separate offences, five of which were Local Court offences that were placed before his Honour by way of a certificate, pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). I shall turn to detail them in a moment.
	
	
	The three offences that had been committed for sentence in the District Court were as follows.
	
	
	Sequence five was an offence of possessing three or more unregistered firearms, one (in fact, three) of which was a prohibited firearm. That is an offence against s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW). Pursuant to s 51D(2), it carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and pursuant to Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), it carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	Sequence three was an offence of supplying the prohibited drug cannabis leaf. Pursuant to ss 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.
	
	
	Sequence eight was an offence of cultivating cannabis plants. Pursuant to s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 10 years.
	
	
	Turning to the five offences on the certificate, sequence one was an offence of possessing the prohibited drug amphetamine, in the form of a few tablets. Pursuant to s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the maximum penalty of that wholly summary offence is imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	Sequence two was an offence of possessing the prohibited drug commonly known as ecstasy, in the quantity of a few tablets. That was an offence against the same section, with the same maximum penalty.
	
	
	Sequence six was an offence of possessing ammunition. Pursuant to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act, it carries a maximum penalty of a fine in the sum of $5500.
	
	
	Sequence seven was an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon; namely, a crossbow, contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act. It carries a maximum penalty when dealt with in the Local Court of imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	Sequence nine was an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime; namely, cash in an amount that was a little over $4900. That was a summary offence against s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years.
	
	
	Finally, for completeness, sequence four was a charge of possessing cannabis leaf. It was a back-up charge to the supply, and was for that reason not the subject of a sentence.
	


Objective features


	
	On 30 September 2013, the applicant was stopped by police as he was driving towards Armidale airport. He was found to possess a few tablets of amphetamines (sequence one) and a few tablets of ecstasy (sequence two). He was also found to be in possession of almost $700 in cash, which went towards establishing sequence nine.
	
	
	Later that day, the police executed a search warrant at the home of the applicant near Armidale. There they found what was eventually determined to amount to 7.58 kg of cannabis in a number of vacuum-sealed bags. There was evidence from police that that cannabis could have a street value of approximately $42,000. There were also well-known indicia of drug supply such as small resealable bags, digital scales, and ledgers of money owing.
	
	
	Pursuant to Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the quantity of cannabis that falls within the offence of supplying that prohibited drug simpliciter is anything below 25 kgs.
	
	
	His Honour found that, although a large amount of the cannabis was for the use of the applicant, nevertheless he was involved in the business of supplying it.
	
	
	At the back of the home, growing openly in the garden, the police located 23 immature cannabis plants. Their value could not be accurately estimated. Pursuant to Sch 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the quantity of cannabis plants that falls within the offence of cultivating a prohibited plant simpliciter is anything below 250 plants.
	
	
	Secreted in a safe in the home the police located eight firearms, individually sealed in heat-sealed bags. They were as follows.
	
	
	First, a .22 calibre rimfire rifle with a tubular magazine capable of holding eight cartridges. Due to the fact that that rifle was self-loading, it was a prohibited weapon.
	
	
	Secondly, a .22 calibre bolt action rifle, with a telescopic sight attached. It was also fitted with a silencer, which meant that it was a prohibited firearm as well.
	
	
	Thirdly, a .308 calibre bolt action rifle with no stock. The fact that the firearm was shortened meant that it was, strictly speaking, a prohibited weapon. Nevertheless, the prosecution accepted that, in all likelihood, the stock had become separated from the body of the firearm through breakage rather than deliberate alteration.
	
	
	Fourthly, a .410 calibre double barrel shotgun.
	
	
	Fifthly, a 12 gauge single barrel shotgun.
	
	
	Sixthly, a 12 gauge single barrel shotgun that had been reported stolen in October 2011.
	
	
	Seventhly, a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun.
	
	
	Eighthly, a 12 gauge double barrel shotgun.
	
	
	Quite apart from those weapons, the police also located inside the safe a large number of shotgun cartridges and cartridges suitable for use in the .22 calibre rifles. That ammunition underpinned sequence six.
	
	
	In the same location, the police located a crossbow, which led to sequence seven.
	
	
	Although not the subject of charges, it is noteworthy that the police also found in the safe ammunition belts, along with arrows suitable to be fired from the crossbow.
	
	
	Finally, the police located more cash bundled up inside the safe, totalling a little over $4,200. As I have said, the total amount of cash possessed by the applicant was a little over $4,900.
	


Subjective features


	
	The following summary is derived from the findings made in the remarks on sentence.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to all offences at the earliest opportunity. His Honour provided a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of those pleas. That discount was disputed neither at first instance nor in this Court.
	
	
	Aged 38 at the time of sentence, the applicant had grown up in Armidale and enjoyed a sound education. He was a very good sportsman as a young man, and on leaving school studied hospitality and worked in that industry. Whilst at university, he commenced using cannabis.
	
	
	Almost 20 years ago, he endured a psychotic episode, during which he was walking through the streets of Armidale naked, believing that a laser was trained upon him and that he was to be shot. Since then he has suffered from the chronic and severe mental illness schizophrenia. A psychiatric report tendered on sentence showed that he had suffered from many and varied delusional beliefs, including severe ideas of reference about external forces controlling or manipulating his life. In the past, he has not been compliant with medication. The applicant has used cannabis very heavily over the years, in the belief that it mitigates his psychiatric symptoms. His Honour accepted that, on balance, the applicant was “probably psychotic” at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	Quite apart from that, His Honour found that the applicant also suffers from paedophilia. Indeed, not long before the sentencing on 23 May 2014, the applicant had been sentenced in the Local Court at Armidale on 19 March 2014 for three offences of producing, disseminating or possessing child abuse material. For those offences, the applicant had received a total head sentence of imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 30 September 2013 and concluding on 29 March 2015, with a non-parole period of 12 months concluding on 29 September 2014.
	
	
	Separately, the criminal record of the applicant placed before his Honour was short but instructive. In 1997, he had been fined and also placed on a bond pursuant to what was then s 556A of the Crimes Act for possessing and cultivating a prohibited drug, and possessing equipment for administration of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In 2003, he had been fined for possessing a prohibited drug, and placed on a bond for cultivating prohibited plants. In the same year, he had also been fined for possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit, and also fined for possessing ammunition unlawfully.
	
	
	Later in 2003, the applicant was placed on a suspended sentence for supplying a prohibited drug, and fined for possessing a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In 2005, he had been placed on a three year bond and fined for using a carriage service to harass or menace another person, and for intimidating a police officer.
	
	
	As for the motivation for the offences, as I have shown, his Honour found that the cannabis was cultivated and possessed for the applicant’s own use to a large degree, but also as part of a course of conduct of supply for profit. With regard to the firearms, his Honour found that, on the balance of probabilities, they were essentially for recreational purposes in a rural setting.
	
	
	With regard to the future, his Honour was guardedly optimistic about the prospects of rehabilitation of the applicant, so long as his long-standing schizophrenia is adequately treated, and he regularly takes any and all prescribed medication.
	


Sentences indicated and sentence imposed


	
	These were as follows.
	
	
	For sequence five, the firearms offence, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for five years (it was a slip for his Honour not to impose an indicative non-parole period for this standard non-parole period offence, but a notified ground of appeal based upon that slip was not pressed at the hearing).
	
	
	For sequence three, the supply of cannabis, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for three years.
	
	
	For sequence eight, the cultivation of cannabis, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for nine months.
	
	
	Turning to the Local Court offences, for sequence one, possession of a few tablets of amphetamines, an indicative fixed term of imprisonment for one month.
	
	
	For sequence two, possession of a few tablets of ecstasy, an indicative fixed term of imprisonment for one month.
	
	
	For sequence six, possession of the ammunition, disposition pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act, with no penalty imposed.
	
	
	For sequence seven, possession of the crossbow, an indicative fixed term of imprisonment for six months.
	
	
	Finally, for sequence nine, dealing with the cash, an indicative head sentence of imprisonment for nine months.
	
	
	With regard to all offences, his Honour imposed a single aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for six years to date from 30 March 2014 and expire on 29 March 2020, with an aggregate non-parole period of three years six months to date from 30 March 2014 and expire on 29 September 2017.
	
	
	Clearly enough, special circumstances were found that led to a substantial reduction in the aggregate non-parole period.
	
	
	It can be seen that the aggregate sentence commenced 12 months before the Local Court sentence expired. That degree of concurrence and cumulation with regard to the pre-existing sentence for wholly separate criminality was not impugned on appeal.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The following grounds were pressed at the hearing:
	


1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the basis upon which the aggregate sentence was structured and how the overall sentence was reached by:

…

c) failing to assess the objective criminality for the separate offending inherent in the individual charges.

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the [applicant’s] mental illness of schizophrenia.

3. The sentence was manifestly excessive.

Ground 1(c)

The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the basis upon which the aggregate sentence was structured and how the overall sentence was reached by: 

…

failing to assess the objective criminality for the separate offending inherent in the individual charges. 


	
	It was submitted in support of this ground that the sentencing judge had failed to assess adequately the objective seriousness of the offences in the remarks on sentence. That was explained in oral submissions as “the assessment or lack of assessment made of the objective criminality of the matters”. It was said that the remarks on sentence contained “many mixed messages about the objective criminality”. It was also said that it was very difficult to determine where precisely his Honour had found the offences for which sentence was to be imposed fell within the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	I consider that that submission cannot be accepted. That is because, at p 6 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour provided an explicit assessment of the objective seriousness of the cultivate offence, the supply offence, and the firearms offence. His Honour said the following:
	


…The s 23 matter is not objectively a serious one but the s 29/25(1) offence is objectively significant as I am satisfied the facts show the offender was when apprehended involved in drug selling. Though I am satisfied that he had a huge personal need for cannabis for his own consumption the presence on his premises of the usual indicia of selling such as plastic bags, scales, lists and quite a lot of cash and a lot of cannabis persuade me that he was in business.

As for the firearms offence it was a very significant example of that offence because of the number of firearms, the presence of ammunition in the near vicinity, the silencer on one of the firearms and the fact that there was no licence for any of them.

(emphasis added)


	
	It may be that, in the course of the remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge referred to the objective seriousness of these three offences that had been committed for sentence to the District Court with varying degrees of emphasis and shades of meaning. But that is of no great moment. That is because the portion that I have extracted from the remarks on sentence shows that his Honour concisely, but clearly and quite adequately, assessed the objective seriousness of the three substantive offences.
	
	
	For that reason, I would not uphold ground 1(c).
	


Ground two

The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the [applicant’s] mental illness of schizophrenia. 


	
	It was suggested to counsel for the applicant by members of the Court at the hearing that perhaps this ground should be regarded as a particular of ground three, in light of what has been said by the High Court of Australia in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 83 ALJR 579 at [9] and Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [22]. It was not entirely clear whether counsel for the applicant was content with that course. But because to my mind it is impossible to determine whether any objective or subjective feature was given sufficient weight by a sentencing judge without analysis of the sentence actually imposed, that is the way that I propose to regard this ground.
	
	
	If the approach for which counsel contended was that ground two should be considered as a separate ground, I consider that it cannot be sustained. That is because in the remarks on sentence the sentencing judge analysed in substantial detail the evidence about the chronic mental illness of the applicant.
	
	
	On either basis, I would reject ground two as a separate ground.
	


Ground three

The sentence was manifestly excessive. 


	
	In oral submissions, it was explained that the proposition that the aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for six years with an aggregate non-parole period of three years six months was manifestly excessive was founded on a number of factors.
	
	
	First the early pleas of guilty, and the resultant discount of 25%.
	
	
	Secondly, the finding by his Honour on the balance of probabilities that the applicant “had developed something of an obsession with guns and liked having them and had them in essence for recreational use on his bush property”. In other words, his Honour did not find that the possession of the firearms was ancillary to the drug supply business in which the applicant was engaged; to the contrary, they were for recreational purposes only.
	
	
	Thirdly, because the firearms were secured in a safe, they did not present any real danger to the community.
	
	
	Fourthly and finally, the undoubted fact that the applicant has been burdened for many years by a chronic and severe mental illness, and in particular the finding of his Honour that the applicant was “probably psychotic” at the time of his arrest. It was said that the aggregate sentence did not adequately reflect those findings.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, I consider that this ground can be dealt with shortly.
	
	
	In my respectful opinion, his Honour made a very generous finding of fact in favour of the applicant when his Honour found firearms that included a rifle that had a silencer fitted, a rifle that was self-loading, and a number of shotguns, were for recreational purposes. Nevertheless, I accept that that finding was reasonably open, and take it into account in assessment of this ground.
	
	
	I also proceed on the basis that the applicant was on balance psychotic at the time of the offences. He has undoubtedly been suffering from a debilitating mental illness for many years.
	
	
	Having said that, by way of his pleas of guilty, maintained whilst represented by counsel, the applicant implicitly accepted that he was fit to stand trial, and to enter those pleas. Those pleas also, of course, solemnly eschewed any reliance on the defence of mental illness leading to a special verdict. Finally, it can be seen from the drug and proceeds of crime offences that, despite his mental illness, the applicant was capable of running a financially successful and well organised illegal business, including keeping careful note of sums owed by various customers.
	
	
	I accept that the mental illness of the applicant made him a less suitable instrument for the expression of general and personal deterrence. To be weighed against that is the fact that he had offended not only with regard to supplying prohibited drugs in the past, but also with regard to possessing or using a prohibited weapon, as well as possessing ammunition unlawfully.
	
	
	Separately, contrary to the submission of counsel for the applicant, I consider that the extreme danger occasioned to members of the community by the possession by a floridly mentally ill man (who believes that his life is being influenced by malignant external forces) of shotguns, a self-loading rifle capable of firing eight projectiles without interruption, and a silenced firearm, along with a great deal of ammunition suitable for discharge in those weapons, is thoroughly self-evident. And that is the case whether that possession occurs in an urban, a rural, or even an extremely isolated outback setting. As well as that, it is not uncommon for criminals to target regional and rural premises in order to steal firearms that are secured, or to take them by force. For more than one reason, the fact that the firearms were secured gives one very little comfort. To my mind, the firearms offence was very serious indeed.
	
	
	Speaking concisely, the indicative head sentence provided for the firearms offence of imprisonment for five years, when seen in its context, along with the context of the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period provided by Parliament for the offence, goes no way towards supporting the proposition that the aggregate sentence actually imposed is manifestly excessive. Indeed, I respectfully regard that indicative head sentence as quite a lenient one, even taking into account the powerful subjective aspects of the matter.
	
	
	Similarly, I am not persuaded that the aggregate head sentence and aggregate non-parole period bespeak error by way of being manifestly excessive, especially bearing in mind that they encompassed the wholly separate offending with regard to prohibited drugs and plants. To the contrary, I consider that each of them was soundly within the exercise of the sentencing discretion by his Honour.
	
	
	I would not uphold ground three.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		24 September 2015",2015-09-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767811,Crotty v R [2015] NSWDC 301,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against a conviction recorded and a sentence passed in the Downing Centre Local Court by Magistrate Keogh. Unfortunately, her Honour never formally convicted the appellant but on 5 May 2015, found the offence with which the appellant was charged, to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. On 29 May 2015, her Honour imposed a sentence on the appellant in respect of the charge which she found proved on 15 May 2015. 
	
	
	The appellant was charged that between 6.30pm and 7.30pm on 9 August 2014, at Bellevue Hill he did assault Camilla Elisabeth Crotty, thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to her. The middle name of the alleged victim of the assault is a matter of conjecture. Despite the spelling of the alleged victim’s middle name in the court attendance notice, police documents refer to her middle name as Elisabet. When she gave evidence before the Local Court, her middle name was recorded as Elyse at the top of page 53 of the transcript of 3 May 2015 but then is recorded as being Alyse on line 7 of the same page of the transcript. Nothing turns on that. The appellant pleaded not guilty. The matter was heard by Magistrate Keogh on 3 February 2015 and 27 February 2015. Her Honour heard addresses on 13 May 2015, and as earlier stated, gave reasons for finding the offence proved on 15 May 2015, before proceeding to pronounce a sentence on 29 May 2015.
	
	
	The appellant and the alleged victim, to whom I shall refer hereafter as “the complainant”, were at all material times, husband and wife. The appellant was born in 1971 and at the time of the offence alleged, was 43 years old. The complainant was born in 1972 and at the time of the allege offence, was 41 years old. The evidence suggests that at the time of the alleged offence, the couple had known each other for seven years, from which I infer that they met in approximately 2007. The evidence also suggests that they had been married for five and a half years at the time, indicating that they must have married in early 2009. The couple have two sons. Kai was born in 2010 and was four years and six months old at the time of the alleged offence and Kallen, was born in 2013 and was nine months old at the relevant date. The evidence discloses that the full dates at birth of each of those four persons but for security reasons, I do not recite them in these reasons for judgment.
	
	
	The couple and their children were living in rented accommodation in Apartment 4, 16 Birriga Road, Bellevue Hill. They had earlier sold a house that belonged to the appellant and were accumulating further money in order to purchase a matrimonial home. The couple could be described as, “high flyers”, in our community. The appellant was and is, a corporate adviser and is required to travel quite frequently in the course of his business. The complainant has university qualifications and is essentially a funds manager. She initially worked in the early part of her career with Bankers Trust. However, five years before the relevant event, that of 9 August 2014, she had left the workforce in order to become a fulltime mother. The evidence suggests that prior to 9 August 2014 the couple had had some matrimonial difficulties, but that is not at all uncommon. The appellant was a man of prior good character. The evidence to support that can be found in the transcript of the first day of proceedings at page 16, line 19. 9 August 2014 was a Saturday. The evidence suggests that on that day the appellant had stayed at home to look after his two young sons.
	
	
	The complainant went out shortly before 2pm to attend a luncheon at Catalina’s Restaurant at Rose Bay with a group of her friends. There were ten ladies all told who attended the luncheon, which was due to commence at 2pm. The complainant was taking this opportunity to introduce to other of her friends Ms Kylie Toomey, whom the complainant had known for around ten years. They were close friends. Ms Toomey had only recently moved to Sydney from Melbourne. She was living at Bronte. She engaged an Uber vehicle to transport her from Bronte to Catalina’s Restaurant. In order to do so she had to pass by the complainant’s residence. She picked the complainant up on her way to the restaurant. She estimated that they arrived at the restaurant at 2pm.
	
	
	It appears that those two ladies were the first to arrive. The evidence discloses the identity of seven of the ladies who attended this lunch. The identity of the other three ladies has not been given. Those identified besides the complainant and Ms Toomey are Ms Katie Lloyd Jones, Ms Elizabeth Chisholm, Ms Sarah McGee, Ms Sarah Weisner and Jacinta (surname not given). Police obtained statements from not only the complainant but Ms Toomey, Ms Lloyd Jones and Ms McGee. No attempt was made, on the evidence before me, to obtain a statement from Ms Weisner or from the lady Identified as Jacinta, nor was any attempt made to identify the other three ladies who attended the lunch.
	
	
	At the hearing Ms Toomey and Ms Lloyd Jones gave evidence. There was clearly an intention to call Ms McGee but the transcript records at line 42 that the Prosecutor, Sergeant Smith, had obtained a message from Ms McGee that she was not able to attend court, despite the fact that she had been served with a subpoena, because she was attending a family wedding. In those circumstances the Prosecutor elected not to call Ms McGee.
	
	
	Whilst the complainant was at this luncheon the appellant was caring for their two sons. The evidence discloses that he anticipated that his wife would return home at around 6pm, plus or minus an hour, that is, somewhere in a window between 5pm and 7pm.
	
	
	The lunch did not commence at the scheduled time of 2pm. Ms Lloyd Jones arrived at about 2.20pm. Ms Chisholm arrived about 2.15pm. The evidence discloses that a number of other participants at the lunch were attending from Double Bay and had ordered a taxi which failed to arrive leading to their arriving late. By the time six or seven of the ladies had arrived, champagne was ordered and was consumed. The champagne ordered was Veuve Cliquot. An issue arises in the current proceedings as to the amount of alcohol that the complainant consumed in the hours preceding the assault alleged. The complainant’s evidence is that she consumed six glasses of champagne in a six hour period between 2pm and 8pm. Of the other diners who gave evidence, Ms Toomey said that she left the luncheon around 7pm but did so in company with Ms Lloyd Jones. Ms Lloyd Jones said that she left around 6.45pm. Ms Chisholm left about 7pm. No one was called who may have been with the complainant between 6.45/7pm and 8pm or later.
	
	
	The evidence strongly suggests that the complainant left the restaurant after 8pm. In an email sent by the complainant to police on Monday 11 August 2014 at 4.45pm, the complainant said that she arrived home at 8.30pm. The distance between Catalina’s Restaurant and the complainant’s residence was 2.3 kilometres and that could be travelled by motor car in six minutes. That intelligence is established by exhibit 4. The complainant’s evidence is that she obtained the assistance of the staff of the restaurant in obtaining a cab which took her from the restaurant to her home. The complainant may have had to wait some time for the arrival of the taxi which had been ordered for her. However, bearing in mind that the trip itself would only take six minutes, one can postulate that she intended to leave the restaurant about 8.10 or 8.15pm but probably did not actually leave the restaurant till very shortly after 8.20pm.
	
	
	When the complainant arrived home she had an oral argument with the appellant. Equally one could say the appellant had an oral argument with the complainant. At this stage I shall not recite what the contentions were but the countervailing allegations need to be considered in a chronological context. Shortly after the oral argument, and the physical events which are said to establish the alleged assault, the appellant telephoned his father, pointed out that things were not going well at the appellant’s home and asking his father to come to the appellant’s residence. Mr Brendan Crotty, the appellant’s father, did so. In oral evidence, which was not the subject of any dispute, Mr Brendan Crotty said that he checked his mobile telephone and also toll records and he believed that he arrived outside the residence of the couple sometime between 8.54 and 8.57pm. His reference to checking his mobile telephone would clearly be to ascertain the time of the appellant’s call to him. Mr Brendan Crotty lived at Cammeray and needed to cross the harbour either by way of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel or the Sydney Harbour Bridge and would therefore incur some form of toll. There was no real dispute that Mr Brendan Crotty arrived at the couple’s residence sometime between 8.54 and 8.57pm. By that stage about 20 minutes had elapsed from the time of the appellant’s call to his father. That suggests that the relevant event happened sometime between 8.34 and 8.37pm which is consistent with the complainant’s arriving home at 8.30pm and the immediate interaction between the complainant and the appellant. Mr Brendan Crotty was at the couple’s residence for only a relatively brief period. The evidence suggests that he may have left at 9pm or shortly thereafter.
	
	
	At about 9.50pm the complainant made a telephone call to a close personal friend, Mrs Sally Obermeder, who gave oral evidence in the Local Court. Ms Obermeder suggested to the complainant that she telephone the police. The complainant did so. I do not know whether she phoned the local police station, which would have been Rosebay Police Station, or whether she phoned 000, but as there was a VKG radio broadcast the inference to be drawn is that it is likely that she phoned 000. The VKG broadcast was made at 10.08pm. According to [5] of exhibit 5 the VKG message was this:
	


“Informant states that her husband has assaulted her. Husband has now left the location. Two children at the location. Nil AVOs. Husband is Justin Crotty.”

Exhibit 5 is a statement of Constable Charles Prow of the Rosebay Police. That evidence is confirmed by oral evidence given by Constable John Spicer at p 17, line 27 of the transcript of evidence of 3 February 2015.


	
	Police attended at the couple’s residence at 10.30pm. That is established by [6] of exhibit 5 and by the oral evidence of Constable Spicer at p 17, line 28 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 as well as by a contemporaneous note at the top of p 73 of the police notebook of Constable Prow which is part of exhibit 5. The magistrate below erroneously referred in her reasons on p 2 to the police arriving at the residence “at about 10.10pm”. The evidence is all one way, that it was 10.30. At 10.46pm the complainant signed an entry in Constable Spicer’s notebook. The relevant part of his notebook is exhibit 12. That suggests that the interaction between Constable Prow and Constable Spicer ended at about 10.46pm. It must also be noted that in addition to Constable Prow and Constable Spicer attending the couple’s residence on the evening of 9 August 2014, Sergeant Adams also attended but left before the two constables did. No evidence was adduced at all from Sergeant Adams.
	
	
	At about 11pm the complainant made a further telephone call to Mrs Sally Obermeder.
	
	
	On Sunday, 10 August 2014 the complainant had made arrangements to participate in the City to Surf Race. When answering questions in chief about her consumption of alcohol at the luncheon on 9 August the complainant said this:
	


“Well over the six hours I had about six glasses of champagne, I was conscious of the fact that I was doing the 14 k City to Surf the next day so, you know, I knew, I knew what my limits were. I mean at the end of the day I was socialising with friends, I was not intoxicated.”

In cross‑examination on 27 February 2015 the complainant gave this evidence, again in questioning concerning her alcohol intake:

“I was doing the City to Surf the next day. I had to be at Hyde Park at 8.30am. My girlfriend had raised over $10,000 for charity for the City to Surf. There was absolutely no way I would let her down. I was totally conscious of what I was drinking. It’s a 14 kilometre run.”

There is no evidence as to whether the complainant participated in the City to Surf run on Sunday 10 August 2014 but one could easily infer from the last piece of evidence that I have quoted that she did so. She clearly intended to do so.


	
	On the morning of Sunday 10 August 2014 the complainant sent an email to Constable Spicer. That email is contained in exhibit 13. The email enclosed photographs which found their way into evidence as exhibit 3. They are photographs of the complainant’s forearm and face and are four in number. They might be described as “selfies”, that is, they appear to have been taken by the complainant herself. After enclosing those photographs the email says this:
	


“The incident probably took place more like 9ish.”

Clearly that is referring to the event which is the subject of this appeal and indicates that the appellant had previously given to Constable Spicer a different time as to when the event occurred. The email then said, “If you need anything else from me my mobile phone number is…” The final sentence of the email thanked Constable Spicer for his help the preceding evening.


	
	On Monday 11 August the complainant attended the surgery of Dr Linda Lombard, a general practitioner at the Bondi Health Care Centre in Bondi Road, Bondi. Dr Lombard prepared an expert certificate which became exhibit 7 and the exhibit includes the practice’s computerised consultation notes made on 11 August 2014 commencing at 12.16pm. Later that day at 4.45pm the complainant sent a further email to Constable Spicer to which I shall again turn.
	
	
	The evidence discloses that on Tuesday 12 August 2014 the complainant had an appointment to see her solicitor at 11.30pm. That is established by the email of 11 August 2014, part of exhibit 13.
	
	
	On Wednesday 13 August the appellant was arrested by the police at his father’s home at Cammeray and taken to the North Sydney Police Station. He agreed to be interviewed by police. His solicitor, Mr William Vahl, participated in the interview but merely as an observer. The interview was conducted primarily by Constable Courtney Farthing and Constable Jon Wilson was in attendance. The interview, leaving out the concluding formalities, involved 238 questions and commenced at 12.37pm and concluded at 1.20pm. The intelligence communicated by the appellant in that electronically recorded interview is quite consistent with the oral evidence which the appellant eventually gave to the Local Court on 27 February 2015.
	
	
	The only remaining dating matter to note is that on Thursday 14 August 2014 the complainant commenced proceedings against the appellant in the Family Court. That evidence is contained at the transcript of 27 February 2015 at p 49 line 19. A further thing to bear in mind before going into greater detail is that the appellant was due to leave the residence he shared with the complainant and their children at 6am the next morning to undertake a business trip to Korea. The evidence also specifically mentions Seoul. The appellant was not due to return from Seoul until Wednesday 13 August 2014. He appears to have arrived in Sydney that morning, attended at his father’s residence and there was arrested by police from North Sydney, acting on behalf of the Rose Bay Police. That is despite the fact that earlier he had made oral arrangements to attend voluntarily at the Rose Bay Police Station in order to assist the police with their enquiries.
	


[ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO WEDNESDAY 23 SEPTEMBER 2015]


	
	HIS HONOUR: At the commencement of my reasons yesterday I outlined the background of both the appellant and the complainant. There was a definite purpose for doing that. It is abundantly clear that both the appellant and the complainant are well‑educated and articulate. One would not need to give to them the allowance one sometimes must, of having a poor memory or being unable to describe what was occurring adequately. In particular, I must stress that a poor memory is not to be readily attributed to the well‑educated and the intelligent.
	
	
	It is perhaps instructive to consider the various complaints that the complainant made from time to time. Of course the first person to whom she could have complained is the appellant but one must leave their interaction aside. The next person to have any contact with the complainant was the appellant’s father, a Mr Brendan Crotty. According to his evidence‑in‑chief, as he was about to leave the couple’s home unit the complainant said to him, “Do you realise that Justin physically and verbally abuses his children?” To that he replied that he did not believe what the complainant had told him. He did not give any evidence that the complainant said to him words to the effect that she had been physically assaulted by his son. In cross‑examination this question and answer were recorded:
	


“Q. She hasn’t said anything to you because you’ve walked in with Justin and she’s standing in the kitchen?

A. She hasn’t said anything to me at that point. It was only when she said to me that Justin had been physically and verbally abusive to the children, that, that her voice was slurred, because she didn’t speak to me when I walked in.”

There was no suggestion put to Mr Brendan Crotty that any complaint was made to him by the complainant that she had been assaulted by the appellant.


	
	The next person to whom a complaint was made by the appellant was to her friend, Mrs Sally Obermeder. As I recounted yesterday the complainant telephoned her about 9.50pm. She gave evidence that the complainant was “quite distressed”. This evidence was then given.
	


“Q. Would you be able to use the first person, so I said, she said, for that phone conversation that you had?

A. Yeah. So I picked up the phone because it was unusual, 10 to 10, for her to call me, to me means something wrong, so I picked up. She was crying. She was crying so much I couldn’t actually hear anything other than tears, and I said to her, you know:

‘I can’t understand what you are saying. I can’t hear anything. I can’t hear you saying anything other than crying. Stop crying, tell me what’s going on, what has happened, what’s wrong.’

I wasn’t sure if something had happened to the kids. She, she kept crying. I said, ‘tell me what’s happening’. She sought of stopped long enough to say to me, ‘Justin has hit me. Kai was here. He saw. He was so scared. I’m scared’, and I said, ‘where are the kids now?’ and then she said, ‘they’re in bed’.

Q. I know this must seem very strange to you, but once she said to you, ‘the kids are in bed’, what happened then? What’s the next thing?

A. I think I asked where Justin was and she said he had gone, his dad came to pick him up. And she said she was still scared. She was very worried because Kai was scared, that he had witnessed it, that he had seen firsthand what had been going on.”

The Magistrate then asked the complainant to repeat what she had said and then after a few more questions this evidence was given in answer to a question by the Prosecutor:

“When she said she was still scared and, and she was, she was worried, she was worried about what would happen again and I said, ‘well I think maybe you should call the police’, and then she said, ‘yes, I think I will’. I also spoke about a locksmith but that was kind of a bit secondary. She said, ‘yes, I think I will’. We hung up.”

The only actual allegation made by the complainant against the appellant to Mrs Obermeder was that “Justin has hit me”. No detail appears to have been given.


	
	As I recounted yesterday the complainant then made a telephone call, probably via 000, and the police eventually attended her residence at 10.30pm. Constable Prow did not give oral evidence but his statement made on 26 November 2014 was tendered together with a copy of his notebook entry which was contemporaneous. At [6] of his statement Constable Prow said this:
	


“At 10.30pm myself, Constable Spicer and Sergeant Adams met Camilla Crotty at the address and she led us inside before having a conversation with Constable Spicer:

Constable Spicer said: ‘What’s happened tonight?

Camilla said: ‘I’ve had an argument with my husband, he hit me’.

I said: ‘Are you okay, do you need an ambulance?’

Camilla said: ‘No I’m okay’.

While we were speaking with Camilla I observed her to be shaking and that she had tears in her eyes. She stated, ‘Justin constantly abuses her and calls her a fucking whore’. She also stated her four year old son witnessed the assault and was crying. During the conversation Camilla also said words to the effect of:

Camilla said: ‘He’s only here three days of the week so I just put up with it when he’s here, then he’s away for the other four days and it’s just me and the kids, it’s okay, I can handle it.’”

The constable’s statement then records observations he made about injuries which it is not necessary for me to recite at this time.


	
	Constable Spicer gave oral evidence on 3 February 2015. In chief the constable said that the complainant told him that her husband had hit her. In his evidence he then stated that he observed that she had bruising to her left eye and bruising to her right forearm, which she showed to him whilst they were talking. He also said that she pointed to her left eye saying, “this is where he’s hit me”. He then deposed in chief to having a further conversation with the complainant and he then said this:
	


“She was pretty hysterical, she was crying and obviously still shaking while she was speaking with us.”

In cross‑examination Constable Spicer admitted that he had prepared a provisional apprehended violence order. His attention was taken to p 4 of the document. The document was marked MFI A but was never put into evidence. At p 26 line 12 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 the following evidence is recorded:

“Q. Just looking at first of all the second paragraph you’ve written there. ‘There has been [no] record of domestic violence in the past.’?

A. Yes.”

In making that quotation I have made a correction to the transcript. The word I have stated to be “no” has been typed as “on” but it is clear from other questioning and from common‑sense that there was a typographical error.


	
	Putting together what was recorded on p 4 of the AVO document from the questions, the following can be ascertained to have been stated:
	


“About 6.30 on 9 August 2014 the PINOP has returned home from being out at lunch with friends [.] The accused was not happy that she had been out and started yelling and swearing at the PINOP [.] They had moved the argument to the main bedroom as the kids were home and the yelling continued [.] The door to the main bedroom was left open whilst this was occurring [.]”

The questioning of Constable Spicer continued thus:

“Q. And then you immediately after that describe the allegation of a punch to the PINOP?

A. Yes.

Q. So you agree there that in that version that you have provided with and that you dutifully relayed it to the Court..

A. Mm-hmm.

Q. ..there’s no mention of an incident in the bathroom?

A. Yes.

Q. And there is no mention of any grabbing or twisting of the complainant’s wrist?

A. No, that’s as much information I could get from her on the night and she didn’t want to supply me with a statement.”

The first part of what is contained on p 4 of the provisional AVO document that I reconstructed was confirmed by Constable Spicer to have been what he was told by the complainant. In other words, the gist of what was stated was that at about 6.30pm on the evening in question there was one interaction between the complainant and the accused, that that one interaction of violence was in the bedroom and that involved a punch by the appellant to the complainant’s face. However, it ought to have been clear to Constable Spicer that more must have been involved because he had already observed bruising to the complainant’s right forearm. However, clearly the intelligence which was communicated by the complainant to Constable Spicer was limited. The complainant signed a short statement in Constable Spicer’s notebook.


	
	Immediately before the recording of that statement in Constable Spicer’s notebook is the residential address of the appellant’s father and immediately prior to that piece of information is a record that the relationship between the complainant and the appellant was of seven years’ duration, consistent with what I stated yesterday, and then there is a note that there had been “two years’ verbal abuse’”, presumably a statement by the complainant that the appellant had been verbally abusing her over a period of approximately two years.
	
	
	The statement of the complainant recorded in the notebook of Constable Spicer is extremely brief. It contains the statutory acknowledgement of the accuracy of the statement and of the consequences of making a false statement. The statement then continues thus:
	


“My husband will be staying at his dad’s place tonight and won’t be home. I have no fear for my safety tonight. I am not willing to provide a statement for the assault and go through the court process.”

There is then the dating, and the time of the complainant’s signature at 10.46pm. The timing of the assault at about 6.30pm is an inconsistency because it has become abundantly clear that the assault occurred at 8.30pm or very shortly thereafter, as I sought to establish yesterday from what might be thought to be fairly objective evidence.


	
	After the police left, and I infer that that was shortly after 10.46pm, the complainant made a further telephone call to Mrs Obermeder. Ms Obemeder’s evidence-in-chief continued thus:
	


“Then after that we spoke again later that night and she said the police had been, and then I said, you know, “How do you feel now?” and she said, “I feel, I feel calmer now, I feel safer now that the police had been,” and she sounded substantially better than she did in the first conversation, because in the first conversation she was suitably and appropriately distressed and hysterical.”

Of course, the averment by Ms Obermeder that during her first conversation with the complainant, the complainant was “suitably and appropriately distressed and hysterical” is an opinion which clearly points in the direction of partiality of the witness towards the complainant. Ms Obermeder went on to say that she asked the complainant what had happened and that the complainant said words to the effect, “I was at lunch, got home and Justin just lost it.” The only thing to note about the cross-examination of Mrs Obermeder is that she confirmed that in the statement the complainant also said to her, “He also sent me an abusive message while I was at lunch.”


	
	The next communication that I know the complainant had with anybody was her email communication with Constable Spicer at 7.30am on the morning of Sunday 10 August. In that communication the complainant relevantly said that the incident probably took place “more like nine-ish” which indicated to me either that the complainant remembered that she had told the constable that the event occurred at about 6.30pm and now wanted it to be known that it occurred about 9pm, or that, by that time, Constable Spicer had forwarded to the complainant a copy of the provisional AVO. The evidence does not allow one to ascertain which of the two conclusions be the correct one.
	
	
	The next record of the event made by the complainant of which the Court was aware was the record made by Dr Lombard commencing at 12.16pm on Monday 11 August 2014. The contemporaneous consultation notes of the practice which are exhibit 8 are these:
	


“Saturday went for lunch with friends. Got home at 8.30pm. Husband became very angry that had stayed out late and had has[sic] something to drink and as Camilla was trying to get into the bathroom and husband tried to prevent [her] entering bathroom - grabbed her right forearm and then pushed her in [to] bedroom and hit her with fist on her left hand side of face. No loss of consciousness.”

The same history is recorded in paras [6] to [8] of Dr Lombard’s expert certificate which is exhibit 7. The appellant by his counsel has submitted that it is significant that the complainant gave the doctor a history of her having consumed alcohol at the luncheon because that indicates that her consumption of alcohol was a relevant consideration. There is force in that submission. Whilst the contemporaneous notes merely refer to “something to drink” the expert certificate glosses those words with the word “alcohol” and that in my view is clearly the understanding by Dr Lombard what she was told by the complainant and it is clearly a rational inference because, if the complainant had only been drinking water, it would have been an irrelevant consideration to bring up when the complainant saw the doctor and explained to her the nature of what had made the appellant angry.


	
	The next communication that is in evidence is the email sent by the complainant to Constable Spicer at 4.45pm on Monday 11 August. It is clear that that document stems from the appellant’s having read the provisional AVO. The initial purpose of sending the email was to transmit to Constable Spicer photographs taken of the inside of the complainant’s mouth and of her lip taken at Dr Lombard’s surgery. The email is this:
	


“I didn’t send photos of inside my mouth and lip. They are attached.

I noticed in the AVO and there was no reference to the hand grip he put around my wrist (I included a photo in my first email). Just wanted to make sure you knew that.

Not really sure if it was his right or his left hand that hit me it all took me by surprise and I was in shock.

I went to the doctor today so she could document that the cuts inside my mouth and marks on arm (you can see two finger marks) from physical contact.

As I previously mentioned, Justin on the phone on Sunday night denies hitting me and says I pushed him (he also said I always push and hit him) and then I fell over (then later he admitted to pushing me). He said I came home abusing him. One of the reasons the argument started was because he was verbally abusing me and I said “Keep going I will record you on the phone.” If I was abusing him why would I want to record myself? He says in his email “Thankfully dad witnessed how drunk you were” but Justin was still happy to leave me with the kids and go to his dads. Kai’s bedtime is 7pm so he should have been asleep and he was still in the bath at 8.30pm when I came home.

Justin has documented the incident in an email and “next steps” for separation clearly trying to protect himself and putting blame on me for being at a girlfriend’s bday at Catalina’s for 10 people between 2-8pm and having a few drinks. I have been in contact with a solicitor and they have advised me not to respond until I meet with them tomorrow at 11.30am.

A question regarding the AVO that the solicitor asked was whether he was allowed to come back into the house?

Thanks again for all your help.”


	
	As I mentioned yesterday the appellant gave an interview to the police on Wednesday 13 August 2014 commencing at 12.37pm. However, the complainant did not make any statement to the police until Tuesday 19 August 2014 and made a further statement on Tuesday 26 August 2014 to make an amendment to her first statement. According to the statement of Senior Constable Catherine Farrel, the officer-in-charge of the investigation, the purpose of the amendment was to correct a date in the original statement. It is to be noted that the complainant’s statement was made almost a week after the statement that had been made by the appellant.
	
	
	I turn now to the complainant’s evidence-in-chief which commenced on 3 February 2015. The complainant said that she went to lunch at 2pm and left the restaurant at 8pm. She was asked what happened when she arrived, she said that when she walked in the door she could hear Kai yell “mummy” and from that she deducted that Kai was in the en suite bathroom. The complainant then said that she could tell from the appellant’s body language that he was “very angry”. She was asked to describe the appellant’s body language and said this:
	


“His face was red, his eyes were wide open, he had his teeth and he puffed out his chest and the...en suite is only a narrow entrance, only about 80 centimetres and he stood in the, in the entrance way so I couldn’t get past to see my son who was in the bath watching the ipad and I wanted to say hello to my son”.

In answer to the following question the complainant said this:

“Justin was angry and he yelled in my face, “you fucking bitch, I fucking hate you” and I, I tried to get past and I said “excuse me”. and then I lifted my right arm and tried to manoeuvre past and that’s when he grabbed my arm with a clenched fist...”.

In cross-examination the complainant gave a different version of what the appellant said to her in the initial confrontation. The question and answer are these:

“Q. I want to put to you that when you arrived home that Justin, your husband, upbraided you for being intoxicated? That happened, didn’t it?

A. He was angry that I had been gone for 6 hours. He said, “Where the fuck have you been? You have been gone for 6 hours. You’re a fucking irresponsible mother”. No”.

The “no” is clearly the direct answer to the question asked, however the recitation of what was initially said by the appellant is different to what the complainant said he said in her evidence-in-chief and it is to be noted that the evidence in cross-examination was given at the second day of hearing, on 27 February 2015. Quite frankly there was much more plausibility in the answer she gave in cross-examination than in the answer she gave in chief.


	
	I return now to the complainant’s evidence-in-chief as to her version of what happened between the complainant and the appellant. After giving the evidence in chief which I have just recently recited, the prosecutor directed the complainant’s attention to the evidence that she had given that she had raised her right arm. The evidence of the complainant continued thus:
	


“A. Yeah I was trying past, trying because he, he wouldn’t let me past, he had his chest up and wouldn’t let me past and Kai was “mummy”. and so I said “excuse me”. and tried to you know normally if I put your arm up like that someone will move past but he stood his ground and would not move and then as I put my arm up then he grabbed it and, squeezed with a clenched hand and squeezed really tightly and then twisted it.

Q. I will just describe what you did. So your right arm was held up and it was bent at the elbow?

A. Yes.

Q. And the fist was clenched.

A. Yeah.

Q. On that arm? And then he used one hand to grasp around just above the wrist but inbetween the elbow and the wrist?

A. Yes.

Q. Right once you say that your arm was grabbed and lifted and twisted, what happened then or what did you do?

A. Well I yelled “let me go” and Justin wouldn’t let go for a little while, and then he let go, and then he said “I fucking hate you, you fucking bitch, you’ve ruined my life.”

Q. I will just get you to stop there. Okay so once he said that?

A. And then I still hadn’t been allowed to get close to my son so I, I felt very scared and threatened. So I went back into the kitchen to grab my mobile phone because I felt, I felt scared and I came back and said “keep yelling abuse at me and I will record you on my phone”, I just - I, I thought my phone would provide me protection and if I said that I was going to record it he, he would stop and walk away, which he didn’t. As I was walking back from the kitchen back into the en suite he had a clenched fist and he punched me across the face.

Q. I just describe action that you made, you held your right arm up with a clenched fist and you held it bent elbows across your face and you pushed what would be your little finger and you used what would be your little finger and you pushed your clenched fist forward?

A. Yeah, it wasn’t a punch it was across the face.

Q. So you made the gesture from the arm being in front of your face and the elbow extending out?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you say that you’re punched across the face or..

A. Yeah on my left hand side.

Q. And how did that feel?

A. Well I, I screamed, I was in immense pain and my tooth had gone through my cheek, so there was blood, you know I was in incredible pain, I mean my arm was obviously hurting to start with and then my face.

Q. And what did you do?

A. Well I, then I hear Kai screaming in the bath crying so my first priority was him, I started to cry and I yelled “you just hit me”, Justin walked away and said “you worthless bitch, I fucking hate you, I’m going to get rid of you”, and I picked myself up off the floor and walked into Kai. At this point I didn’t realise I had blood on my face and then Kai screamed-

Q. I’ll just get you to stop there. You just said that you picked yourself up off the floor?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you get to the floor?

A. I, I fell backwards.

Q. And when you say you fell backward when did you fall backwards?

A. After I had been hit.

Q. And so once you were hit you fell to the floor?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you said that you heard your son screaming?

A. Yes.

Q. And then Mr Crotty said things to you?

A. Yes.

Q. And then continue from where I interrupted?

A. And, and then I went into the bathroom and that’s when Kai really then screamed and said “mummy you’ve got blood on your face” and so I quickly grabbed a towel and wiped my face and you know Kai was screaming, got him out of the bath and I said “it’s okay, mummy is okay.

Q. And then what happened?

A. And then I got Kai out of the bath, I dried him and I carried him in because he was, he was screaming, carried him into his room and put his pyjamas on and then tried to calm him down, I just kept saying “it’s okay, everything’s okay” and I put him on the bed, and read him a book.”


	
	The complainant then said that she read a book to her elder son for about 10 minutes and then stopped because the appellant had gone into “the room” and I infer that she meant by that into Kai’s bedroom. She then said that the appellant yelled out to her in front of their son “you’re a fucked mother” and then, because Kai was upset, she left the room immediately and she went into the kitchen. She then said that the appellant followed her into the kitchen and yelled at her words to this effect “It’s over, I want a divorce. I’ve cancelled your credit cards. I’m going to go and stay with my father tonight before I go to Korea in the morning.” She then said that the appellant threw $170, I infer in cash, on the kitchen bench and then she went back into Kai’s bedroom. She then said that she heard “the front door go” and that led her to presume that the appellant had left the home unit. Before that she had heard him making a telephone call to his father.
	
	
	A few minutes later, she thought about 4 or 5 minutes later, she heard the front door open and did not know who it might be and she then left Kai’s bedroom and saw the appellant’s father standing outside; the appellant then walked into their bedroom to fetch his bag and then he left with his father. The closing and then re-opening the front door is consistent with evidence given by the appellant and his father that when the father reached outside the couple’s block of home units he telephoned the appellant who went down to meet him and then both went to the unit where the appellant completed the packing of his bag before eventually leaving with his father.
	
	
	The complainant was later asked what she did after the appellant and his father had left the unit. She said that she returned to Kai’s bedroom, that he was still awake, and she lay with him for about 30 minutes and once he finally went to sleep she left the bedroom and then burst into tears because she was so shocked at what had happened. She then said this:
	


“I felt guilty and awful, my son had witnessed blood on my face and you know, I felt awful. He’d said, ‘you know mummy, daddy’s, daddy’s scaring me’. You know, so I just bawled and I probably cried for, for about 15 minutes hysterically and then I called my girlfriend, Sally”.

If the appellant and his father left the unit shortly after 9pm, which appears to be to me likely, then the times just recorded from the evidence of the complainant match the timing of her phone call to Mrs Sally Obermeder at about 9.50pm.


	
	Shortly before the commencement of cross-examination the complainant gave this evidence:
	


“Q. What did you do in relation to your arm being what you said sore, and the pain that you described after you were hit to the face?

A. Well, I was in incredible pain, you know both, both the arm I mean from the bruising you can see what incredible pain that had been inflicted”.

With the upmost respect I can only regard the words “incredible pain” as hyperbole, for the minor wounds - and I do not use that word in its legal sense - inflicted, the minor physical damage which is shown in the photographic evidence. Other parts of what I have quoted also, in my view, have an air of hyperbole about them. For example I have quoted the evidence that the complainant gave about feeling “immense pain” immediately after the blow which may or may not have been a punch, and of the complainant’s tooth which “had gone through [her] cheek” which is clearly hyperbole because her teeth did not perforate her cheek, but rather there appears to be very minor damage to the inside of the complainant’s mouth. That damage was described by Dr Lombard in her evidence as being “petechiae” which a medical dictionary tells me are small, purplish haemorrhagic spots on the skin which appear in certain severe fevers and are indicative of “great prostration” as in typhus. They may also be due to an abnormality of the blood clotting mechanism. The term is also applied to similar spots occurring on mucous membranes or serous surfaces. The word can also be used to describe red spots from the bite of a flea. Clearly, the inside of the mouth is a mucous membrane and, accordingly, the petechiae were small, purplish, haemorrhagic spots noted on the inside of the complainant’s mouth, which might be the vestiges of some friction or minor blow between the teeth and the inside of the mouth. To suggest that this was a tooth going through the cheek is, in my view, hyperbole. Similar exaggeration can be noticed in the cross-examination of the complainant to which I shall soon turn.

[SHORT ADJOURNMENT]


	
	HIS HONOUR: Before I turn to the complainant’s cross-examination, I should indicate that, in my view, a major failing in the evidence-in-chief of the complainant was that after giving evidence of having been punched or otherwise struck by the appellant, the appellant disappears from the complainant’s narrative of what happened thereafter. For example, the complainant did not say whether she got up from the floor after falling backwards by herself or whether she was assisted by the appellant. She said that she heard her son screaming and she then went into the bathroom, where it is common ground the appellant had been bathing his son. She then said that after wiping blood from her face she took her son out of the bath, dried him, and then carried him into his bedroom, and put him in his pyjamas and put him to bed. The appellant is not mentioned anywhere in the complainant’s evidence-in-chief, he just disappears from the picture. One would think that he might have been inclined to return to the bathroom and to complete his bathing of his son, but according to the complainant she did so without encountering any opposition from the appellant, and indeed the appellant is not mentioned in the sequence of events after her being struck. This is surprising in my view.
	
	
	I now turn to the cross-examination of the complainant. Commencing at p 67 of the transcript of 3 February 2015, Mr Buchen, who appeared for the appellant in the Local Court, cross-examined the complainant about the history that she gave to Constable Spicer. On that page these two questions and answers appear:
	


“Q. And you told him at that time that you had come home at about 6.30 in the evening didn’t you?

A. I don’t recall that...

Q. And you told him that you came home about 6.30 from the restaurant, right?

A. I don’t recall that.”

She then said that she had no recollection of talking with Constable Spicer about the time of the incident. On the following page this question and answer appeared:

“Q. Didn’t you later email Constable Spicer to suggest to change the time of the incident?

A. I can’t recall.”

Her attention was then directed to the email of 7.30am on Sunday 10 August. When confronted with that, the complainant said this:

“...as I said I rang the police at 10pm, they arrived you know not long after. I’d just been punched in the face and my arm, my son crying, you know I was emotional, I was, I was in shock, you know I wasn’t there looking at my clock or whatever and then I had obviously thought more and more and more about it and emailed him in the morning.”


	
	Of course, that might explain why she gave an incorrect time when initially interviewed by the police shortly after 10.30pm on the evening of 9 August but does not explain her inability to remember things when giving evidence. This evidence was then given:
	


“Q. ...I’m not asking what you’re thinking at the moment, I’m asking what you told officer Spicer was the reason that you didn’t want to give him a statement?

A. Well I was scared.

Q. So what did you tell him?

A. I was scared, I was embarrassed, I was in shock.

Q. Did you say to him anything about not wanting to go through a court process?

A. I don’t recall, not to my knowledge.

Q. Not to your knowledge?

A. All I remember saying I was very clear, ‘I don’t want to charge my husband’ because I was in fear of myself.

Q. You’re in great fear at that time, is that what you’re telling us?

A. Yes.”

Q. And what you are very frightened of physical harm that’s your feeling at the time?

A. I’d just been hit.

Q. When you acknowledged when you sorry--

A. Two hours prior.”

The interjection of “two hours prior” is an admission that the interaction between the complainant and her husband occurred at approximately 8.30pm because the police did not arrive at her residence until 10.30pm. The answer to the preceding question which I have just quoted is clearly an acceptance that she was in fear of physical harm because she had just recently been struck by the appellant. There was then an objection and her Honour asked the complainant a question. The question is at the top of p 71 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 and is this:

“HER HONOUR: ...Are you saying is the last thing in those circumstances that you would tell a police officer that you are not afraid?

A. Yeah.”

Later on the same page the complainant confirmed that she was scared, otherwise why should she phone the police? She was scared, she was scared for herself and she was scared for her children. Then this evidence was given:

“Q. Did you tell Constable Spicer that you have no fears for my safety tonight?

A. I don’t recall that.

Q. Do you deny saying that?

A. I don’t recall saying it.

Q. Because you’ve just given evidence about just how - the state of fear that you’re in, right, you understand?

A. Yes.

Q. I’m putting to you that you did say to Constable Spicer, “I have no fears for my safety tonight”?

A. I do not recall saying that.”

Of course the note in Constable Spicer’s notebook clearly indicates that he was told by the appellant that she had no fear for her safety that evening and the complainant acknowledged that by signing the constable’s notebook. She was then confronted with the notebook and then protested that she did not read the notebook on the night that she signed it.


	
	Later the complainant said that on numerous occasions the appellant had told her he “could kill me with one punch”. He threatened her many times saying that he “wanted to knock me down and bash me and punch me so I was scared.” At the foot of p 75 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 the complainant gave this evidence:
	


“He had tried strangling me before in 2011 when I was holding my little son, he was less than a year old, he put his arms around my throat and left finger marks. He had done Chinese burns on my arms again when I was holding my little son and yanked my arm right behind my back. He has gestured in my face “I am going to fucking punch you, I am going to fuck you in the face,” it was not the first time.”

In other words, the complainant was protesting in cross-examination that physical violence had previously been offered to her by the appellant. This evidence was then given:

“Q. Did you also tell Constable Spicer that there had been no domestic violence in the past?

A. I did and the reason because...I was scared.

Q. You accept that you told Constable Spicer that?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you also tell Constable Spicer that the accused had verbally abused and threatened [you] for the past four years but has never acted upon it until tonight, did you tell him that as well?

A. Yes, I was scared.

Q. I’m just asking at the moment, did you tell him that?

A. Yes.

Q. You understand that you had called out the police to your apartment, you understand that?

A. Yes.

Q. And you understood that the police were there, once you called them out, to investigate a potentially criminal allegation right, correct?

A. Me, it was protection.

Q. Did you appreciate that you were under an obligation to tell the police the truth when they came out there?

A. Of course.

Q. Was it the truth when you told the police officer there had been no domestic violence in the past?

A. I was scared.

Q. Please answer the question?

A. I was emotionally scared.”

Q. Was it the truth that you told the police officer that there was no record of domestic violence in the past?

A. Yes.

Q. That was truthful was it?

A. There’s no record.

Q. I see you’re making a technical distinction at the time were you?

A. Yes.

Q. Between an actual act of domestic violence.

A. Well there was no record.

Q. And whether it had been recorded in the past?

A. There was no record.

Q. And when you’re speaking to Constable Spicer do you say you’re mindful of that distinction?

A. Yes.”


	
	The distinction between there being no prior domestic violence and there being no record of domestic violence was one that had been adverted to in an interjection between the Magistrate and Mr Buchen. The complainant had grasped that distinction and used it to explain why she had not mentioned earlier episodes of domestic violence between her and the appellant. That led to the complainant’s saying that when she was speaking to Constable Spicer shortly after 10.30pm on the evening of 9 August 2014 she had kept in her mind the distinction between a record of domestic violence and domestic violence itself. That, in my view, is extremely implausible when one recalls what was observed by Constable Spicer that the complainant was “pretty hysterical, she was crying and obviously still shaking while she was speaking with us,” which I have mentioned earlier. To make such a fine distinction when one is emotionally upset is in my view quite unlikely.
	
	
	Later the cross-examiner turned to the question of whether the complainant had been provided with the provisional AVO. Initially at p 80 line 27 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 she said that she did not recall those documents. The same averment is made on p 81 line 41 and p 81 line 50. Similar statements appear on p 82 at line 11 and p 82 at line 25. The complainant was then shown the email of 11 August 2014 made at 4.45pm, which is part of exhibit 13. This evidence was then given:
	


“Q. ..just I’m going to read the second paragraph to you. ‘I noticed in the AVO that there was no reference to the handgrip he put around my right wrist. I include a photo in my first email. Just wanted to make sure that you knew that,’ you see that there?

A. Mm.

Q. Right, so what’s happening there Ms Crotty is that you had clearly had the AVO document and were reviewing it and making suggested corrections to officer Spicer, correct?

A. It was not a priority, it wasn’t something I was taking in in detail. I’d asked my husband not to be charged. I had not asked for an AVO, all I’d asked was to record something in case something happened to me. I wanted it on record in case something...

Q. What was not a priority, the AVO?

A. I wanted it on record in case something happened to me.

Q. You were very active at this time, I put to you, seeking advice about this situation and gathering evidence to use against your husband, that’s what was happening at this time, correct?

A. No.”

Immediately after being shown the email and having the second paragraph read to her the complainant essentially confessed and avoided, that is, confessed that she had sent the email and avoided the implications arising from it by saying that it was not a priority for her. However, in confessing and avoiding the complainant did not make a frank concession that she had been in error in denying having previously read the AVO. The confession was eluded and only the avoidance was given. This, in my view, points to unreliability.


	
	The last negative answer, which I have quoted, also in my view is implausible. By the time that the email was generated at 4.45pm on Monday 11 August 2015 the complainant had obtained photographs of her physical injuries, initially the “selfies” taken by her on the evening of the event, then the photographs taken at Dr Lombard’s rooms. She had seen Dr Lombard and had made an appointment to see solicitors at 11.30am on the following day and had had certain communications with the solicitors. That becomes an issue later in her evidence as to whether she spoke to a solicitor or merely a solicitor’s secretary, but of course it was possible that she may have spoken to a paralegal. The exact identity of whom she spoke to was, in my view, of minor moment compared to the fact that she was seeking legal advice and obtaining it.
	
	
	Later Mr Buchen returned to the question of whether the complainant had seen the AVO document and this question and answer were given:
	


“Q. Ms Crotty, do you accept that after seeing these emails that you must have looked at the AVO document that’s MFI A and commented upon it?

A. I’d been punched in the face, hurt, and my son had been screaming, “Daddy scares me”, I was in no mental state.”

That essentially is a confession, without a confession, and an avoidance, and the avoidance in my view is completely inapt. It may explain why she gave inaccurate information to Constable Spicer on the evening of the 9 August, but does not explain her lapses of memory of what occurred on the subsequent days.


	
	Again the cross-examiner pressed the complainant about her answers about not knowing or not recalling what was in the provisional AVO document and of her reviewing it and the protestation made by the complainant was that it was not her document, that is the provisional AVO was not her document, and it was not something that she wrote and was not something that she was interested in. At p 88 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 the complainant said this:
	


“I probably skimmed it, like it wasn’t, it wasn’t you know - it wasn’t anything I took interest in.”

Again that speaks to me of implausibility.


	
	The cross-examination then turned to the luncheon in the afternoon of 9 August. The complainant admitted that she was picked up at around 1.55pm by Ms Kylie Twomey, that she arrived at the restaurant shortly after 2pm, that champagne was ordered and that one of the ladies attending the luncheon did not arrive till about 3pm. She thought that lunch was ordered at 3.30pm and that the entrée did not arrive until 4pm. She then volunteered this evidence:
	


“I think the mains [courses] were probably served around about, oh geez, about 5.30, yeah it must’ve been about 5.30 and then the desserts after that. We didn’t pay the bill until about 7.”

The complainant then agreed to the proposition that the dessert was consumed up until 7pm and the bill was not paid until 7. In fact, exhibit 14 indicates the bill was paid at 5.47pm, that is shortly after quarter to six. The bill had been split evenly between the ten luncheon participants. The complainant went on to say that after the bill was paid, she went onto the balcony of the restaurant and took onto the balcony whatever drink had not yet been consumed at the table. She denied that any further drinks were ordered when they were on the balcony. She said that she was on the balcony for only “another hour”. She denied buying any drink for herself or anyone else providing her with a drink. The complainant said that she drank six glasses of Verve Clicquot champagne and nothing else to drink. She agreed that table wine was served as well but she did not have any of that and she preferred to drink champagne. She agreed that she left the restaurant by herself at 8pm in a cab that had been organised for her by the restaurant staff.


	
	She was then confronted with the bill. It was suggested to the complainant that she moved from the table to the balcony or bar area of the restaurant after the bill was paid at 5.47pm. However, she disagreed with that. She also disagreed that she was drinking between the time that she paid the bill at 5.47pm and leaving the restaurant about 8pm. That evidence is again implausible in my view. The bill clearly was paid at 5.47pm. When the bill is paid the table is usually left. The complainant and her group of friends had gone there for lunch. Dinner, one would expect, is served commencing from 6pm. The appellant gave evidence to that very effect and that is consistent with jury knowledge available to any tribunal of fact. The protestation by the complainant that she did not imbibe any alcohol between 5.47 and 8pm, that is over a period of more than two hours is also implausible because her position all along had been that in six hours at the restaurant she consumed six glasses of champagne. Her position was not that in the first four hours she consumed six glasses of champagne and then abstained from taking alcohol but rather that the consumption of the six glasses was over six hours.
	
	
	Yesterday I pointed out that there was evidence called from others who had attended the restaurant and evidence was also not adduced from a number of people who attended the luncheon and that some of those who attended the luncheon had never been identified in the evidence. No one was called who was with the complainant between 7pm at the latest and 8pm when at the earliest she would have left the restaurant.
	
	
	It was suggested to the complainant that when she arrived back at the “family home”, the unit occupied by the appellant, the complainant and their children that she was “very intoxicated”. She absolutely denied that. She denied that she was swaying on her feet and she denied that she was slurring her words. The cross-examination of the complainant continued on 27 February 2015. The transcript clearly shows that in the interim the complainant reread the statement that she had made to the police and looked at her telephone records and in particular her telephone bill. She admitted in cross-examination on 27 February 2015 that she could not remember on 3 February 2015 that she had made a call to her friend Kylie Toomey at 7.49pm, a call that she made from the restaurant. Later the evidence suggested that the voicemail message was left at 7.12pm and that at 7.42pm there was a phone call which was a second call to Kylie and then there was a third call made at 8.01pm which lasted for 241 seconds, or four minutes, which could not have been either a voicemail or a text message. However, the appellant had no recollection of those communications. One wonders why the appellant could not recall those telephone calls or what she wished to or did discuss with Kyle Toomey.
	
	
	At p 15 of the transcript of 27 February 2015 the complainant admitted that she left the restaurant “a little after eight”, and then said that she got home at about 8.15pm. It was suggested to the complainant that when she spoke with her friend Sally Obermeder she had told her that she came home at about 8.30pm but that was denied. However, the evidence of Ms Obermeder did not establish that admission by the complainant, but that admission has otherwise been made on a number of occasions.
	
	
	In her evidence-in-chief the complainant was asked this question by the prosecutor and the following answer was recorded:
	


“Q. So at the time that you arrived home on that day on a scale of one to ten, ten being very intoxicated, what would you say you were?

A. I’d had six glasses over six hours so you know five, six, I mean.”

When I initially read the transcript I thought that the complainant may have not understood the question correctly, because the answer that she gave would indicate that she was in the middle of the range between sober and very intoxicated, meaning that she was moderately intoxicated. However, it appears the complainant did understand the question correctly, because on the second day, 27 February 2015, this evidence was given:

“Q. Wasn’t it the case that you’ve already conceded that on a scale on one to ten, with ten being very intoxicated, that when you arrived home you would have been around five to six on the scale? Haven’t you already conceded that?

HER HONOUR

Q. Was that the case?

BUCHEN: Yes it is. Transcript p 58, line 20.

WITNESS: About five, well I, I had had six drinks over - I mean, what does five mean? You know, like one, one to ten, what does five mean? I don’t really [know] what five, you know was I drunk or was I not drunk? I was not drunk.”

[LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT]


	
	It is clear to me from the answer which I have just quoted that the complainant knew what a scale of 1 to 10 was but I cannot accept that she did not understand the significance of what a 5 meant when a scale was proposed of 1 being sober and 2 being very intoxicated. A lady with the complainant’s background should have some idea of what a scale is and where to rank herself within the scale. It is clear to me that she understood the question that she was asked in chief and that she conceded, in effect, that she may have been moderately or mildly intoxicated. On the same page in cross-examination on the second day, that is p 16 the complainant admitted that she “had a drink” but protested that she was “not drunk” but then stated that she was not affected by alcohol which I find difficult to accept in light of where she had placed herself on the scale between 1 and 10.
	
	
	It was then that Mr Buchen put the question which I quoted much earlier today about the appellant’s upbraiding her for being intoxicated and when she answered that in essence the reason why the appellant was angry was because she had been gone for six hours and gave evidence as to statements that he made when she arrived home which I found to be more plausible than the answers that she had given in chief. It was then suggested by Mr Buchen to the complainant that the comments made by the appellant to the complainant when she got home “about being intoxicated” made her upset and angry with him. She denied that was the case, the denial may be referable to comments being about intoxication rather than to the comments being about some insult that she perceived that the appellant was offering to her. In any event it would appear that when she arrived home comments were made which did inflame her.
	
	
	The complainant was cross-examined about the version of events which had been given by the appellant in his interview with the police on 13 August 2014 in which he was to restate in his oral evidence to the Court. It was suggested to the appellant that in the bathroom, that is the en suite bathroom, she commenced tapping her finger onto the appellant’s chest and she denied that. It was then put to her that she then started to punch the appellant which elicited this response:
	


“My husband is a black belt in karate. He has been very, very angry. He has been taking steroids and growth hormone. I would not do anything to put myself at jeopardy. Numerous times he has told me he could kill me with one punch. I would not provoke my husband.”

The answer to that question could have been a simple “no”. The complainant gave an answer which to an extent is plausible, that her husband was an expert in the martial art of karate. However then to add that he had been taking “steroids and growth hormone” is merely to insult him, to seek to denigrate him in court which must throw doubts on her objectivity. In answer to a further question the complainant protested that her husband weighed 100 kilos and was 6 foot 3 in height as well as reiterating that he was a black belt in karate. Whether the dimensions attributed to the appellant by the complainant are accurate or not I do not know. However I do know from the statement of Senior Constable Farrell that the complainant could be described “as a slim Caucasian female about 5 foot 6 inches, in her early forties, with long blond hair and blue eyes”. She is depicted most clearly in the photograph which became Exhibit 10, a photograph of the complainant standing in the ensuite bathroom of what had been the matrimonial residence.


	
	It was then put to the complainant that the appellant blocked the punches with one of his hands and she denied that that occurred, obviously because she has denied that she sought to punch the appellant at all. She denied that the appellant then pushed her away using his shoulder. It was then suggested to the complainant that the appellant turned his back towards her in order to take Kai out of the bath. She said that that did not occur because Kai did not get out of the bath. Her evidence was that Kai “was still in the bath”. She denied that the appellant turned to take Kai out of the bath and it was then put to the appellant that after he had done so she sought to force her way past the appellant to reach Kai and that in the process of that occurring she came into contact with the appellant’s hip and that caused her to fall and as she fell she hit her head on the bathroom wall. It was then put to the complainant that after that occurred she became incredibly angry and accused the appellant of hitting her. All of those things were denied.
	
	
	The cross-examiner then turned to evidence which he intended to adduce from Mr Brendan Crotty. The complainant maintained the position that Mr Brendan Crotty did not set a foot inside the home unit. She said that he stayed on the mat at the front door. Not only did she say that he stayed there when she was in the kitchen but she denied that he entered the apartment to check on Kai in his bedroom. It was then suggested to the complainant that she said words to Mr Brendan Crotty to the effect that the appellant physically and verbally abused the children, but she denied that she said that to Mr Brendan Crotty. She denied that Mr Crotty spoke to her at all. The complainant’s evidence about Mr Brendan Crotty could be summed‑up in this question and answer:
	


“Q. On your version you can categorically say Brendan Crotty did not walk into the apartment?

A. Absolutely”.

She then volunteered that the incident occurred at 8.30 and that Mr Brendan Crotty arrived there 20 minutes later. That evidence is recorded on page 21 of the transcript, 27 February 2015, commencing at line 34.


	
	I have considered the complainant’s evidence at some length because the law requires me to do so. There were only three persons that could be relevant witnesses to the alleged assault. They are the complainant, the appellant, and the four and a half year old child, Kai, who was not called. He certainly would not have been capable of giving sworn evidence and I doubt that he would have been capable of giving unsworn evidence. In any event, he was not a compellable witness against his father and I am confident that he would not have understood his right not to give evidence against his father. In other words we are reduced by inevitable logic to the proposition that there were only two relevant witnesses; the complainant and the appellant.
	
	
	In Regina v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 Lee J said at 19E:
	


“In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’ evidence is unreliable.”

That dictum was cited with approval by the High Court of Australia in Robinson v The Queen (1999) 197 CLR 162 at [21] and in Tully v The Queen (2006) 230 CLR 234 per Kirby J at [55]-[59], and also by Hayne J at [89]. In any trial with a jury I am required, where there is only one essential witness in the Crown case, to give what is usually called a “Murray Direction”. I am required to give it when I sit alone as the tribunal of fact. The standard Murray Direction is this:

“Wherever the Crown seeks to establish the guilty of an accused person with a case based largely or exclusively on a single witness it is important that the jury are told that they should exercise caution. That is what I am going to tell you now. You must exercise caution before you convict the accused because the Crown case largely depends on your accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness.

This being so, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is both an honest and accurate witness in the account she has given, you cannot find the accused guilty. Before you can convict the accused you should examine the evidence of the complainant very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you can safely act upon the evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial.

That caution is not based upon any personal view that I have of the complainant. I told you at the outset of this summing-up that I would not express my personal opinions on the evidence. But in any criminal trial, where the Crown case relies solely or substantially upon the evidence of a single witness, a jury must always approach that evidence with particular caution because of the onus and standard of proof placed upon the Crown.

I am not suggesting to you that you are not entitled to convict the accused upon the evidence of the complainant. Clearly you are entitled to do so but only after you have carefully examined the evidence and satisfied yourself that it is reliable beyond reasonable doubt.

In considering the complainant’s evidence and whether it does satisfy you of the accused’s guilt, you should of course look to see if it is supported by other evidence.”


	
	I have scrutinised the evidence of the complainant carefully. I have doubts as to the reliability of some of what the complainant has said. There is exaggeration, there is implausibility, there is clearly partiality, and there is clearly a professed lack of memory when one would not expect there to be such a lack of memory.
	
	
	I turn now to the evidence of the appellant. Firstly I should outline what he said in the electronically recorded interview with the police. Commencing at A21 he said this:
	


“...on August 9 about 1.30 my wife went out to lunch. Ah, I’m not sure who with but she went to Catalina’s and she returned home ah, to our place in Bellevue Hill at 8.30pm. Ah, I observed that um, my wife was very drunk. She does like a drink. ...but it looked like she’d done um, had an extra skin full that night...When she came back ah, I said to her ‘That’s pathetic’. You know you’re a grown woman, a mother, and you’re still acting like a teenager’. That was potentially a bit of a, um, throwing a match to start a fire really combined with the alcohol. At that time when my wife had arrived I was washing ah washing, ah, bathing my son Kai, he’s four and a half years of age. Ah, so after seeing my wife I went to return to the, the bathroom. Now this is an en suite that’s connecting to our main bedroom which is close to the front door. So she walked straight in, Camilla was obviously very annoyed at what I had said. Um, now there is some tension between us. Ah, she’s quite a fiery character, ah, she’s used to getting what she wants.

Ah, it’s very likely that our relationship will probably end up in divorce...So we tried...So with, following my comments to my wife that I don’t think highly of her being so drunk, she followed me into the bathroom. I went back to ah, my son was still in the bath, so I went back into the en suite. Ah, look I got my son out and put him on the mat and put a towel around him...Now my wife followed, came in and then she started a process of trying to ah, really start a fight. So we went through this process ah, of her um, initially making comments about my character, being a loser, thinking you’re so cool. You know just repeating comments like that, pretty inane stuff...so I ignored her and laughed at her. That which probably inflamed her...so then with her right hand started pointing her finger and tapping her finger into my ah, my chest, my left chest up towards the shoulder. So look, I laughed at it a bit and that again further infuriated her. She then started punching me and I started ah, first one I laughed at, the second one hit again and I started blocking her with my left hand.

Now, at that particular point in time, one of my blocks, ah, my hand touched her shoulder and she moved, she moved backwards...So she would probably regard that as a push. I was just defending myself and I think I was entitled to. But it was not serious at this point of time. It was just like, you’re a drunk person, just get your act together right...so I didn’t think too much of it but obviously my wife was quite ah quite, um, ah, mad. I then turned my back to her and put my attention back to my four and a half year old son who I was obviously in the process of trying to dry...So I tried to dry his head. Now I had turned my back on my wife. I was facing ah, my son...So he had his towel around him and I was ignoring her, she’s being annoying. So I turned my back like this. So then I started finishing all the drying. My wife ah, then reached across tried to grab my son. Like it was nothing, you know. And she said, ‘this is my boy, I want access to him,’ and I’m trying to dry him. So she pushes me and I push back with my hip...that results unfortunately in my wife um, hitting her head around about here on the tiled wall on the side. So where the main bedroom is here, there’s a wall, it’s all tiled and then she fell down...so at that time I was a bit shocked, so this was like an accident. So I picked her up and she went a bit crazy so I then brought her into the room, put her on the bed and sat her down. I thought she might calm down. Then she went extra angry at me...I then said, ‘this is not good.’ Mind you, we’ve left my son standing in the bathroom, he’s not obviously too happy about it. I went and called my father...and said, ‘mate this is escalated, I think I need you here to witness this and I think it might be best if I stay away’...so about 20 minutes later my father turned up, so it was about 10 to 9 or so. In the interim, my wife kept yelling at me and I just walked away. Now I had to um my father’s going to pick me up. I was actually going to Seoul the next day in Korea. So I tried to finish my packing that I had started. I just walked away. Camilla then finished off my son, brought him around, put his pyjamas on, took him to bed.”

At the commencement of that quotation the appellant said what his initial comments were to his wife. He gave other versions of his reproach to her later in the interview.


	
	At Q56 the appellant was asked what was the initial conversation, but before I recite what he said I should turn to other information he conveyed commencing at A64. What had alerted the appellant to his wife coming home appears to have been the opening and closing of the front door. At A64 he said that she closed the door and she put her keys in a place where they were usually put outside the main bedroom. At that time he said he was in the main bedroom. He heard her key “click” and he came out of the bedroom, and that was when he made the comment. He said that he made the comment when he was in the main bedroom and then he went back into the en suite bathroom to continue bathing his son.
	
	
	According to A58 the appellant was “probably...annoyed that she’d come home a lot later than she said she would”. The appellant then said at A59 that he made a comment to her that she was “more pissed than usual”. He went on to say that her eyes were glazed, she was swaying and he could “see the fire in her belly”. He then said that, “Alcohol was a fire starter for her”. He then said that he said to her disapprovingly, “I thought that was pathetic”. I find it very difficult to see how one can see “fire in the belly”. I can understand that she may have become irritated, upset, aroused, inflamed when the appellant remonstrated with her and it may well be that his noting her anger occurred only after he made some initial remark to her that inflamed her. At the A92 another insult which the appellant conceded to having made to his wife was “another drunk night, good on you”, although he thought that he made that remark when she was following him into the en suite bathroom.
	
	
	The appellant was asked how it was that he came to pick her up. He said that she had ended up sitting on the floor with her back against the wall and then he picked her up by lifting her from under her armpits. He then took her into the bedroom and sat her on the main bed. It was after he then sat beside her that “she went ballistic” and accused him of hitting her, to which he replied that he did not hit her and then she accused him of being a bully. It was then that he went to phone his father.
	
	
	At A145 the appellant admitted that his wife was “incredibly angry at me” and then he referred to an email he sent to her after he arrived in Korea, outlining what might be described as a separation plan. That is discussed at some length in A145 and A146, and needs not to be recited because it became irrelevant as the case was presented. The appellant said that he had no intention to harm his wife and that when he moved his hip which struck her and caused her to fall, that was accidental.
	
	
	There was then a discussion about various matrimonial difficulties. Those I need not go into, but one piece of the interview I need to set out because it has been wholly misinterpreted by the Magistrate. Commencing at A158 this was said:
	


“Ah, there’s been tension for a while. Um, look I just had to give in to her unreasonable demands. Like, for example, she wants to go to Ibiza in two weeks’ time so I, she keeps going at me. Okay. Yeah. No worries. Everyone deserves a holiday. Ah, I want to go business class. Yeah. Okay. Go business class. And so if she was so concerned about me being a bad father and the like, she’s already agreed and we’ve got tickets issued for her to stay in business class all the way to Ibiza. That’s...Barcelona...then she’s going to Ibiza with her girlfriends, so no husbands and stuff, I’m just going, go have your fun. You’ve been a mum for a couple of years, you need some time out. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Ah, she’s booked ah, booked, ah, accommodation in Barcelona. So I guess if she was concerned about me being a really bad and violent father, which I’m sure she’s probably said, she was prepared to let my sons be looked after [by] me, by me for two weeks that she’s away. So um, I don’t know what the status of that is, but it’s all paid for. All the tickets are issued in her name. Accommodation’s all confirmed.”


	
	There were then some questions directed to how it was that the appellant knew that his wife had come home at 8.30pm. The appellant then volunteered that he let his son Kai watch television cartoons up to a certain time and that they are on the half hour. He then said that he coaxed his son out of the main bedroom and into the bath and switched on the football. It became clear at the hearing in the Local Court that the routine was that Kai went to bed at 7pm as a general proposition but that the appellant, being like many men an indulgent father, permitted his elder son to stay up later, till 8.30pm, watching cartoons such as Scooby Doo and perhaps the NRL and then had to try to persuade him to go to bed by putting him into the bath prior to putting him into bed. That was another item of disagreement between the appellant and his wife.
	
	
	The appellant towards the end of the interview was asked by Constable Farthing for how long there had been tension between the appellant and the complainant, and the appellant said that that had been the case since the birth of their second child, who I do know was born in October 2013. On that estimate there had been matrimonial tension for some ten months.
	
	
	Early in his evidence-in-chief, which commenced before the Magistrate on 27 February 2015, the appellant said on oath that he had striven to be accurate when he answered the questions posed to him by the police at the interview on 13 August 2014. He was then asked by Mr Buchen what time the complainant arrived home on 9 August and he said, “Just before 8.30”. He then gave this evidence, which I seek to shorten by omitting the questions and any extraneous matter:
	


“I soon became aware of Camilla arriving when I heard the keys rattling in the door. At that particular point in time I was bathing my son in the bath which is in the en suite adjacent to the main bedroom.

I went out to see, see her, normally greet her. It became very apparent that Camilla was very drunk. She’s been swaying, her eyes were glazed over as usual, and when she started speaking to me I became - the words were slurred. So that particular point in time, I chipped her...I said - disapprovingly I said to her, that’s pathetic. You’re a grown woman and you’re a mother. Get your act together’...As I had been bathing my son I returned to the ensuite via the main bedroom and I took my son out of the bath. I placed him on the mat in front of the vanity and put a towel around him. At that particular point in time Camilla had followed me into the ensuite to have further words with me...Camilla became aware...that Kai was still up. Kai usually should be in bed by 7 as it was a Saturday night and I am perhaps a bit more relaxed with parenting timetables, I let Kai stay up. It was apparent that Camilla was very annoyed at that particular point and she told me that I was a bad parent, I was a loser and....you think you’re way too cool”.

By that time Camilla had entered the ensuite bathroom. The appellant’s evidence continued thus:

“So Camilla had proceeded to use her right hand and she poked me in my left shoulder a couple of times. I sort of looked back, ‘what are you doing?’. Camilla then graduated, I think in frustration to my comments to her with a punch, I call it, it’s like a downward motion like that [a hammer action is the best description]...I put my left hand to stop it. She continued doing that a couple of times. Then I was frustrated with that and I went, ‘get out of here, what are you doing?’ and pushed my left hand against her right shoulder. She did move back but didn’t fall over. I thought that was the end of the event. Camilla had let off her steam. I then turned back - my attention back to my son Kai. Mind you, he’d been standing quietly on the mat while his parents - with a towel around him with his parents fighting, so that’s not a particular proud moment.

I started to try and dry him again and where I was standing at that point of time was right next to the vanity. It’s a small area, it’s a wet area. Camilla tried to push past. She was going, ‘Kai, Kai’. She bounded off my, my left hip, cause I was bent over like, like this, drying my son like that. There was a vanity here ...She tried to get between my...hip and the vanity corner. She then bounced off that and she hit the side of her head on the tiled wall which is adjacent to the vanity...She fell down. She fell down on her backside with her head against the wall, slumped against it. I was very concerned. I then picked her...up. I think she was in shock. I then picked her up and took her into the bedroom. The bed - sat her on the bed which is, you know, probably less than 2 metres away or a metre away from the....door that joints the ensuite to the main bedroom...And sat her down, and at that particular point in time I think Camilla registered that she’d been hurt. I thought she was in shock, at that particular point in time she exploded, ‘how dare you, how you hurt me, you hit me’, and I didn’t do any of this. Her eyes - it was the most angry I’d ever seen Camilla, and I, look I was very concerned about the response and where the, the next stage of the fight was going to go to”.


	
	The appellant then denied calling his wife a “fucking bitch” or saying that he hated her and denied saying that she had ruined his life. The appellant then had his attention directed to the complainant’s mobile phone. He then gave this evidence:
	


“During - in between the process of - after I’d given Camilla the, the push away, she went back into the main bedroom, I assume back to her bag, and come, come back with the mobile phone]...it was more like a threatening use of the phone in that she said, ‘I’ll record you. I’ll take you to the police’.”

The appellant then denied calling the complainant a worthless bitch or, again, saying words to the effect that he hated her and he wished to get rid of her. The appellant then returned to what happened in the bedroom after the complainant had fallen in the en suite bathroom and been carried to the bed by the appellant:

“So I sat Camilla down on...the bed in the bedroom and I was pretty surprised by the response of her anger. You know, she’s a little person but the anger that came out of her was pretty disproportionate and I was actually concerned about Camilla, and I knew immediately that she had thought that she’d been hurt and I’d, I’d tried to hurt her. So what I did was, I thought this is going to get out of control, I’m going to immediately call my father. I’d been planning to go to Korea the next day so I thought the most sensible thing was (1), to have my father come, come over and just pick me up, make sure he could, he could see that everything was okay. I was concerned about it escalating and the fact that the third party could actually help keep that a bit more level-headed. And the other thing was I didn’t want to particularly lie on a bed next to a person angry at me when I had to get up and fly to Seoul the next morning...so I called my father and asked him to come over and that was pretty much - Camilla and I did not interact after that particular point. I started trying to pack my bag.

This is after I had a chat to my father to come over. He in between the phone call and him actually arriving, I proceeded to pack. I’d sort of been starting, trying to do it through the course of the evening and so I finished it. Dad had arrived. It’s probably about 20 minutes after the argument with Camilla. So when Dad came in he sort of wanted to know what was happening and so he, he just sat there all sorry, he stood there in the kitchen adjacent to the door inside the house. I packed my bags and before we left dad and I - well I first checked on Kai and he was in the room with his mother, they seemed okay. Kallen was already asleep. Dad came in separately, had a look, he wanted to satisfy himself, and then we went back to Cammeray.”

SHORT ADJOURNMENT


	
	The penultimate area addressed in the appellant’s evidence-in-chief was the fact that he had no alcohol on the evening of 9 August 2013. There is no suggestion that at any material time was the appellant affected by alcohol. The final issue addressed in the appellant’s evidence-in-chief was whether he punched the complainant or struck her in the facial region or whether he squeezed her wrist at any relevant time. Those allegations were denied by the appellant.
	
	
	Amongst other things, the appellant was cross‑examined about his allegations about the complainant being under the influence of alcohol on the evening in question. It was suggested to the appellant that when the complainant came home she was “very drunk”. The appellant answered, “Yes, she was intoxicated”. Intoxicated can merely mean drunk. I have difficulty in understanding whether the appellant meant that, yes, the complainant was very drunk, or, yes, she was merely intoxicated. Shortly after the appellant gave this evidence:
	


“I have seen Camilla drunk many times. She gets drunk easily, she’s only a little person. I used to work in bars. I’ve observed all forms of drunken behaviour, and when Camilla came through that front door I immediately saw Camilla was drunk.”

He then stated that at least he could usually identify people who were drunk and he could do so straight away. Later in answer to that same line of questioning the appellant said:

“I could see the…glazing of the eyes, and certainly the uncoordinated movements in her high heels at the time.”

That is one discrimen for being intoxicated that I had not come across previously in 21 years on the Bench.


	
	The appellant was cross‑examined to suggest that when the complainant arrived home she said “I’m sorry I’m late” and he said that she did not say that. I should point out that I have not found any such averment in the complainant’s evidence. At page 69 of 27 February  2015 the appellant was cross‑examined about what he believed were the motivations behind the complainant’s anger. He gave this evidence:
	


“There were two issues for her. The fact that I chipped her, using my words, and the second thing, and In think she felt more righteous about, was the fact that Kai was still up”.

By using the words “I chipped her” the appellant was referring to his reprimanding the complainant.


	
	When cross‑examined as to the mechanism of the incident relied upon by the appellant, the appellant said that if a person stands between the vanity unit and the wall of the ensuite bathroom, opposite the vanity, another person is unable to pass. When one looks at the photograph which is exhibit 10, one can understand that evidence entirely and accept its accuracy. In cross-examination by the Magistrate the appellant was asked about his “flicking his hip” and he said that he did try to block her with his hip to frustrate her advance towards their son but at the time he did that he had no intention to cause any hurt.
	
	
	The only other significant evidence to have been given in my view by the appellant in cross-examination concerns his evidence about the actions of his father later in the evening which I do not need to go into at this point. The only other witness called in the defence case was Mr Brendan Crotty. At the commencement of his evidence he gave details about his background. It is worth noting that evidence. He formerly worked in areas of surveying, town planning and business administration. He was at the time he gave evidence a member of the Council of Macquarie University. He was at the time of giving evidence on 27 February 2015 Chairman of the Western Sydney Parklands Trust. He was also a director of a number of public and private companies. It is clear from that evidence that Mr Brendan Crotty is an accomplished man with many important and significant roles in our community indicating that he is a man of good character and a man of public standing.
	
	
	As I said earlier, he estimated that he received his son’s call at about 8.30pm on 9 August 2014 and arrived outside the unit occupied by his son and daughter-in-law between 8.54 and 8.57pm. He was asked what he did when he arrived in his car. He said that because he was not very familiar with gaining access to his son’s apartment, he called his son and asked him to go down to street level and to meet him at street level. That occurred. He said that the appellant explained to him when they met downstairs that there had been some disagreement between his son and his daughter-in-law. He then said this:
	


“At street level, I then started to hear that Justin had been bathing Kai at the time when Camilla came home and there had been some kind of disagreement in the ensuite or bathroom.”

He was asked to try to remember the words that were said to him by his son. He said this:

“A. The words, the words went something along the lines that he had been bathing Kai, Camilla had attempted to push past him, ‘I don’t know whether to grab Kai or not’ and that Camilla had slip on, on the bathroom floor and, and that was it.

Q. Just tell me where you went as you approached the apartment?

A. I was with Justin and when he opened the door I walked in and then I followed him to, through to the bedroom, Camilla was standing in the kitchen when I arrived.”

He confirmed that he walked into the apartment. He said that he followed Justin to observe him taking his bags. He said that knowing that there had been an argument between his son and daughter-in-law, he did not want to stay in the kitchen with his daughter-in-law and therefore he simply followed Justin “down to the bedroom” although that does not necessarily mean he entered the bedroom but he may have stood outside in the hallway.


	
	He was then asked whether there was a point of time when he was in the kitchen with the complainant and he replied that there was but that was more at the end of his visit rather than at the beginning. His evidence then continued thus:
	


“A. Sorry I went, I went down to the bedroom where Justin was packing his bags. I inquired about the welfare of the children because that was frankly my biggest concern, and I then - Justin said to me that Kai was asleep but I wasn’t really satisfied with that and we then walked down to Kai’s bedroom to discover that he was indeed asleep.

Q. You actually walked into the bedroom did you?

A. Kai’s bedroom?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You saw Kai there?

A. He was asleep, yes.

Q. Then what did you do after that?

A. Well, Justin was ready to go. I walked out with him through the kitchen and as I was leaving Camilla said to me, ‘Do you realise that Justin physically and verbally abuses his children?’ I said to Camilla, ‘I don’t believe that’ because I had observed him with his children on numerous occasions and really that was that. We left the apartment.

Q. Did you have an opportunity to make any observations of Camilla while you were in the apartment?

A. Well, she seemed to be intoxicated and her voice was slightly slurred and initially she seemed to me to be a bit unsteady on her feet.”

Mr Crotty senior then said that he asked his son whether the children would be “okay”, or whether Mr Crotty senior and his son should take the boys with them and that the appellant replied that they should not do that as the appellant did not want “to escalate anything” and therefore they left and drove to Mr Crotty’s home at Cammeray.


	
	In cross-examination, Mr Crotty senior admitted that his son had told him that as his son was bathing Kai, Camilla pushed past and slipped on the wet floor of the bathroom. He was then asked whether his son said anything else about the slip and he then said this:
	


“Only that she had attempted to push past him and he put his hip out of the way to block her or whatever, and somehow, I mean the floor obviously must have been slippery and she fell on the floor.

Q. Did he say like that she hit something on her or anything else?

A. No, she - he did say that she may have bumped her head as, as she slipped down and may have hit her head on the wall, I got the impression that, you know, that was a secondary issue.”

On p 95 of the transcript of 27 February 2015, Mr Crotty senior admitted that “to be perfectly frank” he was more concerned about the welfare of his two grandsons than he was about either his son or his daughter-in-law. He was then asked whether his son had told him that the complainant was “very drunk” and Mr Crotty senior denied that he had been told that by his son. He said that his son had told him that his wife had been drinking, but that his son did not use the words “very drunk.” This evidence was then given:

“Q. You’ve given evidence that she seemed to be intoxicated, her voice was slurred and initially she was unsteady on her feet?

A. That, that was my impression.

Q. She hasn’t said anything to you because you’ve walked in with Justin and she’s standing in the kitchen?

A. She hasn’t said anything to me at that point. It was only when she said to me that Justin had been physically and verbally abusive to the children that, that her voice was slurred, because she didn’t speak to me when I walked in.

Q. When you walked in and you saw her in the kitchen you say she was unsteady on her feet?

A. She, she did appear to be a bit unsteady on her feet.

Q. You’re walking straight through the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. You said in your statement that you provided which has the date of 25 February.

A. Yes.

Q. You said that she was ‘unsteady on her feet and I saw her swaying’?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Your first thought that she was intoxicated?

A. That’s right.

Q. And I mean to some extent if somebody said to you that someone had been drinking during the afternoon you wouldn’t be surprised that they were swaying a bit?

A. That my mind wasn’t conditioned by that to any great extent, it was a factual observation that I made.”


	
	Later this exchange occurred:
	


“Q. It didn’t occur to you when Justin said that she’d hit or slipped in the bathroom and hit her head to seek for Camilla any medical attention?

A. Well, when I looked at Camilla and I’m fairly familiar with football injuries and head injuries and all sorts of stuff, it didn’t even occur to me that there was anything wrong with Camilla.

Q. When you say that you’re familiar with types of injuries, your qualifications are surveying and town planning, you don’t have any medical training do you?

A. I’ve done First Aid and I’ve played football for a long time and I’ve seen a lot of concussion, including experiencing it myself, but I was not, I was not concerned about Camilla getting medical attention.”


	
	The cross-examination of Mr Brendan Crotty finished in this fashion:
	


“Q. I’m going to put to you that when you entered the apartment you stayed in the front door area, so that it would be near the kitchen?

A. I am very, very, very clear on what happened.

Q. I’m going to put to you that you didn’t go to Kai’s room?

A. Ma’am, I know what I did and what I saw. I’m only giving evidence on a very narrow range of issues, and I’m absolutely certain that I was in Kai’s bedroom because I, I saw Kai.

Q. I’m going to put to you that you didn’t go to Kai’s bedroom with Justin?

A. I can’t recall whether I went there with Jus - no, I didn’t go with Jussy.

Q. Mm-hmm.

A. Yeah.

Q. I’m going to put to you that in Kai’s room was Camilla?

A. No.”


	
	The inconsistency between the evidence of the appellant and his father concerned the visit to Kai’s bedroom. Mr Brendan Crotty was adamant that before he left the apartment he went into Kai’s room by himself and saw that Kai was asleep. He denied that he saw Camilla in the room with Kai and he maintained that he went there by himself. The appellant believed, and I use that verb advisedly, that Mr Crotty senior went into Kai’s room with the appellant himself, but it would appear that there were two visits, one involving the appellant and one without the appellant. This evidence was given by the appellant in cross-examination:
	


“Q. After you got your belongings from the master bedroom, you left with your dad?

A. After checking on Kai.

Q. When you say that you checked on Kai, Kai was asleep?

A. I can’t recall. I think he was getting close.

Q. Your dad didn’t go with you to check on Kai, did he?

A. No - well, he, he did it separately. So I did it first and my dad asked me, ‘are the boys okay’ and he probably wasn’t satisfied with my answer so he made his own enquiry. I directed him not to look at Kallen because let sleeping babies lie. So dad did have his own independent view.

Q. When you say you went to check on Kai, your dad wasn’t with you?

A. No, so there’s two separate occasions. Like I popped my head in to make sure everything was all right. Camilla shooed me out pretty quickly. Then dad separately, before he would go, he said, ‘Look are the boys okay? Should they come with us?’. I said, I said ‘No, leave them alone’, then he made his own enquiry, so he’s checked on Kai and he didn’t go to see Kallen, he took my word for it.

Q. Before you go and check on Kai, Camilla is in the kitchen, isn’t she?

A. There’s two separate events. Camilla comes and goes, right? You’re joining dots ahead of each other.

Q. You’re giving your version. You say that when you come back with your dad, your dad is in the front area, you say the kitchen area in your direct line of sight, and you’re in the bedroom packing your things…

A. So you’re asking me what..

Q. That’s where you are?

A. …what are the necessarily - the steps that was taken after escorting dad from up - down at Bennelong Crescent, up the stairs of the apartment?

Q. Then you’re in the apartment packing?

A. Yes. So dad stayed behind the front door, the front door was open, he was inside the apartment in the kitchen area. I then went to the main bedroom, continuing my packing, computers and all that stuff.

Q. When you’re continuing your packing Camilla comes into the kitchen?

A. Correct.

Q. At this point on your evidence you haven’t checked on Kai for that final time and your dad hasn’t yet?

A. That's correct. Dad just walked in pretty much.

Q. So prior to you leaving, so you’ve packed your belongings and you’re about to leave and that’s when you go and check on Kai, is that fair to say?

A. Yes, but - so the events where I was packing, Camilla came out, they had their conversation, I’ll let the witness statement speak for that, I couldn’t quite hear it all. When I’d finished packing and Camilla had finished her conversation with dad I think she went back, I checked on Kai, I left, I was satisfied he was all right. Dad then separately did his own enquiry and kept looking the same.

Q. And when you say Camilla went back, she went back to Kai’s room?

A. Yes, as I understand”.

There was then a question with a lengthy answer and eventually it was suggested to the appellant that the complainant would have been in Kai’s room when his father went to look in on Kai and he said that he believed that that was so. However, Mr Brendan Crotty’s evidence is to the contrary.


	
	I had become confused earlier in these reasons about the significant inconsistency to which I was referring. That was not whether the appellant and his father visited Kai’s bedroom together but whether Camilla was present in the bedroom when Mr Brendan Crotty entered it to check up on Kai. Mr Brendan Crotty said that the complainant was not in the bedroom at the time that he checked up on Kai, however the appellant believed that she was in the bedroom. This conflict is only of minor significance and may be thought by some to be irrelevant. However, the better view of the evidence is not the belief of the appellant but the sworn evidence of Mr Brendan Crotty that when he visited Kai in his bedroom he was asleep and that the complainant was not present in it. The attempt to draw an inconsistency between the evidence of the appellant and the evidence of his father is, in my view, of little or no moment.
	
	
	In essence, the appellant’s evidence is consistent with the record of interview that he gave to the police and is not, in my view, in any way inconsistent with the evidence given by Mr Brendan Crotty.
	
	
	Again it is necessary to consider relevant legal principles. In any jury trial I am required to direct the jury in a certain fashion where an accused person gives and/or calls exculpatory evidence relevant to a critical element in the Crown’s case. The direction is this:
	


“The accused has given and called evidence in support of the accused’s case to the effect that he did not intentionally assault the complainant.

If, having considered that evidence, and the submissions of both counsel in relation to it you accept that evidence then of course you must acquit the accused and bring in a verdict of ‘not guilty’, because it would follow that the Crown has not established beyond reasonable doubt its case in relation to an essential matter which it must prove.

If, after having given consideration to the evidence of the accused and the evidence called on his behalf and any evidence which the Crown asks you to take into consideration, you do not positively accept the evidence of either the accused or his witness in support of the accused’s case but that evidence leaves you, nevertheless, with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case in respect of any essential matter which it must prove, then you are bound, in law, to bring in a verdict of ‘not guilty’. In other words it is not the position that you have to believe that the accused and his witness are telling the truth before the accused is entitled to be acquitted. As I have previously emphasised to you throughout the whole of this case, it remains the position that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt the charge which it brings against the accused and it is never for the accused to prove that she or that he is not guilty.”


	
	Another form of that direction requires me to tell the jury that if the evidence given by the accused leaves the jury with a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case in respect of any element of the offence, or any essential fact that it must prove, then the jury are bound in law to bring in a verdict of not guilty. In other words, a jury does not have to believe that the accused and his witness are telling the truth before the accused is entitled to be acquitted. If at the end of their deliberations the jury finds that there is a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the defence is true, then the Crown has failed in its obligation to persuade the jury of the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, the defence case only needs to raise a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the defence is true.
	
	
	When I consider all of the evidence I cannot exclude as a reasonable version of events the version of events given by the appellant, corroborated to some extent by the evidence of his father.
	
	
	Before I turn to the reasons of the learned magistrate I must refer to the submissions of counsel. I shall do so in the morning. Stood over, part heard, to 10 o'clock in the morning on the morrow.
	


LEWER: Your Honour, if I could enquire, just so the appellant does have counsel appearing - is your Honour able to give me an indication how long your Honour may be?

HIS HONOUR: I should be finished by morning tea time.

[ADJOURNED TO THURSDAY 24 SEPTEMBER 2015]


	
	Immediately prior to adjourning yesterday I announced that prior to considering the reasons for judgment of the Magistrate I would consider the submissions of the parties. However, before I do so there is one further area of the evidence that I should canvas and that concerns communications between the complainant and the appellant during the luncheon on 9 August 2013.
	
	
	At 3.57pm the complainant sent to the appellant a text message which is:
	


“Just a heads up our meals hasn’t [sic] arrived yet. xx.”

The text message confirms, firstly, that the meals were served very late in the afternoon and, secondly, that there was affection at that time between the complainant and the appellant because the complainant said that each of the “x’s” represented a kiss and there is no dispute about that.


	
	At 3.59pm the complainant sent as a text message a photograph taken by a waiter of the party of ten ladies sitting around a circular table with Sydney Harbour in the background. It is clear from the heading of the text message that the complainant sent that not only to the appellant but to a lady identified as “Sarah” and to three other persons.
	
	
	At or around 6.38pm the appellant sent to the complainant a voice message. That is referred to on page 61, line 1 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 and at page 54, line 16 and page 60, line 6 of the transcript of 27 February  2015. The voice message is set out in full on page 60, commencing at line 6 of the second day’s transcript. It is this
	


“Are you bother coming home or not? As usual you lie. I want to know if I’m still going to Korea. Are you going to call[sic] some selfish act? Who are you with? What are you doing? I don’t know. At least give me the courtesy if you're not going to be so late as you are let me know what you are doing.”

It is to be borne in mind that the appellant was flying to Korea the next morning and that trip required him to leave home at 6am. He had anticipated that his wife would be home at 6pm “plus or minus an hour”. However, clearly at about 6.38pm he was becoming concerned as to the hour at which the complainant would be returning to the matrimonial residence and clearly he was concerned that if the complainant stayed out late his arrangements for travel might be placed in jeopardy.


	
	At 7.42pm the appellant sent to the complainant a text message, it is part of exhibit 9. The earlier text messages sent by the complainant are contained in the same exhibit. The appellant’s text message of 7.42pm is this:
	


“Are you going to bother to let me know your plans. Are you out all night? Do I have to cancel my trip to Korea - I leave here at 6am.”

Clearly the appellant’s annoyance about his wife’s failure to answer his earlier voicemail and his annoyance at the complainant’s not having come home yet were irritating the appellant.


	
	The evidence discloses three reasons for the later unfortunate interaction between the complainant and the appellant. They were firstly, the appellant’s annoyance that his wife had not come home at 6pm or communicated to him what her plans were and the resulting concern about his travel arrangements for early the following morning. The second reason was the appellant’s perception that his wife had been taking alcohol perhaps to excess. The third cause of grievance between the couple was clearly the annoyance to the complainant caused by the appellant’s not having put Kai to bed at 7pm, his standard retiring time, and his still being up at 8.30pm when the complainant came home and when Kai was still in the bath.
	
	
	This is a criminal case and not a civil case. Were this a civil case, I would be inclined to find that the appellant’s primary cause of annoyance was his wife’s staying out and not communicating to him her expected time of arrival home and his concern about interference with his travel arrangements. Again, if this were a civil case, I would be inclined to find that added to that annoyance was his perception when his wife arrived home that his wife had been drinking alcohol and may have been affected by it and that rapidly formed a part of his complaint to the complainant about her conduct that afternoon and evening. Again if this were a civil case, I think it likely that the complainant’s repost was to remonstrate with the appellant about his not observing Kai’s usual routine and having permitted him to stay up beyond his appointed bed time of 7pm.
	
	
	I turn now to the submissions on behalf of the appellant. The appellant’s learned senior counsel pointed out that the evidence of the assault alleged by the complainant was inconsistent and therefore unreliable. He points out to eight separate passages in the transcript where the alleged assault was described and points to internal inconsistencies. Those inconsistencies as alleged by the appellant need to be considered. They are these:
	



	
	At p 55 line 30 of the transcript of 3 February 2015 the complainant said that the appellant “punched” her across the face with a closed fist.
	
	
	The Prosecutor then described the complainant’s action for the record as “a lateral backhanded movement of the right arm from the witness’s left to her right”.
	
	
	At line 36 on the same page of the same transcript the complainant said that the action involved “wasn’t a punch”.
	
	
	At p 61 line 23 of the same transcript the complainant described the action of the appellant as a “push punch”.
	
	
	At p 63 line 17 the complainant stated that the appellant “punched me across the face”.
	
	
	At p 21 line 47 of the transcript of 27 February 2015 the complainant said in cross-examination that the appellant’s “whole upper forearm of his arm” struck the face. That action was then described for the record as a “downward hammer motion” with the underside of the right wrist and forearm.
	
	
	On the following page of the same transcript at line 17 the complainant said that she was “fairly sure” that it was the appellant’s right arm rather than left arm. That was despite the fact that she had always earlier referred to the appellant as having used his right arm to strike her.
	
	
	In exhibit 13 the email sent by the complainant to Constable Spicer on 11 August 2014 at 4.45pm, the complainant clearly stated, as I have earlier quoted, that she was “not really sure if it was his right or his left hand” that struck her.
	



	
	The submissions on behalf of the appellant then continue thus:
	


“The change in the witness’ description of the assault have the potential to reflect adversely on her credibility. The initial description - a lateral, backhanded left right movement with the appellant’s right fist - would have resulted in injuries to the right side of the complainant’s face. This was contradicted by the injuries, which were to the left side of her face.

The witness later described (in cross-examination, during the second day of her evidence) a downward hammering motion with the appellant’s right fist and the entire forearm being used as the plane of contact. It is an available inference that the witness changed her evidence in an attempt to accommodate the injuries which descended in a vertical plane from her left forehead/hairline down to her left cheek.”

There is significant substance in that last submission. The mark on the complainant’s left forehead she pointed out was immediately below her hairline and hence the reference that was made by learned senior counsel for the appellant in the last paragraph of the quotation I have just cited.


	
	Counsel for the appellant also made submissions about the evidence of “intoxication”. Paragraph [24] of the submissions is that:
	


“The evidence of intoxication is significant for four reasons. First, it impacts adversely on the reliability of [the complainant] as a witness and her ability to accurately recall the circumstances of the incident. Second, intoxication (to any degree) is a circumstance that makes a fall in the bathroom (with its wet floor and confined space) more likely. Third, the evidence impacts adversely on [the complainant’s] credibility, because the witness categorically (and unreasonably, it is submitted) denied under cross-examination that she was affected by alcohol when she returned from the long lunch... Finally, this body of evidence indicates that her Honour erred when she ‘entirely’ rejected the appellant’s evidence on [the complainant’s] intoxication (which then formed the basis of her decision to ‘reject this evidence entirely’).”


	
	Leaving aside the use made by the magistrate of the evidence concerning the consumption of alcohol, there are in my view four reasons for accepting that evidence concerning alcohol intake is significant. The first is that proposed by Mr Dhanji SC, that it may affect the ability of the complainant to accurately recall circumstances of the event in question. The second is that a person affected by alcohol can misperceive what is occurring to or around him or her, and in that fashion makes the evidence potentially unreliable. The third is that the taking of alcohol can render a person more susceptible or vulnerable to injury because of the interference with bodily coordination, in other words my third reason is similar to that advanced by Mr Dhanji that it makes a fall in a bathroom with a wet floor and in a confined space more probable. The fourth consideration is one not only particular to this case but one often confronted by courts. The evidence of the taking of alcohol can affect the credibility of a witness if there is any dispute about the amount of alcohol consumed. It is commonplace for persons to underestimate the amount of alcohol they consume when it is a fact in issue in any sort of proceedings. For many years I have had cause to remark that there are three questions to reach that is usually impossible to obtain any reliable answer. The first question is how much do you drink, the second is how many cigarettes do you smoke and the third is not currently relevant but is in the same vein. People tend to underestimate their consumption of what might be thought to be substances that might adversely affect them. I need not consider further Mr Dhanji’s submissions.
	
	
	On behalf of the Crown, Ms Roatz stressed the significance of “the immediate complainant” to Mrs Sally Obermeder, there is force in that submission. However, the first person to whom the complainant could have protested that the appellant assaulted her was the appellant’s father; she did not do so on the evidence before me and before the Local Court. A large part of the Crown submissions relate to that question to which I shall shortly refer.
	
	
	The fourth section of the Crown’s written submissions make two points which I need to mention. The first is that the appellant conceded in cross‑examination that when the complainant tried to push past him his back was towards her. Ms Roatz then raised the point that if the appellant’s back was towards the complainant how was he able to see her hit her head on the tile wall. That is a valid observation. However, human experience must be taken into account. The area was small, he could have heard the complainant hit her head against the tiled wall and looked quickly around and immediately perceived what had happened. Considering the small area in which the action occurred, I do not believe that there is any force to that submission.
	
	
	The final point made in that same section of the Crown’s submissions is that the appellant did not observe any injuries on the complainant other than a bump on her head. Ms Roatz pointed out that the police saw a bruise in the area of the complainant’s left eye. However, again, human experience must be taken into account. Bruises take time to appear, they do not appear straightaway as might the appearance of blood from a cut or an abrasion. Bruises take time to come up and an eye that was found to be red at some stage might present as a “black eye” the following morning when the bruise has time to come up.
	
	
	I turn now to the Magistrate’s reasons. I have already pointed out in the first page of the reasons the Magistrate incorrectly was of the view that the complainant returned to the residence “about 8pm”, that occurs on line 19 and line 41 of p 1 of the transcript of 15 May 2015. Insofar as it amounts to a finding, it is erroneous and contrary to the evidence, contrary at least to the weight of evidence which all points in the direction of her returning at 8.30pm.
	
	
	Commencing at line 45 on the same page her Honour said this:
	


“On her evidence there was perhaps a greater degree of hostility, on his evidence a long history that involved concerns in relation to alcohol intake. But also, as I understand it, from looking at his record of interview with the police that although they had some problems, there was a trip planned together to Spain at some near stage in the future and so they were possibly riding out whatever these difficulties were which might occur in quite a lot of relationships, or that is at least the picture that was painted.”

Again the learned Magistrate erred in fact finding. The trip to Barcelona and Ibiza was for the complainant alone with lady friends and not a trip to be shared by the complainant and the appellant.


	
	At p 2 of her reasons, at line 26 the Magistrate found erroneously that the police arrived “at about 10.10pm”. The evidence is clear that it was 10.30pm. At line 42 on p 2 of her reasons, the Magistrate commenced this observation:
	


“Police at the scene noted her condition, she was upset, she clearly had been crying, there was no observation of intoxication, so that was not noted, although what I do note is that Officer Spicer indicated he was with her for some time. He noted her injuries, her bruising, her crying and that she did not want her husband charged.”

The police arrived at 10.30pm. The complainant signed Constable Spicer’s notebook at 10.46pm indicating that Constable Spicer was with her for 16 minutes. Whether that is a lengthy period of time or not is an arguable question and it is difficult to know what the Magistrate meant by the words “for some time”. It is correct that there was no mention made either in Constable Prow’s statement or in the evidence of Constable Spicer as to intoxication or affectation by alcohol. No question concerning that issue appears to have been asked. When Constable Spicer gave evidence, he was not asked in‑chief any question about what he may or may not have observed about the complainant’s affectation by alcohol and therefore that was not the subject of any cross-examination by learned counsel for the appellant in the Court below. However, a complete absence of any observation and a complete absence of any evidence on the subject does not create positive evidence that the complainant was not affected by alcohol. The evidence from the police on this issue is completely neutral and does not prove a positive, that is it does not prove that the complainant was not affected by alcohol. Furthermore, it could easily be argued that the complainant’s emotional state which was clearly observed by Constable Spicer and Constable Prow may have masked or hidden any affection by alcohol or made it such difficult to discern. Added to this lack of positive evidence from the police on this issue is the complete absence of any evidence from Sergeant Adams who was present at the residence some time shortly after 10.30pm.


	
	The learned Magistrate then went on to note that the evidence of the complainant was that the injuries were caused by the appellant’s “punch” and the Magistrate then pointed out that that punch was called a “push punch” with a closed fist that had “effect across her face”. She then continued thus:
	


“I note that there is some inconsistency in relation to the complaint where she says that that was caused by the right hand but the next day in relation to her email she clarified that she really was not sure what hand it was and I would have to say from looking at her evidence that she has maintained that she was not certain about which hand was used and that it happened quickly and clearly she was injured.

I note there was some variation in the version given of the action taken by the defendant’s hand. She gave an indication or she acted as I understand it, an action across her body or across her face and then on the second day of cross-examination when it was resumed, a hammer down or a hammer down movement. It has been submitted by the defence that that inconsistency is significant, I should scrutinise it and as I understand it should cause me to reject her evidence.

I note these comments and in relation to that aspect of the evidence, I also note that she maintained that she really could not recall. It happened quickly. It was not obviously a forward motion in relation to what one would describe as a classic punch and that is something that she maintained that action across her face. I also note that Mr Crotty is six foot three or thereabouts, Mrs Crotty is considerably smaller, I am not sure of her height but I would estimate possibly five foot four or something around that height. Even on those things that are not disputed, that is that she was injured and that there was hostility, it would not be implausible that details would lack clarity. But on her own evidence on scrutinising it, I find her explanation is plausible in light of the hostile aggression and the injury that she suffered which are clearly entirely consistent with her allegation then it is plausible that there could be some uncertainty and in those circumstances that alone is not something that I would use on scrutinising to in [fact] reject her evidence.”


	
	The first thing to note is that the learned magistrate noted inconsistency and variance in the complainant’s evidence. However, she did not think that it affected its plausibility. Saying that something is plausible means that it is possible and could be accepted. It does not mean that it must be accepted and it does not mean that it proves something beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I do not know whence the magistrate formed the view that the complainant was five foot four inches tall. There was positive evidence from Senior Constable Farrell that she was five foot six inches tall. The estimate appears to have been the magistrate’s own rather than the evidence that was actually before the court. The estimate of the appellant’s height is that given in evidence by the complainant and that estimate was not disputed.
	
	
	A large part of the reasoning of the magistrate appears to have been her view that the appellant’s injuries were consistent with the action, whatever it may have been, that the complainant alleged was taken by the appellant. However, the medical evidence, that of Dr Lombard, who gave oral evidence, establishes that the appellant’s injuries were also consistent with the mechanism proposed by the appellant. In other words, the “injuries” sustained by the complainant can be explained both by her evidence and by the evidence of the appellant, and therefore are quite neutral.
	
	
	Her Honour went on to consider the evidence of the doctor and she then said this:
	


“I note that the doctor after some considerable cross-examination accepted that in fact the injury could be entirely consistent with the defendant hitting her face on a blunt surface. But I must say I am confused to an extent then by the cross-examination which seemed to suggest that two objects or the two surfaces could cause an injury that occurred if you like in the one incident because the defendant has always maintained that in flicking his hip when the victim or alleged victim tried to pass him, that she fell backwards and hit her head, and clearly what he is asking the court to accept is that she hit her face on the wall of the bathroom, the tiled wall of the bathroom.”

Clearly the learned magistrate’s first reference to “the defendant,” the one I have just quoted, was a reference to the complainant in the Local Court. I have carefully read the evidence of the doctor. I would not describe the cross-examination as being lengthy and I have no confusion whatever as to what the evidence means. As I said, it is completely neutral.


	
	A large part of the magistrate’s reasoning process concerned the question of alcohol ingestion. Before I turn to that issue, some observations must be made. The taking of alcohol is fairly common in our community. The level of alcohol intake can be small, it can be moderate or it can be large. The taking of alcohol affects different people in different ways. Alcohol affects people differently and relevant factors as to the extent of the affectation of a person are the person’s age, the person’s size, the person’s weight, the person’s sex and the extent to which the person is a user of alcohol. A person who very rarely drinks alcohol is more likely to be affected by a small amount of alcohol than a person who is a regular consumer of the substance.
	
	
	The next point to make is that persons describe the extent of another’s affectation differently. Indeed, a person can describe his or her own affectation differently to others. A regular user of alcohol might say that the person who had only one or two alcoholic beverages was not affected at all. A confirmed teetotal drinker might believe that a person who had taken one or two alcoholic beverages was mildly or moderately intoxicated. A practised, seasoned or experienced drinker might consume alcohol without any obvious affectation, whilst the same amount of alcohol consumed by a person who usually did not take alcohol could render that person mildly or moderately or even very drunk. Indeed, the use of the words “intoxicated” and “drunk” is one which varies from person to person. If one arrives at a meal or a party or other function at which alcohol has been consumed by others and the new arriver is stone cold sober, the newly arrived might believe that others who had been drinking at the function were affected perhaps only mildly by alcohol, whereas those at the function where others were also drinking might perceive no affectation at all.
	
	
	Those ladies who participated in the lunch at Catalina’s who were called by the Crown had themselves partaken of alcohol. They did not perceive that the complainant was in any way intoxicated, but that does not exclude that the complainant and those witnesses may themselves have been mildly intoxicated. Even accepting mild intoxication, a stone cold sober person such as the appellant and such as his father might perceive mild intoxication, omit to add the word “mild”, which is often the case, and then merely say that the person was intoxicated, intoxicated there meaning not drunk but merely affected.
	
	
	Language concerning alcohol intake is variable and opinions about the level of a person’s intoxication are usually idiosyncratic and lacking in objectivity.
	
	
	At p 5 commencing at line 22, the magistrate said this:
	


“the inference…that the Court is being asked to draw is that she [the complainant] must have remained at Catalina’s from 7pm until later and that is the point at which she drank to the point of stupefaction if I am [to] accept that she was intoxicated”.

In that regard the magistrate was referring to the lack of any evidence from anybody who was with the complainant after 7pm prior to her arriving home at 8.30pm. However, it was not alleged by the appellant or by anybody on his behalf that the complainant had taken alcohol “to the point of stupefaction”. That, in my respectful opinion, is hyperbole from the learned magistrate. At p 7 commencing at line 46 the magistrate said this:

“The most significant surrounding circumstance that has been put in issue in this case or in dispute is the level of intoxication of the victim. Mr Crotty has maintained that not only was his wife extremely intoxicated, that she had had a skinful, that she was unsteady, slurred speech, glazed eyes, but that she was so intoxicated that in fact she was irrational, she caused an injury in effect to herself and she blamed him.”

It was not the evidence of the appellant nor was it his case that the complainant was irrational. Again that, in my view, was hyperbole by the magistrate. The magistrate’s reasons then continued thus:

“She had a history, as I understand it, of unreliability, sometimes being out until 5am, and in this context where she was injured he was concerned, he placed her on the bed, he still left her with his children. I do not accept his evidence. I do not accept the evidence that he has attempted to put before the court of her extreme level of intoxication. Now once that occurs, it seems to me that the whole edifice, if you like, of the defendant’s defence cannot be maintained because in effect what he is asking the court to accept is that between 7 and 8 o’clock somehow she managed to get so intoxicated to the extent that he noted in his evidence and in his ERISP, that is a record of interview, to the extent that the father noticed that that was not something that was at all noted by the police.

I reject his evidence entirely in relation to intoxication and therefore it does not cause me any difficulty at all to reject his evidence entirely and I accept Ms Crotty’s evidence in relation to the injuries and the manner in which they were caused.”

Her Honour then formally announced that she found the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	The magistrate made no allowance for the fact that the evidence of the appellant concerning the level of the complainant’s intoxication might itself have suffered from hyperbole. She made no allowance for the fact that he was or may have been upset about the complainant’s coming home late and observing some signs of intoxication added that to his reprimands to his wife and that overtook his concern about her late arrival home. Furthermore, her Honour appears to have rejected the evidence of both the appellant and Mr Brendan Crotty about intoxication because it was “not something that was at all noted by the police”. However, the police were not asked as to whether they noted it or not. Their evidence was completely silent on the issue. That cannot be used to reject the observations made by the appellant himself and more particularly by Mr Brendan Crotty, whose evidence appears on any reading of it to be entirely reliable and whose evidence in no way can otherwise be impugned. For example, the only impugning of that evidence is the assertion by the complainant that he never entered the home, but that is inconsistent with both his evidence and the evidence of the appellant.
	
	
	With the utmost respect, it appears to me that the learned magistrate has not scrutinised the evidence of the complainant with the appropriate care as she was required to do, and has, instead, scrutinised the evidence of the appellant and his father in a completely impermissible fashion by comparing that to a lack of evidence from the police. I have considered the magistrate’s reasons because it was necessary for me to read them in order to ascertain whether the magistrate made any particular findings based on the demeanour of any particular witness. She did not. I am therefore in just as good a position as the magistrate to make findings of fact. As I have earlier announced, when I scrutinise the evidence of the complainant it does not persuade me beyond reasonable doubt of its reliability to substantiate the allegation made by the complainant against the appellant. Equally, when I consider the evidence of the appellant and his father, it raises at least a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the defence is true and therefore that again raises a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
	
	
	Again another reason given by the Magistrate about the defence case is contained in a paragraph appearing on p 7 of the transcript of the reasons. It is this:
	


“The witnesses’ evidence was really only in very short compass. It seems to me that the significant aspect of it was to verify a level of intoxication and a level of hostility but I note that it was also, it seems to me, apparent that the purpose of the evidence was to explain that the children were of concern, had been checked on, and leaving them with a drunken mother was still consistent with their security and safety. I do not accept the evidence that has been given in relation to the level of intoxication and I do not accept that the evidence clearly between the father and his son is consistent in relation to the actions that were taken. That degree of inconsistency does cause me some concern and in scrutinising that evidence I have some concern about both Mr Crotty senior and the defendant’s level of consistency and whether I in fact can rely on it.”

Her Honour appears to have believed that the evidence of the appellant and Mr Brendan Crotty about their perception of the complainant’s level of intoxication was inconsistent with their permitting the two young boys to remain in the custody of the complainant. Kallen had been asleep at all material times. At the time that the appellant and his father left the house, Kai was asleep on their version of the evidence, although the complainant said he was not asleep but later fell asleep. He was safely tucked in bed on either version. The evidence was not that the complainant was a “habitual drunkard”. It was not that she was regularly affected by alcohol but rather that on occasions she went out to socialise and took alcohol. On the evidence of the appellant, she was more affected by alcohol on this occasion than on other occasions. However, both boys were in bed and the evidence strongly suggests that both were asleep at the time that the appellant and his father left the house. One would expect the complainant herself to then retire to bed and there does not appear to have been any suggestion that, for example, the complainant herself might take to consuming alcohol on the following morning. Indeed, the evidence is that the appellant spent much time away from the family home travelling in the course of his work and no fear had been previously expressed about leaving the boys in the custody of their mother. It appears to me that the Magistrate has over stated the level of intoxication of the complainant alleged by the appellant and his father and that led her to the view that it was unsafe to leave the children in her custody, when they, meaning the appellant and his father, were of the view that it was safe to do so, the appellant’s father being assured in that regard by his son. Furthermore, as the appellant conceded in his evidence, any attempt to move the children from the custody of the complainant on the evening in question would have caused much more anxiety, distress and upset than doing what they did, in leaving the children in bed anticipating that the appellant herself would shortly retire and be quite sober in the morning to look after them.


	
	Any further reasons for judgment required?
	


LEWER: Not on my part.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Van Zyl?

VAN ZYL: No, your Honour, none on my part, thank you.


	
	HIS HONOUR: I have inquired of counsel for the appellant and the solicitor for the Crown whether any further reason for judgment is required and I am told that none is so required. For those reasons I set aside the conviction recorded and the sentence passed by the Downing Centre Local Court on 29 May 2015.
	
	
	I am acutely aware of the damage done to our community by what is referred to in shorthand as “domestic violence.” It currently consumes the media. However, the process in which I have been involved requires the application of well and long-established legal principles to the assessment of evidence. Included in the written submissions on behalf of the appellant is this observation by Mr Dhanji SC and his junior, which is well worth noting:
	


“In Douglass v The Queen [2012] HCA 34; (2012) 86 ALJR 1086 at [48], in the context of upholding an unreasonable verdict ground of appeal, the court (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) emphasised that the “criminal standard of proof is a designedly exacting standard.”

The court reasoned that the intermediate appellate court erred in holding that it had been open to the trial judge to be satisfied of the reliability of a complainant’s statements and to reason from that, despite the appellant’s denials, to a conclusion that his guilt had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Similar considerations apply to the present appeal.

	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Adams J.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 6 November 2013 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three offences: first, that on 28 November 2012 he supplied cocaine having a total weight of 2.75 ounces; secondly, between 29 February and 28 November 2012 he supplied more than an indictable and less than the commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (head); and, thirdly, between 9am and 12pm on 28 November 2012 he dealt with $21,400 knowing that it was the proceeds of crime. The first two offences were contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), carrying maximum penalties respectively of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units, and 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. The last offence was contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	When the applicant appeared in the District Court for sentence, he asked that three offences should be taken into account on a Form 1: possessing 1 tablet of methylene dioxymethamphetamine (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); possessing two vials of a steroid, a prescribed restricted substance (s 16(1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW), maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment); and possession of four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds, a prohibited drug (s 10(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, maximum penalty 2 years imprisonment).
	
	
	On 6 June 2014, the applicant was sentenced as follows: for the proceeds of crime offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 28 November 2012; for the supply cocaine offence, a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 28 November 2012; and, for the supply cannabis offence (taking into account the matters on a Form 1), a sentence of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing 28 November 2012. A discount of 25 per cent was allowed for his early plea.
	
	
	The primary judge sentenced the applicant for the cannabis offence upon the mistaken basis that the applicable maximum term of imprisonment was 15 years. This error, conceded by the Crown, means that the sentence for this offence cannot stand. It is not controversial that this Court must itself consider the appropriate sentence for this offence and, if a lesser sentence is warranted in law, substitute that lesser sentence.
	


The facts


	
	These were not disputed. The following account is taken from the statement of agreed facts.
	
	
	On 28 November 2012 police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s house. When they arrived, officers asked the applicant if there was anything in the house, to which he responded, “it’s all on the bed. You’ll see it”. In the bedroom, the police found 17 clear plastic resealable plastic bags containing cannabis. In the kitchen they found more cannabis, stored inside a cupboard as well as in a vacuum sealed package in the spare room. Together, the cannabis weighed 8.7kg. Police located also a large storage bag in the garage containing 80 empty vacuum bags smelling strongly of cannabis. The applicant told police that some of these bags had previously contained cannabis that he had either sold or used personally over the previous eight months. He indicated that the bags would have contained from between two and eight pounds but that, at times, they would be double or triple bagged to conceal the strong odour. The agreed facts noted that, using the lowest weight provided by the applicant, on the assumption that all of the bags were double bags, the total quantity of cannabis was 36kg. Allowing for the applicant’s claim that he had used some of it, the applicant would have supplied close to 25kg of cannabis over the preceding eight months. This was said in the agreed facts to relate to count one. However, whilst the facts certainly concede the supply of cannabis beyond the quantity found in his possession of 8.7kg, it is clear that the calculation assumed facts which were not admitted. Firstly, the applicant only admitted that “some of these bags had previously contained cannabis” and that “at times they would either be double or triple bagged”. But this is not an admission that all the bags were used. A fact which is adverse to an offender cannot be based upon an assumption. It may be established beyond reasonable doubt by evidence or admission but an admission as to a calculation based on an assumption which is not admitted is clearly insufficient. Furthermore, in respect of cannabis leaf, the indictable quantity is 1kg whilst the commercial quantity is 25kg. The 8.7kg of cannabis in the applicant’s possession at the time of his arrest together with “close to 25kg of cannabis” suggested to have been supplied during the period comprehended by the charge would have amounted to a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, which was not alleged. It seems to me that the appropriate approach for present purposes to this issue is to sentence the applicant upon the basis that he had 8.7kg of cannabis in possession at the time of his arrest, mostly but not all for the purpose of supply (he was a heavy user) and that he would have supplied a significant but unknown quantity of cannabis leaf during the previous eight months. He cannot be sentenced on the basis that he had either in his possession for supply or had in fact supplied as much as 25kg.
	
	
	Returning to the facts, the applicant directed police to search the kitchen, where they located 12 resealable bags, one of which contained an ecstasy tablet, whilst inside the fridge police also located two vials of steroid medication and, inside a built in wardrobe in the spare room, four small resealable bags containing cannabis seeds (otherwise not quantified). Possession of these substances comprised the three charges on the Form 1. Also in the kitchen the applicant directed police to a plastic bag containing cocaine in a corner cupboard. This, together with two small knotted bags of cocaine found in the wardrobe in his bedroom totalled 74.6g of cocaine at 65 per cent purity and constituted the second charge. Police found wads of cash of $15,000 and $6,400 in two separate bags in the bedside table of the applicant’s bedroom, the applicant admitting that this was the proceeds of the sales of drugs. This constituted charge three.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested, taken into custody, and ultimately participated in an electronically recorded interview confirming the admissions he had made during the execution of the search warrant.
	
	
	On 16 October 2012 he had committed the offence of driving whilst disqualified and, on 26 March 2013 (whilst he was in custody on the present charges) he was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment commencing on 28 November 2012. Accordingly, as the primary judge observed, the applicant had been in custody in respect of the drug offences alone since 27 May 2013.
	


Subjective features


	
	These are not controversial. The applicant is now 38 years of age. His criminal record was characterised by the primary judge as “minor” comprising convictions for driving whilst disqualified, stating a false name, exceeding the speed limit, affray, obtaining money by deception, displaying unauthorised number plates, driving whilst licence suspended, using an uninsured and unregistered motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. So far as the sentence of imprisonment for the offence of driving whilst disqualified is concerned, the learned primary judge considered that a gaol sentence may well not have been imposed had he not been in custody for the present charges. Mr Barrow, counsel for the applicant in this Court, points out that his previous offence was three years earlier and, but for his being bail refused on the present charges, a non-custodial disposition could well have resulted but was not available as he was in custody. The Crown submits that he would likely have been sentenced to imprisonment at all events. In my view this Court should approach the matter in the same way as did the primary judge.
	
	
	Tendered on the sentence proceedings was a drug and alcohol report prepared by Corrective Services. It noted that the applicant scored “extremely high in the range which requires more intensive treatment in some domains specifically around his cannabis and cocaine use”. It noted his strong desire to address his alcohol and drug use and had expressed an interest in attending a rehabilitation program within the community. Programs are available within the custodial setting, providing he is assessed as suitable for them. A report from Mr Bradley Jones, a forensic psychologist, was also tendered. The history in that report was used as a basis for the primary judge’s consideration of his background. The following is drawn from her Honour’s reasons for sentence.
	
	
	The applicant was raised in a family of African descent although he, himself, is Caucasian. He was born in Australia and his mother moved to Tanzania, ultimately returning to Australia when he was aged four years. He enjoyed a stable and loving upbringing and speaks highly of his mother, a devout Catholic and his stepfather. He completed year 10 at school and went on to complete a mechanic’s course, undertaking an apprenticeship in a repair shop. Thereafter he worked for a number of mechanics and commenced his own business which, however, failed after he lost his license as a result of driving offences. The applicant commenced consuming alcohol at the age of 18 and to abuse marijuana when he was 22. His consumption of this drug increased significantly over the next 12 years. He has experimented with ecstasy and has also been a heavy user of cocaine. He experienced a significant trauma when, in 1999, one of his stepbrothers petrol bombed the residence where he and another brother were staying and both men suffered significant emotional distress and physical injuries as a result. Following the petrol bombing and the loss of his business, his drug addiction increased significantly. He had been receiving psychological treatment for some four years before his arrest but continues to suffer flashbacks and nightmares. The report notes that the applicant has expressed shame and regret at his offending behaviour saying, “I was blinded by drugs, I’m glad I was caught, I was over the top”. In the opinion of the psychologist, the applicant suffers from anxiety and depression and needs cognitive behavioural therapy, drug release prevention counselling, cognitive training and monitoring upon his release from custody by the Community Corrections Service. The psychologist considered that he has insight into the basis of his offending behaviour, his maladaptive thought processes and his depression and noted his willingness to engage in a treatment program. He has established a connection with the chaplaincy service at the correctional centres where he has been held and appears to have been doing well in prison, engaging with the drug and alcohol counsellor and undertaking studies which will be useful on his release.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest the applicant was in a relationship and has a four year old child from that relationship.
	
	
	It is a significant matter to be taken into account that, were it not for the applicant’s admissions that he had been supplying cannabis over something like eight months before his arrest and his candid estimate of the quantity involved, it would have been virtually impossible for the Crown to prove the extent of his criminal activities over and above what was found in his possession, although no doubt it could be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that he had been trading in an unknown quantity in addition to that found in his possession. The primary judge considered that the applicant’s criminal antecedents, as I have mentioned, were relatively minor and did not disentitle him to leniency. Her Honour also concluded that he was truly remorseful and contrite but his prospects for rehabilitation were guarded because of the extent of his addictions. She considered that the applicant was in need of intensive rehabilitation for a lengthy period if he were to become and remain law abiding. I agree with these conclusions which were not, at all events, really disputed. The need for a long period of supervised parole justifies a finding of special circumstances warranting a variation of the calculus prescribed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Objective seriousness


	
	The scale of drug supply is obviously significant and naturally focuses attention on the amount of cannabis involved. I have already discussed the difficulties in determining this quantity. It is fair to say, as the Crown submitted, that his supply was not an isolated event and could not be regarded as a temporary aberration. The supply of significant quantities of cannabis is plainly a serious offence, marked by the maximum term of imprisonment its commission attracts. It took place over a period of eight months and produced at least the cash which was found in the applicant’s possession on his arrest. The objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence is significant but very far short of the worst case. Since, essentially, he is to be sentenced in respect of the marijuana offence for selling drugs, it appears to me to be double counting to punish him additionally for dealing with the proceeds of those sales. That the primary judge made the sentence for that offence wholly concurrent with the supply of marijuana charge is not surprising and this Court should take the same approach.
	


The other offences


	
	It was submitted by the Crown in this Court that there should be a degree of accumulation in respect of the cannabis and cocaine charges, pointing to Luu v R [2008] NSWCCA 285 in which the applicant was convicted of the deemed supply of 19.72g of crystalline methylamphetamine and 7.29g of heroin. The Court observed –
	


“[32] Possession of the two different kinds of drugs giving rise to the ‘deemed supply’ offences is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality. There were two deemed supplies, as there would be two (or more) actual supplies were the different drugs to be sold to two (or more) purchasers in the course of the applicant’s drug dealing ...”

(The appellant in that case had also been found in the possession of a prohibited and an unregistered pistol.) Dealing with the drug offences, the sentence imposed for the heroin offence was 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months and, for the crystalline methylamphetamine offence, imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years. They were accumulated by 6 months. It is apparent that the Court did not consider this accumulation as suggestive of error.


	
	It is relevant to note, in respect of the overall quantity of cocaine, that the history he gave to the psychologist, which was not sought to be disputed either below or in this Court, was that the applicant had commenced consuming cocaine for about two years before the offence, rising to 7g daily. The cocaine, which he was deemed to have in possession for supply, was not an insignificant quantity and it is appropriate to accumulate the sentence for this offence to some degree on the sentence to be imposed in respect of the supplying marijuana.
	
	
	So far as the Form 1 offences are concerned, it seems to me virtually certain that, either individually or taken together, they would not have resulted in a custodial sentence. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to add a period of custody in respect of them. Nor do they indicate anything of significance in relation to the substantive offences.
	


Assessment


	
	Mr Barrow brought to the Court’s attention the Judicial Commission’s statistics for supply of less than a commercial quantity of cannabis. Although the sample is reasonably high (87 cases), since it is not known what proportion of these involve a quantity of drugs greater than the indictable quantity, let alone the quantities themselves, they are not of much use. The statistics of cases involving the supply of a commercial quantity of cannabis leaf (which of course must be regarded as much more serious, having a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years), involve 24 cases. Only 58 per cent of these offences attracted prison sentences, which is rather surprising. In 14 cases, the sentences ranged between 2 years and 4 years, 6 months. Although we were given the figures for non-parole periods, I do not think these are at all useful, given the very wide range of special circumstances that might or might not have been applied. The statistics are informative at a somewhat doubtful level of significance. A number of particular cases were also referred to but I do not regard them as presently useful and it is unnecessary to discuss them further.
	
	
	In my view the appropriate commencing point for sentencing the applicant in respect of the cannabis offence is 5 years and 6 months which, with a 25 per cent discount, yields an overall sentence of 4 years and 9 months. It is in the public interest as well in that of the applicant to find (as did the primary judge) that special circumstances justify varying what I have called the statutory calculus to provide for an extended period of supervision, which the applicant will need if he is to maintain an appropriate level of treatment for his drug addiction. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The offence for the proceeds of crime should be wholly concurrent with the other sentences. The cannabis supply offence should in my view be accumulated by four months on the cocaine supply offence. I therefore propose the following orders –
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Set aside the sentences imposed by the District Court on 6 June 2014, in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant as follows:
	



	
	for the supply of cocaine on 28 November 2012, a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 28 November 2012 and expiring on 27 November 2014;
	
	
	for the supply of cannabis leaf between 29 February 2012 and 28 November 2012 (taking into account the offences on the Form 1) a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 28 March 2013 and expiring on 27 September 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 28 September 2015 and expiring on 27 December 2017; and
	
	
	for the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime a term of imprisonment of twelve months commencing on 28 March 2013.
	
	
	The first date upon which the appellant is eligible to be considered for parole is 27 September 2015.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Adams J.

2767821,R v Hiba CORNELL [2015] NSWCCA 258,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons expressed by Beech-Jones J and the orders proposed by his Honour.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: On 18 March 2014 the appellant, Hiba Cornell, was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that contained two counts. The first count charged her with an offence under former s 301(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. This count alleged that on 30 June 2006 Ms Cornell used a copy of a false instrument, namely two pay slips, knowing them to be false, with the intention of inducing St George Bank Ltd to accept them as copies of a genuine instrument and, because of that acceptance, do some act to its prejudice, namely approve a loan of $460,000. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 301(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 was ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	The second count charged Ms Cornell with an offence under former s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. This count alleged that on 30 June 2006 Ms Cornell, with intent to obtain a financial advantage for another person, made a statement, namely an entry on St George Bank's computer, that was false or misleading in a material particular, namely that she “verified [a] home loan [applicant's] application details including employment”, knowing that statement was false or misleading in a material particular or with reckless disregard as to that matter. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 was five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Ms Cornell pleaded not guilty to each count. The trial proceeded. On 10 April 2014 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts.
	
	
	On 25 June 2014 Ms Cornell was sentenced on count 1 to a term of imprisonment of five years, comprised of a non-parole period of two years commencing from 27 June 2014 and expiring on 26 June 2016 with a balance of term of three years expiring on 26 June 2019. On count 2 she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing from 27 June 2014 and expiring on 26 December 2015. Thus the sentence for count 2 was wholly subsumed into the sentence for count 1.
	
	
	Ms Cornell appeals against her conviction on both counts. She contends that her trial miscarried because there was a deviation between a ruling given by the trial judge in advance of the trial as to the basis upon which the Crown could lead evidence concerning six other home loan applications that Ms Cornell processed, and the use which the Crown Prosecutor made of that evidence in his closing address which was reinforced by the trial judge’s summing up. Ms Cornell further contends that her conviction was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence” that was presented at her trial (Criminal Appeal Act 1912; s 6(1)). Ms Cornell also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on her (Criminal Appeal Act 1912; s 5(1)(c)).
	
	
	For the reasons set out below I propose that Ms Cornell’s conviction appeal be dismissed.  While there was a deviation in the Crown address and the summing up from the trial judge’s pre-trial ruling, I consider that did not occasion any unfairness to Ms Cornell so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. I also consider that the deviation did not result in the trial judge giving any wrong decision on any question of law within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and that the evidence of those other home loan applications was properly admissible for coincidence purposes in respect of all their features. Otherwise I consider that the verdict in Ms Cornell’s trial was not unreasonable and could be supported having regard to all the evidence.
	
	
	Insofar as Ms Cornell seeks leave to appeal against her sentence I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. In summary, I consider that the sentencing judge did not err in assessing Ms Cornell’s level of involvement in the subject offences to be higher than a co-offender by reference to evidence concerning her involvement in the processing of other fraudulent home loan applications. I also do not consider that the sentencing judge erred in the manner in which her Honour dealt with the hardship occasioned to Ms Cornell’s daughter from Ms Cornell’s incarceration.
	
	
	The balance of these reasons is structured as follows:

Conviction Appeal


	
	To address the grounds of Ms Cornell’s conviction appeal it is first necessary to describe the Crown case including the evidence concerning the other home loan applications as well as Ms Cornell’s evidence in some detail.
	


The Crown Case


	
	From late 2003 until 2006 Ms Cornell was employed as a lending officer by the St George Bank Ltd (“St George”). She worked at the Chester Hill branch. She had worked for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the “CBA”) in a similar role from 1996 until 2003. The Crown contended that in June 2006 she participated in a fraudulent scheme designed to extract a home loan from St George ostensibly in favour of a witness whose identity was suppressed, Mr X, but ultimately said to be for the benefit of the alleged organiser, Mr Ali Moussa, and others.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that on or about 26 June 2006 a “Freedom Account” was opened at St George in the name of Mr X and the sum of $148,000.00 was transferred into it. The Crown alleged that Ms Cornell opened that account. Around the same time Mr Moussa provided Mr X with a contract naming him as the purchaser of a unit in Willoughby for $582,000.00 together with a bogus letter identifying his employer as “D.N. & D.M. Heussner Transport Pty Ltd” and two bogus payslips. He drove Mr X to the Chester Hill branch and told him to “ask for a particular manager”, being Ms Cornell (“I remember it was Hiba”). Mr X attended upon Ms Cornell and applied for a home loan in the sum of $460,000.00. It is unclear whether Mr X attended on 26 June 2006 or 30 June 2006. I will explain that discrepancy and outline the evidence concerning the loan application in more detail, but it suffices to note that Mr X provided Ms Cornell with, inter alia, the bogus letter and payslips.
	
	
	The Crown alleged that knowing of the falsity of the payslips Ms Cornell made copies of the payslips and “used” them by placing them on the file intending that St George would act on their veracity to grant the home loan. Her conduct in doing so was said to be the offence under former s 301(2) of the Crimes Act. The Crown also alleged that on 30 June 2006 Ms Cornell typed an entry on the St George Bank’s computerised notes system, Consumer Loan Application System (“CLAS”), which recorded, inter alia, “[s]table employment” and “[e]mployment has been confirmed as per letter and payslips held”. This entry was said to be false to Ms Cornell’s knowledge. The making of this entry was said to be the offence under former s 178BB of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	On 19 July 2006 a cheque was drawn on Mr X’s St George account to pay stamp duty. On 24 July 2006 the purchase of the Willoughby unit settled. A St George bank cheque in the sum of $458,089.25 payable in favour of the purchaser, City Downtown Developments Pty Ltd (“City Downtown”), was drawn from the mortgage funds provided by St George and provided on settlement. In addition a bank cheque for $64,730.75 drawn on the account in Mr X’s name with St George was paid to City Downtown. It seems that some payments were made on the home loan out of the account in Mr X’s name, but by 10 November 2006 the account balance was reduced to zero.
	
	
	It appears that the purchase price was grossly inflated. No valuation was undertaken on the Willoughby unit. City Downtown had purchased the Willoughby unit on 9 June 2006 for $140,000.00. Further, the same coterie of individuals who were orchestrating and funding Mr X as purchaser were behind City Downtown as vendor of the Willoughby unit. City Downtown was incorporated in March 2006 and Mr Hassan Youssef was its listed director. The authorised signatories to its account were Ali Rachid and Hassan Youssef. The source of the deposit into Mr X’s account on 26 June 2006 was cheques drawn on the accounts of New World Enterprises Pty Ltd and World Wide Property Investments Ltd. Ali Rachid was a signatory to both companies’ bank accounts. An employee of the drawing bank, ANZ, stated that Hussan Youssef was “associated with New World”.
	
	
	Further, on 27 August 2006 two cheques were deposited into Mr X’s St George Freedom account totalling $27,000.00. One of the cheques was a handwritten cheque drawn on a National Australia Bank (“NAB”) account in the name of Louvre Investments. The other was a bank cheque but the funds for that cheque also came from the Louvre Investments account. The business profile for the Louvre Investments account was established on 2 June 2006. Mr Terrence Reddy was listed on the account and was the applicant for the bank cheque. The Crown led evidence of a relevant connection between Mr Reddy and Mr Moussa (see [39] and [49]).
	
	
	It will be necessary to describe Mr X’s evidence in more detail, but at this point it suffices to state that Mr X told the jury that the originals of the letter and the payslips provided to him by Mr Moussa were not genuine and that he had never been to the work premises listed as the employer’s address. As at the middle of 2006 he was receiving Centrelink benefits. By the time of the trial judge’s summing up it does not seem to have been seriously disputed that the employer’s letter and payslips were bogus.
	
	
	There is no doubt that a reasonably sophisticated scam was perpetrated on St George. The orchestrators of the scheme funded the initial purchase of the Willoughby unit and the deposit for the grossly inflated on-sale to Mr X with the balance of that inflated purchase price funded by St George. They procured a front man, namely Mr X, to act as the proposed purchaser and borrower and furnished him with bogus documents sufficient to meet the St George Bank’s lending guidelines. The loan funds were diverted and St George was left with a security that was worth far less than the amount it advanced.
	
	
	Ms Cornell gave evidence in her own case. She accepted that she copied the pay slips and made the computer entry on the CLAS system but denied having any knowledge of any fraudulent scheme or that any documents were bogus. Thus the real issue in the case was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Cornell knew that the payslips were false and knowingly (or recklessly) made a false entry on the CLAS system. The Crown also had to prove that she had the requisite intent with each charge but an inference to that effect would easily follow from a finding that she knew the payslips were false and knowingly made a false entry.
	
	
	The apparent narrowness of those issues belies their true scope. The Crown’s case was circumstantial and it invited the jury to consider all the circumstances of Mr X’s loan application and, as I will explain, other loan applications in determining whether Ms Cornell had the requisite knowledge and intention. While the charges focussed on the pay slips and employment details, the Crown alleged that Ms Cornell was aware that Mr X’s application was bogus and she was a knowing participant in the scam being carried out on the St George Bank.
	
	
	From reviewing the evidence and the addresses, it appears that the Crown relied on four matters as demonstrating that Ms Cornell had the requisite knowledge and intent, namely (i) her dealings with Mr X in relation to his loan application; (ii) her alleged cancellation of a direction to obtain a valuation for the Willoughby unit; (iii) her contact with the principals of the fraud in mid-2006 and (iv) her previous dealings with Mr Moussa and fraudulent loan applications connected to him. I will describe the evidence on those topics, including that given by Ms Cornell.
	


Dealings with Mr X


	
	Mr X pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining a financial advantage by deception and using a false instrument arising from his role in the fraud perpetrated upon St George Bank. He received a custodial sentence but it was discounted on account of his plea and the assistance he provided to the authorities which included giving evidence against Ms Cornell.
	
	
	I have already recounted some aspects of Mr X’s evidence. He stated that he first met Ali Moussa in 2004. He said that in 2006 he again met Mr Moussa who encouraged him to purchase the property with the assistance of bogus documents. He said that Mr Moussa provided him with a cheque for $148,000.00 and took him in his car to deposit it into an account opened in his name. He opened the account before he received the cheque although that is inconsistent with the records already noted. On the same day Mr Moussa showed him the contract for the purchase of the property. Mr X said that he signed the contract but could not recall when.
	
	
	Mr X said that Mr Moussa then drove him to St George Bank’s Chester Hill branch. He said that Mr Moussa told him to memorise the name of this supposed employer (ie D.N. & D.M. Heussner Transport Pty Ltd), its address and his income level. Mr Moussa gave him a manila folder with the bogus pay slips and a letter supposedly on the employer’s letterhead confirming that he worked for that company.  He knew they were false. Mr Moussa parked outside the bank and told Mr X to go into the bank and ask for Ms Cornell. He went into the bank. He introduced himself and handed her some paperwork, including identification, payslips, work history and the contract for the purchase of the property. Mr X recalled Ms Cornell asking him a question about the company he was working for. He said he “buckled”. He said he told Ms Cornell that his car was parked in a no parking area and that he needed to move it.
	
	
	Mr X then left the interview and went outside and spoke to Mr Moussa. Mr X said that he and Mr Moussa then both returned to Ms Cornell’s office. He recalled Ms Cornell reviewed the paperwork and spoke to Mr Moussa (“talking, like laughing”). Mr X said he signed and initialled some documents in the presence of Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa and then left.
	
	
	Mr X identified his signature on a partially completed home loan application dated 26 June 2006, a completed loan application dated 30 June 2006 and a “Residential Loan Agreement Offer” dated 30 June 2006. With the last two of these documents he did not accept that the dates were in his handwriting. He stated that the employment details and some other personal information such as his ownership of a BMW motor vehicle that was included in those applications was false. He stated that he only spoke to Ms Cornell on one occasion. He said that Mr Moussa assumed control of the bank account and directed him as to the distribution of funds.
	
	
	In her evidence Ms Cornell stated that Mr X came to her office on 26 June 2006 and 30 June 2006. She said that on 26 June 2006 Mr X told her that he was still negotiating the price on a property and was seeking an approval based on his income. He provided her with the original of his employment letter and payslip. She photocopied them, put them on the file and returned the originals. Ms Cornell said that Mr X signed a home loan application on 26 June 2006. She also said that she opened a St George account for him on 26 June 2006 as it was a requirement that all home loan customers have an account with St George. She said she asked Mr X to transfer whatever deposit he had or any money that was going towards the property into that account.
	
	
	Ms Cornell stated that while Mr X was in her office he received a telephone call on his mobile. Mr X said to her: “It’s my boss, he doesn’t believe I’m in the bank, can you please speak to him”. She took the phone and recalled a Mr Vickers identifying himself. After she told the caller she worked for St George Bank the caller confirmed Mr X’s employment details as referred to in the letter and payslips. Ms Cornell stated that, even though she obtained confirmation from the employer, she was not required to obtain verbal confirmation of the details of the payslips.
	
	
	Ms Cornell stated that towards the end of the interview on 26 June 2006 Mr X stated that he was worried that his car was going to get booked. He left and returned within five minutes. She remembered that by then she had printed off all the documents. She said she explained them to him, he signed them and left her office. Ms Cornell stated that Mr X returned on 30 June 2006 and signed a complete application form and residential loan agreement offer.
	
	
	Ms Cornell stated that there was nothing about the letter of employment that caused her to have concerns about its legitimacy. She accepted the information on it as correct. She stated that she accepted the payslips provided by Mr X as genuine.
	
	
	Thus there were three principal differences between the evidence of Mr X and Ms Cornell. First, there was the dispute about whether Mr X attended at her office on two occasions or one. Second, there was a critical dispute about whether Mr Moussa joined Mr X at any time during his meetings with Ms Cornell. Mr X said he did but Ms Cornell denied that. Given the evidence as to her previous dealings with Mr Moussa described below, if the jury accepted that Mr Moussa made himself known to her during her interview with Mr X, then the case against her became very strong. Third, as stated Ms Cornell asserted that she spoke to a person on the telephone in Mr X’s presence who claimed to be the author of the employment letter. In cross-examination Mr X denied that happened.
	


Cancelling the valuation request on CLAS


	
	The scam being perpetrated on St George Bank was predicated on the Bank not ascertaining the true value of the property being purchased. As at 2006 the practice of St George Bank was to not require a valuation if the loan to value ratio was 80% or lower with the value being determined by the purchase price disclosed by the contract for sale. The loan to value ratio disclosed by Mr X’s application was 79.037%. Nevertheless on or about 17 July 2006 the text of an email from a senior Bank employee directing Ms Cornell to arrange a “short form” valuation of the Willoughby unit was placed on the CLAS system. According to a Bank investigator, a short form valuation involved a valuer entering the premises and conducting a “full evaluation”. Shortly afterwards Ms Cornell’s assistant, Ms Ranade, made an entry on CLAS recording that a short form valuation had been ordered. Nevertheless no valuation was obtained.
	
	
	St George maintained a valuation processing system (“VPS”) that recorded requests for valuations. The VPS contained an entry corresponding with the request made by Ms Ranade. It also contained an entry with a creation date of 7 August 2006 “valuer could not get access, withdrawn at request of Hiba [Cornell]”. In her evidence Ms Ranade stated that she made that entry after receiving an instruction from Ms Cornell. In cross-examination it was suggested that Ms Cornell provided that instruction to her on the date she made the entry, ie 7 August 2006, to which she responded “could be”. The implication of the question was that by that time the settlement was complete so that the necessity for the valuation had disappeared. Even so, why the valuation was not completed before settlement or St George did not insist on it being delayed pending a valuation was not explained.
	
	
	In her evidence Ms Cornell stated she did not recall being contacted by Ms Ranade about the valuation request or being advised that a valuer was having difficulty accessing the property. She stated that there was no utility in obtaining a valuation once the sale is completed. In cross-examination she denied deliberately “kill[ing]” the valuation to avoid detection of “[her] fraudulent scheme”.
	


Contact with the principals of the scheme


	
	The Crown tendered Ms Cornell’s mobile phone records for the period May to September 2006. They included three telephone calls or attempted calls from Ms Cornell to Mr Moussa and six calls or attempted calls from her to Mr Rachid on 25 May 2006, a telephone call or attempted telephone call from her to Mr Rachid on each of 2 June 2006, 9 June 2006, 22 August 2006, 23 August 2006 and 29 August 2006, and two such calls or attempted telephone calls from her to Mr Rachid on each of 27 July 2006, 18 August 2006, 30 August 2006, 31 August 2006 and 4 September 2006.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Cornell stated that she did not know whether she knew she was ringing Mr Moussa’s number on 25 May 2006 as he may have telephoned her and she may have been unwittingly returning a call to that number. She denied that the call was part of the preparation for the loan to Mr X. She claimed that she called Mr Rachid as he was a customer of St George ( “I was answering his enquiries”).
	


Other loans – Mr Laurence/Galdas


	
	As noted, Ms Cornell worked for the CBA as a part-time lending officer between October 1996 and August 2003. She was based at the Bankstown branch. In circumstances which I will describe the Crown adduced evidence concerning the processing of six loan applications by Ms Cornell on behalf of the CBA between September 2002 and March 2003.
	
	
	One such loan was for $450,000.00 in favour of Mario Galdas who was previously known as Flavio Laurance. Mr Galdas gave evidence. The loan was approved in November 2002. Mr Galdas stated that he was assisted by Terence Reddy and Ali Moussa who showed him a property in Elizabeth Bay and then introduced him to Ms Cornell who processed his loan application. He described a perfunctory meeting with Ms Cornell at which Mr Moussa was present. He said that two days later he was advised the loan was approved. He could not service it and the CBA repossessed the property six months later.  The stated purchase price was $625,000.00 which corresponded to a loan to value ratio of 72%. There was no evidence as to how the proceeds of the loan were disbursed, although Mr Galdas recalled that the purchase price was $490,000.00 suggesting that some part of the loan was diverted.
	
	
	The CBA file included copies of a St George Bank statement in Mr Galdas’ name indicating a balance of around $150,000.00 and two pay slips for Mr Galdas indicating that his gross monthly pay was $11,249.45. The pay slip listed his employer as “Baywash Blue” and the address of the employer as Level 25 Chifley Tower, 2 Chifley Square. This address was associated with Mr Moussa (see [49]). Ms Cornell certified that both were copies of originals. On the pay slip Ms Cornell wrote “Directory 9293 2935 Employment confirmed with Iliana”. Mr Galdas confirmed that both sets of documents were bogus. He denied ever having seen them before or being asked about pay slips. His taxation records indicated his average income was around $500.00 per week.
	
	
	Ms Cornell denied that Mr Moussa accompanied Mr Galdas to the interview or that she had any dealings with him in relation to the loan application. She said that an interview usually took between half an hour and 45 minutes to complete a loan application and that it was “impossible” that the interview only occupied 5 to 10 minutes as stated by Mr Galdas. She said that Mr Galdas provided the pay slips when she interviewed him and that he showed her the bank statement. She said she was not able to contact St George Bank to check its validity. She said she made a telephone call to confirm his employment and then wrote “Employment confirmed with Iliana” on the pay slip.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was pointed out to Ms Cornell that one of the pay slips included a calculation of net pay that could not be reconciled with the amount stated for gross pay and the tax taken out. It was also pointed out that the other pay slip contained two different statements of the gross pay. She agreed those matters were evident on a “quick check” but denied being aware of it. She also agreed that there was an “obvious” discrepancy between the ABN stated at the top of the pay slip compared with the body of the pay slip but said she “missed it, it’s an honest mistake”. She denied being aware of any connection between Mr Ali Moussa and the address in Chifley Square.
	


Mr Cunningham


	
	The Crown adduced evidence concerning the other five loans via an investigator employed by the CBA, Mathew Lynch.
	
	
	On or about 5 September 2002 Ms Cornell recommended that an investment home loan submitted by Mr Russell Cunningham be approved. Mr Cunningham sought a loan for $490,000.00 to purchase a property at 9/232 Moore Park Road, Paddington, for $650,000.00. The loan to valuation ratio was 75.4%. In a document titled “Application Covering Memo and Acknowledgment” Ms Cornell certified that the income and employment of the applicant had been verified. She also certified that two faxed copies of pay slips from “RLC Entertainment Pty Ltd” showing that Mr Cunningham held the position of Producer and earned a gross monthly income of $12,500.00 were true copies of the originals she had sighted. On one she wrote “Emp confirmed”. Ms Cornell also certified that a faxed copy of a NAB statement in the name of Russell Leroy Cunningham with a closing balance of $205,150.73 was a true copy of the original sighted.
	
	
	In June 2003 Mr Lynch obtained a valuation of the Moore Park Road property for $260,000.00. Mr Cunningham’s tax records revealed that his gross annual income for the financial year 2002 was $31,500.00 and he was employed as a managing supervisor. A NAB officer confirmed that the purported bank statement was not a true record of the bank.
	
	
	In her evidence Ms Cornell stated that after she worked on the file another CBA officer, Marilyn Marshall, completed a “funding request” which is an instruction to the loan processing centre. She said that Ms Marshall would have also had the application and the supporting income documentation and bank statement. Ms Cornell said that after the loan left her office she would generally not see it before settlement. She said that she did not see the valuation report or the material from the ATO concerning Mr Cunningham’s income. She stated that she was not required to collect tax declarations for the Cunningham file or for other loan files. Ms Cornell stated that she was not allowed to contact the NAB to verify the validity of the bank statement as it would have been a breach of privacy for anyone to have given her information in relation to the account.
	
	
	While she had no specific recollection of the file, Ms Cornell agreed that she would have received the payslips and the NAB account statement at the time she completed that document. She agreed that she wrote “Emp confirmed” on the payslips but stated that she only would have done so after telephoning the employer (“I used to ring the employer and confirm the employment”). She agreed that she certified the payslips and the NAB bank statement as being true copies. She stated that she might have sighted faxed versions of the documents, but stated that before she certified them she would have inspected the originals as provided by the customer, although the originals would be returned to the customer. In cross-examination she agreed that the pay slips did not list a bank account or include an amount for the year to date salary but did not agree that had any significance.
	


Mr Kutchera


	
	On or about 25 October 2002 Ms Cornell recommended that an investment home loan submitted by a Samuel Kutchera be approved. The approval was marked “urgent”. The loan application revealed that Mr Kutchera sought a loan for $450,000.00 to purchase a property at Wentworth Avenue, Surry Hills. A copy of the contract was kept on the CBA’s file. It stated that the purchase price for the property was $650,000.00. The loan to valuation ratio was 69.2%. In a document titled “Application Covering Memo and Acknowledgment” Ms Cornell certified that the income and employment of the applicant had been verified. She also certified that two copies of pay slips from Fatburger Pty Ltd showing a gross monthly income of $10,000.00 were true copies of originals sighted. She wrote on one of the copies of the pay slips “Employment confirmed”. She certified that a letter of employment from Oxydo Café (trading as Fatburger Pty Ltd) stating that Mr Kutchera was employed on an annual salary of $120,000.00 was a true copy of the original sighted. She also certified that a faxed copy of a statement for an account from the Sydney Credit Union in the name of Mr S. Kutchera with a closing balance of $151.249.22 was a true copy of the original sighted.
	
	
	In 2003 Mr Lynch obtained a copy of the contract for the sale of the property purchased by Mr Kutchera which showed a purchase price of $295,000.00. An employee of the Sydney Credit Union provided a statement confirming that Mr Kutchera had an account but did not have a balance exceeding $9,880.00 during the period from May 2002 to August 2003. An Australian Securities and Investments Commission search showed that from 4 March 2002 to 14 March 2004 Ali Moussa was a Director of Fatburger Australia Pty Limited and Terrence Reddy was its company secretary. Mr Moussa held an account with CBA in the name of Fatburger. The mailing address for the account was listed as care of “Mortgage One, Level 25 Chifley Tower, 2 Chifley Square Sydney”.
	
	
	In her evidence Ms Cornell agreed that she certified the documents but stated that when she saw the letter of employment from Oxydo Café she did not recognise the name of the café, did not recognise the name “Fatburger” or that Ali Moussa was associated with it. She reiterated that the CBA polices did not require that she make any enquiries as to persons connected with Fatburger. She said that Mr Kutchera provided her with two payslips. She wrote “employment confirmed” and certified that they were true copies. She did that on the same day that she saw the original and photocopied it. She certified the copy of the Credit Union statement when she saw the original. She gave the original back to the customer. Again she stated that she was not allowed to contact the Credit Union to check the validity of the statement.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Cornell agreed that one of the pay slips contained a figure for net pay that did not reconcile with the gross figure and the amount withheld for tax, but denied that she realised that at the time she certified it. She stated that she was not surprised that Mr Kutchera was supposedly earning $120,000.00 per annum as a café manager.
	


Ms Moussa


	
	On 10 December 2002 Ms Cornell signed a “Home Loan approval – Input Schedule” for a Fatima Moussa. Ms Moussa applied for a loan of $490,000.00 to purchase a property at 2D/23 Baden Road, Neutral Bay. Ms Moussa signed a Consumer Credit Contract Schedule on 9 December 2002. A copy of the front page of the contract for sale retained by the CBA listed the purchase price of the property as $620,000.00. The loan to value ratio was 79%. A mortgage on the CBA file contains a signature of Ali Moussa as the witness to Fatima Moussa’s signature.
	
	
	On 30 December 2002 a settlements officer employed by the CBA faxed a letter to Ms Moussa’s solicitor requesting a copy of the transfer. On 16 January 2003 they replied. They enclosed copies of two draft transfers and noted that Ms Moussa was purchasing from an on-seller. The transfers stated that the property was being sold to Double Bay Developments Pty Ltd for $230,000 and that Double Bay Developments Pty Ltd was on-selling the property to Ms Moussa for $330,000. Ms Hart noticed the discrepancy and spoke to her manager, who instructed her to contact the branch to chase it up. She said she spoke to Ms Cornell and told her that there was a discrepancy between the transfer and the contract of sale regarding the sale price. Ms Cornell said that she would inquire and respond. Ms Hart recalled Ms Cornell stating “[m]ake sure it gets done”. Later the same day Ms Hart spoke to Ms Cornell again. She made a diary note for the file recording that Ms Cornell told her that she, Ms Cornell, had spoken to the customers who advised that they would be taking their business elsewhere. Ms Hart said that she later received a telephone call from Fatima Moussa wanting to know why the loan was not proceeding. She told Ms Moussa that she would have to speak to Ms Cornell.
	
	
	In her evidence, Ms Cornell denied that she told Ms Hart to “[m]ake sure it gets done”. She said that she never saw Ms Moussa’s file after it left the Bankstown office including the draft transfers sent to the bank by Ms Moussa’s solicitors and she was not aware that there were two different transfer amounts. She agreed that she spoke to Ms Hart on 23 January 2003 and advised her that Fatima Moussa was moving her business. Ms Cornell said that she had a heated conversation with Fatima Moussa about the loan not settling and Ms Moussa decided to take her business elsewhere.
	
	
	Fatima Moussa was Ali Moussa’s sister. In cross-examination Ms Cornell denied being aware of that until she was told that by Mr Lynch during the interview in July 2003 discussed below (at [64]). She agreed that she had meetings with Mr Moussa in December or early January 2003 but stated that he did not mention that he had a sister much less that she was seeking a loan. As further explained below, her discussion with Ms Hart that was recorded in the file note of 23 January 2003 occurred three days after Ali Moussa had transferred $6,000.00 to her. She denied writing the word “urgent” on the file.
	


Mr Garbett


	
	On or about 17 January 2003 Ms Cornell recommended that an investment home loan submitted by Mr Bronson Garbett be approved. Mr Garbett sought a loan for $490,000.00 to purchase a property at 310/33 Bayswater Road, Potts Point for $615,000.00. The loan to valuation ratio was 79.7%. In the “Application Covering Memo and Acknowledgment” Ms Cornell stated that the income and employment of Mr Garbett had been verified. She certified that two faxed copies of payslips for Mr Garbett from “Uncle Sam’s Fast Photo Service” showing a gross monthly income of $12,300.00 were true copies of originals that she had sighted. She also certified that a faxed copy of a letter of employment from Uncle Sam’s Fast Photo Service stating that Mr Garbett was employed as a Marketing Manager on an annual salary of $148,000.00 was a true copy of the original sighted. She wrote “Employment confirmed” on the letter. Ms Cornell certified that a faxed copy of a bank statement for an ANZ account in the name of Bronson Garbett with a balance of $164,552.81 was a true copy of the original sighted. However, ATO records showed that for the financial year 2002 Mr Garbett earned a total income of $44,598.00 from his employment as a sales and marketing manager.
	
	
	In her evidence, Ms Cornell stated that the funding request was filled out by Marilyn Marshall but agreed that she dated and initialled the task items on the left hand side of the Application Covering Memo and Acknowledgement. She also agreed that she wrote “Employment confirmed” on the employment letter from Uncle Sam’s Fast Photo Service. She stated that “I would have rung the employer and confirmed that he actually work[ed] there”. Ms Cornell said that, although she was not required to, she adopted the added precaution of telephoning employers to confirm the employment details. She said she certified the copies of the letter of employment and the payslips when she saw the originals.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Cornell denied that there was any discrepancy between Mr Garbett’s income being listed as $148,000.00 and his working in a photo shop. She denied that the marking of the application as “urgent” would have had any meaning to her at the time. In re- examination she denied writing the word “urgent” on the top of the memorandum.
	


Mr Mustapha


	
	On or about 18 March 2003 Ms Cornell recommended that an investment home loan submitted by Mr Mohamad Mustapha be approved. Mr Mustapha had applied for a loan for $490,000.00 to purchase a property at 603/33 Bayswater Road, Potts Point. The purchase price was said to be $620,000.00 and thus the loan to valuation ratio was 79%. In the “Application Covering Memo and Acknowledgment” Ms Cornell stated that the income and employment of the applicant had been verified. She certified that a faxed copy of two payslips from “A&J Delta Tiling Australia Pty Ltd” showing a gross monthly income of $10,416.67 were true copies of originals that she had sighted. Ms Cornell wrote on a copy of the payslips “Employment confirmed with JOHNNY. Directory. 9760 0777”. Ms Cornell certified that a faxed copy of a letter of employment from A&J Delta Tiling Australia Pty Ltd stating that Mr Mustapha was employed as a Sales Representative on an annual salary of $125,000.00 was a true copy of the original sighted. She also certified that a faxed copy of a bank statement for a St George account in the name of Mohamad Mustapha with a closing balance of $187,508.57 was a true copy of the original sighted.
	
	
	Records obtained from the ATO stated that for the financial year 2002 Mr Mustapha earned a total income of $4,846.00 from employment as a freight handler. An employee of Westpac confirmed that the account number with St George was an account held by Mr Mustapha, but the balance listed on the copy of the account statement retained by the CBA was false. The true balance was $16.00.
	
	
	As with the other loans Ms Cornell agreed that she had certified the employers’ letter and pay slips even though that was not required. She said she did that “[as] a rule that I made for myself just as an added precaution”. She stated that she telephoned the employer and confirmed the loan applicant’s employment details. She obtained the number from directory assistance. She stated that she certified a copy of the St George Bank statement when she sighted the original. She reiterated that when she processed the loan she did not have access to any information from the ATO and denied having any knowledge of the true opening balance of Mr Mustapha’s CBA account.
	


Ms Cornell’s relationship with Mr Moussa


	
	In her evidence Ms Cornell said that she first met Mr Moussa in 1999 shortly after she separated from her husband. They became friends but saw each other less after she remarried in September 2000. She said that he never told her he was involved in finance or property development. He knew she worked in a bank but she denied that he ever asked her to do anything on his behalf.
	
	
	During his investigation, Mr Lynch discovered that on 20 January 2003 $6,000.00 was withdrawn from Mr Moussa’s CBA account and deposited into a CBA account in the name of Ms Cornell’s son. Ms Cornell was authorised to withdraw funds from that account. On 21 January 2003 the $6,000.00 was withdrawn and dispersed. $4,000.00 was deposited into Ms Cornell’s home loan account, $1,500.00 was paid off her credit card balance and $500.00 was withdrawn as cash. In her evidence Ms Cornell accepted that she received the funds but said they were the proceeds of a loan from Mr Moussa to pay for air conditioning for her home. This was contested by the Crown. This dispute resulted in the calling of a witness who said he fitted an air conditioner at her home in 2003, a witness with expertise in air conditioning models and brands and the adducing of evidence from the police who arrested her in 2009 as to their observations as to whether air conditioners were installed at the home. I will not describe the evidence any further. The fact that funds were provided by Mr Moussa to Ms Cornell at the time she was involved in the processing of a loan application for his sister was itself a critical fact supporting the Crown case.
	
	
	On 19 and 23 June 2003 Mr Lynch interviewed Ms Cornell. In the interview on 19 June 2003 Mr Lynch asked her about a number of the files and then asked whether she knew Ali Moussa. She agreed she knew him “but only very like vaguely”. She said that she knew he owned a café and the name of it was “Oxy Door or something like that”. In the interview on 23 June 2003 she denied that she connected that name with the employer listed on Mr Kutchera’s application. She also denied that Mr Moussa mentioned that Fatima Moussa was his sister. Ms  Cornell was asked about the transfer of $6,000.00. She stated that it was a loan to fund air conditioning at her home. She stated that she had not made any repayments. The balance of the questions in the interview tested her assertion that funds were used to purchase an air conditioning unit.
	
	
	Having regard to what was discussed with her during that interview Ms Cornell could not have been in any doubt that the CBA suspected her and Mr Moussa of being involved in a fraud. In cross-examination she agreed that in September 2003 she spoke to Mr Moussa and told him “there was some home loan fraud and they think that he may be linked to it”. She said that she became “wary of him”.
	


Grounds 1 and 2: Use of Tendency evidence for Coincidence Purposes


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal contends that a miscarriage of justice was “occasioned by the address of the Crown Prosecutor in which evidence, which was not admitted for a coincidence use, was relied upon for that purpose”. Ground 2 of the appeal contends that a “miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the trial judge inviting the jury to use evidence which was not admitted for a coincidence use, for that purpose”. Both grounds do not involve a question of law alone therefore leave to raise them is required (Criminal Appeal Act; s 5(1)). I consider that leave should be granted.
	
	
	As noted the essence of these grounds concerns a deviation between a ruling given by the trial judge in advance of the trial (the “pre-trial ruling”) as to the basis upon which the Crown could lead evidence concerning each of the six CBA loan applications described above, and the use which the Crown Prosecutor made of that evidence in their address as well as the references to that evidence in her Honour’s summing up. To address these complaints it is first necessary to describe the course of the trial in detail.
	


The Pre-Trial Ruling


	
	Prior to the trial the Crown provided Ms Cornell’s legal representatives with a document entitled “Tendency and Coincidence Evidence”. It referred to the Crown’s stated intention to lead evidence of twelve home loan applications considered by Ms Cornell including the six noted above, as well as certain evidence connecting her to Mr Moussa. The notice stated that the purpose of the tender of the coincidence evidence was to prove that Ms Cornell was involved “in a joint criminal enterprise to obtain fraudulent loans on behalf of loan applicants based on overvalued properties” utilising a loan to value ratio under the threshold for obtaining a valuation, and to prove she produced “fraudulent” documents to obtain loans including documents concerning the loan applicant’s “employment [and] salary”. The alleged tendency was identified in similar terms.
	
	
	Before a jury was empanelled the trial judge addressed an objection to the tender of this material on a voir dire. In a judgment delivered on 3 March 2014 her Honour held that the evidence concerning her “relationship with Mr Moussa in general is admissible because it is relevant under a [Harriman v The Queen [1989] HCA 50; 167 CLR 590] argument”, that is because her association with Mr Moussa in 2002 and 2003 was probative of the nature of her association with him via Mr X in 2006. In relation to the twelve loan applications her Honour rejected the tender of evidence of six but allowed the others being those noted above. However in doing so her Honour sought to identify which features of each application that bore a similarity to Mr X’s loan application would be allowed on a tendency basis and which would be allowed on a coincidence basis. Thus with tendency evidence her Honour referred to “questionable” documentation that Ms Cornell had “either not checked or not checked it appropriately”. In relation to coincidence evidence her Honour stated:
	


“In relation to the coincidence there is evidence of, in general, incorrect valuations with respect to certain properties. There is also evidence of incorrect asset amounts. These issues are related in whether the loan ought to have been approved or not by the bank. There is no evidence that the accused knew of these incorrect valuations. There is no evidence that she benefitted from these transactions. But there is evidence which should be put to the jury as it being the unlikelihood of it being a coincidence that the accused was involved in loans which had these features in the CBA and those similar transactions in St George.”


	
	Her Honour then addressed each of the twelve transactions. As stated, in relation to the six loan applications described at [38] to [61] above her Honour listed the features of each application that could be “admitted” on a tendency basis or a coincidence basis. Thus, for example in relation to the Kutchera loan application her Honour stated:
	


“The matter of Kutchera, the similarities are the accused approved the loan. There was the consistent loan to value ratio and the similar amount of loan of $450,000, the property worth $650,000. They are the tendency or coincidence similarities. In relation to this matter the accused verified the employment and there is evidence of connection between that employment and Mr Moussa. Therefore, those matters will be admitted under the tendency rule. With respect to the evidence of the valuation of the property, that should be admitted as coincidence evidence.”


	
	Two matters should be noted about the pre-trial ruling at this point. First in stating that only certain matters in respect of each loan application would be admitted her Honour did not make a direction under any provision of the Evidence Act 1995 either at the time of this ruling or when the evidence was adduced at the trial. Second, with respect to her Honour, I do not understand the basis for only “admitting” certain features of each loan application on a coincidence basis. In the events that transpired all the evidence was “admitted” in the sense that it was adduced before the jury. Instead, I understand her Honour’s reference to a feature being “admitted as coincidence evidence” as being an indication that only that feature could be deployed by way of reliance on coincidence reasoning. This is puzzling. It is understandable that her Honour would distinguish between similar “conduct” by Ms Cornell in addressing the admissibility of tendency evidence on the one hand (Evidence Act, s 97(1)(b)) and evidence of similar “events” connected to Ms Cornell when addressing the admissibility of coincidence evidence on the other (Evidence Act, s 98(1)). However once it had been determined that evidence of two or more “events”, such as the making of a loan application, can be admitted for coincidence purposes then there is no justification for restricting the tribunal of fact from considering all the “similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred” as part of the process of determining whether or not the events occurred coincidentally (Evidence Act, s 98(1); see R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236 at [79]; “MR”).
	
	
	In the end result her Honour stated that with each of the Cunningham, Kutchera, Lawrence, Garbett and Mustapha loan applications, the certification of, inter alia, their false employment details was or would be “admitted” on a tendency basis. With each of the Cunningham and Lawrence loan applications her Honour admitted evidence of the false bank statements on a coincidence basis. With each of the Kutchera, Lawrence and Moussa loan applications her Honour admitted evidence that the purchase price of the property the subject of the loan application was falsely inflated on a coincidence basis. Her Honour did not state that any aspect of the Garbett or Mustapha loan applications could be admitted on a coincidence basis. This was inconsistent with the passage set out above because all six loan applications involved falsely inflated purchase prices and there was evidence of false bank statements being provided in support of all the loan applications except Mr Moussa’s application.
	


The Course of the Trial


	
	The jury were not empanelled until 18 March 2014. In the meantime her Honour dealt with an objection to the tender by the Crown of taxation records which showed the falsity of the income statements provided in support of the loan applications, valuations which showed the purchase prices of property the subject of the applications were inflated and documents showing a connection between Mr Moussa and Mr Kutchera’s employer. On 7 March 2014 her Honour held that the income statements could be tendered as part of the tendency material and the documents showing a connection with Mr Moussa were admissible on the basis that, inter alia, they showed an “association” involving Mr Moussa. In relation to the valuations her Honour stated that she had previously ruled that “valuations in general ought to be admissible in relation to the tendency or coincidence loans”.
	
	
	After the jury were empanelled the Crown opened its case. The Crown Prosecutor made reference to the six CBA loan applications and the connection they revealed between Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa.
	
	
	Counsel for Ms Cornell then opened. He identified the main issue for the jury as whether Ms Cornell knew that the pay slips and employment letter provided in support of Mr X's loan application were false. He also referred to the dispute about whether Mr Moussa attended at the St George Bank with Mr X. Counsel for Ms Cornell referred to the CBA loan applications and stated that it was not agreed that Ms Cornell “breached lending policy”. Counsel also told the jury that although they would hear evidence of “some discrepancies on payslips” they were “overlooked by my client” and were “simple human error”.
	
	
	The evidence described above was then adduced. During the trial Counsel for Ms Cornell sought to lead evidence about an audit of Ms Cornell’s files at the CBA which was said to reveal that she acted properly as evidence rebutting the alleged tendency relied on by the Crown. Her Honour rejected the evidence on the basis that, unlike the six CBA loan applications, there was nothing to suggest that Mr Moussa had any connection to the files and thus at most the evidence was said to relate to character only (see [97]). Presumably Ms Cornell did not want to lead evidence of her good character given that it may expose her to cross-examination on matters said to reflect poorly on her (Evidence Act; s 112). After the Crown closed its case, Ms Cornell was called and gave evidence. The defence then closed its case. There was no further discussion of the basis upon which the evidence of the six CBA loan applications was adduced or would be deployed during these parts of the trial.
	


The Crown Prosecutor’s Address


	
	The Crown Prosecutor then addressed. As is to be expected the Crown Prosecutor placed significant emphasis on Ms Cornell’s association with Mr Moussa and his role in the transaction the subject of the charges. However no reference was made during the course of that address to any tendency of Ms Cornell. The word “tendency” was not used. Instead, in relation to the six CBA loan applications, the Crown Prosecutor made a number of references to the common features of those applications and Mr X’s application. The Crown submitted that they were not the result of any coincidence.
	
	
	Thus early on in the address, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the Kutchera and Lawrence loan applications and stated:
	


“We put it on the basis that it is unlikely to be a coincidence that the accused was involved in loans which had the specific features which were also present in the loan with Mr X. That is, we say, it was not a coincidence and we say to you that in terms of this issue of coincidence that you would look at the loans carefully and consider that there were similar features in some or all of the loans and those features which were present in the Commonwealth Bank loans and appeared in the Mr X loan but also appeared in a slightly changed format to account with what the accused’s state of knowledge was having been investigated by the Commonwealth Bank.

… these features are, firstly that, the loans … did not require a valuation….

Of course there’s the false income details in relation to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia loans ...

All computerised payslips. No payslip required, no letter of employment required, no need to contact the employee, no need to write on any such documentation. And so we say that that is a feature which is consistent amongst the loans, maybe not on every document. I can’t remember now whether there’s a letter of employment for every loan but in any event that category of document which is not even required being placed on the file and being notated by the accused in circumstances where it’s required. So we ask you to look at all of those things and as I say draw the conclusion that it was not a coincidence ...” (emphasis added)


	
	Later in the address the Crown Prosecutor returned to the falsity of the payslips and income details for some of the CBA loan applications. The Crown Prosecutor identified the false payslips for the Kutchera file, the “Lawrence payslip”, the “Mohamad Mustapha one … similar format”, then referred to other aspects of the applications before stating that “when you look at all the of the coincidence evidence, that is not a coincidence”. Shortly afterwards the Crown Prosecutor submitted that:
	


“… Mr Lawrence [said] I went in there, I saw these two guys. Ali Moussa and Terence Reddy and we say the circumstantial evidence supports Mr Lawrence that he met an Ali Moussa who had a link with the Lawrence payslips, that is similar payslips to the Kutchera ones, the address at Chifley Square. So ladies and gentleman, we say that when you look at those two files [Lawrence and Kutchera] and then move out, you will accept that there was an emerging pattern from about the Kutchera loan onwards which had started with the false documentation from the Cunningham loan but then moved on to those others, the pattern, part of a pattern being those payslips in the same format.”


	
	The gravamen of these parts of the Crown Prosecutor’s address was to emphasise the connection between Mr Moussa, the CBA loans and Ms Cornell as demonstrating a “pattern” of fraudulently obtained loans which was in effect repeated with Mr X’s loan application. In so submitting, the Crown Prosecutor clearly deployed an appeal to coincidence reasoning. It highlighted that a common feature of the loan applications was the false income and employment material and the connection to Mr Moussa. The Crown submitted that was “no coincidence”, the implication being that it was planned because Ms Cornell was a knowing party to a fraudulent scheme involving the use of such documents.
	
	
	This aspect of the address was inconsistent with the pre-trial ruling. In particular to the extent her Honour ruled that evidence would be admitted for coincidence purposes, being the Cunningham, Kutchera, Lawrence and Moussa loan applications, her Honour did not specify that the loan applicant’s payslips and employment details were matters that could be relied on as part of any appeal to coincidence reasoning. Further the pre-trial ruling did not identify any aspect of the Mustapha loan application as able to be deployed for coincidence purposes yet the Crown’s address invoked the pay slips from that transaction for that purpose. The Crown Prosecutor did not refer to the Garbett loan application in his address.
	


Defence address


	
	After the conclusion of the Crown address no complaint or even comment was made by Counsel for Ms Cornell about either the appeal to coincidence reasoning or the absence of any reference to tendency in the Crown’s address. Instead Counsel for Ms Cornell immediately proceeded to address the jury.
	
	
	The first topic that Counsel for Ms Cornell addressed the jury on was the credibility of Mr X and Mr Galdas. That this was addressed at length is not surprising given that they both gave evidence of direct meetings between Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa in relation to loan applications. Counsel then addressed the evidence concerning the air conditioning unit. He ultimately submitted that a loan is “no kickback”. Next Counsel addressed Ms Cornell’s “role” at the CBA and St George but only to make the point that at most she only recommended approvals of loan applications but did not grant them herself. Finally Counsel addressed Ms Cornell’s evidence in detail imploring the jury to either accept or at least not reject it in its entirety. The only reference to the six CBA loan applications in the entire address was in discussing Ms Cornell’s evidence. Counsel stated “[w]e’re talking about the X loan” and “[l]et’s not get bogged down in the CBA material”. Otherwise the CBA loans and the Crown Prosecutor’s reliance on them were not addressed at all.
	
	
	Following the conclusion of the address by Ms Cornell’s Counsel, the Crown Prosecutor raised some minor points about references to the evidence in the address. The next day just prior to the commencement of the summing up Ms Cornell’s Counsel raised two matters. The first was a request that there be a correction of one part of the Crown Prosecutor’s address which referred to the timing of the Lawrence application and the Kutchera application. In the course of making that submission Counsel for Ms Cornell referred to the Crown Prosecutor as having delivered “a very succinct … and highly relevant address”. The second was a further application for a direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act concerning Mr Galdas’ evidence. In rejecting the latter application the trial judge referred to the opportunity the jury would have to consider Mr Galdas’ evidence “in the context of the coincidence evidence which is where his evidence lies”.
	
	
	Again no complaint or even comment was made by Counsel for Ms Cornell at this point about either the appeal to coincidence reasoning or the absence of any reference to tendency in the Crown’s address
	


The summing up


	
	In the summing up the trial judge told the jury that, in so far as the Crown sought to prove that Ms Cornell had knowledge of the falsity of the documents in Mr X’s loan application and had the requisite intent, its case was circumstantial. Her Honour directed them in a manner consistent with Chamberlain v R (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521. Her Honour advised them that one of the circumstances relied on by the Crown was the presence of Mr Moussa at the loan interview with Ms Cornell and Mr X. Her Honour repeatedly told the jury that that was in contest but stated that, if it was accepted, it was a very important part of the Crown case having regard to the evidence as to Mr Moussa’s past dealings with Ms Cornell.
	
	
	Immediately following the giving of the circumstantial direction the trial judge addressed the coincidence evidence. Her Honour told the jury as follows:
	


“The next thing I am going to tell you about is what is called coincidence evidence. It is obvious to you now that the accused has been charged only with the acts relating to the Mr X loan in 2006, that you know. But you have also been permitted to receive into evidence some other information regarding the CBA 2002, 2003 loans. That evidence has been permitted to be put before you because the Crown alleges that the loans the 2002, 2003 CBA loans were made in circumstances where the applicants apparently gave false details as to their income. Apparently there were false details as to their asset position that is the money they had in bank accounts and in some cases you may form a conclusion there were inflated values as to property.

… The Crown has pointed to certain similarities in those CBA loans and that includes the Mr Lawrence loan. The Crown has pointed to certain similarities in relation to the CBA loans and the Mr X loan which is the subject of the proceedings before the court. The Crown has addressed you on some of those similarities that the Crown says exist. I have referred to those matters. Importantly they have included in their address to you the fact that Mr Moussa was allegedly the introducer in relation to some of those loans. Certainly there is some evidence before you if you accept it that he was there for the Mr Lawrence loan. There was some evidence before you if you accept it that he was somewhere in relation to the Fatima Moussa loan. You know the dispute in relation to that evidence in relation to Fatima Moussa’s loan because that is certainly not conceded. There is some evidence if you accept it, in relation to Kutchera because that gentleman was allegedly employed by the Oxydo Café which you have evidence was associated with Mr Moussa…

…

Now in considering the relevance of that body of evidence, it is part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. In considering the relevance of that evidence you do not consider each of those transactions individually. You consider all of the evidence in relation to that body of the evidence as a whole and consider it when deciding whether the Crown has made a sufficient connection between that and the matter that you are hearing evidence of in this matter.

You do not ask yourself whether you find that in isolation but considering those CBA loans in connection with the Mr X loan. You have to consider whether there is such a significant similarity between those acts and circumstances as are put before you and the circumstances in which those acts occurred that it is highly improbably as the Crown suggests that the events occurred simply by chance or coincidence. Mr Crown has addressed you on that he has suggested to you that the events are so similar in nature that the course of conduct in the CBA loans and the course of conduct in the Mr X loan is so similar it could not have occurred by coincidence. He says therefore you would use that information that reasoning in order to consider whether the Crown has proven any of the elements of the offence in relation to the Mr X loans, specifically that of knowledge and intent.

The Crown say the improbability of those sets of events occurring by change or coincidentally may lead to a conclusion that the accused was aware of the circumstances of the Mr X loan.

Now this is all predicated I might say members of the jury on you accepting that Mr Moussa was present in the interview with Mr X, because that is certainly a very strong connection.

The Crown say that you would reject the accused’s explanation of an innocent involvement and therefore lack of knowledge. It is to that part of the evidence that the CBA loans and the suggestion that there is no coincidence at all that you would find it relevant in your consideration of the Crown’s circumstantial case in relation to the Mr X loan. In this case the Crown say that provided you are satisfied that the accused participated in the loan applications in the CBA in the way that they say they did, therefore you would be satisfied as to the accused’s knowledge of the Moussa involvement in the CBA loans, then importantly the Crown say the presence of Mr Moussa in the Mr X loan is one final circumstance that you would take into account when considering the issue of knowledge and intent.

The Crown says that in the circumstances of this case the presence of Mr Moussa is an important feature of the Mr X loan made more important by his involvement they say in the CBA loans.

Now the Crown say it is a markedly similar circumstance and one that simply does not occur by coincidence. They would say that because of that you would conclude beyond reasonable doubt when considering all of the evidence in relation to the Mr X loan, this is one further body of evidence they say that you would be entitled to take into account.

They say that it [is] evidence of a pattern of behaviour. Now you can only use the evidence of a pattern behaviour if you find two things are so. Firstly that the accused, that is Ms Cornell did the other acts in the way that the Crown allege in relation to the CBA loans. That is you have to be satisfied of her involvement in the CBA loans in the way the Crown allege in relation to false income details, occasionally inflated values of property and the involvement of Mr Moussa in those loans, you have to be satisfied of that.

Secondly you have to be satisfied that the body of CBA loans is so similar in all of those important features to the Mr X loan that you would find it is highly improbable that both sets of loans were carried out independently of each other or entirely by coincidence.

If you accept those two matters then you can use that evidence together with the other evidence put before you by the Crown to consider whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the Mr X loan. That is how you are entitled to use it.”

…

The evidence is placed before you not for that reason. The evidence is placed before you simply to assist you to consider in a circumstantial case, and whether you are convinced that there are similarities and whether the similarities are such that it is improbable that they occurred by coincidence. Now again that is predicated really on your finding of facts in relation to the presence of Mr Moussa in relation to the series of CBA loans and in relation to the Mr X loan and that is a factual matter that I keep on telling you is an important issue and I am not giving you any directions on that other than to say it is a factual issue you have to consider.” (emphasis added)


	
	At the conclusion of the summing up no issue was taken by either the Crown Prosecutor or Counsel for Ms Cornell with any part of the summing up.
	
	
	Thus the trial judge gave a direction on the use of the CBA loan applications as coincidence evidence regarding whether Ms Cornell was “aware of the circumstances of the Mr X loan”. Her Honour referred to the similarities between the “false details” about income, the similarities referred to by the Crown Prosecutor in his address and to similarities arising from the involvement of Mr Moussa. The direction was very much focussed on the connection of Mr Moussa to the CBA loan applications and Mr X’s loan application. Its overall effect was to instruct the jury that they could use the similarities in relation to the dubious elements of the CBA loan applications especially the false employment letters and pay slips in determining whether Ms Cornell had the requisite knowledge (and intent), that is knowledge of the falsity of Mr X’s pay slip and employment details. Further the trial judge did not give a tendency direction. To the contrary her Honour warned the jury about using the evidence of the CBA loan applications to reason that “she is the type of person who will commit criminal activity generally”.
	
	
	The end result was that the summing up directed the jury as to the coincidence use that could be made of the CBA loan applications that was consistent with the Crown Prosecutor’s address. Thus the observations made in [81] above as to the deviation between the trial judge’s ruling and the Crown Prosecutor’s address apply with equal force to the summing up.
	


Miscarriage of justice and wrong decision on any question of law


	
	In her written submissions on the appeal Counsel for Ms Cornell, Ms Francis, pointed to the deviation between the pre-trial ruling on the permitted use of the six CBA loan applications for coincidence purposes and the actual use sought to be made of the evidence concerning those applications in the Crown Prosecutor’s address which was also reflected in the summing up. Ms Francis contended that a miscarriage of justice was “occasioned by the use of extensive and significant evidence for a coincidence purpose, it having not been admitted on this basis”. It was further contended that the effect of the deviation was that “Defence counsel did not meet this different Crown case during the course of the evidence nor in his address to the jury” and that “[i]t was not a Crown case which [Ms Cornell] was required to meet and indeed defence counsel was prevented from adducing evidence which was capable of meeting this case”. Ms Francis submitted that none of this was cured by any part of the summing up. To the contrary the summing up reinforced the deviation between the Crown case and what was permitted by the pre-trial ruling. Finally Ms Francis contended that, as a miscarriage of justice had been demonstrated, leave to raise these grounds should be granted under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules notwithstanding that no complaint was made about the deviation at the trial by Counsel for Ms Cornell.
	
	
	Properly analysed each of grounds 1 and 2 identifies a different but related basis upon which it was contended that the above events gave rise to a basis for setting aside Ms Cornell’s conviction. Ground 1 is to the effect that the deviation between the pre-trial ruling and the Crown’s address meant that Counsel for Ms Cornell was unfairly required to meet a new case or at least a substantially different case from what he expected and that constituted a miscarriage of justice (see for example Anderson v R (1991) 53 A Crim R 421 at 438). This raises a complaint that falls squarely within the so called third limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 namely that “on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”.
	
	
	Ground 2 concerns the trial judge’s summing up. In oral argument it was developed to the point of contending that the pre-trial ruling was binding, as a matter of law, on the Crown Prosecutor and the trial judge. As I understand it the consequence of that is said to be that the trial judge’s summing up, which suggested a use of that evidence in a manner consistent with the Crown Prosecutor’s address but inconsistent with the pre-trial ruling, thereby involved a “[misdirection] on matters of adjectival law” so as to engage the second limb of s 6(1), namely a “wrong decision of any question of law” (Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29 at [13] per French CJ, Bell, Keane and Nettle JJ; “Filippou”). As I will explain, the relevant “adjectival law” for these purposes could either be s 95 of the Evidence Act or s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and a consideration of s 95 requires a determination of whether the evidence concerning the six CBA loan applications was properly admissible for a coincidence purpose. If the second limb of s 6(1) is satisfied in the sense that there has not been a trial according to law then consideration moves to the proviso in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act (Filippou at [13]; Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; 246 CLR 469 at [50] per Gageler J; Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [18]; “Weiss”).
	


Ground 1: Change in Crown Case


	
	In relation to the first of these bases I have set out the course of the trial in detail. I will proceed on the basis that the first notice that Counsel for Ms Cornell received that the Crown was not relying on tendency evidence but was seeking to pursue a case based on an expanded use of coincidence evidence from that contemplated by the pre-trial ruling was when he heard the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address. However in this case what is critical is what occurred next. Counsel for Ms Cornell did not raise any complaint whatsoever. Instead he delivered his address and then appeared to welcome the Crown’s approach (referring to the Crown’s address as “very succinct and highly relevant”). In his address he responded to the Crown’s reliance on this material by suggesting that the jury not get “bogged down in the CBA material” and instead focussed on the connection (or lack of it) between Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa in relation to Mr X’s loan application which was ultimately what the coincidence evidence was directed towards proving. This approach was only reinforced by his response to the trial judge’s summing up.
	
	
	As noted, during the hearing of the appeal Ms Francis sought to address the failure of Counsel for Ms Cornell at the trial to object to either the Crown Prosecutor’s address or the trial judge’s directions by reference to whether leave should be granted under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. However in this case the conduct of Counsel at the trial is of critical significance to whether the change in the Crown case occasioned a miscarriage of justice. This is so because where Counsel’s “failure to object was a rational, tactical decision, the Court is entitled to conclude that no unfairness attended the process” (Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; 247 CLR 531 at [114]; Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [9] per Gleeson CJ).
	
	
	If ever there was a case in which a review of the course of the trial reveals that Counsel for the accused’s failure to complain about the deviation in the Crown case could be considered a “rational, tactical decision” and suggestive if not demonstrative of a lack of unfairness in the process then it is this case. A complaint that the Crown Prosecutor’s address deviated from the pre-trial ruling might have led to a corrective direction about the features of the transactions that could be used in aid of coincidence reasoning and the re-agitation of the assertion that Ms Cornell had a tendency to knowingly certify false documents at least when Mr Moussa was involved in a transaction. It also could have led to a revised ruling that expanded the basis upon which the material could be deployed. However, instead of complaining about the deviation Counsel for Ms Cornell embraced it. It is completely understandable that Counsel for Ms Cornell accepted a Crown case based on an appeal to coincidence reasoning that was wider than that permitted by the pre-trial ruling, albeit one tied to Mr Moussa’s involvement in the loan applications, as the price to be paid for avoiding a case involving tendency. A trial where that transpired did not, without more, involve a miscarriage of justice. In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 Gaudron J stated (at [26]):
	


“The question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is usually answered by asking whether the act or omission in question ‘deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open’ … The word ‘fairly’ should not be overlooked. A decision to take or refrain from taking a particular course which is explicable on [the] basis that it has or could have led to a forensic advantage may well have the consequence that a chance of acquittal that might otherwise have been open was not, in the circumstances, fairly open.”


	
	In her written submissions Ms Francis instanced as an example of the prejudice that was occasioned as a consequence of the change in the Crown case the rejection of certain evidence that was sought to be adduced on behalf of Ms Cornell to rebut the alleged tendency evidence. As noted, during the trial Counsel for Ms Cornell sought to adduce evidence of an audit of some loan applications approved by her between 2003 and 2007. The trial judge described the outcome of the audit as “favourable” to Ms Cornell. Ms Cornell’s Counsel had sought to tender this material as evidence that she “had a tendency to act (a) honestly, and (b) in accordance with the policies of the bank”.
	
	
	Ms Francis submitted that the “audit evidence established that 88 per cent of the 39 files randomly selected” which Ms Cornell had been involved in had a loan to value ratio of 80 per cent or under and thus did not require a valuation. Ms Francis submitted that this evidence was clearly relevant to rebut the coincidence case ultimately put by the Crown to the jury in that it was capable of showing that the fact that the loan to value ratios for the six CBA loan applications was under 80% was coincidental or at least not uncommon.
	
	
	The audit report was made available to this Court. It lists 39 files by number and specifies a loan to value ratio for 36 of them of 80% or less. Thirty six files are listed as “S” for compliance which presumably means satisfactory. There is nothing in the document to suggest that the report was based on a random selection of files. A bank officer gave evidence on the voir dire. He was not familiar with the particular audit report but was familiar with the process that led to its creation. He stated that files were selected by reference to some criteria (“inbuilt targeted selection”) although he did not know what they were.
	
	
	Accepting that the audit report suggested that the approval of a loan with a loan to value ratio of 80% or less by Ms Cornell was relatively commonplace, Ms Francis’ submissions on this topic overlook the reason the trial judge gave for rejecting its tender as material rebutting the tendency relied on by the Crown and the basis upon which the Crown ultimately sought to rely on coincidence reasoning. The trial judge concluded that, for the outcome of the audit to be admissible on a basis that rebutted the Crown case on tendency, the loans that were reviewed would have to have “involved Mr Moussa”. This is so because the tendency that the Crown identified was one that involved dishonest conduct by Ms Cornell in connection with loans arranged by Mr Moussa. If there were bona fide loans approved by her in cases connected to Mr Moussa that would have rebutted the suggested tendency. Similarly the suggested lack of coincidence relied on by the Crown concerned loans in which Mr Moussa was involved. To rebut that case there would need to be evidence of Ms Cornell having approved loans from applicants connected to Mr Moussa that did not involve a loan to value ratio of less than 80% or which did not involve fraudulent income material or the like. There was no evidence of that kind.
	
	
	Ultimately the Crown’s address on coincidence and the summing up directed attention to the common feature of Mr Moussa’s involvement in the various applications. Her Honour rejected the evidence of the audit on the basis that the audited transactions had nothing to do with Mr Moussa. Even if the material concerning the audit relied on by Ms Francis demonstrated that, with loan applications unrelated to Mr Moussa, loan applicants often applied for less than 80% of the stipulated purchase price, it was irrelevant to so much of the Crown case that was put to the jury that sought to rely on coincidence reasoning. The absence of any attempt by Ms Cornell’s Counsel to re-tender this material after the Crown address or to otherwise point to the occasioning of prejudice from the change in the Crown’s case confirms this conclusion.
	


Ground 2: Significance of the pre-trial ruling


	
	As stated during oral argument on the appeal Ms Francis contended that the effect of the pre-trial ruling was binding in the sense that, as a matter of law, it precluded the Crown from seeking to deploy the six CBA loan applications and features referred to by the Crown Prosecutor in their address from being used for coincidence purposes. On this approach it is arguable that it is irrelevant whether this caused the trial to become unfair because the Crown case changed. Instead it is arguable that, if the pre-trial ruling had the effect contended for, then the summing up would have necessarily involved a “misdirection … on matters of adjectival law” (Filippou at [13]) and that will be sufficient to “[constitute] a miscarriage of justice in the sense of a departure from trial according to law” (Filippou at [13]; Weiss at [18]).
	
	
	This submission directs attention to the status of the trial judge’s ruling. There can be no doubt that the trial judge was authorised to conduct a voir dire and make an advance ruling on the admissibility of the evidence and the use to which it might be put at the trial (Evidence Act s 192A; Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 130A; cf TKWJ v The Queen at [39] to [45] per Gaudron J). In particular s 192A of the Evidence Act 2005 provides:
	


“192A Advance rulings and findings

Where a question arises in any proceedings, being a question about:


	
	the admissibility or use of evidence proposed to be adduced, or
	
	
	the operation of a provision of this Act or another law in relation to evidence proposed to be adduced, or
	
	
	the giving of leave, permission or direction under section 192,
	


the court may, if it considers it to be appropriate to do so, give a ruling or make a finding in relation to the question before the evidence is adduced in the proceedings.” (emphasis added)


	
	However neither a “ruling” or a “finding” is a judgment or order of a court capable of founding an appeal (Cheikho v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 191; 75 NSWLR 323 at [22] per Spigelman CJ with whom Barr and Fullerton JJ agreed). Further s 192A does not give a “ruling” any more force of law than it otherwise bears (WO v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 275 at [39] per Basten JA). Absent the giving of any direction or the granting of any leave under the Evidence Act, a ruling or a finding does not amount to anything more than an explanation of why evidence was admitted or rejected. In this case the ruling was to the effect that evidence would be admitted for tendency and coincidence purposes. It was accompanied by an indication that only certain similarities could be relied on for each use. Even though it was “authorised” by s 192A, that did not mean that a subsequent use inconsistent with what was stated in the ruling was of itself contrary to law. However two other legislative provisions may have had that effect.
	
	
	The first are the provisions of the Evidence Act dealing with the adducing of coincidence evidence in a criminal trial namely ss 95, 98 and 101 which provide:
	


“95 Use of evidence for other purposes

(1)   Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

(2)   Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

…

98 The coincidence rule

(1)   Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

   (a)   the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

   (b)   the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

      Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2)   Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if:

   (a)   the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

   (b)   the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.

      Note. Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as exceptions to the coincidence rule.

…

101   Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1)   This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2)   Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3)   This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4)   This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.”


	
	The distinguishing feature of these provisions for present purposes is that none of them contain a provision making the adducement or deployment of coincidence evidence contingent upon a grant of leave or the making of a direction by a trial judge (cf s 38, s 112; s 136 see TKWJ at [41] to [42]). In oral argument Ms Francis pointed to s 95. Section 95 operates to constrain the use of evidence which is admitted on other bases at the trial (see El-Haddad v R [2015] NSWCCA 10 at [38] to [42] per Leeming JA). However s 95 refers to evidence that is “not admissible” for a coincidence purpose. It can be contrasted with evidence that is only “admitted” for a non-coincidence purpose i.e. s  95 does not operate to stamp a definitive limit on the use of evidence at the time the evidence is adduced. Subject to no unfairness having been occasioned, evidence could be admitted at a trial for a non-coincidence purpose and later be used for a coincidence purpose provided that ss 98 and 101 are properly addressed. In this case if this Court were to conclude that all of the loan applications ultimately relied on by the Crown were “admissible” for a coincidence purpose and that all of the similar features could be deployed, a matter I will return to, it would not matter at this point that the trial judge had only admitted it for a different purpose (leaving aside the matter already addressed by ground 1). It follows that I do not accept that the effect of the pre-trial ruling was that the summing up was necessarily inconsistent with s 95 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The other provision that potentially gave the pre-trial ruling binding effect is s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 which as at the date of the trial provided:
	


“130A Pre-trial orders and orders made during trial bind trial Judge

(1)   A pre-trial order made by a Judge in proceedings on indictment is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(2)   If, on an appeal against a conviction for an offence in proceedings on indictment, a new trial is ordered, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to the proceedings from which the conviction arose is binding on the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings unless:

   (a)   in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for that order to be binding, or

   (b)   that order is inconsistent with an order made on appeal.

(3)   If proceedings on indictment before a trial Judge are discontinued for any reason, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to those proceedings is binding on a trial Judge hearing any subsequent trial proceedings relating to the same offence as the discontinued proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the subsequent trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(4)   In this section, pre-trial order means any order made or given after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial.” (emphasis added)


	
	If this provision operated on the pre-trial ruling then its effect would be that it was “binding” on her Honour and it could only have been departed from if her Honour considered such a departure to be “in the interests of justice” (s 130A(1)). There is no evidence that her Honour expressly considered that matter (although the reasoning in relation to ground 1 would suggest that such a conclusion was at least reasonably open). However for the reasons already noted the ruling was not an “order” and therefore did not engage s 130A (see R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [151] per Howie J). Thus, the pre- trial ruling did not have the necessary consequence that the direction in the summing up was inconsistent with s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	For the sake of completeness, I note that with effect from 8 January 2015 s 130A was amended by the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No 2) 2014 (Act No 88 of 2014) by including subsection (5) which provides “[t]o avoid doubt, this section extends to a ruling given on the admissibility of evidence.” The proper application of this provision may require a close analysis of what exactly constitutes the “ruling” in a case like this. However it is not necessary to consider this further because s 130A(5) has no application to Ms Cornell’s trial which took place in 2014.
	


Ground 2: Was the evidence admissible for coincidence purposes? 


	
	The conclusion just noted still leaves the possibility adverted to in [106] above that the use that was sought to be made by the Crown of the six CBA loan applications was not supported by ss 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act (and precluded by s 95) with the consequence that the trial judge’s directions on coincidence evidence amounted to a misdirection on a matter of “adjectival law” as discussed in Filippou. Although Ms Francis did not address this possibility the Crown raised the issue in its written submissions in that it contended that if, after the evidence of the six CBA loan applications had been led, the “appropriate application” had been made there was “no reason why … the same evidence could not also have been held to be admissible as ‘coincidence’ evidence”.
	
	
	As stated notice of reliance on the evidence as coincidence evidence was given in advance of the trial (s 98(1)(b)). I discussed the operation of the above form of s 98 (and s 101) in MR at [59] to [79]. I will not repeat that discussion. To properly apply s 98 (and ss 55 and 101) it is necessary (or at least helpful) “to identify the ‘events’ that are said to have occurred, the particular act or state of mind that it is said that the evidence of the events proved, the relevant similarities that are to be relied upon and the reasoning process that is sought to be engaged” (MR at [66]). In this case the relevant “events” are the six CBA loan applications and Mr X’s loan application and the state of mind that it is said the events prove is that Ms Cornell knew that Mr X’s pay slips and employment details were false. The similarities in the events were that all the loan applications involved a falsely overstated purchase price, and all of them except for Ms Moussa’s application involved false employment letters, pay slips and bank statements. There was direct evidence that four of the loan applicants were connected to Mr Moussa, namely Mr X’s application, Moussa, Galdas/ Lawrence and Kutchera and all seven were presented to Ms Cornell for approval. The relevant reasoning that was sought to be engaged was that, in light of those similarities, the presentation of those loan applications to her was not coincidental but instead occurred because she knew that the loan applications including the employment details were bogus.
	
	
	The first step in the process of considering this evidence is to determine whether that evidence is capable of affecting the probability of a fact in issue (DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 at [6]; “DSJ”; MR at [67] to [73]). The evidence was certainly capable of proving that Mr X’s loan application was the continuation of a scheme of fraud pursued by Mr Moussa. The second step is to determine whether the evidence has significant probative value (s 98(1)(b); DSJ at [7]). As noted an assessment of whether the evidence that these events occurred has significant probative value requires a consideration of the combined effect of all the similarities concerning the events (MR at [79]) as well as a determination of whether that evidence, when taken with any other evidence that is led or to be led by the adducing party has the “capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue” (DSJ 9 at [72]; MR at [78]) namely that Mr X’s loan application was false. In this case that other evidence includes the evidence connecting Ms Cornell to Mr Moussa (see [62ff]). When that evidence is considered with the evidence concerning the loan applications, bearing in mind the similarities between them, then this test is more than satisfied. Otherwise no relevant form of prejudice is apparent (cf s 101). In my view and notwithstanding the trial judge’s ruling, the evidence of the six CBA loan applications was admissible on a coincidence basis and all their common features were available to have been deployed.
	


Conclusion on grounds 1 and 2


	
	The deviation in the Crown address and the summing up from the pre-trial ruling concerning the evidence available to be used for coincidence purposes did not occasion any unfairness to Ms Cornell at her trial so as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. The effect of the pre-trial ruling was not such that a summing up that was inconsistent with it per se resulted in a wrong decision of any question of law within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Otherwise the evidence of the six CBA loan applications and all their similarities was properly admissible for coincidence purposes.
	
	
	It follows from those conclusions that I would reject grounds 1 and 2 of Ms Cornell’s appeal against her conviction.
	


Ground 3: Unreasonable verdict


	
	Ground three of the appeal contends that the jury's verdict was unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. In raising this ground Ms Cornell implicitly seeks a grant of leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to raise grounds of appeal involving questions of fact or questions of mixed law and fact (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]). I propose that leave be granted.
	
	
	This ground requires this Court to “ask itself … whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty” (M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493; “M”). In doing so this Court must undertake its own “independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality” (Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473). Thus it must consider any competing evidence to that presented by the Crown and weigh the conflicting evidence (SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [24] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ).
	
	
	In relation to the advantages enjoyed by the jury in hearing and observing witnesses compared to this Court in SKA at [13] French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ stated:
	


“The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M …[at 494] went on to say:

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred'.""


	
	Ms Francis’ written submissions in support of this ground pointed to the significance of the coincidence evidence contending that it was the critical evidence pointing towards guilt. Ms Francis contended that the evidence of the six CBA loan applications was not admissible for coincidence purposes at least in the manner utilised by the Crown and reflected in the summing up and without it the verdict cannot be supported. I have already rejected the premise of this submission. In my view the six CBA loan applications were admissible for coincidence purposes in the manner already explained above. I will address this ground on that basis.
	
	
	I have summarised the evidence at the trial. Contrary to Ms Francis’ written submissions, even without the coincidence evidence of the six CBA loan applications the Crown case was strong. Mr X’s loan application was clearly fraudulent. It is true that Mr X’s evidence should be treated with circumspection. However there was other material supporting his evidence so far as it implicated Ms Cornell. The documentary material established a connection between Mr Rachid and Mr X’s loan application. Further the funds from Mr Reddy provided indirect support for Mr X’s evidence of Mr Moussa’s involvement, given Mr Reddy’s past connection to Mr Moussa (see [49]). It follows that the evidence of Ms Cornell’s telephone contact with Mr Moussa and Mr Rachid was incriminating in light of her previous dealing with Mr Moussa in 2003. Ms Cornell’s explanation for that telephone contact was specious. Further the evidence pointed to Ms Cornell having failed to have the property valued despite a direction from her superior to do so. As noted the trial judge emphasised the importance of finding that Mr Moussa was present at Mr X’s meeting with Ms Cornell. This may have been over-cautious. However, accepting its significance to my own deliberations, I consider that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied of that fact. Finally, when the Crown case is considered with the evidence of the six CBA loan applications on a coincidence basis that embraces all their common features then I consider it overwhelming.
	
	
	I would reject ground 3.
	


Conclusion on conviction appeal


	
	It follows that I would dismiss Ms Cornell’s appeal against her conviction.
	


Appeal against Sentence


	
	The sentences imposed on Ms Cornell are set out above at [6]. Two grounds of appeal are raised in relation to sentence which I will address shortly. It is not suggested that either of the sentences were manifestly excessive. At the outset I note the following seven matters about the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	First, her Honour described the facts of the offence in some detail. Her Honour found that the jury must have accepted that Mr Moussa was present with Mr X when he applied for a loan and in doing so that they took into account the lack of coincidence with respect to the CBA loans.
	
	
	Second, her Honour addressed Ms Cornell’s criminality and her role in the fraudulent scheme compared to Mr X finding as follows:
	


“[Ms Cornell] was part of a well organised criminal enterprise which consisted at least of her and Moussa. The level and degree of sophistication of the whole plan when one takes into account the creation of false documents including payslips, bank statements and the entry on electronic devices and the maintenance by Mr Moussa of the front that he used as described by Mr X, the degree of organisation and criminality is high for the entire organisation. Again, it is acknowledged that there is no evidence of the offender participating in this part of the process, however, it was part of the organisation as a whole and she was an integral part of the whole organisation.

I find the offender’s level of involvement and knowledge of the entire operation was at a greater level than was Mr X. He did not know of her involvement which suggests she, in being able to keep her own position secret, was protecting herself.”


	
	Third her Honour addressed the “objective seriousness of the offence” being that the amount of the loan was $460,000.00 and the significance of the position of trust she occupied as a bank employee.
	
	
	Fourth, her Honour addressed Ms Cornell’s subjective circumstances. Her Honour noted that at the time of the offences she did not have any criminal record but since then she had been convicted “of a different type of fraud matter which occurred after the commission of the offence” (namely insurance fraud). For that offence Berman DCJ imposed an intensive corrections order. Her Honour held that, to a “small extent”, that conviction deprived her of leniency that would otherwise be afforded on account of her prospects of rehabilitation and in assessing her general mental health issues. Her Honour noted that Ms Cornell had not shown any remorse and that her prospects of rehabilitation were “difficult to assess”.
	
	
	Fifth, Her Honour noted that Ms Cornell had been diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Her Honour noted that the proceedings and her difficult family circumstances “weighed heavily on [the] offender”. Her Honour noted that in light of her condition and her concern about her daughter’s welfare, a custodial sentence would be onerous. However her Honour did not accept that there was any connection between the offences and Ms Cornell’s mental health problems.
	
	
	Sixth, her Honour referred to the position of Ms Cornell’s daughter. As at the date of sentence her daughter was 26 years old. Her position was described by Berman DCJ in the following extract from his sentencing judgment which was before her Honour in terms her Honour implicitly accepted:
	


“I turn now to really one of the most important factors in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose upon Ms Cornell and I want to say quite clearly and plainly were it not for this factor Ms Cornell would go to gaol full-time. Her offence was serious and, ordinarily, in the absence of the factor I am about to mention, nothing less than full-time custody would be appropriate. Ms Cornell’s daughter, … , was born with a significant injury. She suffers from sickle cell disease. Regular blood transfusions are required but one of the consequences of the disease has been, … , the development of further problems. As a young child she suffered a stroke and is now affected by frontal lobe injury. And in more recent times she has begun to experience seizures, any one of which may be fatal. It is something of an understatement to say that Ms Cornell is [her daughter’s] primary carer, indeed in many respects, she is her only carer. [Her daughter’s] problems are both physical and mental. I do not feel the need, in these public remarks on sentence, to go into the sort of behaviour that [her daughter] exhibits but I will note that it is the sort of behaviour that requires careful and close attention by someone who is willing to look after her. The person who best fulfils that role is of course her mother, Ms Cornell.”


	
	As did Berman DCJ, her Honour accepted that the position of her daughter amounted to “exceptional circumstances” (see R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510; “Edwards”), a matter I will return to. Her Honour noted the lack of family support to look after her daughter and the arrangements that must be made to provide medical support. Her Honour stated:
	


“While the courts will take those matters into account and as sympathetically as possible it cannot be the case that these considerations can override the need to take into account the objective seriousness of the offence when imposing a sentence, nor should the offender escape an appropriate sentence simply because of the hardship to her daughter. As Judge Berman observed, she was aware of the circumstances of her family when this offence was committed.

The considerations that I have mentioned will affect the non-parole to parole ratio of the sentence imposed.”


	
	Later her Honour noted that the “considerations of general deterrence in cases such as this require a significant consideration in sentence”. Her Honour said that she would take into account the hardship to Ms Cornell’s daughter to effect a “significant alteration of the statutory parole to non-parole ratios”. Ground 2 of the application for leave to appeal addresses this aspect of the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	Seventh, her Honour addressed the question of parity between Ms Cornell and the sentence imposed on Mr X. Mr X pleaded guilty to offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act and s 300(2) of the Crimes Act. After allowance for a discount of 50% he was sentenced to one year and three months for the former offence and two years for the latter offence. Her Honour stated as follows:
	


“The other matter that I would take into account is the issue of parity. It was considered appropriate by Judge Zahra that Mr X who at that time had very little in the way of prior criminal antecedents should be sentenced to a custodial term of approximately four years. He was given ultimately a 50% discount for assistance and an early plea of guilty. His own subjective circumstances were strong but conceded not as strong as this offender’s and did not amount to exceptional circumstances.

It is my assessment when considering the issues of parity that this offender was far more involved in the criminal organisation than was Mr X who was used and duped, it would seem to me, although somewhat willingly by Mr Moussa.” (emphasis added)

Ground 1: Ms Cornell’s involvement in a criminal organisation


	
	Ground 1 of the application for leave to appeal against sentence contends that her Honour erred in concluding that the appellant was “far more involved in the criminal organisation” than Mr X and that this was a matter to be taken into account in fixing an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	I have referred to the sentence imposed on Mr X at [131] above. The starting point for the heaviest sentence imposed on Mr X was four years imprisonment which was one year less than that imposed on Ms Cornell.
	
	
	In her written submissions Ms Francis submitted that the finding that Ms Cornell was “far more involved in the criminal organisation” than Mr X was the sole, or at least principal, basis upon which her Honour distinguished between the position of Mr X and Ms Cornell. I accept that contention. Ms Francis also relied on an observation by her Honour that Ms Cornell’s involvement in the six CBA loan applications “point[s] to an involvement of the offender in the criminality of the offence to a high degree” and complained that her Honour has “adverted to different criminality for which the appellant was not to be sentenced and which pre-dated the present offences by some years”.
	
	
	It is true that her Honour referred to Ms Cornell’s conduct in relation to the CBA loan applications but there was nothing improper in her Honour doing so. At no point in the sentencing judgment did her Honour purport to sentence Ms Cornell for her involvement in “different criminality”, namely the CBA loan applications. Instead her Honour made an assessment of Ms Cornell’s level of involvement in the subject offences by reference to evidence at the trial about those offences which included earlier transactions involving her and Mr Moussa. There was no reason why her Honour could not have regard to that evidence when assessing Ms Cornell’s relative standing amongst the perpetrators of the fraudulent scheme, provided that her Honour only sentenced Ms Cornell for the offences for which she was convicted. That evidence pointed overwhelmingly to a long standing pattern of co-operation between Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa to effect frauds of which the subject offences were one manifestation. The identity of the loan applicants changed over time but Ms Cornell and Mr Moussa’s involvement persisted. Her involvement as a bank insider was crucial and represented a grave breach of trust. She clearly had a far greater involvement than Mr X. If anything, the one year differential in the starting point for their respective sentences was generous to her.
	
	
	I would reject ground 1 of the application for leave to appeal against sentence.
	


Ground 2 : Exceptional Circumstances


	
	Ground 2 of Ms Cornell’s application for leave to appeal against sentence contends that her Honour erred in confining the relevance of the health of Ms Cornell’s daughter, which was conceded to be an exceptional circumstance, to the length of the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have referred to the circumstances concerning Ms Cornell’s daughter as disclosed to the sentencing judge. As noted, when sentencing Ms Cornell for another offence, Berman DCJ had concluded that the circumstances of her daughter’s vulnerability were such that the consequences for her daughter of sending Ms Cornell to gaol were “exceptional”. This characterisation was accepted by her Honour in this case.
	
	
	The phrase “exceptional circumstances” as deployed in this context derives from the following passage from the judgment of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 which was described by Gleeson CJ in Edwards (at 516) as the “most frequently cited Australian judgment on [the] subject” of the relevance of the impact of incarceration of an offender on third parties:
	


“… But it has been often remarked that the strength of our law lies in the willingness of judges, when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or of affronted common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back. So it is proper that I should here add that, in my opinion, hardship likely to be caused by a sentence of imprisonment under consideration ought to be taken into account where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be, in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so … For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go.” (emphasis added)


	
	Edwards was a Crown appeal against a sentence of periodic detention for manslaughter that was imposed because of the hardship the offender's full time custody would cause to a long term patient at an institution who was cared for by the offender. This sentence was set aside on the basis that those circumstances were not properly characterised as “exceptional” (at 516 to 517 per Gleeson CJ). The sentencing judge was found to have “deflect[ed] her[self] from imposing the sentence of full-time imprisonment, which she plainly indicated she would otherwise have imposed” (at 518). Thus in Edwards the sentencing judge was found to have wrongly treated the impact on a third party as determinative of the type of sentence that was to be imposed.
	
	
	On one view, Edwards is authority for the principle that exceptional circumstances are required to justify an exceptional sentencing outcome. However Edwards has come to be treated as authority for the broader proposition that “hardship to family members caused by a prison term can only be taken into account in ‘highly exceptional circumstances’” (Mokhaiber v R [2011] NSWCCA 10 at [30] per Price J, with whom James and Hislop JJ agreed; see also Winter v R [2011] NSWCCA 59 at [11] per Blanch J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed; Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22 at [49] per Simpson J, with whom Fullerton and Davies JJ agreed). However there is some authority to the effect that some weight can be attached to the impact on children of an offender’s incarceration even if exceptional circumstances cannot be demonstrated (see R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21] per Hodgson JA, with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed). Further family hardship falling short of exceptional circumstances has nevertheless been held to be a matter capable of constituting a basis for a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and thus affects the length of the non-parole period (Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150 at [83] per Hoeben CJ at CL, with whom Harrison J and I agreed). Given that exceptional circumstances were found in this matter it is unnecessary to consider this further.
	
	
	In her written submissions, Ms Francis embraced the finding of exceptional circumstances but contended that her Honour did not properly give effect to it by supposedly confining its relevance to the fixing of the non-parole period and ignoring it in determining the head sentence. In support of this contention Ms Francis pointed to the following passage from the judgment of Mason CJ and McHugh J in Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525 at 531 (“Bugmy”):
	


“Considerations which the sentencing judge must take into account when fixing a minimum term will be the same as those applicable to the setting of the head sentence. Obviously, the weight to be attached to these factors and the way in which they are relevant will differ due to the different purposes behind each function.”


	
	The appellant in Bugmy had been sentenced to a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment for murder. The head sentence of life imprisonment was fixed by legislation. The majority of Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ concluded that the sentencing judge had erred in fixing a long minimum term by being “unduly influenced by considerations which bear on the fixing of a head sentence rather than on the minimum term” such as the assessed risk of his reoffending, his behaviour in prison and the need to protect the community (at 537). Mason CJ and McHugh J dissented. Consistent with the above passage, their Honours found that the sentencing judge did not commit the error found by the majority (at 533.2).
	
	
	It follows that some caution should be exercised in applying the passage from Bugmy relied on by Ms Cornell. However even that passage accommodates the attribution of differing weight to the various factors affecting sentence for the purpose of fixing the head sentence as opposed to the non-parole period.
	
	
	The most common applications of the principle which Edwards is said to stand for are either at the point of considering whether a full time custodial sentence should be imposed, which was the circumstance faced by Berman DCJ, or at the point of determining whether special circumstances exist and, if so, the length of the non-parole period (see Regina v Robert Brian Grbin [2004] NSWCCA 220 at [33] per Dunford J, with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed). However there is no reason why a finding that exceptional circumstances exist is not a matter that a sentencing judge is entitled to give weight to in the fixing of a head sentence. It is possible that there will be cases where the adverse impact on third parties that the exception is designed to address will not be eliminated or minimised by the release of the applicant on parole. For example a travel restriction imposed as a condition of parole could prevent an offender returning to their home to care for a close relative. Nevertheless, consistent with both judgments in Bugmy, it is far more likely that hardship to family members will be a factor that warrants significant weight in fixing the non-parole period if special circumstances are found. This is because in most cases the hardship to the affected party from the sentencing of the offender to a term of imprisonment will disappear on their release. Certainly that is the case here.
	
	
	A consideration of the entirety of the sentencing judgment, including the passage noted above at [129], reveals that her Honour clearly regarded the circumstances of Ms Cornell’s daughter as a matter that warranted a significant reduction in the non-parole period. Critically I do not interpret the sentencing judgment as revealing that her Honour denied the potential relevance of the finding of exceptional circumstances to the fixing of a head sentence. Instead her Honour reasoned that, in this case, it was not a matter deserving any real weight having regard to the objective seriousness of her offending. Given that the nature of the hardship caused to her daughter from her imprisonment would dissipate on her release, such an approach does not involve any error of the kind discussed in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504 to 505.
	
	
	I would reject ground 2 of the application for leave to appeal.
	


Proposed orders


	
	Accordingly I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to raise grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the conviction appeal be granted;
	
	
	The appeal against conviction be dismissed;
	
	
	Leave to appeal against sentence be granted; and
	
	
	The appeal against sentence be dismissed.

		24 September 2015",2015-09-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2767824,R v Charles Robert Moyano [2015] NSWSC 1444,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Charles Robert Moyano, has been committed for trial on a charge that on 5 December 2014, he murdered Keith Lee. An issue has been raised as to the accused's mental condition, both at the time of the alleged offence and continuing to the present. Accordingly, on 11 September 2015, an order was made that an enquiry should be conducted as to the accused's fitness to be tried for this offence.
	
	
	The hearing of that enquiry this morning has been very brief indeed, as both counsel, Mr Bailey, for the Crown, and Ms Loukas of senior counsel for the defence, are in agreement as to the appropriate finding, and the vast majority of the relevant documentation had been provided to me in advance of the hearing.
	
	
	The accused has been interviewed by psychiatrists on behalf of both the Crown and the defence, in order to assess his fitness to be tried for this offence. Dr Adam Martin saw the accused on behalf of the defence on 17 April 2015 and submitted a report dated 23 April 2015. Dr Olav Nielssen saw him on behalf of the Crown on 3 June 2015 and submitted a report on 16 June 2015. Both psychiatrists considered that the accused suffers from a mental illness, although there was a slight variation as to the precise nature of the illness. Dr Nielssen's diagnosis was that he suffers from chronic schizophrenia, noting in his report that the accused has had three long hospital admissions since 2005, with affirmed diagnose of schizophrenia. Dr Martin considered that the accused suffers from schizo-affective disorder, with an alternative diagnosis of bi-polar disorder or schizophrenia.
	
	
	Both doctors concluded that the accused was unfit to stand trial at the time of their assessments, although both agreed that, with appropriate medication, it was likely that he would recover sufficiently to become fit for trial within the next 12 months.
	
	
	The reports, as already noted, were written some months ago now, but, as I shall mention shortly, the situation appears to be essentially unaltered at the present time.
	
	
	Section 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”) requires that the judge, in determining a person's fitness to stand trial, is to include the findings of fact which were made and the principles of law which were applied.
	
	
	As to the principles of law applicable in these proceedings, it has long been accepted that the appropriate principles are those enunciated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45. To very briefly summarise those principles, they require that, in order to be fit to stand trial, a person needs to:
	



	
	understand the charge against him,
	
	
	be able to plead to that charge,
	
	
	understand generally the nature of the proceedings and follow the course of those proceedings,
	
	
	be able to make his defence,
	
	
	if represented by counsel, be able to give counsel appropriate instructions.
	



	
	Dr Martin considered that the accused would have great difficulty communicating to the Court in a coherent manner, and would have significant problems in concentrating on legal processes. This would impact detrimentally on his ability to make a rational defence. At the time of his assessment the accused appeared unable to understand, or communicate the defences which might be available to him, particularly the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness, nor could he understand the nature of the legal processes or follow the course of the proceedings. Dr Martin therefore considered that, applying the Presser principles, the accused was at that time unfit to be tried for the present offence.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen, as already mentioned, concurred with Dr Martin's conclusion. He considered that the accused was aware of the charge against him, but was unable to make his defence as he did not recognise that he was mentally ill at the time of the killing. His grossly disorganised thinking would, in the doctor's opinion, prevent him from following the proceedings in a meaningful way, or providing reliable instructions to his legal representative.
	
	
	Accordingly, both experts were of the view that the accused essentially fails all but the first of the Presser principles I mentioned earlier.
	
	
	These reports, of course, date back some months, over five months in the case of Dr Nielssen's report. However at the hearing today the defence, by consent, presented the affidavit of Helen Shaw dated 24 September 2015. Ms Shaw is the solicitor from Legal Aid who has represented the accused throughout these proceedings. The first two times she saw the accused were in December 2014 and January 2015, at which time she formed the view, as a result of his inappropriate responses, that he was unfit to be tried. She saw him again last Thursday, 24 September 2015, when he again gave inappropriate answers and showed a complete lack of understanding of the legal processes involved in his trial. Ms Shaw could see no improvement in his condition over the period that she has been seeing him.
	
	
	Even more significantly, Dr Martin this morning saw the accused in the cells, before the hearing of this matter. He gave evidence that the mental state of the accused has not greatly changed. He was thought disordered, and kept coming back to problems of hygiene in his current accommodation. He had elevated mood and was suffering from paranoia. The doctor said that he tried to go through the Presser criteria and, essentially, nothing had changed in relation to those criteria since his report of 23 April. The doctor concluded that, in his opinion, the accused does not meet the Presser criteria.
	
	
	In cross-examination he said that with appropriate medication the accused does have the potential to become fit to be tried within a 12 month period.
	
	
	Section 12 of the Act provides that an enquiry as to a person's fitness to be tried is not to be conducted in an adversarial manner. That has certainly been adhered to here where, as already mentioned, counsel for both the Crown and the defence agree that the appropriate finding in this case is that the accused is at present unfit to be tried for this offence. On the basis of the whole of the evidence, in particular the expert evidence, which is all one way on this issue, I am more than satisfied that this is the only appropriate finding.
	
	
	Accordingly, pursuant to s 14 of the Act:
	



	
	I formally find that the accused, Charles Robert Moyano, is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder of Keith William Lee on 5 December 2014.
	
	
	In accordance with section 14 of the Act, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
	
	
	Pursuant to section 14(b)(iii) of the Act I remand the accused in custody, pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, under section 16 of the Act.
	
	
	I direct the Supreme Court Registry to provide the following documentation to the tribunal:
	



	
	A copy of these findings.
	
	
	A copy of any orders made for detention.
	
	
	A transcript of these proceedings.
	
	
	A copy of the Crown papers tendered at this enquiry, which include
	



	
	A copy of any psychiatric reports tendered to the Court during these proceedings, and
	
	
	The Crown Case Statement.
	



	
	Any other exhibits tendered to the Court in the enquiry.

		30 September 2015",2015-09-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767825,R v A2; R v Magennis; R v Vaziri (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 1427,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown seeks to adduce evidence of steps taken as part of the New South Wales Education Program on Female Genital Mutilation (“FGM”) following the enactment in 1994 of an offence prohibiting FGM as contained in s.45 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	Objection is taken on behalf of each of the Accused persons to the tender of this evidence.
	


The New South Wales FGM Education Evidence


	
	The Crown seeks to call Ms Vivienne Strong, recently retired Manager of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM and Ms Linda George, the Community Education and Development Officer of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM since 2007.
	
	
	According to her statement (MFI 23), Ms Strong has been a registered nurse and has occupied the position of Manager of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM from 2006. She managed two State-wide women's health programs. The New South Wales Education Program on FGM is said to work with health and allied health professionals and women and men from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Ms Strong has been involved in presentations on FGM in various forums. These include presentations to conferences and workshops with attendees from a wide audience, including health professionals to affected communities in New South Wales.
	
	
	Ms Strong states, amongst other things, that her unit responds to reports of FGM in New South Wales, liaising with other agencies in that regard.
	
	
	Reference is made by Ms Strong to publications concerning FGM, including a 1997 document entitled ""Information for Health Professionals"" issued by the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the 2007 brochure entitled ""New South Wales Education Program on Female Genital Mutilation"" issued by the New South Wales Education Program on FGM.
	
	
	In her statement (MFI24), Ms George indicates that her duties include the presentation of information on FGM at different forums and training service providers and co-ordinating education programs concerning FGM. Ms George has stated that FGM professional training to nurses, midwives and other clinical staff began as early as 1998 and has been conducted at different hospitals throughout the Sydney metropolitan area (MFI25).
	


Registration of Health Professionals


	
	There is evidence before the jury from Detective Sergeant Stek that the Accused, Kubra Magennis, has been a registered nurse and midwife (T259 and T293). There is additional information before me (MFI29), provided by the Executive Officer of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of New South Wales, that the Accused Magennis born in 1943, was first registered in New South Wales as a nurse and midwife in 1977 on the basis of overseas qualifications and registration. Continuous registration records prior to 1995 are not available. However, available records reveal that she:
	



	
	was registered from 28 February 1995 to 6 March 1997 when her registration lapsed, as she failed to pay her registration fee;
	
	
	was re-registered from 9 October 1997 to 5 November 1998 when her registration lapsed for failure to pay the registration fee;
	
	
	was re-registered from 23 February 1999 to 4 March 2004 when the registration lapsed again for non-payment of the registration fee;
	
	
	was re-registered on 3 May 2004 with registration lapsing on 7 June 2007 for non-payment of the registration fee;
	
	
	has not been registered as a nurse or midwife since 7 June 2007.
	



	
	Evidence has been adduced on the voir dire this morning from Detective Sergeant Stek that enquiries reveal that the Accused Magennis worked at Liverpool Hospital between 2000 and 2004 (T425).
	
	
	The Crown also points to the status of A1 as a medical practitioner working in that capacity in New South Wales. He has resided in Australia since 2000 (PT626.) He is the husband of one of the Accused persons, A2. I will return to this aspect later in this judgment.
	
	
	Although A2 is a pharmacist (T259), the Crown does not seek to tender the FGM education material against her (upon the education of health professionals basis). It appears that FGM training is provided to frontline health care workers such as doctors and nurses, but not to pharmacists (MFI30).
	
	
	The role and significance of a community education program undertaken after the enactment of s.45 in 1994 was referred to in my judgment in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) 2015 NSWSC 1221 at [198]-[205]. Reference was made, at [202]-[204], to the statement of Ms Strong and the 2007 brochure which has been disseminated as part of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM.
	
	
	It may be noted that the conclusion that I reached on the meaning of the word ""mutilate"" in s.45 (that it includes causing any injury to any extent for non-medical reasons) is not dissimilar to the explanation of a s.45 offence given in the New South Wales Education Program on FGM material: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) at [110], [202]-[205] and [240]-[258].
	


The Crown Tender of New South Wales FGM Education Evidence


	
	I turn to the bases upon which this material is tendered by the Crown, and against each of the Accused persons.
	
	
	Firstly, the Crown seeks to tender the material against the Accused Magennis upon the basis that she has been a registered nurse and midwife over a period when education of health professionals, including nurses and midwives, concerning FGM was actively available. Although there is no direct evidence that the Accused Magennis attended any particular FGM education session, the Crown submits that it may be inferred that this information came to her attention as a nurse and midwife.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown seeks to tender the material against all of the Accused persons. It says that A1, as a practising medical practitioner in New South Wales, may be inferred to have been aware of the FGM education material. Although he is not an accused person (he is a Crown witness), the Crown submits that the electronic evidence demonstrates that he was closely involved in recorded conversations with each of the Accused persons in the development of the “Africa story” and the “checking story” which, the Crown says, were false explanations intended to explain away the true position, namely that FGM was undertaken, separately, by the Accused Magennis in the presence of the Accused, A2, upon each of C1 and C2 with injury to each girl resulting from that process.
	
	
	The Crown submits that it may be inferred, from the content and frequency of these conversations, that not only did A1 know of the New South Wales education material concerning FGM, but that he told the Accused persons about this matter.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely upon some statements made in these conversations as admissions, and statements made concerning the “Africa story” and the “checking story” as lies which indicate consciousness of guilt of the performance of FGM causing some injury.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submits that the FGM education material is admissible because of some evidence of Professor Sonia Grover, a witness called for the Accused, A2 and Shabbir Vaziri, whose evidence was interposed at a relatively early point in the Crown case because of the impending unavailability of Professor Grover.
	
	
	Counsel for each Accused person objects to the tender of this evidence on relevance and other grounds as appear in the transcript and submissions on this issue (T383-388).
	


Issues in Dispute in the Trial


	
	As is apparent from the opening addresses at the start of the trial of Mr Sutherland SC for the Accused, A2 and Shabbir Vaziri, and Mr Bouveng, counsel for the Accused Magennis, there is a confined area of dispute in this trial (T50-70). There is no dispute that at places and times alleged in the indictment, the Accused Magennis used a metal instrument to come into physical contact with the genital area of each of C1 and C2. On each occasion, the Accused, A2, was present and she had requested the Accused Magennis to so act. Each girl was lying on a bed naked from the waist down during the event.
	
	
	The issues in dispute may be summarised as follows. The Crown says that, on each occasion, what was happening was a form of FGM where some injury was caused to the clitoris of each child. The defence says that this was a form of religious or cultural ceremony where metal is laid upon the child's genital area, but that it was not a form of FGM, and that no injury was caused to either child.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely upon different forms of evidence, both direct and indirect. As mentioned, the Crown will contend that the recorded conversations which took place on and after 29 August 2012 constitute admissions, express or implied, or evidence of lies indicative of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	It will be necessary, in due course, with the assistance of counsel, to formulate directions to be given to the jury concerning lies and consciousness of guilt by reference to the authorities, including Steer v R [2008] NSWCCA 295; 191 A Crim R 435, R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157; 221 A Crim R 311 and McKey v R [2012] NSWCCA 1; 219 A Crim R 227.
	


Some Evidence Relevant to this Ruling


	
	For the purpose of this ruling, mention will be made of some parts of the evidence.
	
	
	Between 9.50 am and 1.03 pm on 29 August 2012, each of C1 and C2 were interviewed separately by investigating officials concerning alleged FGM. That evidence is before the jury by way of video recordings (MFI2 and MFI7). Reference was made, in those interviews, to being ""cut"" and ""hurt"".
	
	
	That same day, a number of conversations took place which were recorded by way of surveillance device or telephone interception warrant. Reference will be made to some of these.
	
	
	Between 2.49 pm and 2.58 pm on 29 August 2012, whilst travelling in a motor vehicle, the Accused, A2, asked C1 and C2 what they had been spoken to about that day. Upon being told about what had been discussed, the Accused, A2, said to C1 (Exhibit AD):
	


“I told you not to say, now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you, my child, this is a big secret, never tell anyone.”


	
	At 3.04 pm on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit AA, Tab 3), a telephone conversation takes place between the Accused, Shabbir Vaziri, and A1. The Crown says that there is discussion that C1 has told the interviewers that circumcision had happened. There is discussion about reference being made to the trip to Africa and what may have happened there. The Crown says this appears to be the genesis of the “Africa story”. A1 says that he will speak to the Accused Magennis.
	
	
	At 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit AA, Tab 4), A1 spoke to the Accused Magennis by telephone. The Accused Magennis sounded concerned when told the girls had been interviewed and that C1 had ""told all the truth"". The Crown says that the ensuing discussion involved A1 saying that the authorities would be told that the girls had been checked in case anything had been done to them in Africa and that the Accused Magennis told him that she was ""happy for him to go that way"".
	
	
	After 3.21 pm that day, a further conversation is recorded in a motor vehicle in which the Accused, A2, A1, C1 and C2 are present (Exhibit AF). A1 says at one point:
	


“Kubra Aunty was worried.”

A2 then says:

“We should say we don't remember names.”

A1 then said:

“We can say that we called this lady to checkup to make sure that they haven't had anything done. Say this way that we called to check them if anything is being done because they go to Africa and is been done there.”


	
	At 4.08 pm that day, the Accused Magennis spoke by telephone to Zafar Sheikh (Exhibit AA, Tab 5). In this conversation she said in a sad voice:
	


“I am quite in trouble.”


	
	A little later, in a weeping voice the Accused Magennis said:
	


“I do not want to go to gaol at my age.”


	
	At 5.50 pm on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit AA, Tab 7), the Accused A2 and the Accused Magennis discuss by telephone what the Crown says is the “Africa story” and the “checking story”.
	
	
	At 5.13 pm on 30 August 2012 (Exhibit AA, Tab 19). The Accused Magennis speaks to the Accused Shabbir Vaziri by telephone. In the course of the conversation, the Accused, Shabbir Vaziri, tells her that thirty-five thousand had been sanctioned and that ""your cheque will arrive"". The Accused Magennis tells him that she had ""phoned all the way to her brother Zafar"" and she had said to him, ""At my age I do not want to go to sit in a gaol"".
	
	
	The Crown says that there are further references in recorded conversations to the “Africa story” and the “checking story”.
	
	
	I will refer to one further conversation. At 6.17 am on 2 September 2012 (Exhibit AA, Tab 27), the Accused, A2, speaks to her father (in Kenya) by telephone. In the course of this conversation, the father asks:
	


“Legally what will happen? Worst comes to worst, just a curiosity.”

The Accused, A2, replies:

“They can put us behind bars. Whoever involved, they said all are in fault. They can put us behind bars.”

Determination


	
	I return to the bases upon which the New South Wales Education Program on FGM material is tendered.
	
	
	The first basis relates to the Accused Magennis’ status as a nurse and midwife, registered to practice in New South Wales for significant periods, in particular between 1999 and 2007. The offences here are alleged to have been committed between 2009 and 2012.
	
	
	I am satisfied that evidence of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM directed to health professionals, including nurses and midwives, is relevant for the purposes of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995 in the case against the Accused Magennis. It is capable of assisting the jury in considering her responses to being told that C1 had told investigators what had happened, and in assessing whether her responses (orally and by conduct) constituted admissions or are evidence of consciousness of guilt on her part, that what had happened with each girl involved the performance of FGM resulting in some injury.
	
	
	The second basis sought the admission of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM material against each of the Accused persons by way of A1's position as a practising medical practitioner in this State, taken with his alleged part in developing with the Accused persons, the “Africa story” and the “checking story”. I am satisfied that the New South Wales Education Program on FGM evidence is admissible against each Accused person on this basis. It is relevant for the purpose of the Evidence Act 1995. This is particularly so in assessing the almost immediate responses contained in the electronic evidence, where what is said to be a false story was allegedly developed by the Accused persons and A1 in the form of the “Africa story” and the “checking story”, with that story then being given to investigators.
	
	
	It will be for the jury to determine what flows from the use of these stories, but it is open to the Crown to contend that these are lies advanced out of consciousness of guilt, namely, that the true position was that what happened to each girl was a procedure involving FGM resulting in some injury to each girl.
	
	
	In this context, it is appropriate to note that it will not be argued for the defence that the “Africa story” or the “checking story” are true. In his opening address to the jury, Mr Sutherland SC said (T67):
	


""… there will not be any issue that nothing happened in Africa at all, that they were just expressions of scared people that were worried because the police were investigating what they contend was nothing more than a religious or cultural ceremony”.


	
	The third basis relied upon by the Crown arose from the evidence of Professor Grover. Early in her evidence-in-chief, Professor Grover gave a long answer including general comments about her experience with FGM in Victoria. In the course of an answer, Professor Grover said (T191.45-192.29):
	


“I undertook a research project a little bit later in the 1990s looking at 50 consecutive women that we had seen at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne to understand what age these women had had their circumcisions done and what problems they had experienced and then some time in the last five or six years I have done a repeat of the survey to obstetricians and gynaecologists as well as health care workers who are working with women from the relevant cultural backgrounds to find out whether people are seeing circumcision procedures or are hearing about whether circumcision procedures are being done in Australia and in fact we could find no evidence that it was being done in Australia.

Tell me to stop if you want me to stop, but if I think about male circumcision the Children's Hospital's stopped and there's been a move to stop male circumcisions being done as part of public hospital's things and within--

HIS HONOUR

Q. Could I just ask you to pause for a moment? I'm not being critical of the doctor, this is a long answer to an introductory question and we're now on to male circumcision. I'm not being critical but--

SUTHERLAND: It's up to me to pull the rope.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Sutherland, if you could proceed by asking questions, perhaps asking the witness to focus on particular areas.

SUTHERLAND: Yes. 

Q. We were specifically focussing on the area of, amongst other things, female genital mutilation or cutting, mutilation, circumcision, whichever is the apposite term surgically, if you could just finish your response without referring to male circumcision, if you would be so kind?

A. The point was that I have never heard of an acute complication from a girl having a procedure done here in Australia and I think I would have heard of it, so I'm pretty confident it's not happening in Australia.”


	
	The Crown pointed to the two places where Professor Grover opined that there was no evidence that “it” (namely FGM) “was happening in Australia”. In submissions, Mr Sutherland SC said he would not be relying on these observations of the witness which had nothing to do with this trial (T369).
	
	
	While Professor Grover was under cross-examination, she replied to a question from the Crown Prosecutor in a manner which drew an intervention from me (T219.30-47):
	


“Q. And with their eyes closed and being distracted by some dissociative technique, if the person who performed the procedure was able to put a cotton bud or something like that on to staunch whatever blood there might be, it's fair to say that the child wouldn't have seen the blood, do you agree with that?

A. That's absolutely correct, but it - you remember that your cut on your finger, that it's required only one or two dabs before it stops bleeding, it's been a very superficial, minor, nonscarring, non-mutilating minor cut and the distinction I thought we were trying to make was whether this was a significant injury.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Could I indicate that the question of the term 'mutilate' is a question of law which ultimately I will give the jury some directions about; that is something you understand, don't you, Doctor? You are not here to give an opinion about what the word 'mutilate' means, are you?

A. No, I'm not.

Q. Thank you.""


	
	Professor Grover's response appeared to distinguish a “non-mutilating minor cut” from a “significant injury”. What I said at that point speaks for itself. It is, of course, a matter for the Court to direct the jury concerning the meaning of the word ""mutilates"".
	
	
	I am satisfied that the New South Wales Education Program on FGM material, which will be before the jury for other purposes as well, will also provide information to the jury concerning FGM in this State as communicated to health professionals and the general community. As I indicated earlier in this judgment (at [13]), the directions which I will give the jury concerning the meaning of the word ""mutilate"" in s.45 Crimes Act 1900, is not dissimilar to the explanation given in the New South Wales Program on FGM education evidence.
	
	
	Although it is a subsidiary basis only, I am satisfied that the New South Wales Education Program on FGM evidence is relevant, as well, given the impression which may have arisen from the evidence of Professor Grover, which was given early in the trial (the witness having been interposed). That evidence appeared to be based upon Professor Grover's Victorian experience. Evidence concerning the New South Wales Education Program on FGM will assist the jury in this trial.
	
	
	To the extent that any objection was taken to evidence on this topic generally under s.137 Evidence Act 1995, I record my conclusion that the probative value of this evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused persons.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to allow the Crown to adduce evidence of the New South Wales Education Program on FGM as applied up to September 2012.
	
	
	If evidence on this topic was to be admitted, specific objection was taken to the tender, as a physical exhibit, of the 2007 brochure entitled ""New South Wales Education Program on Female Genital Mutilation"" (contained in MFI23 and MFI24) and in the canvass material provided by police to members of the Dawoodi Bohra community (MFI14). I accept that there is material in the booklet which may give rise to some confusion, including the reference to the World Health Organisation classification comprising four types of FGM.
	
	
	Having determined to allow evidence in this area, I have in mind oral evidence on these matters, perhaps accompanied by a document extracting some material from the brochure. I do not think the complete brochure should be tendered.
	
	
	Having reached this point, I will allow counsel to consider the form of evidence which will be given. I will rule on any remaining controversy, if required.

		19 February 2016",2015-09-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767832,Assi v R [2015] NSWDC 343,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: This is an application pursuant to s 12(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Section 12(1) provides;
	


“Any person who has been convicted by the Local Court in the person’s absence or following the person’s plea of guilty may appeal to the District Court against the conviction, but only by leave of the District Court.”

The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 13 May 2014. He gave notice of an application to set aside that plea on 21 August 2014. The application was heard and determined by Magistrate Still sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 3 October 2014. The learned magistrate refused the applicant’s application to withdraw his plea of guilty. The appellant was later sentenced by a Magistrate McManus sitting in the Local Court at Burwood on 10 December 2014. The applicant, in the alternative to the relief which I am currently considering, seeks to appeal against severity of that sentence should his primary application to this Court be unsuccessful.


	
	The applicant was served with two court attendance notices. The court attendance notices were filed in the Local Court at Kogarah on 20 January 2014 and were first returnable on Tuesday 4 February 2014 at that Local Court. The first court attendance notice (“sequence 1”) alleged this:
	


“Between 12.01am on 06/04/2009 and 11.59 pm on 15/04/2009 at Roselands, did dishonestly obtain for the said Jihad Assi a financial advantage, to wit, $137,819.70, by deception, namely by purporting to be a male by the name of Isaac Hamdan and applying for a Westpac Loan using fraudulent means and documents”.

The second court attendance notice (“sequence 2”) alleged this:

“Between 12:01am on 12/05/2009 and 11:59pm on 16/05/2009 at Roselands did dishonestly obtain for the said Jihad Assi a financial advantage, to wit, $183,066.79, by deception, namely by purporting to be a male by the name of Issac Hamdan and applying for a Westpac loan by using fraudulent documents and means.”


	
	The applicant applied for Legal Aid. Ms Christine Manolakos of Marrickville was appointed by Legal Aid to appear for Mr Assi. According to Ms Manolakos’ affidavit of 2 October 2014, which is exhibit 4 before me, the Legal Aid had requested that Mr Assi’s matter be dealt with “in-house” but the applicant was not happy with that decision and the matter was transferred by Legal Aid to Ms Manolakos. Ms Manolakos first appeared for the applicant when the court attendance notices were first returnable on 4 February 2014. At that appearance the matter was transferred to the Local Court at Burwood. This Court does know that the Local Court at Kogarah has been closed.
	
	
	The matter was before the Local Court at Burwood on 11 February 2014 and then again on 25 March 2014. On that occasion the endorsements appear to indicate that the Crown was considering an election to have the matter dealt with on indictment. The matter was then adjourned to 7 April 2014. On that occasion the Local Court noted that no election had been made by the Crown for the matter to be dealt with on indictment. It was then stood over for mention on 22 April 2014. On 22 April 2014 the matter was set down for hearing for two days commencing on 13 May 2014. On 13 May 2014 a plea of guilty was entered by the applicant or on his behalf. That plea was entered before Magistrate M O’Brien. His Honour set the matter down for sentence for 5 August 2014. The sentence did not proceed on 5 August 2014 but was adjourned to 21 August 2014 on which occasion notice was given of the intention to seek the leave of the Local Court to withdraw the plea of guilty. That application, as I said, was heard and determined on 3 October 2014. Eventually the sentencing hearing was completed on 10 December 2014.
	
	
	The sequence 1 offence concerns a hire-purchase agreement over a 2009 Caterpillar 432E backhoe loader. The vendor of that piece of plant was ZZ Co Pty Limited. It wished to transfer the plant to Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Limited of 130 Princes Highway Arncliffe. Mr Stephen (or Steven) Nguyen, a mortgage broker, of TN Mortgage Lending Pty Limited of Fairfield, acting for Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Limited approached a Mr David Evans of R and D Consulting Pty Limited, which was an asset finance broker. According to a statement prepared by Mr Evans, Mr Nguyen did not have asset lending experience or an interest in asset lending and hence his approach to Mr Evans to act on behalf of Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Limited. There is in the evidence that I have read for this application a standard commercial hire purchase agreement between the Westpac Banking Corporation Limited and Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Limited which was initially dated 15 April 2009 but was redated 17 April 2009. It was signed on 15 April 2009 by Isaac Hamdan who gave as his residential address, 12 Leslie Street, Roselands, and provided a date of birth of 2 February 1970. The moneys advanced by Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd pursuant to this hire purchase agreement were $154,000. The Crown case is that most of that money was received by the applicant and disbursed by him mainly in the Lebanon.
	
	
	The sequence 2 offence concerns almost identical facts; the piece of plant in question for the sequence 2 offence was a 2009 Caterpillar 320D Excavator and the sum advanced by the Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd was $195,800. The amount alleged to have been received by the applicant is that pleaded in the second court attendance notice. The standard commercial Hire Purchase Agreement for the sequence 2 offence bears a date 16 May 2009. As I understand the pleading and the submissions before me, the Crown case is that Isaac Hamdan, a director of Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Limited, was in fact the current applicant, using an alias and a false identity.
	
	
	For a number or years prior to 2009 the applicant had worked for a Mr Ian David Lazar. According to his affidavit which was in fact affirmed on 4 September 2014 and bears on the front cover the date 2 September 2014, which is exhibit 2 before me, the applicant had worked for Mr Lazar or one of his companies as a project manager for some five years between 2003 and 2008. According to paragraph 7 of the applicant’s affidavit he instructed Ms Manolakos that he was not guilty and that he was a “victim of Lazar”. Another acquaintance of Mr Lazar was Mr Owen Salmon who describes himself as a “business consultant”. He met the applicant around August 2004 at the Bligh Street offices of Mr Lazar whom he identifies as formerly being known as Ian Rogut. Mr Salmon in his affidavit of 4 September 2014, which is exhibit 3 before me, says that Mr Lazar became Mr Salmon’s client, Mr Salmon’s business providing to Mr Lazar “consulting and bookkeeping” services. Mr Salmon’s affidavit contains this matter:
	


“7. I am aware of Mr Assi bringing many loan customers, property developments and business interests to Mr Lazar for assessment. Many of these I was asked to assess in some way. This was done on the promises that Mr Assi would receive commissions for such work. I worked with Mr Assi on a number of these property and business matters over a lengthy period.

8. Mr Lazar is the target of a major NSW Police Taskforce (McMaster) with which I could safely say I am heavily involved…Recently (6 March 2013) a Fraud and Cybercrime Squad (FCS) officer whom I know well lodged an affidavit in the Supreme Court proceedings (matter 2009/295278). In the affidavit he says ‘In February 2012, the FCS commenced a protracted investigation into Mr Ian David Lazar et al who are believed to be involved in serious organised criminal activities within Australia’.

9. I raise this background as I am aware of dozens of victims of Mr Lazar and I still work with many of these people on a daily basis. I am a similar victim. I am aware due to working for Lazar and now with his victims, of how he operates and what he does to people. ICG had Assi as one of these victims.

10. Mr Assi continued to hang out at the Lazar offices well after I had drawn a line in the sand and moved on. By that stage I was out of pocket several million dollars for which I am now proving fraud myself. The nature of these police operations prevent me from elaborating too much but suffice to say I verily believe that Mr Lazar will face many counts of fraud on matters relating to fraud and conspiracy against my company, against numerous other victims whom I am assisting and I understand numerous criminal associates of his will also be charged”.

I have quoted that extensively in order to set out the background to the application in the Local Court from which leave to appeal is sought.


	
	Paragraph 7 of the applicant’s affidavit says that on 4 April 2014 he contacted Mr Owen Salmon. Paragraph 11 of Mr Salmon’s affidavit says that on that day he contacted Mr Assi. I can accept that they made contact with each other, but who initiated the approach is difficult for anyone to know because of the conflict in the evidence. The applicant’s affidavit gives details of conversations between the applicant and Mr Salmon as to Mr Salmon’s involvement in investigating offences that are alleged to have been committed by Mr Lazar. According to par 10 of the applicant’s affidavit, on 22 April he sent a copy “of the brief” to Mr Salmon and after he did that they met for coffee on 30 April 2014. Paragraph 10 of the applicant’s affidavit may not be entirely accurate and he may have only sent part of the brief because at par 18 he attests to providing a “full copy of the brief” to Mr Salmon on 17 July 2014, that is after he had entered a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Paragraph 11 of the applicant’s affidavit indicates that sometime between 4 April 2014 and 30 April 2014 he spoke with Ms Manolakos about Lazar and his activities. The affidavit of the applicant continues thus:
	


“12. I mentioned to Ms Manolakos that I am assisting the Fraud squad against Lazar prosecutions, and it might take some time to finish the full statement. She requested I get the fraud squad to write a letter of comfort. I did mention to her I was innocent and pleading not guilty all same time”.

It is difficult to know what exactly the applicant meant by saying that he was assisting the Fraud Squad. There was no evidence given that he had prior to this time made any approach to any officer of the Fraud Squad, merely that he was in contact with and in conversation with Mr Salmon. That may have led the applicant to believe that he was somehow assisting the Fraud Squad but there was no direct evidence that he had done so other than the averment in the paragraph of his affidavit that I have just quoted. The affidavit of the applicant then says this:

“13. On 5 May 2015 Ms Manolakos again spoke to me and requested follow up with the Fraud Squad to get a letter to assist their cause. She believed my innocence and she hoped that letter will make the DPP drop all the charges.

14. On 6 May 2014 CM Lawyers [Ms Manolakos’ firm] had agreed with me they would call police directly and seek an agreed adjournment. This was on the basis that my evidence would assist the guilty plea and that Mr Lazar was under heavy investigation and that could provide insight into this case over time.

15. Later on, Owen received a call from Steven Kassem who is a solicitor in her [Ms Manolakos’] office. He seemed to have a very different understanding of what Ms Manolakos and he had discussed. This greatly concerned him.

16. On 15 [sic] May 2014 my court was adjourned until 5 August 2014. Ms Manolakos advised me to plead guilty on the day of court without any written instructions or any prior discussion. She said, ‘You need to plead guilty because you got the money.’ I said, ‘I received the money but I didn’t do any dishonest thing, I wasn’t aware it was illegal, or what I did is tried to refinance all my properties. I followed the broker’s instructions.’, then she said, ‘if you receive some money then you are guilty. You have to change your plea to guilty with no admission.’ I said, ‘What is no admission?’ She said, ‘You didn’t know what you were signing.’ I agreed to plead guilty to receive some money without doing anything illegal. In a way I was forced to plead guilty to get the adjournment. I did not understand that consequence and thought the interview now pending with NSW Police Fraud and Cybercrime squad would assist his [my] case. She kept saying we will be changing the facts and will strike a deal with the police.”


	
	The affidavit of the applicant details at some length what happened subsequently. It is important however to note two electronic communications. The first is dated 4 August 2014 and was transmitted at 10.12pm. It is addressed to Christine@cmlaw.com.au and I infer is addressed to Ms Manolakos. The email says this:
	


“I am a bit concerned about the court tomorrow, after I saw you today and we agreed to seek adjournment for two months to allow for my wounds to heal and my health gets better. I received a call from Owen, saying that Steven from your office called him and said that ‘Christine is not going tomorrow to the court and he thinks sentencing might go ahead’.

If this is the case, and they refuse to postpone the court, I would like to seek to change my plea to ‘not guilty’ and prepare a defence. Ian Lazar is going to be charged on or before the 10 of October. The court or the police must know that the company in question was set up by Owen Salmon, under the instructions of Lazar and I was appointed as a director by them. We need to need link all these evidence to Lazar.

In the meantime please give me a ring when possible.

Cheers”

The tone of that email is cheerful, positive and respectful. It does not show any concern by the applicant about Ms Manolakos’ competence or inability to adequately represent him. Furthermore it indicates that the applicant had an understanding of what was happening. He clearly knew that he had entered a plea of guilty. He knew that the matter was listed for sentence on 5 August and he knew that it was necessary to obtain evidence which inculpated Ian Lazar, perhaps tending to exculpate the applicant. The reference to the applicant’s “wounds” and the need for his health to improve is, as I understand it, a reference to his recently having been treated for certain abscesses.


	
	It is clear that Mr Kassem had told the applicant that Ms Manolakos would not be appearing at court on 5 August 2014. She did not. Mr Kassem appeared and the matter appears to have been adjourned to 21 August without what might be described as “drama”. However it is clear from the email of 4 August 2014 that the applicant believed that it was in his best interests to get an adjournment for “two months” rather than for merely two weeks.
	
	
	The second communication to Ms Manolakos by email was sent on 11 August 2014 at 9.31pm. With necessary corrections, the email is this:
	


“On our last meeting three weeks ago, when I and Owen Salmon met in your office, we raised the point that I might need to change my plea based on the evidence and statements of Mr Owen Salmon and the facts that the company in question ‘Dolphin Point Apartments’ [had] been set up by Owen Salmon under Lazar’s instructions and the second company ‘ZZ’ again was set up by Stephen Nguyen an accomplice of Lazar. The submission to the police was to do thorough investigations of Lazar, the broker, Stephen and the tax agent.

You mention in your office that you will seek a Counsellor opinion and apply for one through Legal Aid. Also asked us if we can provide a detailed statement from Owen Salmon, which he did.

In the meantime I had a surgery and you managed to postpone the trial till the 21st of August.

Again, today I spoke to Steven [Kassem] regarding this case, he is a bit worried that it is too late to change the plea and he can’t apply for a barrister through Legal Aid for lack of time or because it is a Local Court.

I don’t know what is going on, there is some miscommunication here, my instructions were very clear, if there is no deal on the table between us and the DPP, and the submissions hasn’t been done properly or nothing has been done to alter the facts and introduce Lazar to this case, I will need to change my plea to not guilty.

Steven has raised a good point that last time he attended the court, that the magistrate doesn’t know anything about me helping the fraud squad with Lazar’s case and I was a victim of his all his fraudulent activities for the last ten years.

Tomorrow hopefully I will do a statement for the police for Lazar’s case, it is very linked to my allegations and we need to act very quickly.

Steven promised to engage a barrister and seek his opinion on the whole case before it is too late.

Someone has to call the prosecutors and explain our intentions before the Court.

Thanks.”


	
	The fifth paragraph of that email is very significant. It does refer to the applicant’s instructions to Ms Manolakos. Those instructions concerned a “deal”, an agreement between the applicant and the prosecution, that a set of facts to be agreed would be altered in such a fashion as to inculpate Lazar and thereby exculpating the applicant, and there clearly being some comfort offered to the prosecution, an offer to assist the prosecution in pursuing Lazar. It is also clear from that email that the applicant had not yet provided any statement to the police and one would have thought that that ought to have been done before he entered a plea of guilty. That would have been the prudent thing to do.
	
	
	In the Local Court the Crown relied on an affidavit of Ms Manolakos affirmed on 3 October 2014, which became exhibit 3 in the Local Court and is exhibit 4 before me. In it Ms Manolakos refers to attending court on 4 and 11 February 2014 and on 8 and 22 April 2014. Her referral to 8 April is clearly a reference to 7 April, as the court records clearly show the mention was on 7 April. After 22 April the next court appearance was the date when the matter was listed for hearing, 13 May 2014. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Ms Manolakos’ affidavit are these:
	


“7. On or about 8 May 2014 I had discussions with Detective Sergeant Joerdens from Kogarah police whereupon Mr Assi was willing to plead guilty to the offences. This would enable us to seek an adjournment so that an adjournment could be obtained to enable Mr Assi to provide a statement in another matter relating to a financier known as Mr Lazar, who was being charged with serious criminal [offences] relating to financial fraud. I recall the detective agreed that an application would be made to the court for the adjournment and a letter of comfort could be provided to the court so as to make Mr Assi’s sentencing options easier. Mr Assi provided me with instructions to proceed with this approach.

8. On 13 May 2014 at Burwood Court the matter was then set down for sentencing on 5 August 2014 and Mr Assi’s bail reporting was reduced to one day per week (i.e. Mondays). Mr Assi instructed Ms Manolakos after lengthy discussions to enter the plea.”


	
	As could be expected the Crown sought to cross-examine Mr Assi on his affidavit and the applicant sought to cross-examine Ms Manolakos on her affidavit. According to the applicant’s evidence-in-chief Ms Manolakos was late arriving at court on 13 May. He went on to say this:
	


“No, we didn’t have a lengthy discussion actually, we were waiting for her, she was late that day. When we came into the Court she said the best option you have to plead guilty and maybe I can get some time and then we wait for Mr Lazar to be charged and we can drop the charges. Said to me, yeah, if we do the, only five minute job, yeah.”

He went on to say that Ms Manolakos turned up at 10.10 or 10.15am, that the conversation was only two minutes long and that Ms Manolakos did not on that occasion go through the elements of the offences with which the applicant had been charged prior to receiving his instructions to plead guilty. According to the evidence given in-chief by the applicant what occurred at court on 13 May was done in a hurry and merely done to “buy some time”. In cross-examination the applicant protested that Ms Manolakos advised him to change his plea “without even telling what’s the consequences of it”. He said later in his evidence that he was confused by Ms Manolakos and that she “was never clear about anything” that she said to him. Later in cross-examination the applicant agreed that he had previously been charged with having goods in custody for which he received the benefit of s 10, that he was also charged with demanding property with menaces, for which he received a suspended sentence in the Local Court. He agreed that in respect of those offences he had used a solicitor and indeed that the suspended sentence matter was a matter that eventually came before this Court. Later in cross-examination, when pressed about his knowing that if he pleaded guilty it meant that he was not innocent the applicant said that he was advised by Ms Manolakos that as he had got some of the proceeds of the fraud that meant that he was guilty. He also referred to being “confused”. This exchange also occurred:

“Q. You pleaded guilty because you intended on providing information to the police that would assist police in their charges or the matter against Mr Lazar?

A. Yeah.

Q. By doing so you hoped to receive a lesser sentence?

A. Well, she didn’t explain it to me up to that point back then. She said just plead.”

The applicant was then pressed and adopted a position which ended up with this exchange:

“Q. So you say and you’re standing by that evidence that the only reason you entered the plea is to get an adjournment to argue later?

A. She said to me let’s get an adjournment, postpone it, help the police all because you took money, that’s the whole understanding even though - and then we met her afterwards with Owen, even have a witness when we met her. She said to me, yeah, yeah, you’re not guilty, okay, let’s work about this one first.”

Clearly that answer was not responsive. Later the applicant said this:

“As I said, you can tell I’m so confused because she confused me a bit more and every time I ask her technical question she said, no I have to seek legal advice, I have to seek barrister advice, she confused me. I never get answer from her.”


	
	The applicant then went on to say that he did not know what was meant by the word “deception”, which was a word used in each court attendance notice. Later he said that when he obtained the court attendance notices he did not read them “thoroughly”. This exchange then occurred:
	


“Q. Well, you read the facts and you understood that what the facts were saying was that you applied for a loan and you pretended to be someone else?

A. Yeah, that’s what she told me there, yeah.”


	
	At the foot of p 10 of the transcript of 3 October 2014 and the top of the following page the applicant was taken to the facts sheets that had been provided to him by the police and whether he knew that the police were alleging that prior to April 2009 he had obtained by some unknown means a fraudulent New South Wales driver’s licence and a fraudulent Medicare number in the name of Isaac Hamdan and that the RMS had established that both those forms of identification were fraudulent. He agreed that he knew that and it was part of the Crown case. He also admitted that he was a director of the company ZZ Co Pty Ltd and that he was a director of Dolphin Point Apartments Pty Ltd but he said that he was appointed to both companies by Mr Lazar, which itself is irrelevant, but then said that he did not sign any of the documents involved in obtaining the two loans.
	
	
	Later in cross-examination the applicant gave some evidence which, it has been submitted by the Crown, was incredible. One answer recorded on p 12 commencing at line 32 is this:
	


“That’s under the impression what she told me exactly the and she understand my case, ‘so plead guilty, we know you’re innocent, we’ll make a - because you took money we’ll plead guilty and then we’ll worry about it later’.”

One can understand a lawyer to whom a client protests that he or she is innocent accepting what the client tells the solicitor but continuing to advise that although that may be the subjective view of the client it might be in the client’s best interests to plead guilty in order to obtain a discount on sentence if the evidence against the client is particularly strong. However, it defies belief that a lawyer would tell a client that knowing that he is innocent nevertheless to plead guilty and that things could be later investigated and somehow put right.


	
	It was then suggested to the applicant that he pleaded guilty in order to obtain a reduced sentence. He said this:
	


“No, she never mentioned about lesser sentence, all she saying, we’re hoping they get charged because he did all the fraud, and you get acquitted. She always promise me acquitted.”

It is difficult to see how a lawyer who advised his or her client to plead guilty was promising the same client that he or she would be acquitted. Later this exchange occurred immediately prior to re-examination:

“You instructed Ms Manolakos in as early as April that you intended to plead guilty?

A. How did I instruct her?

Q. You told her, ‘I want to plead guilty’ in April?

A. No, I didn’t tell her to plead guilty.

Q. And you told her to call the police on your account?

A. I told her to call the police to see what’s happening with Ian Lazar’s case and see what - ‘yeah, what can you do with it because I am innocent’ and said to me, ‘let’s plead guilty and then we can [strike] a deal with them’, she try to do something, I thought. I know I’m innocent like I kept saying the same word, ‘I am innocent’. I even took a person with me to that meeting afterwards which...(not transcribable).. to say the case, and she said, ‘yeah, you’re innocent’ and that’s why - she did the same to me with a witness next to me, Owen Salmon”.

It was then pointed out that Mr Salmon never went to Ms Manolakos’ office prior to the entry of the plea of guilty on 13 May 2014.


	
	The protestations of being confused or ignorant or misled appear in my view to be quite inconsistent with the gist of what is contained in the two emails, which I quoted at length, which clearly indicate that the applicant was aware that a plea of guilty had been entered by him, that it was part of a deal between him and the prosecution, the idea being that he would give an undertaking to give evidence or to cooperate with the prosecution in amassing evidence concerning Ian Lazar and obtain a letter of comfort which would give the applicant both a discount for his plea of guilty and a discount for his cooperation with the relevant authorities.
	
	
	The matter is complicated, however, by confusing evidence, and I use those words advisedly, given by Ms Manolakos. Ms Manolakos was admitted to practise in 1991. She is on the Legal Aid criminal lawyers panel and had been on that panel since some time in 2012. She swore that when the applicant became her client she went through each of the facts sheets with the applicant. Those facts sheets would have outlined the elements of each charge. On p 18 this evidence was given:
	


“Q. What did you explain to him about the Court Attendance Notice if anything?

A. I explained to him the charges that he was faced with. I explained to him the seriousness of the matter and the effects of the charges.

Q. Do you recall the words that you used when you explained it to him?

A. No, I wouldn’t recall the exact words.

Q. When you said ‘the nature of the charges’, what do you mean?

A. I explained to him that the charges that he was facing were serious charges, that they do carry a gaol term, but basically he at the beginning of the matter we discussed his options and it was agreed that he would enter a plea of guilty on the basis that he would assist in another matter that was associating [sic] with this matter. On that basis I had a discussion with the detectives at Burwood Court, he was with me at that conference and we agreed that we would enter the plea of guilty on the basis that we would get our discounts in sentencing and our letter to assist in sentencing as well. Mr Assi was present on that occasion and he agreed.”

The important point to glean from that evidence is that there was some meeting involving detectives, Ms Manolakos and the applicant at which it was agreed that the applicant would plead guilty and assist the police with their enquiries clearly concerning Mr Lazar and that he would obtain from the police a letter of comfort which would enable a discount for assistance to authorities to be given to the applicant as well as the usual discount for a plea of guilty.


	
	After that evidence Ms Manolakos was asked to try to date that meeting. Ms Manolakos said that the meeting was in a conference room at the Burwood Local Court. She was asked whether it was on 13 May when the matter was first listed for hearing. She said it was not on one of those days but on a day that the matter was mentioned prior to 13 May. This caused much confusion. Clearly the matter was mentioned before the Local Court on 7 April and 22 April 2014. The upshot of the mention of 22 April 2014 was to set the matter down for hearing with an estimate of two days commencing on 13 May 2014. If there had been a conference at court in April 2014 in which it was agreed that the applicant would plead guilty then there was no need to set the matter down for hearing for two days commencing on 13 May 2014. Later in her evidence- in-chief Ms Manolakos said that the instructions to plead guilty were given either on 7 or 22 April although again she mistook 7 April for the 8 April. Ms Manolakos was then asked this question and gave the answer following:
	


“Q. What did you explain to him, if anything, about pleas of guilty and what they mean?

A. I explained to him that a plea of guilty is accepting the charges, that he was obviously consenting and agreeing that he was - that he had committed the offence.”

She then pointed out that there was a discussion with the applicant about the likely sentence outcome and she said that she had pointed out to the applicant that he could obtain a suspended sentence pursuant to s 12 or an order to perform community services. The confusion arising from Ms Manolakos’ evidence-in-chief was certainly highlighted in cross-examination when she thought that the matter was listed for sentence on 13 May and did not realise it was listed for hearing on 13 and 14 May.


	
	Leaving that matter to one side, the other concerning matter arising from the evidence of Ms Manolakos is this:
	


“Q. I’m suggesting that a conversation on 13 May 2014 took place between yourself and Mr Assi and this is what you said to him:

‘You need to plead guilty because you got the money’?

Did you say that to him?

A. I don’t recall saying that in those exact words.

Q. Could you have said something along those lines?

A. Possibly.

Q. See, you said in the beginning you took Mr Assi through the facts of the matter, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. I’m going to suggest on 13 May that you never explained to him the elements of the offence, did you?

A. I don’t recall that.

Q. Because the learned sergeant asked you, ‘What did you explain when he pleaded guilty?’ and you said that he was accepting the charges and consenting and agreeing that he had committed the offences. Can I suggest that you told him because he’d received the money that therefore he was guilty?

A. I didn’t say that.

Q. Well you don’t recall whether you said that, was the second--

A. I didn’t say that in those exact words.

Q. But at no stage, can I suggest, did you explain to him the elements of the offence in terms of any deception and/or dishonesty?

A. I don’t recall.”


	
	Looking at the evidence holistically it is clear to me that the meeting with the detectives at which the applicant was present when Ms Manolakos discussed the concept of the applicant’s giving assistance to the prosecuting authorities and obtaining a letter of comfort together with an entering a plea of guilty did not take place at Burwood Local Court on a mention date. Indeed, according to Ms Manolakos’ evidence, it occurred on 8 May 2014 when she had a discussion with Sergeant Joerdens from the Kogarah Police. It may well be that the conference took place at Kogarah Court House or even at Kogarah Police Station. Furthermore, this appears to be the same meeting that is deposed to in pars 13 and 14 of the affidavit of the applicant made on 4 September 2014. He discloses these as events on 5 and 6 May involving Ms Manolakos and the police. The evidence suggests strongly to me that there was a meeting sometime in early May 2014 not involved with the court proceedings which was attended by the applicant, Ms Manolakos and probably Detective Sergeant Joerdens and a deal was made, the deal which is referred to in particular in the fifth paragraph of the applicant’s email of 11 August 2014.
	
	
	Still LCM did not canvass the facts at any great length. However, at p 25 line 22 the learned magistrate quoted the fifth paragraph of the email of 11 August 2014 and continued thus:
	


“It seems from the evidence before the Court that he has entered a plea expecting by either assisting the police or getting a letter of comfort to obtain a more lenient sentence, and that is the evidence of his lawyer as well. The emails and the account seem to me to support that view and where there is any conflict between E [sic] and his solicitor I prefer the evidence given by his solicitor.”

The learned magistrate then refers to the affidavit evidence of Ms Manolakos in which she did not accept certain portions of conversation alleged by the applicant in a number of paragraphs of his affidavit. His Honour then continued thus:

“So I do not think the defendant is inexperienced in terms of either business or of his business with the courts. I think he knew what he was doing when he entered the plea, that is to receive a discount or comfort on settlement and that appears to me to be consistent with the evidence of his lawyer and that she explained the seriousness of the matter to him and the sentence options that might be achieved.

I accept the evidence of the lawyer that the plea was entered on his instructions for the purpose of receiving a benefit or a reduction in sentence. She goes further and says that the defendant was himself present during a meeting with detectives, where the plea of guilty was agitated and that claim by her, that he was part of that process, has not been disputed”.

I should point out that insofar as the evidence of Ms Manolakos does refer to there being a meeting involving herself, the applicant and a detective or detectives, or other members of the Police Force, there was no denial, no direct denial of it by the applicant.


	
	Clearly the Magistrate preferred the evidence of Ms Manolakos to the evidence of the applicant. I have not heard the evidence of either of those persons. I am only able to read what they are recorded as having said and it has to be acknowledged that sometimes the recordings themselves can be inaccurate. It is important to bear in mind the limitations that there are upon a judge hearing an appeal under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 where the hearing is confined to documentary evidence. In Charara v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 244 Mason P, with whom Kirby and Hoeben JJ concurred said this:
	


“17. The appeal is to be by way of rehearing on the Local Court transcripts (section 18(1)), obviously supplemented by reference to any exhibits tendered in the Local Court. Fresh evidence may be given by leave, subject to the District Court being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that this should occur (section 18(2)).

18. The District Court is then required to apply the principles governing appeals from a judge sitting without a jury. The judge is to form his or her own judgment of the facts so far as able to do so, i.e. recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court (Bell v Stewart (1920) 28 CLR 412 at 424-5, Paterson v Paterson [1953] 8 CA 74; (1953) 89 CLR 212, Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118).

19. The nature of an appeal ‘by way of rehearing’ has been discussed in many cases. The procedure to be adopted, powers to be exercised and function to be performed must be sought in the language of the particular statute. One thing, however, is clear. The ‘rehearing’ does not involve a completely fresh hearing by the appellate court of all the evidence. That court proceeds on the basis of the record and any fresh evidence that, exceptionally, it admits” [Fox at 118 [22] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ]. Referring to the ‘requirements, and limitations of such an appeal’, their Honours continued (at [23], footnotes omitted):

‘…On the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to ‘give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance’. On the other hand, it must, of necessity, observe the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. These limitations included the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses’ credibility and of the ‘feeling’ of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. Furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. Commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.’

20. In Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Limited [1970] HCA 43; (1970) 124 CLR 192 at 208-9 Windeyer J described a difference between an appeal by way of rehearing on the one hand and a re-trial or hearing de novo on the other in the following terms:

‘The rule…provided that all appeals shall be ‘by way of rehearing’. This does not mean that the appeal is a complete rehearing as a new trial is. It means that the cases to be determined by the Full Court, its members considering for themselves the issues the trial judge had to determine and the effect of the evidence he heard as appearing on the record of the proceedings before him, but applying the law as it was when the appeal is heard not as it was when the trial occurred… [A power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgement that ought to have been given] does not…curtail the recognition or respect an appeal should accord to the decision of the trial judge’.

21. These principles apply equally to an appeal by way of rehearing in a criminal matter where the appeal court has not seen the witnesses (Bell, Barendse v Comptroller-General of Customs (1996) 93 A Crim R 210 at 219-220).

22. The appellate role of the District Court in the present context is further reinforced by the reference to ‘appeal’ in ss 18 and 19 and by the power, conferred by s 20, to determine the appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction or by dismissing the appeal. It is true that the Court moves to the disposition of the appeal by considering the totality of the material before it, including any ‘fresh evidence’ that has been admitted and making up its own mind on the issue of guilt. The prosecutor continues to carry the onus (Gianoutsos at [42] - [43]). As observed in the passages quoted from Fox and Da Costa, the District Court must of necessity observe the ‘natural limitations’ stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcripts record”.

LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The question of the nature of the appeal from the Local Court to this Court was more recently considered in AG v DPP (NSW) [2015] NSWCA 218 at [5], Basten JA pointed out that a judge on appeal is bound to observe the “natural limitations” which arise when appeal is conducted by reference to a documentary record. There appears to be little dispute about that requirement. This authority makes it clear that principles such as those enunciated by the High Court of Australia in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 apply.
	
	
	It is perhaps appropriate to go back to consider what fell from McHugh J in Abalos v The Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167. Commencing at 178 his Honour said:
	


“In SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack [1927] AC 37 at 47, Lord Sumner pointed out that:

‘not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge, and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage, the higher ourt ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the case. The course of the trial and the whole substance of the judgment must be looked at, and the matter does not depend upon question when a witness has been cross-examined to credit or has been pronounced by the judge in terms to be unworthy of it. If his estimate of the man forms in any substantial part of his reasons for his judgment the trial judge’s conclusions of fact should, as I understand the decisions, be let alone’.

Consequently, where a trial judge has made a finding of fact contrary to the evidence of a witness but has made no reference to that evidence, an appellate court cannot act on that evidence to reverse the finding unless it is satisfied ‘that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses, could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge’s conclusion’: Watt or Thomas v Thomas [1947] AC 484 at 488.

In the present case, the learned trial judge’s decision on the issue of supervision was based on the evidence of Mrs Archer. In addition to hearing Mrs Archer giving evidence, her Honour had the great advantage of seeing both a video cassette of Mrs Archer operating the coding machine and the in-court demonstrations of her operating the keyboard. She did not refer to the evidence which Professor Ferguson had given on the issue of supervision. The learned trial judge formed the view that, for a person who performed the work in the manner which Mrs Archer demonstrated, the risk of injury was minimal. Her Honour was not bound to accept the whole of Professor Ferguson’s evidence concerning supervision even if it had the effect which the Court of Appeal thought it had. She accepted his evidence concerning the risk of injury which was inherent in the system and his evidence that he had communicated his views to representatives of the defendant. But she made no express findings about the rest of Professor Ferguson’s evidence or his general reliability as a witness. If there is any inconsistency between Professor Ferguson’s evidence and her Honour’s findings concerning supervision, then she must be taken to have rejected that evidence. Certainly, she seems to have rejected his evidence that the postures adopted were partially dictated by the visual demands of the task and partly by the action required of both hands.

As I pointed out in Jones v Hyde (1989) 63 ALJR 349 at 351, where a trial judge resolves a conflict of evidence between witnesses, the subtle influence of demeanour on his or her determination cannot be overlooked. It does not follow that, because her Honour made no express reference to the demeanour or credibility of either Professor Ferguson or Mrs Archer, demeanour or credibility played no part in her findings on the supervision issue”.


	
	More recently that authority and similar authorities were reviewed in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118. At [26] Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said:
	


“After Warren v Coombes, a series of cases was decided in which this Court reiterated its earlier statements concerning the need for appellate respect for the advantages of trial judges, and especially where their decisions might be affected by the impression about the credibility of witnesses whom the trial judge sees but the appellate court does not. Three important decisions in this regard were Jones v Hyde, Abalos v Australian Postal Commission and Devries v The Australian National Railways Commission. This trilogy of cases did not constitute a departure from established doctrine. The decision was simply a reminder of the limits under which appellate judges typically operate when compared with trial judges.

[27] The continuing application of the corrective expressed in the trilogy of cases was not questioned in this appeal. The cases mentioned remain the instruction of this Court to appellant decision-making throughout Australia.”

McHugh JA revisited the issue at considerable length. His Honour commenced that discussion at [65]. His Honour then said this:

“[66] Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, the other members of the Court, agreed with my judgment. Abalos was applied in Devries v Australian National Railways Commission where Brennan and Gaudron JJ and myself said [(1993) 177 CLR 472 at 479]:

‘More than once in recent years, this Court has pointed out that a finding of fact by a trial judge, based on the credibility of a witness, is not to be set aside because an appellant court thinks that the probabilities of the case are against - even strongly against - that finding of fact. If the trial judge’s finding depends to any substantial degree on the credibility of the witness, the finding must stand unless it can be shown that the trial judge ‘has failed to use or has improperly misused his advantage’ or has acted on evidence which was ‘inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence’ or which was ‘glaringly improbable’.’

[67] There was nothing novel about these statements. They derive from principles in decisions of this Court and the House of Lords stretching back over the best part of a century.”

Between [68] and [89] his Honour then considered those authorities. His Honour then said this:

“[90] It is a serious mistake to think that anything said in Abalos or Devries necessarily prevents an appellant court from reversing a trial judge’s finding when it is based, expressly or inferentially, on demeanour. Those cases recognise - in accordance with a long line of authority - that it may be done. But there must be something that points decisively and not merely persuasively to error on the part of the trial judge in acting on his or her impressions of the witness or witnesses. Recently in State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Limited (in liq) (1999) 73 ALJR 306, for example, this Court held that undisputed and documentary evidence was so convincing that no reliance on the demeanour of witnesses could rebut it.

[91] Legal doctrine is most likely to command the respect of the profession and, consequently, the public when it evolves by processes of induction and deduction on the experience of decided cases and the application of established legal principles to cover new situations. To now reject the doctrines to which Abalos and Devries in effect would be a revolutionary, not an evolutionary step.”


	
	I ask myself in the current application, is there anything that points decisively to error on behalf of Magistrate Still and to that question I answer, no. Indeed the extended view of the facts into which I entered earlier in these reasons points me to exactly the same conclusion as that reached by the learned Magistrate. Furthermore there was nothing in my view improper or unacceptable in the learned Magistrate referring to the fact that he did not believe the current applicant was “inexperienced” in either the commercial sense or as regards the law. Clearly the appellant had spent either five, and on another view of his evidence, 6 years working with and under Mr Lazar in various commercial undertakings and the appellant’s own experience of the criminal law points to his having an understanding of the whole process, as indeed significantly does the email of 11 August 2014 upon which both the learned Magistrate and I relied.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that his Honour misdirected himself in point of law. Those directions he commenced towards the end of his judgment at p 26 line 8 of the transcript of 3 October 2014. I myself have recently had to consider the same law in Hollingsworth v Bushby [2014] NSWDC 101 from which there was an unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal. I reviewed the relevant legal principles between [24] and [26]. It is to be borne in mind that the onus lies upon the applicant to demonstrate that leave should be granted to him to withdraw his plea of guilty. The applicant must establish a good and substantial reason for the Court taking the course of granting him leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. An application to withdraw a plea of guilty is to be approached with caution bordering on circumspection. The authorities which are cited in particular are the restatement of principles contained in R v Rae (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 380 clearly refer to the situation, which here obtains, of a party agreeing to plead guilty in order to obtain a lesser sentence. The Magistrate accepted the evidence of Ms Manolakos that the applicant decided to enter a plea of guilty knowing what it involved in order to obtain a discounted sentence. There is nothing to suggest that the decision made by the applicant was not initially made consciously with the prospect of perceived advantage, nor does the evidence as accepted by the Magistrate suggest that the applicant did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt. Indeed, Ms Manolakos said that he did acknowledge that he was guilty.
	
	
	The assertion by the applicant that he thought he was guilty merely because he had been told by Ms Manolakos that he was guilty because he had received the benefit of money, appears with the utmost respect to be ex post facto rationalisation, and such can be implied from what the learned Magistrate said.
	
	
	The applicant has the onus of proving error in the decision of Magistrate Still. As found by the learned Magistrate, his decision was made freely and voluntarily. That was the evidence of the solicitor which his Honour accepted. No real grounds had been established to warrant the interference of this Court in the decision reached by the learned Magistrate. The application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed.

		29 January 2016",2015-09-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767836,Harkins v R [2015] NSWCCA 263,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: By a judgment dated 8 August 2014 a District Court judge, sitting without a jury, convicted the appellant of an offence that on 27 July 2013 in Alexandria, New South Wales, he “used an offensive instrument, namely a motor vehicle, with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself” (see s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). He was acquitted of a similar charge relating to an earlier incident but pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, an offence of driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, whilst another person was in the motor vehicle (see s 154C(1)).
	
	
	The appellant appeals (or in the case of the first ground, seeks leave to appeal) against the first conviction on the following grounds:
	


“1.   The learned trial judge’s verdict on count two was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

2.   His Honour erred in holding intoxication was irrelevant to the issue of whether or not the appellant used the vehicle as an offensive instrument.

3.   Should the conviction verdict on count two be quashed, it is submitted that the appellant should be resentenced on count three.”


	
	Ground Three only arises for consideration in the event that the appellant is successful on one of his other grounds. For the reasons appearing below, I consider that leave to appeal should be refused in respect of Ground One and that the appeal on Ground Two should be dismissed.
	


THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL

Constable Conroy’s Evidence


	
	Constable Brendan Conroy gave evidence that on the evening of 27 July 2013 he and Constable Karina Stennett responded to an emergency call regarding an attempted break-in in the Alexandria area. They identified a gold sedan vehicle that they thought might contain the suspect when it stopped at a set of traffic lights. The driver (Mr Adam Toutou) got out of the vehicle and told the police officers that “he’s in there”, pointing to his vehicle. The officers saw a person, now known to be the appellant, climbing from the back seat into the front seat of the vehicle and attempting to start it, with a passenger (Mr Malcolm Nelson) endeavouring to stop the appellant both entering the front seat and starting the engine.
	
	
	Constable Conroy continued:
	


“16.   I grabbed the accused’s right arm using my left hand to remove him from the vehicle and also attempted a number of times to turn the gold sedan off with my right hand. The accused was sweating profusely, his skin was cold and clammy. At this time I could see Constable Stennett also had hold of the accused. The accused, using his right hand, grabbed my right arm in an attempt to stop me from turning the vehicle off, attempting to force my hand away from the ignition. The accused then struck my right arm a number of times.

17.   The gold sedan began to rev loudly and jumped forward a number of times knocking me off my feet as it jumped. At this time my hand was still on the key of the vehicle, the accused’s arm had hold of my arm to attempt to remove my arm and the door had closed on me. I was then dragged with the vehicle for about 10 metres before the accused let go of my right arm. I managed to regain my footing, leaning on the door and began running alongside the vehicle before coming free from the vehicle. As I came free from the vehicle the vehicle was veering right. I ran to the right, taking evasive action to avoid being hit by the rear tyre of the vehicle and also the door as it shut closed with the vehicle’s momentum. I quickly looked back to make sure that Constable Stennett was ok” (Police Statement, 28 July 2013).

Constable Stennett’s evidence


	
	Constable Stennett gave the following evidence:
	


“Constable Conroy had alighted from the police vehicle and made his way to the driver’s door of the gold sedan. I called, ‘urgent’, several times from the car radio. I alighted from the vehicle and made my way to the driver’s side of the vehicle with Constable Conroy.

Constable Conroy had hold of the right hand of the male. The male whom I now know to be the accused, Aaron Harkins, was sweating profusely. I heard Constable Conroy speak, ‘it is the police, get out of the car, stop the car’. I heard a loud revving noise and observed the accused put the vehicle into first gear. The vehicle was bunny hopping in a forward motion. Constable Conroy and I still had hold of the right arm of the accused. The accused was hitting Constable Conroy in an attempt to free himself. Constable Conroy had made several attempts to pull the keys from the ignition. The accused managed to accelerate the vehicle by holding his right foot on it. I jumped out of the way, avoiding the rear tyre of the vehicle. Constable Conroy was being dragged up … alongside the vehicle. This action became dangerous. Constable Conroy let the accused go. Constable Conroy had been dragged alongside the vehicle for approximately 10 metres” (Transcript, 26 June 2014, p 58).

Mr Toutou’s evidence


	
	Mr Toutou gave the following evidence:
	


“12   … by this time [when the police ran towards the vehicle] the male in the back seat of my car had got in the driver’s seat by jumping through between the seats. The male was trying to drive off. Malcolm was trying to wrestle him and stop him from taking the car. The police officers ran around to the driver’s side of my car. The driver’s door was still open. The police officers were trying to pull the male out of the car. The male had his foot on the accelerator. The wheels started to spinning [sic] and he has taken off straight through a red light and just missed t-boning another car travelling along Swanson Street. Malcolm was still in the front passenger seat of my car. My car turned left onto Swanson Street and was fish tailing before crashing through and [sic] post box and into the wall of a house’” (Witness Statement, 27 July 2013).

Mr Nelson’s evidence


	
	Mr Nelson gave the following evidence:
	


“6   There was a cop van behind us while we were stopped at the red light. Adam jumped out of the car I stayed in the car, the man got out of the back seat out the door and jumped into the front seat. I was trying to push him out and Adam was at the driver’s side door trying to pull him out. The driver’s side door was open. There were two police officers trying to get him out of the car as well. The man had his foot on the accelerator and drove the car left onto Swanson Street. The car went onto the wrong side of the road, there was a car coming toward us” (Witness Statement, 27 July 2013).

The appellant’s evidence


	
	The trial judge summarised the appellant’s evidence as follows:
	


“[The appellant] says that he climbed through the centre console to get into the driver’s seat; this was the quickest way he could enter the driver’s seat to make his escape. Mr Nelson was attempting to push him back as he did this but clearly he was unsuccessful. He said he wedged himself with his left foot in the driver’s seat so that he could not be moved by anyone. He could not say whether the door was open or closed but appears to accept from what was said beforehand that the door must have been open. He was being pulled to the right from the car:

‘They’re grabbing my arm, they’re grabbing my shoulder. All the while this is going on you’ve got the bloke in the passenger seat trying to pull me out through – like out of his way so I’m effectively wrestling with this bloke and the other people here.’

He did not know how many people were there. I noted that when he said this, the accused pointed to his right. He said his focus was getting the car into drive and the park brake off and that he was frightened. He did not look at the people to his right. His focus was on the windscreen. He said he had a fair idea the people were the police. He said he was trying to get the park brake off and the car into gear and his left foot was pushing to lock him against the seat. The car was in low gear. He could not say whether he did that deliberately. He had no memory of the vehicle bunny hoping [sic] as described by the police officers but he said that he was not saying that that did not happen, only that it was unlikely.

[H]e said he was stopping the constable from turning off the car. He was trying to move his hand away; that is what he thought the constable was trying to do. He denied trying to knock the constable over or drag him along or hit him with the back of the car or run over the constable’s feet. He saw no-one being dragged; they were just using their arms. Then he described what happened after he drove off and the collision” (Judgment pp 36-37 references omitted).

428H   Abolition of common law relating to self-induced intoxication

The common law relating to the effect of intoxication on criminal liability is abolished.”

THE JUDGMENT UNDER APPEAL


	
	The trial judge accepted the Crown’s submission that it needed to prove that the appellant had two forms of intent in order to establish the charged s 33B offence, namely, an intention to use the vehicle in question as an offensive instrument and an intention to prevent his lawful apprehension (Judgment pp 10 – 11). His Honour said that he was satisfied of the existence of the second and that issue had been joined in relation to the existence of the first, with which he then proceeded to deal (Judgment p 11).
	
	
	His Honour quoted the following passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Ireland J agreed) in R v Hamilton [1993] 66 A Crim R 575 at 577:
	


“The noun ‘instrument’, in this context, means a thing with or through which something is being done, or effected. The adjective ‘offensive’ means something that is adopted or used for the purpose of attack. The question whether an object or article is an offensive instrument raises for consideration the nature of the object, the uses of which it is capable, and the intention of the person who is using it on the occasion in question. An object which in its nature and in its ordinary use is not offensive may become an offensive instrument by reason of the use to which a person puts it, and the intention which accompanies such use.”


	
	His Honour then referred to a number of cases, including Hamilton, in which an offender was convicted of the relevant offence after driving threateningly towards someone.
	
	
	His Honour said that each of the alternatives listed in subsection (c) of the “offensive weapon or instrument” definition in s 4 of the Crimes Act (see [10] above), requires first “that the accused turned his mind to the use he intended, threatened or executed and [secondly] that he in fact intended to use or to threaten the use of the vehicle as an offensive instrument” (Judgment p 20).
	
	
	His Honour found that the appellant was intoxicated at the relevant time and that the intoxication was self-induced. His Honour continued:
	


“The provisions in Part 11A are concerned with crimes of specific intent, and by force of s 428C, the use to which the question of intoxication may be put is with regard to the intention to cause the specific result necessary to prove the offence of specific intent. In my judgment a plain reading of the legislation leads to no other conclusion and in the circumstances the intoxication of the accused at the time is not a relevant consideration with regard to the use to which he put the vehicle” (Judgment p 24).


	
	After referring to Constable Conroy’s evidence (see [5] above]), his Honour concluded:
	


“Upon that description I have no doubt that the accused used the vehicle as an offensive instrument and I make that finding regardless of the direction of the vehicle moving to the right as described by Constable Conroy. Whether the vehicle had veered to the right or was driven forward, whilst his arm was within the vehicle and the accused was attempting to strike his arm to have him withdraw it, those circumstances in my view lead to the only rational conclusion that he was using the vehicle as an offensive weapon for this specific intent charged” (Judgment p 35).


	
	His Honour then reached the following conclusion as to the applicant’s guilt:
	


“I have brought to account the time over which this interaction occurred before the vehicle made off, the contact between the accused and the police officers as they sought on one hand to have the motor turned off and the other to take hold of the accused, and his decision to drive the vehicle forward to avoid apprehension. From the circumstances, as I have said, I have no doubt that the only rational conclusion to draw is that he was using the vehicle as an offensive instrument and in respect of that matter I am satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt” (Judgment p 37).

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL – GROUND ONE: UNREASONABLE VERDICT


	
	In support of this ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that, unlike the position in the cases to which the trial judge referred, there was no evidence that the appellant was “driving at” anyone. To the contrary, he submitted, “all the evidence was to the effect that [he] was driving, or attempting to drive, away from” Constable Conroy (Appellant’s Written Submissions [75]). The appellant contended that, because of the struggle over the steering wheel that was occurring, the Crown had not established “that the appellant was ‘in control of the motor vehicle’ in the sense that phrase is used in Hamilton” and that it was therefore not “open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant was deliberately steering to his right” and thus towards the police (ibid [82], [84]).
	
	
	However, the trial judge did not base his conclusion that the appellant used the vehicle as an offensive instrument upon a finding that the appellant was in control of the steering wheel and attempting to steer the vehicle to the right, and therefore towards Constable Conroy. Instead, his Honour’s conclusion was expressly stated to be “regardless of the direction of the vehicle moving to the right as described by Constable Conroy” (see [16] above).
	
	
	The trial judge appears to have concluded that the appellant used the vehicle as an offensive instrument because he accelerated for the purpose of breaking Constables Conroy and Stennett’s grips, or attempted grips, on him regardless of whether he also had control of steering the vehicle’s direction.
	
	
	The evidence supports this conclusion. Constable Conroy’s evidence, which was corroborated by the other witnesses, was that he had hold of the appellant’s right arm with his left hand and attempted to remove the appellant from the vehicle whilst also attempting to turn off the ignition with his right hand. Constable Stennett also had hold of the accused and, from the other side, Mr Nelson tried to push the appellant out of the vehicle. Whilst this was occurring the appellant pressed the accelerator with his right foot causing the vehicle to move forward, perhaps somewhat to the right.
	
	
	As the trial judge found, the appellant did this in order to evade apprehension. Indeed, the appellant admitted as much in his evidence in chief when, in response to a question as to what was going through his head at that time, he answered: “I’ve got to get away. I’ve got to get out of here. I’ve got to get away” (Transcript, 1 July 2014, p 148). He denied that he was attempting to knock Constable Conroy over, drag him along, hit him with the back of the car or run over his foot (ibid p 149). In order to evade apprehension, the appellant clearly needed to break free from the police officers’ holds. His intention to evade apprehension therefore encompassed the more immediate purpose of wresting himself free.
	
	
	By accelerating the vehicle, he successfully used it to break himself free of the police officers’ holds. In my view, that constituted the appellant’s use of the vehicle as “an offensive weapon” regardless of the fact that he may not have intended that use to harm the police officers.
	
	
	Whilst the use of an offensive weapon is most commonly accompanied by an intent to injure or threaten someone, the expression has a broad meaning that encompasses what occurred in this case, namely, using an instrument in a positive fashion to achieve an object which, in the case of s 33B, is the prevention or hindrance of lawful apprehension. Thus “[t]o go on the offensive” is an expression commonly used in sporting and other fields to refer to positive action to achieve an objective. An intention to harm is not required. Use of an offensive weapon or instrument can therefore occur without an intent to cause or threaten harm. The following parts of the Oxford English Dictionary definition of “offensive” are consistent with this approach:
	


“The position or attitude of attack; aggressive action; an aggressive act; forceful or aggressive action or movement directed towards a particular end, a sustained campaign or effort.”

DETERMINATION OF THE APPEAL – GROUND 2: INTOXICATION


	
	In support of this ground, the appellant submitted that s 428C of the Crimes Act (see [10] above) rendered the appellant’s intoxication relevant to a consideration of whether or not the appellant used the subject vehicle as an offensive instrument because of s 428B(2)’s classification of an offence under s 33B as an offence of “specific intent”.
	
	
	In response, the Crown adopted the trial judge’s view that s 428C was instead only concerned with an intention to cause a specific result which, in the case of s 33B, is the prevention or hindrance of lawful apprehension.
	
	
	As Brennan J observed in He Kaw Teh v The Queen [1985] HCA 43; 157 CLR 523 at 566:
	


“It is now firmly established that mens rea is an essential element in every statutory offence unless, having regard to the language of the statute and to its subject matter, it is excluded expressly or by implication”(citations omitted).


	
	Brennan J went on to distinguish between the concepts of voluntariness, general intent and specific intent as follows:
	


“Judicial examination of the distinction between the various forms of mens rea has not been extensive. Thus, Barwick C.J. who had noted in O'Connor that mens rea ordinarily requires a general or basic intent at least to do the physical act involved in the crime charged, observed in Ryan that -

‘ ... there has not been any frequent need to express with technically expressed precision the difference between that element of mens rea which relates the will to act to the deed in question and that element which relates to it the general intent with which that will was exercised.’

Nonetheless, voluntariness and general intent are distinct mental states. General intent and specific intent are also distinct mental states. General or basic intent relates to the doing of the act involved in an offence; special or specific intent relates the results caused by the act done. In statutory offences, general or basic intent is an intent to do an act of the character prescribed by the statute creating the offence; special or specific intent is an intent to cause the results to which the intent is expressed to relate” (at 569-570 citations omitted).


	
	Mason CJ, Brennan J and McHugh J in The Queen v Falconer [1990] HCA 49; 171 CLR 30 at 39 and the plurality in The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at [24] approved of Brennan J’s discussion of this topic.
	
	
	The Honourable Paul Whelan referred to these concepts in his Second Reading Speech preceding the introduction of Part 11A (which is concerned with intoxication) into the Crimes Act (as quoted in R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; 55 NSWLR 80 below). The Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) permits consideration of Second Reading Speeches where doing so will assist in ascertaining the meaning of a statutory provision (see ss 34(1), 34(2)(f)). Mr Whelan said:
	


“The present law in New South Wales is that a person charged with a criminal offence, including murder, might be acquitted altogether if there is evidence that the accused was so intoxicated at the time of committing the act that there was a reasonable doubt whether the accused had acted intentionally or voluntarily. This reflects the common law as stated by the High Court in The Queen v O'Connor [1980] HCA 17; 146 CLR 64. It reflects the principle that a person should not be held criminally responsible for an act in the absence of proof that the accused acted voluntarily and with the required mental element for an offence. This is also the law in the other common law jurisdictions of Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

By contrast, in the case of Regina v Majewski [1977] AC 443, the House of Lords in England held that evidence of self-induced intoxication may be considered in relation to offences of specific intent only, and cannot be considered in relation to offences of basic intent. The Majewski approach reflects generally the position in the code jurisdictions, as well as Canada and the United States of America. An offence of basic intent is an offence which simply requires an intention to perform some act – such as striking a person – rather than one requiring an intention to bring about some consequences, such as striking a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. An offence of specific intent is thus one involving an additional purposive element, that is, a specific purpose or an intention to achieve a particular result. Murder is such an offence. It requires proof that the accused acted with an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. By contrast, an offence of basic intent requires proof only that the accused intended to commit the act proscribed. Manslaughter is such an offence. It requires proof only that the accused committed an unlawful or dangerous act”.


	
	Mr Whelan then referred to the new legislation as incorporating the Majewski approach.
	
	
	In the terminology of He Kaw Teh, reflected in Mr Whelan’s speech, the requirement under s 33B that the accused intended “to prevent or hinder lawful apprehension or detention” is a requirement of specific intent because the relevant intention is to cause a particular result. Understandably, s 33B is therefore characterised by s 428B(2) as an offence of specific intent.
	
	
	As the trial judge in the present case pointed out, another type of intent must also be proved under s 33B, namely, to use something as an offensive instrument. This is a “general or basic intent” relating to the doing of the act in question. As Brennan J pointed out in He Kaw Teh, “proof of an actual desire or wish to do an act of the prescribed character is proof of a general intent” (at 570). As his Honour also pointed out in the passage quoted in [28] above, the need to prove such a general intent is distinct from the additional requirement that the relevant act be voluntary.
	
	
	The question that remains is how, if at all, Part 11A deals with this basic or general intent element of a provision that also requires proof of a specific intent and that is characterised as creating an offence of specific intent. Section 428C does not address this question, at least not expressly, as it is only concerned with the relevance of intoxication in determining whether the accused had “the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent”. This does not encompass the basic or general element of s 33B to which I have referred.
	
	
	Nor does s 428D, at least not expressly, address this question because that section concerns the determination of “whether a person had the mens rea for an offence other than an offence of specific intent”. Section 33B however creates an offence that is of specific intent.
	
	
	Furthermore, s 428G does not assist in answering the question because it is concerned with the determination of whether the relevant conduct was voluntary. As Brennan J pointed out in He Kaw Teh, voluntariness and basic or general intent are distinct concepts (see [28] above).
	
	
	Section 428H is similarly unhelpful, although in stating that the common law relating to the effect of intoxication on criminal liability is “abolished” it indicates that recourse cannot be had in answering the present question to the common law principle stated in The Queen v O’Connor [1980] HCA 17; 146 CLR 64 that evidence of self-induced intoxication is relevant in determining whether a person accused of a criminal offence had the mental element prescribed in respect of that offence.
	
	
	In my view, the reasoning that leads to the correct answer to the present question is as follows.
	
	
	Considered as a whole, Part 11A manifests a legislative intention to preclude intoxication from being taken into account except in the circumstances identified in that Part. This is most clearly evident from s 428H which, as discussed above, abolishes the common law principle allowing intoxication to be taken into account in determining criminal liability. Mr Whelan’s Second Reading Speech provides further evidence of this policy (see [30] above). The only exception to the policy is that stated in s 428C which permits intoxication to be taken into account in determining “whether the person had the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent”. For the reasons given above, the intention presently in question, namely, to use the vehicle as an offensive instrument, is not intention of that type, although the intention to which s 33B also refers, namely, of preventing or hindering lawful apprehension or detention, is. However, that latter intention is not in issue as the trial judge’s finding that it was present was not challenged.
	
	
	Part 11A does not expressly prohibit regard to intoxication in respect of the basic or general intent presently in question because s 428D only applies to “an offence other than an offence of specific intent” and s 33B is an offence of specific intent. Nevertheless, Part 11A impliedly achieves that result because, as I have said, it manifests a legislative intention to prohibit regard to intoxication except where specifically permitted by the Part, with no such specific permission being presently relevant. As a result, the trial judge was correct in concluding that the appellant’s intoxication was irrelevant to the determination of whether he had the basic or general intent of using the vehicle as an offensive instrument. While any ambiguity that remains after applying the ordinary rules of statutory construction should be resolved in the appellant’s favour because the Crimes Act is a penal statute (Barker v The Queen [1983] HCA 18; 153 CLR 338 at 355), in my view no such ambiguity exists.
	
	
	R v Grant is not inconsistent with this conclusion. In that case, the Crown’s case that the appellant was guilty of murder was left to the jury to decide on the basis of whether he had a specific intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, or on the alternative basis of reckless indifference to human life. Following conviction, the appellant’s appeal was allowed because this Court found that the trial judge had misdirected the jury that the appellant’s intoxication, whilst relevant to the formation of a specific intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, was not relevant to the issue of whether the appellant was recklessly indifferent to human life.
	
	
	The Court held that murder, in all its forms, came within the ambit of s 428C of the Crimes Act. Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) concluded as follows:
	


“97   Bearing in mind the existence of the express provision (s 428E) relating to the offence of manslaughter, which prevents an accused, whose intoxication is self induced, from escaping criminal responsibility (as might formerly have occurred), the potential complexity for a jury where a case is left upon the alternative bases of specific intent, and reckless indifference and/or manslaughter, the comparable degree of heinousness which attaches to murder however committed, the nature of the malice aforethought involved, and the terms in which s 428B(2) is framed, I have reached the conclusion that the legislature should be taken as having intended that murder, in all of its forms, should come within the operation of s 428C. Had it been intended to apply a distributive effect to it, so that s 428C was applicable only to murder dependent upon intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, then it might have been expected that it would have been included in part (b) of the table to s 428B(2), rather than in part(a)”.


	
	As is apparent from this paragraph, his Honour relied upon a number of presently irrelevant matters including s 428E’s express provision relating to the offence of manslaughter, the “comparable degree of heinousness which attaches to murder however committed” and “the nature of the malice aforethought involved”. His Honour’s reference to “potential complexity” may have some analogy to the present case. However, that analogy is limited because a jury should not have any significant difficulty in following instructions that relate, on one hand, to a general intention to use an offensive weapon or instrument and, on another, to an intention to achieve the result of preventing or hindering lawful apprehension.
	
	
	Moreover, Wood CJ at CL relied on a reference to “murder” in part (a) of the Table to s 482B(2) as supporting the contention that s 428C was intended to apply to murder in all its forms. The issue is different in relation to s 33B as there are not two distinct, alternative, ways in which the offence can be committed. Rather, the use of an offensive weapon or instrument, as well as the intent to prevent or hinder lawful apprehension, is required in all cases. The simple reference to s 33B in part (a) of the table to s 428B does not therefore have the same significance as the reference to “murder” in that part of the table.
	
	
	I add that had I taken a different view in relation to the appellant’s second ground of appeal and concluded that the trial judge had erred in directing himself that the appellant’s intoxication was irrelevant to the formation of an intent to use the vehicle as an offensive instrument, I would nevertheless have proposed that the appeal be dismissed by reason of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Under that proviso, an appeal may, and indeed should, be dismissed if the appellate court “considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. This proviso is applicable in circumstances such as the present if the appellate court concludes that the trial judge’s erroneous direction “could not have deprived the appellant of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him or her” (Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29 at [15]).
	
	
	I am persuaded that what I assume for present purposes was a misdirection by the trial judge did not deprive the appellant of a fairly open chance of acquittal. There is no challenge to the trial judge’s finding that, notwithstanding the appellant’s intoxication, he intended to prevent or hinder his lawful apprehension or detention. This conclusion was obvious on the evidence at the trial. In the circumstances of this case, that intention necessarily encompassed the appellant’s basic or general intent to use the vehicle as an offensive instrument (assuming the correctness of my conclusion in respect of Ground One of the appeal). Thus, the appellant’s struggle to wrestle free of the police officers’ hold and his pressing of the vehicle’s accelerator were designed to assist him in evading lawful apprehension. They both served not only that purpose but also the more immediate, and entirely consistent, purpose of freeing himself. A finding that the appellant’s intoxication did not prevent him forming the intent to achieve the more immediate purpose, as well as the intent to prevent or hinder his lawful apprehension, would have been inevitable if the trial judge had considered that, as a matter of law, he was able, or bound, to take into account the appellant’s intoxication in determining whether the appellant intended to use the vehicle as an offensive instrument.
	


ORDERS


	
	As neither Ground One nor Ground Two of the appeal has any merit and the appellant accepted that Ground Three would only arise in the event that he was successful on one of his other grounds of appeal, the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Refuse leave to appeal in respect of Ground One.
	
	
	Dismiss the appellant’s application for leave to appeal and appeal.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2767838,Application by Christopher John Laycock under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1429,"Judgment


	
	This is an application brought by Christopher John Laycock under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“CAR Act”) for an inquiry into the sentence imposed on him by the District Court (Williams DCJ) on 5 April 2012.

	The applicant was sentenced to a total aggregate sentence of 7 years 6 months imprisonment. The non-parole period was 4 years 6 months, representing 60% of the head sentence. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 28 September 2016.
	
	
	The applicant applied for leave to appeal against his sentence to the CCA on the basis of six grounds as follows:
	


“1.   His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extra curial punishment suffered by the applicant;

2.   His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extent of delay within the proceedings;

3.   His Honour erred in his consideration of matters irrelevant to sentencing by having regard to factual errors and failing to have regard to omitted facts;

4.   His Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extent of assistance given by the appellant to authorities and applying an overall reflective discount;

5.   His Honour erred in failing to apply proper and correct principles of parity in respect of co-offenders; and

6.   The sentence is manifestly excessive.”


	
	The Court allowed leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal, finding that none of the six grounds were made out.
	
	
	The applicant in his present application does not press the issue of delay or the manner in which the issue of assistance was dealt with by the sentencing judge (Grounds 2 and 4 in the CCA appeal). The remaining grounds are linked, with the exception of Ground 1. The applicant’s contention is, broadly, that the sentence he received was the result of the sentencing judge proceeding on an incorrect factual basis (Ground 3 in the CCA appeal). This is said to have meant that his overall criminality was assessed as higher than it would have otherwise been, which in turn resulted in a sentence which was manifestly excessive (Ground 6 in the CCA appeal). The alleged factual errors are said by the applicant to have also infected the sentencing judge’s approach to the question of parity (Ground 5 in the CCA appeal). The crux of the applicant’s claim is that the sentencing judge relied upon a document tendered at the sentence hearing by the Crown entitled “Agreed Facts on Sentence” which was not, in fact, what had been agreed to. In his present application the applicant also asserts failure by the sentencing judge to take into account extra-curial punishment, namely, the loss of the applicant’s family home (Ground 1 in the CCA appeal).
	
	
	Applications under s 78 CAR Act
	
	
	Part 7 of the CAR Act is entitled “Review of Convictions and Sentences”.  Section 78 appears under Division 3 of that Part and provides:
	


78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1)   An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2)   The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.


	
	Section 79 is in the following terms:
	


79 Consideration of applications

(1)   After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a)   the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b)   the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2)   Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3)   The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a)   it appears that the matter:

(i)   has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii)   has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii)   has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv)   has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b)   the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)   The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:

(a)   the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or

(b)   the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or

(c)   the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.

(3B)   This section does not authorise a direction to be given, or a referral to be made to the Court of Criminal Appeal, if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the grounds for the direction or referral arise only from:

(a)   the fact that the convicted person was:

(i)   questioned under section 24 of the Crime Commission Act 2012, or

(ii)   required under section 24 or 29 of that Act to produce a document or thing, or

(b)   either or both of the following:

(i)   evidence obtained directly from that questioning or requirement,

(ii)   any further information, evidence, document or thing obtained as a result of the questioning or the production of the document or thing.

(4)   Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

(5)   The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).


	
	In accordance with s 79(4), proceedings under the section are not judicial proceedings. They are, rather, in the nature of inquiries and the Court performs an administrative act in considering the application: Application of FD [2015] NSWSC 285 at [4] (Garling J); Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 per Johnson J at [5] referring to Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124].
	
	
	Part 7 of the CAR Act is remedial legislation which was designed to overcome injustices which may occur in the administration of criminal justice: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCA 172; 66 NSWLR 151 at 154 [5], 155 [8] (Spigelman CJ); Milat, Ivan Robert Marko – Application under Section 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 209 at [11] (Johnson J).
	
	
	Section 79(2) is a precondition to the exercise of the power in s 79(1) to take further action in relation to the application. In Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, supra, Johnson J set out the following principles applicable to applications made under s 78:
	


“6   The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].

7   Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19].

8   There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].

Some Other Features of the Jurisdiction

9   The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.

10   The jurisdiction which a judge is exercising under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence. The powers available under s.79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They do not extend to a power to quash convictions or direct acquittals (as the Applicant sought in this case).

11   The nature of the jurisdiction under Part 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application for an order directing an inquiry or referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. To invoke the fresh evidence rule at the ss.78-79 stage (as the Crown submissions of 30 November 2006 suggested by reference to R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 at 93-94) does not sit well with the function being performed. In decisions concerning applications under s.475, it was observed that the fresh evidence rule had no application: Application of Esposito at page 2; Application of Visser at page 3.

12   If the judge refers the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, however, that Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: s.86 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. On an appeal following referral, the test governing the reception of new and fresh evidence on appeal is applicable: R v Johns (2000) 110 A Crim R 149 at 151-153 [4]-[10], 165-169 [41]-[58]; R v Pollock [2005] NSWCCA 316 at [2]-[3], [24]ff.”


	
	The principles referred to by his Honour in Holland have been frequently adopted in relation to s 78 applications: See eg Allan – Application for Inquiry into Conviction and Sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2012] NSWSC 1596 at [5]; Skaf, Bilal – Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 45 at [19]-[22]; Application of Victor Makarov Pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]; Application by Roseanne Beckett pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 1773 at [16]; Application by Ivan Robert Marko Milat pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2014] NSWSC 434 at [7]; Application by Alarn Scott McCormick pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 708 at [5]; Application of FD [2015] NSWSC 285 at [4]. They are applicable to the present case. I am required to consider the application and the material relied upon by the applicant and whether a sense of unease or disquiet arises in relation to the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Background
	
	
	The applicant joined the New South Wales police force in 1989. In 1992 he sustained a back injury at work for which he underwent laminectomies in 1999 and 2001.
	
	
	In December 2000 he became a Detective Sergeant at Burwood Local Area Command. Prior to this he had received a number of awards for his work which led the sentencing judge to observe that he had “clearly earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues and senior officers” (ROS 3). The offending conduct occurred between 4 December 2003 and 8 October 2004 while the applicant was a Detective Sergeant.
	
	
	As noted above, a key concern in this application is whether the sentencing judge proceeded on an incorrect factual basis in considering the offences and their gravity. This arises from the submission by the applicant that the “Agreed Facts” relied on by his Honour were not agreed and were inaccurate. As such, it is useful to consider the facts surrounding each offence as apparently understood by his Honour, noting that some facts are disputed by the applicant. A number of names of offenders, witnesses and victims in the District Court and Court of Criminal Appeal proceedings were suppressed in those proceedings.
	


Count 1: Aggravated Enter of Dwelling House with Intent to Steal and Form 1 Matter (Receiving Stolen Property)


	
	His Honour summarised the facts as follows at ROS 3-4:
	


“The first offence occurred on 4 December 2003…This offence was committed with a former police officer and an associate Chris Walker and X.  Licensing Police had gained information in the course of a firearms inspection that Mr L had a safe that contained, amongst other things, large amounts of cash, apparently being the takings of Mr L’s restaurant. Mr Laycock told (the others) about this information and they agreed to carry out a robbery on Mr L’s premises. To avoid being recognised Mr Laycock waited in a van while Christopher Walker went into the premises pretending, with X, to be police officers. They successfully gained entry on that pretext as well as persuading Mr L to open the safe. They informed Mr L that they were going to take the money that was in the safe to check the serial numbers and then left. The proceeds were shared between the three…”

Count 2: Aggravated Enter of Dwelling House with Intent to Steal and Form 1 Matter (Obtaining a Benefit by Deception)


	
	His Honour summarised the facts surrounding the second offence as follows at ROS 4:
	


“The second offence occurred on 22 July 2004. Police had mounted an operation called Cobalt, using, amongst other things, telephone interception warrants. This covert intelligence revealed a plan by Mr Laycock, Christopher Walker, X and two others [including H] to take money from a criminal called AH. Further observations and intercepts confirmed this plan in regard to AH’s premises, which firmed up to take action on 22 July 2004. On the pretext of executing a search warrant on the premises they confronted him as he left his car in the car park and gained entry to (the) premises. A sum of $20 000 cash was located. After a phone call was made they pretended that a TV in the premises was stolen property and AH was asked how much he was prepared to part with. Mr Laycock and X said “at least 10.” Mr Laycock waited outside while X returned to the unit. Two security guards, one of whom was an undercover police officer, spoke to Mr Laycock, who said that he was there on police business and produced police ID. X returned with $11,000 that he had obtained from AH. The five then left the area and the money was later divided after X had taken $1000 out of that amount which he retained. X gave Mr Laycock an additional $800 from the $1000 retained by him. The Form 1 offence relates to the obtaining of that benefit by deception.”


	
	The reference to “at least 10” in the passage is taken to mean “at least $10,000”. It is apparent that through Operation Cobalt the police were at this point supervising the actions of the applicant and his co-offenders.
	
	
	It is again noted that the applicant disputes certain of the facts stated by his Honour the sentencing judge.
	


Count 3: Unauthorised Accessing of Computer Function with Intent to Commit a Serious Indictable Offence of Larceny


	
	His Honour detailed the third count on the applicant’s indictment at ROS 5-6 as follows:
	


“The third offence occurred on 23 September 2004… Mr Laycock and his associates devised plans to take money from various individuals. One target was LT, who police suspected was running a fraudulent immigration business. Mr Laycock obtained information about her from the police computer system, COPS. Christopher Walker had introduced Mr Laycock to a person who I will refer to as B in 2004 and he acted as a go-between between he and Mr Laycock. Mr Laycock and B discussed a number of plans and targets, some of which involved large sums of money. Mr Laycock said that he could supply names and addresses and other information for the purpose of B and others standing over those persons for reward pretending to be police officers.

On 8 September 2004 Mr Laycock was involved with B discussing an operation. Persons referred to as “the Old Man” and the “Australian couple” were mentioned, but Laycock told B that they had to do LT first. Mr Laycock accessed the COPS system on 23 September 2004 which showed that LT was to attend court on 29 September 2004. He also discussed her case with the officer in charge of her matter. Mr Laycock met B and said they were to confront the Asian woman at her home. He would bring someone, as would B. Discussions with an informer in late September 2004 showed that Mr Laycock and the person called H were desperate for money and again discussed possible sources for obtaining it.

On 27 September 2004 Mr Laycock phoned B to arrange a meeting at 10.30am where it was planned to approach the Asian woman, LT, on 28 September 2004 at her home. A further meeting was arranged for 5pm on 28 September 2004, but Mr Laycock did not attend. He had been served with a summons to give evidence at the Police Integrity Commission for 8 October 2004 because investigators were concerned at what was being planned in regard to [suppressed] and decided to forestall it.”

Count 4: Receiving a Corrupt Reward


	
	The sentencing judge set out the facts surrounding the fourth offence, which occurred on 24 September 2004 and was referred to as the “Regpay Matter” as follows:
	


“In early 2004 intelligence revealed information about child pornography and the New South Wales Police, amongst others, carried out a number of investigations. Mr Laycock was involved in regard to two suspects and was given information about them. On 24 September 2004 Mr Laycock was observed with a person called H.  They went to one of the suspect’s houses. H, pretending to be a police officer, went to the front door and persuaded the suspect to come with him to a laneway where they met with Mr Laycock who also said he was a police officer. The police investigation of the suspect was discussed and he was shown some documents. Mr Laycock and H then solicited money from him and he, that is the suspect, offered $4000. Arrangements were made for payment in cash outside some flats in Concord. Mr Laycock and H attended at 10am. H searched the suspect for listening devices. The suspect handed over $3900 and was advised how to get rid of the evidence on his computer and deal with any questioning. Conversations with a person who is called A, both before and after, confirmed a plan to rip off child pornography suspects, and the payment by the suspect was confirmed by both Mr Laycock and H on the intercepts.

On 25 and 26 September 2004 the suspect got rid of all incriminating evidence by various means. On 27 September 2004 a search warrant was executed on his premises by police other than Mr Laycock, but nothing was found. The suspect appeared calm and unsurprised by the visit. He was not charged, but later made an induced statement to the Police Integrity Commission.” (ROS 6)

Count 5 and Two Form 1 Matters: Lying to Police Integrity Commission


	
	The applicant appeared before the Police Integrity Commission on 8 October 2004. He denied dividing up money with Mr Walker, denied dividing up money with X and denied having a corrupt relationship with the co-offender referred to as H. He later recanted and admitted criminal involvement with the mentioned co-offenders. The applicant was dismissed from the police force shortly after.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	At the sentence hearing on 29 March 2012 a bundle of documents was tendered by the Crown and marked Exhibit 1. This bundle included a table entitled “Summary of Offences” and a 17 page document entitled “Facts on Sentence” (the “Agreed Facts”). Exhibit 2 was tendered by Greg James QC of Counsel for the applicant and included reports of Dr John Roberts dated 23 October 2011 and Dion Bisa dated 20 August 2003, a variety of reports and documents going to the applicant’s character and his service to the police force and some material on protective custody. Exhibit 2 also contained a 30‑page document entitled “Facts on Sentence”. I will deal further with the manner in which these documents were tendered below.
	
	
	The sentencing judge at ROS 2 identified the documents he had before him for the purpose of sentencing. He stated:
	


“There is a detailed agreed statement of facts, Exhibit 1 in these proceedings, together with the Crown’s submissions. Mr Laycock has no criminal record. Other material before me is the defence bundle, Exhibit 2, containing written submissions on sentence, a report of 23 October 2011 by Dr Roberts, a psychiatrist, a report of 20 August 2003 by Mr Beazer [sic – Bisa], a psychologist, material as to prior good character, official Police Service Commendations, a Judicial Commission article on protective custody and a personal background statement by Mr Laycock, together with the family medical background.”


	
	In considering the seriousness of the offence his Honour first observed that the offences would be “significant and serious” aside from the fact that the applicant was a police officer. It was observed at ROS 7 that the applicant had used a position of power and trust to facilitate the offences and that the offences were committed in circumstances where the “victims” were unlikely to complain “because of their own nefarious activities”. In relation to Count 4 his Honour noted at ROS 8 that the actions of the applicant and his co‑offenders had frustrated a police investigation into serious offences involving child pornography.
	
	
	His Honour considered at ROS 8 that:
	


“…the most significant aggravating factor in Mr Laycock’s offending is the twofold breach of trust. Firstly, in regard to the community’s high expectation as to the integrity of the Police Force and its individual officers and secondly, in the fundamental breach of his duties and responsibilities as a police officer both to other police officers, to the Police Force generally as well as to the public.”


	
	Other factors considered by his Honour to increase the gravity of the offences were that a significant amount of planning went into the first four counts, and that the offending was part of a planned and organised criminal undertaking (ROS 11).
	
	
	In terms of the applicant’s subjective case, the sentencing judge relied primarily upon the report of Dr Roberts which he referred to at ROS 9. The report indicated that Mr Laycock had expressed frustration about being deskbound at work because of his back injuries and that he was frustrated with his superiors and “hated to attend work”. The applicant had told Dr Roberts that the reason for his offending was extreme financial difficulties. At ROS 10 the sentencing judge referred to the contents of the report and stated:
	


“Whilst that may provide an explanation for his offending it cannot mitigate it in any way and certainly does not explain the lengths he was prepared to go to in order to achieve financial reward.”


	
	At ROS 11 his Honour referred to the applicant’s prior good character and lack of criminal record. He acknowledged the submission by counsel for the applicant that he was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. It was later stated at ROS 12 that the Crown “concedes his prior good character, his strong family and community ties and prospects of rehabilitation”.
	
	
	His Honour also considered the probability of the sentence being served in custody noting the concession by the Crown that the applicant’s time in custody in segregation would “be more onerous than someone within the general prison population”. His Honour, however, went on to observe:
	


“In some respects, of course, that factor is a two edged sword because most police officers would realise that if they commit a crime and end up in custody their position is going to be substantially different to a similar offender who commits the same offence who is not a police officer.” (ROS 12)


	
	The question of delay was identified as relevant by his Honour at ROS 11 where he stated “I take into account the delay in these matters reaching the stage that they have today in accordance with what was said by Street CJ in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519…” and at ROS 12 where his Honour set out the relevant dates in the proceedings against the applicant.
	
	
	The issue of parity was also considered by the sentencing judge. His Honour stated at ROS 13:
	


“There does not appear to be a meaningful degree of parity between the totality of their (the co-offender’s) offending and the totality of Mr Laycock’s offending. However, I am mindful of the sentences that they received and the parts that they played in regard to Mr Laycock’s offending as well as to the recent High Court decision of Green v R [2011] HCA 49. In regard to that case, objectively it is difficult to see that a realistic comparison can be made between Mr Laycock’s offending and the offending of (the others) particularly having regard to the judgment of Finnane DCJ of 24 May 2010 in regard to Mr Walker which is the only one I have.”


	
	The sentencing judge referred to a number of cases also involving offending by police officers but observed that:
	


“As far as I can tell the pattern of sentencing for such offences, if one exists, has not changed since 2004. I say, ‘if one exists’, because this type of offending is not really conducive to any sort of pattern of sentencing.” (ROS 13)


	
	After outlining some cases his Honour went on to say “These cases are of interest in regard to the principles they espouse rather than any comparability of either offending or sentencing”. The principles espoused brought to light the increased severity of offences committed by police officers exploiting their public office and rank to gain advantages.
	
	
	His Honour allowed a 15% discount for the applicant’s guilty plea and noted that although there was a willingness by the applicant to assist authorities, the utilitarian value of the assistance provided was negligible. It is also apparent from his Remarks that his Honour considered the principle of totality (ROS 16) and reference was made to the likelihood of public opprobrium (ROS 12). The fact that the applicant would be precluded from certain jobs upon release was noted at ROS 11.
	
	
	His Honour considered whether a finding of special circumstances should be made at ROS 15. Although his Honour did not expressly state his finding it is evident from the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence imposed (60%) that a finding of special circumstances was made.
	
	
	I have referred to the indicative sentences for each offence imposed by the sentencing judge above at [2]. As noted above, the applicant was sentenced for a total of 7 years and 6 months with the non-parole period being 4 years and 6 months.
	


The CCA Appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant before the CCA are set out above at [4]. The appellant relied upon written submissions dated 16 July 2014. The Crown relied upon written submissions dated 5 September 2014. The CCA hearing took place on 19 September 2014 on which date the applicant appeared in person. As previously noted, the appeal was dismissed. Adamson J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Fullerton J agreed) dealt with each ground and gave reasons for dismissing each (which I need not reproduce here).
	


Submissions

Applicant’s Submissions


	
	In relation to his application under s 78 CAR Act the applicant relied upon written submissions (28 pages) contained within a folder of material relating to his application.
	
	
	The folder of documents, in addition to the written submissions, contained a number of documents including: (i) copies of transcript of proceedings before the sentencing judge dated 29 March 2012; (ii) the sentencing judge’s Remarks on Sentence dated 5 April 2012; (iii) a copy of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal delivered on 29 September 2014; (iv) the transcript of the hearing before the Court of Criminal Appeal dated 19 September 2014; (v) Exhibit 1 comprising material before the sentencing judge, and (vi) Exhibit 2 entitled “Sentencing Material” also tendered at the sentence hearing.
	
	
	In the applicant’s written submissions in support of the application particular attention was given to the following matters (in the order in which they were addressed):
	


Ground 3 – Alleged errors in fact‑finding

Ground 5 – Alleged disparity between co-offenders

Ground 6 – Alleged manifest excess 

Ground 1 – Alleged failure to take into account extra‑curial punishment


	
	The applicant stated that his submissions in respect of the application are “referenced in accordance with the Grounds of Appeal relied upon in the judgment of CL v R [2014] NSWCCA 196” (Applicant’s Submissions at p 3).
	
	
	I turn to the individual grounds relied upon by the applicant.
	


Ground 3 – Alleged Errors in Fact-Finding


	
	The applicant submitted that the facts relied upon by Williams DCJ were not the Agreed Facts. He contended that Adamson J, a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal which heard his appeal, erred in finding that there was no discernible basis upon which the Agreed Facts, Exhibit 1, ought not to have been accepted by the sentencing judge, or on which their correctness ought to be revisited on the application (Applicant’s Submissions at p 1).
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions then set out a history as to what was said to have been the process or means by which an agreed set of facts was arrived at by himself, his representatives and the Crown (Applicant’s Submissions at pp 4-6).
	
	
	The applicant acknowledged that the relevant references by him to the facts, and now made in support of his present application, were referred to in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (Applicant’s Submissions at p 6).
	
	
	He argued that he had sought to persuade that Court that although the ingredients of the offence had been made out, the objective seriousness had been exacerbated by the inclusion of material which was not factually correct. He submitted that this had not been appreciated by Hoeben CJ at CL who presided at the hearing of his appeal (Applicant’s Submissions at pp 6-7).
	
	
	A further submission was made by the applicant that:
	


“…this omission to consider this issue had the effect of denying the appellant the right to have his appeal dealt with to finality, in that the Court did not make a specific ruling on this ground of appeal” (Applicant’s Submissions at p 7).


	
	The applicant then set out what he contended were the factual errors apparent in Williams DCJ’s Remarks on Sentence (Applicant’s Submissions at pp 7-22).
	
	
	I have examined the submissions made in respect of each asserted error but do not here reproduce in detail the individual comments or submissions made, in particular, at pp 7-9 of the applicant’s Written Submissions. It is sufficient to state that the effect of the submissions made was that an inaccurate account of his role was given and that this heightened his level of criminality which in turn impacted upon the sentence imposed.
	
	
	In addition, the applicant asserted that there had been further “factual errors” which had not been the subject of his written submissions in the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal but which he submitted constituted an error in sentencing. He asserted that such errors had found their way into the document “Exhibit 1” relied upon by the sentencing judge (Applicant’s Submissions at p 9).
	
	
	I have read the submissions made in respect of such alleged factual errors. The ultimate submission was that the alleged errors significantly impacted on the facts adopted in the sentencing process and these, it was argued, formed the foundation of a miscarriage of justice and a flawed sentencing process (Applicant’s Submissions at p 22). The applicant stated in his submissions, at p 22, that he:
	


“…merely seeks that the court intervene to correct this error on face value.”

Crown’s Submissions


	
	The Crown relied upon its written submissions dated 12 February 2015.
	
	
	The Crown’s primary submission was that the application largely repeats submissions raised in support of the grounds relied upon by the applicant before the Court of Criminal Appeal, in particular, the third, fifth, sixth and first grounds of appeal. The Crown submitted that in these circumstances there is no merit to the application.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted:
	


“… the applicant appears unwilling to accept the CCA’s determination, contending that the CCA erred in dismissing these grounds of appeal. The applicant was entitled to apply for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the CCA’s judgment, but no such application was made. The applicant identifies no special facts or circumstances that justify the taking of further action under Part 7 of the Act. Rather, he impermissibly seeks to use s 78 of the Act as another avenue of appeal: Holland at [9] and Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574.” (Crown’s Written Submissions at [19])


	
	The Crown submission accordingly was that the Court should refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application under s 79(3) of the Act upon the basis that the matters it raises have previously been dealt with by the CCA or could have been the subject of an application for special leave to the High Court, and that there are no special facts or circumstances that justify the taking of further action: Crown’s Written Submissions at [20].
	
	
	The Crown, however, sought to address the particular submissions made by the applicant in the event that the Court took the view that it was appropriate to consider the merits of the application. In respect of the matters relied upon by the applicant, the Crown submitted that they do not raise any doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence.
	
	
	The foundational submission made on behalf of the Crown was that the Agreed Facts document (Exhibit 1), contrary to the submissions of the applicant, was a statement that contained the relevant facts for sentencing agreed upon by the parties.
	
	
	Whilst the applicant disputed the Agreed Facts and submitted that they contained a “range of errors”, the Crown observed that the applicant had made lengthy written submissions on this question before the Court of Criminal Appeal, parts of which are replicated in the present application (in particular, those appearing at pages 12-15 of the Applicant’s Written Submission dated 16 July 2014).
	
	
	The Crown extracted from the judgment of Adamson J, observations made by her Honour at [43]-[46] on the question of the Agreed Facts.
	
	
	These paragraphs of the judgment, the Crown contended, addressed fully the applicant’s submissions regarding the alleged errors in fact‑finding. The Crown submitted that the matters asserted by the applicant were considered and dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in dismissing his appeal against sentence: Crown’s Written Submissions at [24].
	
	
	The Crown additionally submitted that if the Court was minded to consider the merits of the ground then in that event the Crown’s position was that the applicant’s claims do not give rise to unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing his sentence to stand: Crown’s Written Submissions at [25]. Reference in this respect was made to the exchange between Senior Counsel for the applicant and the sentencing judge recorded in the transcript concerning the Agreed Facts.
	
	
	I consider it is desirable to reproduce in these reasons relevant extracts of the discussion before the sentencing judge (transcript of 29 March 2012) concerning the Agreed Facts document (Exhibit 1) as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR:   The facts that I have, Mr Crown, are sort of in a strange format.

BOWERS:   Your Honour, the person XX, his name appears mentioned starting at p 15 of those facts.

HIS HONOUR:   I’ll hand back to you the statement of facts that I have.

BOWERS:   It might be that your Honour has an earlier version of that document. There was some refinement.

HIS HONOUR:   I’ll hand back the two documents that were—(T 3)

JAMES:   Your Honour, I should indicate it was more than refinement. One of the submissions we will be making concerns the timing of today’s hearing and how there has been a very lengthy process in relation to charges and in relation to facts, and I’m worried that what your Honour has seen might be an earlier version. It’s not likely to--

HIS HONOUR:   Let me say this, there is a very lengthy document there, a statement of facts, which I haven’t read. All I have read was the summary. I don’t know where the summary came from, but that appears to be some sort of submissions made by the Crown at some stage, which is a much briefer document, it’s only a few pages.

JAMES:   None of that is going to cause your Honour any problem in the upshot because essentially we’re relying on the principles relating to focusing on the facts relevant to the relevant offences. We’ve prepared the written submissions on that basis. I don’t think there’s going to be any real issue between us on the facts.

BOWERS:   Your Honour, I have a different document to tender today. This is a document that was handed up some time ago. In some ways I think it’s got material that actually is a duplicate. I don’t know how that has occurred, but in any event, your Honour, perhaps I could hand up the document on which we’ve settled. I’ll hand that up now, the facts in relation to the matter of Laycock. Your Honour, it’s a 20 page document.

HIS HONOUR:   All right.

JAMES:   It’s different to the one we’ve got.

HIS HONOUR:   Is it possible to go through the facts without handing them up at this point in time, to go through the facts back on the computer or wherever, and, to use a new expression, redact out of the facts the names of the persons you are seeking to suppress, because I have got no doubt that the press at some stage – well people are entitled to know the facts from which this-- (T 4)

…

JAMES:   Your Honour, the facts that my friend is now handing up are probably exactly the same, but for some difference that it causes them to extend for a few lines longer than the one that we’ve got. So I’m speedily having my instructing solicitor check over the facts to make sure that something hasn’t crept back into the final product that was dealt with during the lengthy process of dealing with them otherwise.

DALEY:   I think it’s just a setting out change, but certainly my friend should check. (T 5)

…

JAMES:   Your Honour this matter’s likely to take a while. There’s a great deal of reading. Would it be helpful if we provided now our written submissions to – my instructing solicitor is still going through the statement of facts. What seems to have happened is there’s been a reformatting. I don’t think, as far as we work out so far, it’s likely to lead to any material content change.

CROWN PROSECUTOR:   I can assure my friend there were no material changes to the contents of the document, it’s just a setting out matter your Honour. (T 7-8)

JAMES:   … your Honour we’d now verify that the statement of facts is simply a reformatting of the already agreed facts and the facts are as agreed. Secondly, my friend’s just provided a submission on sentence. On page 11 at about point 8 in the paragraph commencing ‘Question of Delay and Plea of Guilty’.” (T 10)

Consideration

The Question of the Agreed Facts


	
	The applicant’s contentions in relation to the question of the alleged erroneous fact‑finding by the sentencing judge, in essence, assert:
	



	
	That the sentencing judge was in error in relying upon the Agreed Facts (Exhibit 1) when making findings of fact in relation to his culpability in respect of the offences to which he entered guilty pleas.
	
	
	That the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in finding that there was no basis on which the Agreed Facts ought not to have been accepted by the sentencing judge.
	



	
	The applicant’s contentions in respect of these matters are, with respect, misconceived. As to (1), the transcript of evidence (reproduced at [63]) records discussions with the applicant’s senior counsel, Mr James QC, which confirm that Mr James was afforded the opportunity to satisfy himself as to the accuracy of the Agreed Facts, Exhibit 1. Mr James is recorded as having indicated, in the presence of the applicant, that Exhibit 1 accurately recorded the facts that had been agreed upon with the Crown for the purpose of the sentencing hearing, indicating that the facts therein were “… the facts agreed”: T 29 March 2012, at p 10:4-9.
	
	
	As to (2), the issue was fully canvassed in the Court of Criminal Appeal at the hearing of the appeal in that Court on 19 September 2014. As noted in the judgment of Adamson J at [43]:
	


“The facts by reference to which an offender is sentenced must generally be either proved to the requisite standard, admitted or agreed: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54 ; 199 CLR 270; Weininger v R [2003] HCA 14 ; 212 CLR 629; Gas v R; SJK v R [2004] HCA 22 ; 217 CLR 198 at [30]. The Agreed Facts were tendered by consent on the basis that they were agreed. As such they constituted the basis on which the applicant was to be sentenced. The sentencing judge was both entitled, and obliged, to sentence on the basis of the Agreed Facts.”


	
	As noted by the Crown, there was no application by the applicant for Special Leave to appeal the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the High Court.
	
	
	There is, in my opinion, no merit in the applicant’s ground alleging errors in fact-finding by the sentencing judge and there is no basis for asserting error in the judgment of Adamson J.
	
	
	Having considered the applicant’s written submissions asserting error in relation to discrete factual references, I am satisfied that none of the matters raised in his submissions were capable of impacting upon the sentencing determinations, including, in particular, the aggregate sentence imposed. It has been necessary to consider these particular submissions in the context of what were, objectively, extremely serious offences. As discussed below, having regard to the objective seriousness of each of the offences committed by the applicant in breach of trust as a police officer, and taking into account all relevant subjective factors, the individual indicative sentences and the aggregate sentence imposed, were, in my assessment well within the sentencing judge’s discretion.
	
	
	I proceed, notwithstanding the conclusion I have expressed to nonetheless consider some of the specific allegations of factual error advanced by the applicant in support of his application.
	


(i) The Second Offence: 22 July 2004


	
	The sentencing judge as pp 4-5, summarised the factual circumstances constituting the second offence (see [17] above). In the course of doing so, reference was made to the fact that $20,000 in cash was located at the subject premises and that was followed by discussion involving the applicant and his co-offender as to money to be paid to them. The sentencing judge then recorded:
	


“… the five then left the area and the money was later divided after Mr X had taken $1,000 out of that amount which he retained. Mr X gave Mr Laycock an additional $800 from the $1,000 retained by him. The Form 1 offence relates to the obtaining of that benefit by deception.” (p 5)


	
	This matter was addressed in the applicant’s Written Submissions at p 7. He there asserted that no additional money was received by him and there was no mention of this fact in the “facts” forming Exhibit 2 (prepared by his legal advisors) although it was mentioned in the Agreed Facts, Exhibit 1.
	
	
	The statement in the Remarks on Sentence that Mr Walker, the co‑offender, gave the applicant an additional $800 from the $1,000 retained by him, it was asserted, was accordingly said to have been an error.
	
	
	The applicant asserted that an inaccurate account of his role in respect of this aspect (the $800) was given and that this “undoubtedly heightened the level of criminality”. It was stated that the “clear indicator was that the receiving of money (as well as the actual amounts) was a significant consideration”: Applicant’s Submissions at p 7.
	
	
	This matter suffers from the same problem concerning the Agreed Facts, Exhibit 1, discussed above. The reference in the Agreed Facts to the payment of the $800 does not, for the reasons earlier stated, constitute a basis for asserting error by the sentencing judge. Exhibit 1 was accepted as having set out “the facts” for sentencing purposes. I do not here repeat what has been said about Exhibit 1 above.
	
	
	The applicant, in entering a guilty plea to the offence in question, had asked that the additional matter on the Form 1 (namely his receipt of a share of the $10,000 which was stolen and divided by five, as well as the additional $800 received by him) be taken into account on sentencing.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submissions that in the context of the applicant’s share of the $10,000 the amount of $800, in contrast, is a matter of comparatively minor significance. I do not, in any event, as I have stated, consider that error has been established. In the circumstances, there is no basis for any unease or sense of disquiet as to the applicant’s aggregate sentence.
	


(ii) The Third Offence: 23 September 2004


	
	The second matter raised by the applicant concerns a statement made by the sentencing judge in his Remarks on Sentence at p 6 in relation to the third offence that occurred on 23 September 2004. Reference was made by his Honour to a discussion on 8 September 2004 between the applicant and the person identified as “B” in which the “operation” in question was discussed. The sentencing judge observed:
	


“… Mr Laycock met B and said they were to confront the Asian woman at her home. He would bring someone, as would B. Discussions with an informer in late September 2004 showed that Mr Laycock and the person called X were desperate for money and again discussed possible sources for obtaining it.” (p 6)


	
	Again, the applicant relies upon a statement to the effect that this fact, as to his discussions with an informant and desperation for money, was included in Exhibit 1 and not included in Exhibit 2. The applicant claims that he had sought the statement about that matter to be omitted from the Agreed Facts. He further alleges that the Crown consented to its removal but that it was not removed.
	
	
	His contention was that the statement increased his level of criminality and implied desperation, planning and involving others in the commission of offences (conspiracy) which in fact did not form part of the basis upon which he was to be sentenced.
	
	
	As detailed above, the offence committed on 23 September 2004, involved the applicant and his associates devising plans to take money from various individuals. One target was a person who police suspected was running a fraudulent immigration business. The applicant obtained information about her from the police computer system, COPS.
	
	
	There is, in my assessment, no merit in the applicant’s assertion of error in relation to this matter. The sentencing judge was simply identifying an aspect that lay behind the motive for the applicant’s offending behaviour and this could not constitute a basis for a conclusion that the applicant had been sentenced on an incorrect ground or that the matter in question contributed to the already extremely serious nature of the offence in question. Any complaint or grievance on this aspect could not, in my opinion, have constituted a cogent ground of appeal against sentence.
	


(iii) The Fourth Offence: 24 September 2004


	
	In relation to the fourth offence committed on 24 September 2004, (the “Regpay” matter) the sentencing judge set out the relevant facts reproduced above at [21]. The circumstances in which the applicant and his associates solicited money from one particular suspect and the offer of payment of $4,000 was set out in the Remarks on Sentence at pp 6-7. In that context the sentencing judge observed:
	


“… conversations with a person who was called A, both before and after, confirmed a plan to rip-off child pornography suspects, and the payment by the suspect was confirmed by both Mr Laycock and XX on the intercepts.” (p 7)


	
	Again, the applicant asserts that the statement made by the sentencing judge in this respect was contained in Exhibit 1 but not in Exhibit 2. Again he asserted that he had sought its removal and the Crown allegedly consented to the same. He asserted that it was not removed and that it was factually incorrect.
	
	
	The fundamental problem in the applicant asserting error in Exhibit 1 in relation to the above statement by the sentencing judge, suffers from the same problem as other factual errors identified, namely, that Exhibit 1 had been accepted as accurately recording the facts for sentencing the applicant for the fourth offence. This matter having been the subject of a ground of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is no basis for the complaint now made by the applicant. The offence in question was itself objectively extremely serious. The objective seriousness of the offence is evident from the facts constituting it and, in my assessment, there was no error in fact-finding such as to provide a ground of complaint in the present application.
	
	
	In his written submissions in relation to the fourth offence, the applicant also took issue with a remark made by the sentencing judge at p 8 of his Remrks relating to the Regpay matter where his Honour referred to one of the persons target by the applicant and his associates as a “medical practitioner”.
	
	
	The relevant passage in the Remarks on Sentence (p 8) is as follows:
	


“In the case of the Regpay matter not only did he corruptly solicit a benefit, but his and X’s actions frustrated a police investigation into potentially very serious offences involving child pornography and a medical practitioner.”


	
	In the written submissions the applicant contended that the complainant in relation to the offence in question was not a “medical practitioner” but that he had a Doctorate of Science. The contention is that the “medical practitioner” was referred to in the Agreed Facts tendered by the Crown and was an error.
	
	
	The submission was that the statement implies the protection of a person in a position of trust who may have had access to vulnerable persons and the general public at large. It was submitted that it increased the applicant’s criminality and attaches a “stigma” to the offence.
	
	
	This point again encounters the same problem as to the Agreed Facts (Exhibit 1) referred to above.
	
	
	In any event, the matter does not assume any significance having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The factual findings made by the sentencing judge in respect of the fourth offence committed on 24 September 2004 (the Regpay matter), establish that the criminality involved a very high level of objective seriousness. The applicant’s conduct involved not only corrupt solicitation of a personal benefit but actions by him and others designed to frustrate police investigations into what his Honour appropriately termed “potentially very serious offences” involving child pornography. The fact that his Honour added the words “and a medical practitioner” in the context of the facts, in my opinion, adds little, if anything, to the otherwise extremely serious facts constituting the offence.
	
	
	In summary, none of the factual errors asserted by the applicant are made out. The written submissions do not, in my opinion, raise any question of asserted error either in the sentencing process or in the proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The statements of fact to which the applicant takes exception were verified by the Agreed Facts, Exhibit 1 and it is evident that these facts were agreed to by the applicant’s counsel.
	


Alleged Disparity Between Sentences Imposed on Applicant and Co-Offender


	
	The applicant has submitted that the Agreed Facts establish that the objective seriousness or gravity of his offending conduct was similar to that of the co-offender, Mr Walker.
	
	
	This matter was the subject of a ground of appeal heard and determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The judgment of that Court noted the observations of the sentencing judge at [34] and [35] under the subheading “sentences imposed on co-offenders”.
	
	
	Adamson J dealt with the ground (Ground 5) at [51] and [52]. There, the following observations were made:
	


“51   The applicant’s counsel accepted, correctly in my view, that there was no parity between the applicant on the one hand and Mr Walker and the other co-offender on the other because of the substantial difference between the offences with which they were charged. The practical effect of the principles of parity is diminished where different charges are laid (since this is a matter of prosecutorial discretion) or offenders are sentenced on the basis of a different factual substratum (whether agreed or otherwise): Green v R [2011] HCA 49 ; 244 CLR 462 at [30] which approved Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60 ; 77 NSWLR 540 at [203] per Campbell JA; see also Yousif v R [2014] NSWCCA 180 at [26]–[27] per Hoeben CJ at CL, Adamson and Bellew JJ agreeing.

52   The sentencing judge did, however, take into account both the sentences imposed on Mr Walker and also on the co-accused, although only the remarks on sentence in respect of the former were available at the applicant’s sentence hearing. The fifth ground has not been made out.”


	
	I accept, as the Crown has submitted on this application, that the matter was dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal by dismissing Ground 5 and that there are no particular facts or circumstances now identified that would justify reconsideration or review of the matter. The Crown correctly observes at [37] of its written submissions that senior counsel appearing for the applicant conceded at the sentence hearing that there was “not a true, precise, parity equation” between the applicant and his co-offenders and that “the difference in charges [was] significant”. The argument presented was that the difference was “not so much as to produce an unacceptable disparity in treatment arising simply from a difference in treatment by the DPP”: Transcript of sentence hearing on 29 March 2012, at pp 15, 19.
	
	
	The sentencing judge specifically noted that the co-offenders had pleaded guilty to substantially different offences and that objectively it was difficult to see any realistic comparison could be made between the applicant’s offending and that of his co-offenders. It was clear, however, that his Honour was mindful of the relevant parity principles, including those stated by the High Court in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49: Remarks on Sentence at p 13.
	
	
	The applicant has not identified any basis for a conclusion as to any error either by the sentencing judge or by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to parity. The sentencing judge had specific regard to the role played by the co‑offenders in the applicant’s offending.
	
	
	I am of the opinion that this ground is without merit.
	


Sentence Alleged to be Manifestly Excessive


	
	The applicant addressed this ground at [98]‑[119] of his written submissions before the Court of Criminal Appeal in which he contended that the sentences imposed “in isolation of each other” are manifestly excessive. He submitted that the overall sentence should be considered in light of the “… accumulation that was exercised by His Honour”: Applicant’s Written Submissions before the CCA at [98]. In his submissions on this application, the applicant pressed the ground of manifest excess and contended that the CCA had not approached the ground properly.
	
	
	I have earlier expressed the opinion that the indicative and aggregate sentence imposed by the sentence judge fell well within the sentencing discretion. His Honour had regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors.
	
	
	The nature of the offences involved very serious breaches of trust by the applicant. As previously observed, the sentencing judge appropriately summarised the position as follows:
	


“As can be appreciated all these offences would be regarded as significant and serious without the fact that they were committed by a police officer. Mr Laycock used a position of power and trust within the Police Force to commit what are serious criminal offences in the guise of being a police officer, when in the circumstances set out in the facts he had no entitlement to operate in that way. The targeted victims were in most cases persons who would be unlikely to complain about what was going on, because of their own nefarious activities”: Remarks on Sentence at pp 7-8.


	
	A little later his Honour observed:
	


“The most significant aggravating factor in Mr Laycock’s offending is the twofold breach of trust. Firstly, in regard to the community’s high expectation as to the integrity of the Police Force and its individual officers, and secondly, in the fundamental breach of his duties and responsibilities as a police officer both to other police officers, to the Police Force generally as well as to the public. The community rightly looks to the integrity of the Police Force to uphold and protect the law, not to break it …”: Remarks on Sentence at p 8.


	
	Adamson J at [53]‑[66] of her judgment considered the matters relevant in assessing the ground of manifest excess, which requires an applicant to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principle that there is no single “correct” sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325.
	
	
	Her Honour observed at [56] in particular, that there was no error in respect of the first count and that at the time of that offence the applicant was a serving police officer and was the “architect” of the offence.
	
	
	Her Honour addressed the issue of using statistics in respect of the third count at [57], noting that they were of a limited value generally in sentencing and that they were particularly inapposite in the applicant’s case where his moral culpability depended on his position and the surrounding facts.
	
	
	Her Honour dealt with an argument put by the applicant that his conduct was being monitored, that the offending conduct was intercepted before it could run its intended course. Her Honour, understandably observed:
	


“… that he was thwarted by diligent policing does not operate in his favour on sentencing.” (at [58])


	
	At [59] her Honour noted that the Agreed Facts indicated the extent to which the applicant was “… the mastermind of the criminal conduct as well as the extent to which he used the knowledge of the system he had gained in the course of his duties as a police officer …”. Her Honour noted that his offending conduct as a whole involved an abuse of his position as a police officer and this had tended to corrupt the system.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the sentence imposed was not excessive and appropriately reflected the criminality of the offending conduct. Her Honour at [66] addressed the issue of accumulation but noted that there was also a substantial degree of “implicit concurrence”.
	
	
	Again, the applicant’s submissions in the present application seek to establish error in the judgment of Adamson J (and of the Court of Criminal Appeal). However, as has already been observed, no application was made by him for Special Leave to Appeal the judgment of that Court to the High Court.
	
	
	Many of the arguments sought to be advanced on this application were considered and dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In other words the applicant has had a full opportunity to pursue and ventilate such matters at the appellate level. I accept the Crown’s submissions that no special facts or circumstances have been raised in this application that would justify the taking of any further action.
	
	
	Accordingly, in relation to these specific matters raised by the applicant, I consider that they are not matters that contain merit which would cause any unease or raise any question or doubt as to the appropriateness of the aggregate sentence imposed and they should not be further dealt with under s 79(3) of the Act. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered each of the offences and the indicative sentences. It did not merely focus upon the aggregate sentence as the applicant contended.
	
	
	I have concluded that there is no basis for this Court acting under s 79(1) of the Act on the ground of manifest excess.
	


Alleged Failure of the CCA to Consider Extra-Curial Punishment


	
	This ground may be dealt with shortly. As noted in the judgment of Adamson J at [31], the question of extra-curial punishment was a matter considered and taken into account by the sentencing judge. It was also a matter relied upon as Ground 1 of the applicant’s appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Adamson J dealt with this matter at [38] of her judgment. As her Honour observed, the matter was specifically adverted to by his Honour in the Remarks on Sentence. There was no doubt that his Honour did take it into account and it was a matter for the sentencing judge to determine what weight was to be given to that matter.
	
	
	The sentencing judge had regard to what was termed “the loss of his family home” as extra-curial punishment. As the Crown observed, this matter was raised in the “personal background statement” which was tendered at the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	In relation to this head of complaint, against it is to be noted again that no application was made by the applicant for Special Leave to Appeal to the High Court in relation to any matter concerned with extra-curial punishment. No matters have been established on this application which would warrant taking further action in relation to this aspect.
	
	
	The arguments presented and the matters raised by the applicant in his submissions, do not give rise to any unease or sense or disquiet in relation to the sentence imposed.
	
	
	I note the Crown’s submission that there was no evidence at the sentencing hearing to suggest that the applicant lost his family home simply as a result of having committed the offences. The personal background statement revealed that he had had long-standing financial difficulties. It was submitted that a sufficient nexus between the offences and the loss of the applicant’s family home was not established by the fact that the loss of his home would not, or may not, have occurred had his employment as a police officer not been terminated.
	
	
	However, at the end of the day the sentencing judge did refer to the extra-curial factors in his consideration of the indicative and aggregate sentence imposed.
	


Conclusion


	
	The application filed by the applicant on 16 January 2015 pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry into his aggregate sentence of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months for five offences and four further offences specified on the Form 1 does not establish any relevant error either by the sentencing judge or by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Furthermore, the application and the material relied upon in support of the application does not establish any facts or circumstances that would justify the taking of any further action pursuant to s 79(3)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The offences committed by the applicant involved a high level of objective seriousness. The sentencing judge considered all relevant matters in determining the applicant’s criminality including personal or subjective factors.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence imposed was well within the sentencing discretion exercised by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The following two matters are noted:
	



	
	The applicant had the opportunity of pursuing many of the matters that were raised in the present application in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Following the dismissal of that appeal, no Application for Special Leave was made by him to the High Court and no facts or circumstances have been raised sufficient to cause any sense of disquiet or unease as to the sentence imposed upon him.
	



	
	Each of the matters (1) and (2) above fall respectively within the provisions of s 79(3)(i) and (ii) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. They are matters that entitle this Court to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application for an inquiry under s 78 of that Act. They are matters that justify the dismissal of the application.
	
	
	Upon consideration of the application, I have concluded that no basis has been established warranting a direction for an inquiry in terms of s 79(1)(a) and there is no basis for a referral of the applicant’s case to the Court of Criminal Appeal in terms of s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	Accordingly, the application made pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is dismissed.

2767845,NSW Police v Garrick [2015] NSWLC 30,"Judgment


	
	On 10 November 2013 Anthony Garrick (the defendant) was detected by police to be speeding at Chippendale. He was stopped and a breath test was conducted which returned a positive result. He was arrested for the purpose of a breath analysis and returned a blood alcohol reading of 0.122. He was not carrying a driver’s licence at the time. Following his being charged with the offence of mid-range PCA a notice of suspension was issued to him meaning that he was not entitled to drive until the charge was finalised at court. These were proceedings H 53170057. Some 17 days later, on 27 November 2013 at Marrickville, the defendant was detected driving his motor vehicle and as a result was charged with the offence of driving whilst suspended. This was proceeding H 55153785.
	
	
	The offence of 10 November 2013 was the second occasion that the defendant had been charged with an alcohol related offence. His record revealed that on 30 January 2013 he had been convicted in the Waverley Local Court of the offence of driving with the middle-range prescribed concentration of alcohol.
	
	
	After some delay and following pleas of guilty being entered the charges from both 10 and 27 November 2013 came before his Honour Magistrate Mabbutt for sentence in the Downing Centre Local Court on 6 August 2014. I have had the benefit of perusing the original court papers in respect of both matters and have also been provided by Ms Duncan, who now appears on behalf of the defendant, with a copy of the transcript of the proceedings before Magistrate Mabbutt. Ms Duncan did not appear for the defendant at that time.
	
	
	On the 6 August 2014, his Honour heard submissions from the defendant’s solicitor and at page 4 of the transcript it indicates that in respect of the mid-range PCA charge the defendant was convicted and fined $2,500. He was also placed on a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for two years. In addition, he was disqualified from holding a driver licence for a period of two years from 6 August 2014 to 5 August 2016. In relation to the speeding offence and the offence of not carrying a driver licence, the defendant was convicted but pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 no further penalty was imposed.
	
	
	In respect of the drive while suspended matter the defendant was convicted, fined $800 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence for a period of two years from 6 August 2014 to 5 August 2016.
	
	
	Following his Honour making these orders, an application was made to him to consider the imposition of a disqualification suspension order, otherwise known as an interlock order. His Honour accepted that it was appropriate for an interlock order to be made. A consideration of the papers and the transcript reveals that his Honour then proceeded to make an interlock order pursuant to the then relevant provision, being s 210 of the Road Transport Act 2013, with a disqualification compliance period of 6 months and a minimum interlock participation period of 36 months. His Honour purported to make such an order in respect of both the mid-range PCA offence and the drive whilst suspended offence.
	
	
	Page 5 of the transcript of 6 August indicates that the following was said at the time the interlock order was made:
	


HIS HONOUR: I will explain to you what has happened, Mr Garrick. I have imposed an interlock order. That means you’re disqualified now from driving any car other than a car fitted with the interlock device for 36 months, 3 years. The disqualification period for driving anything is reduced to 6 months. You can decide which of these options you want. You can be disqualified for two years driving anything or you go and pay the money and get your car fitted out to get the interlock order. That means you have got to stay off the road for 6 months and you can’t drive any car other than that fitted car for 36 months, so if you are found in the next 3 years driving anything other than that car you have got the device fitted to, you will be treated as a disqualified driver. Do you understand that?

ACCUSED: I do.


	
	No issue is taken by the defendant that his Honour was perfectly entitled to make the interlock order in respect of the mid-range PCA matter. The issue raised by the defendant is that there was no entitlement for the court to make an interlock order in respect of the drive while suspended charge. It is clear that the defendant is correct in this submission. The drive while suspended matter was not an alcohol related offence to which the interlock provisions of the Road Transport Act 2013 applied and accordingly, those proceedings should be reopened pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and a fresh penalty imposed. That of course gives rise to the question of what that fresh penalty should be.
	
	
	Ms Duncan, who has made both oral and written submissions to me, is instructed that the solicitor then acting for the defendant advised him that he could drive a motor vehicle in 6 months’ time from 6 August 2014 on the basis that he had the interlock device fitted for a further 36 months. She submits that it was the intention of the magistrate that Mr Garrick be permitted to drive with an interlock device after a period of 6 months of disqualification. She observes, and this is confirmed from the transcript, that the periods of disqualification were to run concurrently for both the mid-range PCA and the charge of driving whilst suspended. She submits that the only way to achieve the outcome that the court intended is to reopen the proceedings for the drive while suspended charge, amend the conviction and impose a penalty being a s 10(1)(b) bond. She notes that for the purposes of s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the disposition of the matter pursuant to s 10 falls within the definition of a penalty.
	
	
	Ms Duncan submits that in reliance upon the remarks of the magistrate concerning the interlock period, and given the subsequent confirmation of that order by his solicitor, the defendant believed that he could take up an interlock device after 6 months and recommence driving. She said that as a consequence he did not lodge an appeal which he otherwise would have. Further, he purchased a motor vehicle with a loan of $19,000 so as to have the interlock device fitted. She says that these are all matters that the court is now able to take into account in determining this application.
	
	
	Section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides a mechanism by which a court may re-open proceedings to correct sentencing errors. Ms Duncan submits that as there was a sentencing error made in the disposition of the drive while suspended charge, the proceedings should be reopened and a further penalty imposed. Relevantly for the purposes of this matter, s 43 applies to criminal proceedings in which a court has imposed a penalty that is contrary to law. In that event the court may re-open the proceedings and impose a penalty in accordance with the law and if necessary amend any relevant conviction or order. The words “impose a penalty” include the court making orders under s 10 or making an order in respect of disqualification of a driver licence.
	
	
	Importantly, the section does not allow for the court to amend a conviction in the manner submitted by Ms Duncan. In my view a conviction may only be amended if it is one that is imposed contrary to law, that is, without any legal basis whatsoever. Further it is clear that the intention of the magistrate was always that the defendant be convicted. That this is so is abundantly clear from the fact that a penalty was imposed, albeit an incorrect one.
	
	
	Here the defendant was convicted of the drive while suspended charge on the 6 August 2014. Relevantly, and prior to that date, he had a prior mid-range PCA of which he had been convicted on 30 January 2013. On conviction for the drive while suspended offence and given the terms of s 54 of the Road Transport Act 2013, the defendant was automatically disqualified (with or without any specific order of the court), for a period of two years from the date of conviction. No other disqualification was properly open to the court.
	
	
	Despite this, the court after convicting the defendant imposed a fine and purported to then impose an interlock order. I accept that it had no power to do so and that such order was contrary to law. That being the case I further accept that it is open to me to re-open the proceedings and impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law. I do not accept that I can do what Ms Duncan urges, being, to look behind the fact of the conviction imposed by the magistrate. The conviction itself was not contrary to law. It was a penalty open to the court and accordingly to that extent there was no sentencing error. It was always open to the defendant to appeal his conviction if he thought that it was appropriate to do so. For whatever reason, he did not do so and it is not now open for this court to in effect sit as an appellate court in respect of the decision of another magistrate.
	
	
	It is submitted by Ms Duncan that the magistrate had intended the defendant to be eligible to drive with an interlock device after 6 months disqualification. If that were the case, then so far as that intention is evinced from the interlock order for the drive while suspended charge, there has been a sentencing error. Upon conviction for that offence and given his record there could only ever be available an automatic period of disqualification of 2 years (see s 54 (8) and (9), Road Transport Act 2013). In reality Ms Duncan seeks to have me re-determine the fact of the defendant’s conviction. I do not accept that I have any power to do so.
	
	
	Section 43 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117 where it was held:
	



	
	that to re-open there must be an error which leads to a penalty that is contrary to law, and
	
	
	that section 43 is a discretionary provision intended to correct manifest error in the sentence itself, and
	
	
	that s 43 is not an alternate to appeal and must not be used to effectively lead to a lack of finality in criminal proceedings.   
	



	
	In my view, the conclusion that I have reached in respect of my inability to deal with the matter in the way that Ms Duncan has submitted is consistent with what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v Achurch. Further, the section does not permit the re-litigation of what has already been litigated or the seeking of a different outcome based on fresh evidence: see Bungie v R [2015] NSWCCA 9. To do other than that which I propose would in my view be to re-litigate the sentencing proceeding in an impermissible way.
	
	
	I accept that there has been a sentencing error in that the court had no power to impose an interlock order for the drive whilst suspended offence. I am of the view that the appropriate course is for me to re-open sentencing proceedings pursuant to s 43 and to impose a disqualification period which is in accordance with the law, being for a period of 2 years to date from 6 August 2014.​ 
	


 


	
	ORDERS 
	



	
	I reopen the sentence proceedings in H55153785 pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 determined on 6 August, 2014.
	
	
	The disqualification/suspension order dated 6 August, 2014 is set aside.
	
	
	In lieu the defendant is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driver licence pursuant to the Road Transport Act for a period of 2 years from 6 August 2014.

2767853,R v Biljuh (No 6) [2015] NSWSC 1451,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

Introduction


	
	This is an application for adjournment of part heard proceedings on sentence that are currently listed before me on 16 October 2015.
	
	
	The background of the matter is as follows. After a trial by jury on a count of murder alleged to have been committed on 14 February 2014, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on 22 June 2015. On that day, the matter was stood over for proceedings on sentence on 14 August 2015 before me.
	
	
	Without delving deeply into the evidence in the trial, the mode of the killing of the deceased – who was the offender’s own mother – along with things that he had said about her to others, combined with his presentation both in recorded interviews with police and in the witness box, gives rise to a concern that he suffers from some psychological or psychiatric condition; at the least, a pathological hatred for, or resentment of, his late mother.
	
	
	In written submissions on sentence already provided, the Crown Prosecutor has foreshadowed the possibility that any such condition could make the difference, in his submission, between the imposition of a very long determinate sentence, and the imposition of the ultimate sentence; that is, life imprisonment without possibility of parole.
	
	
	To complete my thumbnail sketch of the background, at an early stage of the trial the instructions of the original Crown Prosecutor were withdrawn by the DPP. I rejected a Crown application for the discharge of the jury. And, although, of course, I granted an adjournment to permit new Crown counsel to be briefed and become prepared, I did not grant an adjournment of the length for which the Crown contended: see R v Biljuh [2015] NSWSC 660 and R v Biljuh (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 702.
	
	
	On 14 August 2015, all evidence except any psychiatric material was tendered. Defence counsel explained that the offender had indeed been under the care of a psychiatrist, a Dr Carne, but regrettably that psychiatrist had been unable to prepare a report due to personal commitments. As well as that, defence counsel on that occasion was not entirely well. I was prepared to adjourn the matter in those circumstances, although I did receive all evidence available at that stage. I preferred not to receive oral submissions until all of the evidence had closed. Accordingly, without demur on the part of the Crown, the matter was adjourned until 16 October 2015 for receipt of the report, any necessary cross-examination of its author, and final oral submissions on sentence of both counsel.
	
	
	In the meantime, defence counsel has contacted my Chambers and asked to have the matter relisted, and that has been done on an urgent basis. The problem that has arisen is that the treating psychiatrist will be able to provide a report, but only a few days before 16 October. Furthermore, it will be personally difficult for the psychiatrist to attend for any cross-examination on that day. Secondly, and quite separately, defence counsel needs to have urgent surgery with regard to a medical problem. Accordingly, the application of defence counsel is that the matter be adjourned until late November or December 2015.
	
	
	The position of the Crown Prosecutor is, in a nutshell, that in all of the circumstances an adjournment of six weeks or so is not opposed. Indeed, I understand his position to be that the Crown would prefer to have some time to reflect, after the psychiatric report is received, and before the conclusion of the proceedings on sentence.
	


Determination 


	
	Turning to my determination, I reject any suggestion that, with regard to a verdict that was returned in June 2015, sentence should be imposed in February or March 2016. Such an approach would place far too much stress, and distress, upon those who loved the deceased, and indeed the offender. And I do not consider that the administration of justice can operate whereby a sentence for a murder is imposed such a long time after the jury has spoken.
	
	
	It follows that the proceedings on sentence must conclude, not only this year, but also on a date that provides me with sufficient time to reflect deeply on the matter, to compose remarks on sentence, and to deliver them before the end of the Law Term 2015.
	
	
	Secondly, it is clear that any psychological or psychiatric condition of the offender is an important - perhaps central - issue in the proceedings on sentence. I accept that it would be preferable if the report could be provided to the Crown well before the proceedings on sentence, and also that the psychiatrist be available to give evidence at the proceedings on sentence undistracted by other commitments. Having said that, if that were to become impossible in the future, so be it. It is well known that there are very many eminent forensic psychiatrists in Sydney.
	
	
	Thirdly, it is true that it would be preferable for defence counsel to be able to stay in the matter. Having said that, as I said to the jury many months ago, it is not uncommon for counsel to change in the course of litigation, including criminal litigation. The entire transcript of the trial is available, as are, of course, all of the exhibits, by way of application to my Associate. And it will be recalled that I “forced on” the Crown to a degree, in circumstances in which its preparation and presentation of a trial of a very serious example of the most serious offence known to law was not optimal.
	
	
	In short, if the medical difficulties of defence counsel subsequent to today make it impossible for him to appear on a date that will permit me comfortably to sentence on a date this year, that is regrettable, but again so be it.
	
	
	In summary, there is no question of the proceedings on sentence being adjourned past 4 December 2015. Indeed, were it not for the fact that I have another commitment in court on 27 November 2015, I would have insisted that the proceedings on sentence must conclude on that earlier date.
	
	
	Turning to whether the current date should be vacated at all, there are grounds for saying that that should not occur. After all, that date is over two weeks away, and I consider that alternative counsel could be briefed and properly prepared. Whether another forensic psychiatrist could provide a comprehensive report well before that date is less clear, but I consider that it is perhaps possible, if things were arranged as a matter of urgency.
	
	
	To be weighed against those considerations is the fact that it is completely inevitable that the offender will spend many years in custody as a result of the verdict of the jury, whatever evidence is presented on the next occasion. I repeat that the Crown has submitted that medical evidence could be crucial to whether the ultimate sentence should be imposed. And I emphasise that my own impression, on the basis of a number of aspects of the evidence in the trial, is that it could well be that the offender has a significant medical condition of the kind under discussion.
	
	
	In the circumstances, and with considerable reluctance, I am prepared to vacate the next hearing date of 16 October 2015, and to list the matter for hearing at 10 AM on 4 December 2015.
	
	
	It should be noted that that date is almost six months after the date of delivery of verdict. Without seeking to bind myself, I indicate that only in truly exceptional circumstances will the proceedings on sentence not conclude on that day, on the application of either party. In particular, the unavailability of counsel, or the unavailability of psychological or psychiatric material, or indeed a combination of the two, will not find favour as a ground for yet another adjournment of these proceedings on sentence for a count of murder.
	


Orders


	
	For those reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	The hearing date of 16 October 2015 is vacated.
	
	
	The matter is listed for proceedings on sentence at 10 AM on 4 December 2015.
	
	
	The bail of the offender continues to be refused.

		01 October 2015",2015-09-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767859,Wong v Wong [2015] NSWDC 274,"Judgment


	
	By statement of claim filed on 25 June 2014, the plaintiff brings proceedings for assault and battery against the defendant for the injuries he suffered arising out of an incident on 21 December 2012 whilst on the premises at 64 Endeavour Street, Seven Hills NSW.
	
	
	The circumstances giving rise to this claim were as follows. The plaintiff, who was 63 years of age at the time, was watering the garden of a Ms Amy Chui as part of his ongoing duties as a handyman. Ms Chui was the defendant’s ex-wife. While he was watering the front yard, the defendant, aged 47 at the time and the occupant of another house in the same street which was two doors away, came to the property to visit his son. The plaintiff alleges that, without reason, the defendant jump-kicked him to the ground, stomped on his left thigh, breaking it and then delivered further kicks to his body. The defendant alleges the plaintiff abused and assaulted him first, and that the plaintiff suffered the broken leg by catching his foot and falling on a stone wall when he pushed the plaintiff away in self-defence. The plaintiff denies this version of events but said that, even if it were accepted, the push and the circumstances of his broken leg did not occur in the course of self-defence and hence still constituted an assault.
	


The issues for determination


	
	The issues are as follows:
	



	
	The resolution of the differing accounts of the incident by the plaintiff and defendant;
	
	
	The expert evidence as to the mechanism of injury;
	
	
	Issues of quantum.
	



	
	These proceedings have had an unfortunate procedural history. After a first return date and two further mentions (at which the defendant represented himself), the matter was set down for hearing for two days, an inadequate estimate for a case involving cross-examination of two expert medical witnesses, a police officer, three lay witnesses and a plaintiff who required an interpreter. The hearing had to be adjourned part-heard as the estimate of time was insufficient. Additionally, case management issues such as concurrent evidence for the parties’ experts were not considered.
	


The evidence in these proceedings


	
	The evidence may be divided into the following categories:
	



	
	Contemporaneous reports of calls for assistance and the contents of those records, including the ambulance officer’s notes and the 000 call made by the defendant. The contents of these reports and records are not in dispute;
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Khan, the next door neighbour, who did not see the assault but came out after hearing the plaintiff call for help. This evidence is essentially unchallenged and therefore reliable;
	
	
	The notes taken by the police officer, Senior Constable Catto, who took the defendant on a “walkthrough” of the events and took a series of photographs of the relevant areas pointed out by the defendant. He also interviewed the plaintiff the following day at the hospital. Some caution needs to be exercised when considering the accuracy of statements made by the plaintiff to the police officer as no interpreter was present and he was about to go into surgery for operation on the injury to his leg, but the accuracy of his reports and photographs, and the impartiality of his opinions, means that this evidence is reliable;
	
	
	The evidence of the plaintiff, the defendant and the defendant’s son, which was the subject of extensive cross-examination; and
	
	
	The evidence of expert medical witnesses as to the mechanics of the fall
	



	
	The issue of the credit of the plaintiff and defendant was a significant issue. Counsel for the plaintiff and for the defendant each pointed to inconsistencies and implausibilities in the evidence of the plaintiff and the defendant.
	
	
	The correct approach to the credibility of witnesses by a trial judge has been the subject of many decisions in the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In Hasler v Singtel Optus Pty Ltd (2014) 311 ALR 494 at [156]-[157], the Court of Appeal described the approach of the primary judge to the contemporaneous documentary and testimonial evidence as follows:
	


“[156] Between [147] and [214], over some 18 pages of reasons, the primary judge recorded and made findings about substantially the whole of the contemporaneous documentary evidence and testimonial evidence on this point. Although he did not deal with every piece of contemporaneous documentary evidence, the gravamen of Optus’ complaint was that in light of the cogency of the documentary evidence, the absence of obvious witnesses (such as Mrs Curtis and Mrs Hasler) and the vagaries of human recollection eight years later, there was reviewable error in failing to find in accordance with the documents. Optus candidly recognised that his Honour’s finding was, expressly, based upon opinions concerning the credibility of witnesses, especially that of Mr Tull and Mr Trent Hasler, whom he regarded as reliable and having significant probative weight. In particular, Mr Tull (a truck driver) was found to be independent and claimed to have an actual recollection of transporting Optus products from Campbelltown to Lidcombe over a number of months, commencing in winter.

[157] The careful and extensive nature of the reasoning process of the primary judge in this respect warrants recording, for this was not merely a case where the judge states that he or she prefers the testimony of one witness over another, in part by reason of demeanour. To the contrary, there was an engagement with the force of Optus’ case, including a discounting of the testimonial evidence of most of the defendants’ witnesses and an appreciation of the force of the contemporaneous documents. The judgment is the opposite of what is on occasion seen, when findings are made without “a consideration of the real strength of the body of evidence [the losing party] presented”: State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) [1999] HCA 3; (1999) 73 ALJR 306 at 321; cf Bunnings Group Ltd v Borg [2014] NSWCA 240 at [36].”


	
	A trial judge must take into account the potential for inconsistencies between human memory and contemporaneous records, and the need to evaluate the evidence of each of the witnesses in the context of the whole of the evidence. In those circumstances, the need for “careful reasons” of the primary judge (Hasler v Singtel Optus Pty Ltd at [167]) is essential. As is set out in more detail below, I have given particular weight to the contents of contemporaneous records. One of these, namely the “walkthrough” by the defendant of the scene of the accident which was conducted by Senior Constable Catto with the defendant, appears to favour the version of events given by the defendant in terms of consistency of report. However, other contemporaneous records tend to favour the version of events given by the plaintiff.
	
	
	I have also given considerable weight to the evidence of independent witnesses whose credit is unchallenged and whose version of events was substantially not the subject of cross-examination. These witnesses include Mr Khan, the next door neighbour, and Ms Fung, who telephoned the police and ambulance at the plaintiff’s request. Where their evidence is inconsistent with the evidence of the plaintiff or defendant, I have generally preferred their evidence.
	
	
	Mr Khan was not cross-examined about a number of disputed issues relevant to the defendant’s case, such as whether the plaintiff shouted abuse at the defendant after the incident, or about his observations, such as his statement that the defendant was washing his car both prior to and after the incident. I have had regard to the principles enunciated in Brown v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 as explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Vines v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] NSWCA 75 at [60] – [62] and, most recently, in Bradley v Matloob [2015] NSWCA 239 at [5] – [7] per McColl JA.
	


The evidence of the plaintiff


	
	The plaintiff met Mrs Amy Chui in about May 2012. She had recently divorced the defendant, and was living in the premises at 64 Endeavour Street Seven Hills with her son, Maan Wong, a university student. Although the defendant had only moved two doors away and lived in number 60 Endeavour Street, she and he lived separate lives.
	
	
	Ms Chui asked the plaintiff to perform regular maintenance and gardening from approximately June 2012. The plaintiff was certain that he did not start to do this work until after the defendant had moved out, which the defendant said occurred on 19 July 2012. Whatever the starting date, the plaintiff was at the premises fairly regularly from that time on, and was paid cash in hand by Ms Chui. The plaintiff’s acquaintances, such as Ms Fung, knew he was working there (T 90).
	
	
	The defendant, who lived only two doors away, also knew that the plaintiff was working there, according to the plaintiff. He said that during the first two weeks that he started working there, the defendant looked at him in a fixed way on several occasions, and on one occasion made a rude gesture (T 84).
	
	
	In October 2012 Ms Chui told the plaintiff she was going on holiday to China. She gave him a key to the house and a list of chores to do while she was away. In the course of performing these duties, the plaintiff found (in early December 2012) the defendant’s car parked in the driveway, blocking access to the garage, which the plaintiff was supposed to paint. He asked the defendant why he had parked there and whether his ex-wife had given him permission to do so. According to the plaintiff, the defendant replied “Go to hell, it’s none of your business” (Exhibit B, paragraph 9). The defendant did, however, remove the car (the defendant’s statement says “I moved the car accordingly”: Exhibit 6, tab 3, paragraph 5).
	
	
	While this appears to have been the only conversation between the plaintiff and defendant before the incident, it is clear that each of them knew who the other was. The plaintiff knew that the defendant was Ms Chui’s ex-husband. The defendant, who visited the premises to see his son, knew that the plaintiff was at the premises carrying out work (he conceded that the plaintiff was “maybe…employed” by his former wife: T 79).
	
	
	On the day of the incident (21 December 2012) the plaintiff arrived at Ms Chui’s home to perform handyman duties some time between 1.30 pm – 2 pm. Ms Chui was still in China, but the plaintiff had his own key and maintenance equipment, and knew where everything was stored. He saw a blue car parked in the driveway and knew that it was the defendant’s car. He turned on the hose and began to water the front lawn. He described what happened very shortly afterwards in his statement (Exhibit B) as follows:
	


“11. I started to water Amy’s front lawn as I normally did. After I started watering, the defendant stood up on the other side of the light blue car. I had not seen him before that and had not realised he was there. He said (in Cantonese): “I want to hit you earlier.” I said “Why?”

12. The defendant then ran towards me and jump-kicked me around the chest. As he was doing this I threw down the hose and put my arms up, crossed together, to defend myself. The kick connected with my arms and the force pushed me backwards. I fell backwards onto the ground, putting my hands behind me to cushion the fall. I landed on the grass.

13. The defendant then came up to me and used his right leg to kick or stomp down on my left leg, hitting hard against the middle of my left thigh. I heard a crack and my left leg involuntarily bent at the knee and stayed in that position. I tried to stand up but I couldn’t. My leg was very painful. I realised the defendant had broken my leg.

14. The defendant then used his left leg to try to kick me twice around my right chest area. I put my right arm up to protect myself and his leg connected with that arm. My right arm hit against my body because of the force.”


	
	The plaintiff observed the neighbour come out of his house and called to him:
	


“15. I then saw a neighbour, an Indian man, come out from his house at 62 Endeavour Street which is next door to Amy’s house. I called out to him “My friend, please help me, call the police, he kicked me, he broke my leg.” He replied “I have called the police already.” I said “Thank you.”” (Exhibit B, paragraph 15)


	
	The plaintiff then called his friend, Ms Kai Kwai Fung, and had a conversation with her as follows:
	


“17. At 1:58pm I called my friend Kai Kwai FUNG using my mobile phone and spoke to her in Cantonese. I said to her words to the effect of: “Amy’s ex-husband kicked my leg and broke it. I need you to call an ambulance. I’m still on the ground at the front of Amy’s place.” I asked her to call them for me because my English is poor.”


	
	The plaintiff told the police officer who came to speak to him:
	


“He [the defendant] hit me and broke my leg.” (Exhibit B, paragraph 18)


	
	He said he was asked if he had wet the defendant with his hose and said:
	


“No, I didn’t wet him. Please, you can touch his clothes, check if they are wet or not.” (Exhibit B, paragraph 18)

Is the plaintiff’s account of the incident reliable?


	
	The defendant submits that this account is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination. This was as follows:
	


“A. INTERPRETER: When I was watering the lawn I could not see anybody at the car, and I also did not know that this car belong to him. I thought that it was the - his son's friend's car and so I continued to water the lawn and the, the hose - the water was very slow, because I was putting the, the lawn on so I could not turn on the water tap very strongly. And suddenly he was standing up right there, I could hear his voice and I, and I looked up and I saw him, he was rushing towards me and he was swearing at me saying that, ""I wanted to have hit you for very long time,"" meaning that he, he, he had intention to hit me for a very long time. So I immediately defend myself with my arms up. I lost my balance and I fell onto the ground and my both hands were supporting myself on the lawn, and then his feet - his, his feet was stepping on my feet, and then I heard this sound. I saw that my leg was not bent in that position. I have never seen my leg bent in that position.”


	
	The plaintiff went on to say (T 33) that when the defendant started rushing towards him and swearing at him, this was preceded by the statement, “I wanted to hit you for a very long time”, to which the plaintiff replied, “Why?”
	
	
	The plaintiff gave this evidence a second time:
	


“A. INTERPRETER: Then he kicked me but I raised my hand to defend myself and so I lost my balance and I fell down onto the ground. And then he stamped on my leg. And then he used his left leg to kick me on this side and twice. And I saw an Indian who was living next door so I said to him, “Friend, friend, this person is hurting my leg and breaking my leg. Can you ring the police?” And the Indian friend said that, “I’ve already called the police.” I said, “Thank you. Thank you.” And at that time I also rang Kai Kwai Fung. I said, “Mrs Lowe, Mrs Lowe, can you call the police and ambulance? This person has broken my leg.”” (T 33-34)


	
	The plaintiff described both in his statement and in his evidence that the defendant “jumped kicked” (T 34) him, launching himself into the air and that the plaintiff raised his arms to defend himself. Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, I am satisfied that his account of the evidence remained consistent throughout the cross-examination. Counsel for the defendant also pointed to the inconsistency between the plaintiff’s account of Mr Khan’s saying “I have called the police already” and Mr Khan’s evidence that he said he would call the police. I consider this to be of no importance. The plaintiff was in pain and his recall of this conversation is likely to be affected.
	
	
	The defendant also submitted that the plaintiff’s evidence about where the incident occurred, and where he fell, was confused and inconsistent. The plaintiff was shown a series of photographs and asked to mark with an X the relevant positions of himself and the defendant. The plaintiff identified where the defendant was standing near the car, and identified where he was when he fell. He thought the car was parked back to front; it is clear from the photographs that this is not the case. However, the significance of this inconsistency is doubtful. It is not a fact of any significance to the issues in question.
	
	
	The plaintiff denied that he approached the defendant and started yelling at him telling him to move the car and saying, “You don’t have permission to be at the property and leave immediately” (T 37). He also denied that he approached the defendant with the garden hose and begun to spray the defendant with water (T 37). He also denied that he continued to shout abuse at the defendant while sitting on the ground with a broken leg.
	
	
	The plaintiff also denied the mechanics of the accident as postulated by the defendant:
	


“Q. I suggested to you before that, after pushing him over, you approached him and adopted a fighting stance, raising your fists. You were standing a vicinity which I am going to mark generally with a circle. Do you agree or disagree?

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.

Q. After you adopted that fighting stance, the defendant got to his feet and, with both of his hands, he pushed you out of the away?

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.

Q. When he pushed you away you lost your balance, you tripped at the base of the palm tree, which you can see there in the corner of that third photograph?

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.

Q. Then you fell over on your left side?

A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. With your thigh landing across a small raised stone retaining wall?

A. INTERPRETER: No.

Q. Then you rolled over onto your back?

A. INTERPRETER: No, not possible.

Q. And onto the grass?

A. INTERPRETER: I fell to the ground because he kicked me.” (T 39)

Did the plaintiff spray water on the defendant?


	
	The defendant’s case is that he was approached by the plaintiff, who abused him and sprayed water on him from the garden hose that he was carrying. Senior Constable Catto records that the defendant had a wet patch on his shirt. The defendant principally relies upon the plaintiff’s answers to Senior Constable Catto (in hospital, the following day) to attack the credibility of the plaintiff.
	
	
	It was put to the plaintiff that he had pointed the hose at the defendant and sprayed him with water, and then pushed him over the low brick arch so he landed on his back in the garden, after which the plaintiff adopted a fighting stance, raising both arms and making fists (T 37 - 38):
	


“Q. So just like on the occasion before, when you saw the red car in the front yard of Amy’s house, you’re the one who approached him and told him to leave?

A. INTERPRETER: Not the case.

Q. My client at the time you were saying this to him was polishing the blue car and he ignored you?

A. INTERPRETER: I don’t agree.

Q. Then you approached him with the garden hose and began to spray him with water?

A. INTERPRETER: I don’t agree.

Q. So you say you never sprayed him with water?

A. INTERPRETER: Correct.

Q. I want to suggest to you that, as you were spraying him with water, you

continued to say to him, “Leave the house immediately. You don’t have a right to come here.”

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.

Q. As you did this, he moved towards you. Is that correct?

A. INTERPRETER: I don’t agree.

Q. Then you, as he moved towards you, you threw down the hose and you pushed him such that he fell backwards over a small brick arch onto his back in the garden?

A. INTERPRETER: I don’t agree.

Q. At no stage did he jump kick you?

A. INTERPRETER: I don’t agree.

Q. When you say that he jump kicked you, you’re telling a lie?

A. INTERPRETER: I did not lie.

Q. When you tell her Honour that you didn’t point the hose at him and spray him with water, you’re telling a lie?

A. INTERPRETER: I did not lie.

Q. After you pushed him over the low brick arch and he landed on his back in the garden, you moved towards him?

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.

Q. You adopted a fighting stance, raising your arms, both your fists?

A. INTERPRETER: No such thing.”


	
	Where was the garden hose during these events? There is no doubt that the plaintiff was watering the garden at the time of the incident and although there is no evidence to this effect, it appears that the hose was dropped during the incident.
	
	
	As is set out in more detail below, Senior Constable Catto, when he attended the scene approximately 20 minutes after the incident, observed that the defendant’s shirt had a large wet spot on it. There were also some drops of water on the defendant’s motor vehicle.
	
	
	The amount of water observed on the defendant is hard to measure from the evidence, but it is clear he was not completely wet through; he had a wet patch on his shirt and partially on his trousers below the belt. He was not drenched and he did not give evidence of needing a towel to dry himself off.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant submits that on a very hot day the water from the drenching would have largely evaporated by the time that the police officer arrived. Since the police officer would have been making his observations, at the latest, approximately 20 minutes after the incident, I consider this explanation implausible.
	
	
	There are four potential explanations for the defendant having water on his clothes:
	



	
	The plaintiff pointed the hose at him and sprayed it, as the defendant claims. If so, the defendant’s clothing would have been quite wet, as would the defendant;
	
	
	The defendant had been using water himself to wash his own car, this being the description of what the defendant was doing given by the next door neighbour Mr Khan (see also paragraph 6 of Maan Wong’s statement taken by the police on 21 December 2012) and this is the source of the water on the defendant and on his car;
	
	
	The defendant deliberately wet himself, as the plaintiff told Senior Constable Catto in hospital; or,
	
	
	The defendant was accidentally sprayed with water in the circumstances of the assault on the plaintiff, who was holding a hose for the purpose of watering the garden at the time of the incident. It is not in dispute that the hose was connected to the water for the whole of this time; the defendant’s son, Maan Wong, told police in his statement (Exhibit 6, tab 4, paragraph 14) that he went to turn off the hose when the defendant telephoned police.
	



	
	The day after the incident, the plaintiff was asked questions by Senior Constable Catto about the circumstances in which the defendant had become wet. It is a significant issue, in relation to the plaintiff’s credibility, that he acknowledges that Senior Constable Catto came to the hospital shortly before he was about to go into surgery, but that he denies that Senior Constable Catto asked him any questions. It was put to the plaintiff that he falsely made a statement to Senior Constable Catto that he saw the defendant wet himself.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in the section of this judgment summarising the evidence of Senior Constable Catto, I am of the view that the medical condition of the plaintiff, and his very limited understanding of English mean that the plaintiff’s belief that he was not asked any questions by Senior Constable Catto, is mistaken, but is not a mistake which is adverse to his credit. I am also satisfied that his answers to Senior Constable Catto, in broken English, without an interpreter, and shortly before surgery, should not be relied upon.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, the most likely explanation for the defendant becoming wet was that he became involved in a physical altercation with a man holding a garden hose who was engaged in watering the garden.
	


Did the plaintiff yell abuse at the defendant?


	
	The plaintiff denied that he yelled abuse at the defendant before (T 37) the incident.
	
	
	I note that he was not asked whether he spoke the words ““You are a useless shit man. You completely rely on your ex-wife. It was not fair that you took two houses from the divorce. I am the judge to make it fair today for Amy and you will go to jail when the police arrive” (set out in Exhibit 6). This is a significant omission.
	
	
	The plaintiff was heard to call out by the next door neighbour but not to shout or call out abuse. As is set out below in more detail, Mr Khan was within earshot and was not cross-examined about hearing such statements.
	


Comparison of the plaintiff’s evidence of the mechanics of his injury with contemporaneous independent evidence


	
	There are four sources of independent evidence:
	



	
	The ambulance notes;
	
	
	Ms Fung’s evidence;
	
	
	Senior Constable Catto’s evidence; and,
	
	
	Mr Khan’s evidence.
	



	
	The plaintiff’s words following the injury to each of these persons would be of relevance when determining if the account of his injury is consistent.
	


The ambulance notes


	
	The ambulance notes set out the plaintiff’s statement that he was “punched and jumped on” and that when he attempted to get up he “couldn’t because his leg was broken” (Exhibit A, tab 1). This makes it clear that, from the first, the plaintiff said that he/his leg was “jumped on.” The ambulance officers also noted an abrasion to the top of his head, which is consistent with his claim of a further assault while on the ground.
	


Ms Fung’s evidence


	
	Ms Fung’s evidence (T 69 – 70) did not include any cross-examination about what the plaintiff had told her about the accident. She said the plaintiff said the defendant “kicked me and I fell over, then he jumped on my leg and broke it” (Exhibit A, tab 21). She was the second person the plaintiff spoke to after the incident.
	


Senior Constable Catto


	
	Only that part of Senior Constable Catto’s evidence relating to the interview with the plaintiff about the “stomping” allegation is set out here; the rest is set out in the section of this judgment which summarises the defendant’s evidence.
	
	
	Senior Constable Catto said that the plaintiff was not able to speak to him when he was at the scene. However, he was aware of the “stomping” allegation by the time the ambulance officer had left the scene (police statement of Michael Catto, 30 July 2013, paragraph 14), and did not believe that anyone other than the plaintiff could have told him (although it is, of course, possible that the ambulance officers conveyed this information).
	


The evidence of the next door neighbour, Mr Ziamud Khan


	
	Although Mr Khan did not see the assault, he made three relevant observations. The first of these was that he heard the plaintiff calling out for help, the second was the location of where the plaintiff was lying at the time, and the third is that his evidence does not refer either to seeing the defendant’s son at the scene, or to hearing the plaintiff say the words attributed to him by the defendant and his son.
	
	
	Mr Khan sets out the relevant events in his statement as follows (Exhibit C):
	


“5. On the afternoon of Friday 21 December 2012 I was inside my house. I heard a loud voice screaming from out the front of number 64. It was a man’s voice. He was screaming out: “Help me, help me. Somebody call the police please.” He said this a few times in a pleading tone. I could not see who it was, because I was inside.

6. He kept screaming out “Help me, help me. Somebody call the police please”, so I got up and went outside onto my front balcony to see what was happening. I went to the end of my balcony closest to number 64. From there I could see the person who was screaming out. It was Georges Wong.

7. Georges was sitting on the grass in the front garden of 64 Endeavour Street. He was facing towards the palm tree in the front garden. His feet were just over a metre from the base of the palm tree and his body was about 2 or 3 metres from the palm tree. Annexed and marked “A” is a photograph showing a person sitting in the same location as Georges was.

8. At this time I also saw Martin Wong from my balcony. He was standing next to his car, washing it. We did not say anything to each other.

9. Georges saw me and said: “Please, call the police, my leg’s broken.” I said “OK, I’ll ring up”.

10. I then rushed back inside my place and had my daughter Shabnam Qureshi ring the police. She called Blacktown police station directly.

11. I then went back outside onto my balcony and waited for the police to arrive. During this time Georges stayed in the same spot on the grass and Martin continued to wash his car.”


	
	Mr Khan was only briefly cross-examined (T 71ff). He repeated the observation in his affidavit that the plaintiff’s legs were pointing towards the palm tree and not towards the house (T 72). He also repeated his evidence that he had said to the plaintiff “OK, I will ring up” and not that he had already rung the police (T 72).
	
	
	Mr Khan was not cross-examined about his observation that he saw the defendant standing next to his car washing it (paragraph 8, Exhibit C) or that he “continued to wash his car” (paragraph 11). Nor did he say that he saw the defendant’s son, or that he heard the plaintiff calling out or saying the words attributed to him by the defendant and his son.
	


The defendant’s evidence


	
	Before considering the evidence of the defendant and his son, I first note the contents of the 000 call the defendant made to report the incident.
	


The defendant’s 000 call


	
	Before considering the evidence called by the defendant, I note that the defendant used his son’s telephone call to ring 000 at 2:00.21 pm, according to the mobile phone invoice (Exhibit A tab 23). His son was standing nearby at the time. The text of this call was:
	



	
	When asked what happened, he first said: “I was hit by the other guy in here” (T 120).
	
	
	He then said “An intruder come to my place and then hit me.” (T 120).
	
	
	He next told the operator “I don’t know the person at all”. He then said: “Please come here, he’s here now” (I accept the submission of counsel for the defendant that this was said in an urgent tone) (T 121).
	
	
	He next said: “Yeah, he’s here now. Please come here as soon as possible.” He next said, in what I agree is an urgent tone of voice, “The person is still in my property now”, and “In the yard, in the front yard” (T 121- 2).
	
	
	He next said “I don’t know why he comes to this place. This is not his place here” (T 123).
	
	
	He also said “Maybe he’s my wife’s ex-boyfriend, I don’t know” (T 123).
	



	
	The defendant’s misleading description of the assault in this call is of great significance when determining which version of events to believe.
	


The evidence of the defendant


	
	The evidence proceeded by way of statement. In his statement, the defendant described the circumstances of the assault as follows:
	


“9. At or around 2:00pm, the plaintiff arrived at the Property. The plaintiff saw me and began to yell at me. He said that I did not have permission to be at the Property and told me to leave immediately. I remember him saying the words “You’re not meant to be at this house” or words to a similar effect. I paid no attention to the plaintiff and continued to polish my car.

10. The plaintiff then ran to the other side of the Property, picked up a garden hose and began to spray me with it. He managed to soak my t-shirt and shorts and spray water into the inside of my car.

11. I told the plaintiff to stop spraying me. The plaintiff continued to shout at me saying “You have to leave the house immediately. You don’t have the right to come here”. I replied to him: “Who are you? You don’t have the right to do this, stop, stop”. Then I put down my washcloth and began walking towards the plaintiff.

12. The plaintiff threw down the hose from his hand onto the side of the brick arch causing the tap to break apart. The plaintiff then raised both of his hands, rushed towards me and pushed me over a brick arched bridge. I fell onto the lower part of the front yard. This caused me to deeply scratch and cut both of my legs.

13. Before I could manage to stand up, the plaintiff walked towards me from the top part of the arch to the lower part where I had fallen. The plaintiff raised his fists towards the front of his face and made a fighting stance.

14. I stood up and I used two hands to push the plaintiff in his shoulder away from me. The plaintiff tripped and fell over the edge of a stone block on the retaining wall and slid down the retaining wall onto the lower ground next to a palm tree.

15. The plaintiff started calling for help. He was shouting “Help, this guy broke my leg. This guy wants to kill me. Can someone call the police?”

16. I walked to the porch and saw that my son had come outside the front door. I asked him for his mobile phone so that I could call the police. I called the police and sat on the front porch while I waited for them to arrive.

17. The defendant [sic] stayed on the ground where he had fallen and continued to yell at me in Chinese. The closest meaning in English is “You are a useless shit man. You completely rely on your ex-wife. It was not fair that you took two houses from the divorce. I am the judge to make it fair today for Amy and you will go to jail when the police arrive”. (Exhibit 6)


	
	The defendant was cross-examinated about the difference between the version of events given in:
	



	
	His statement;
	
	
	The 000 call;
	
	
	His statements to Senior Constable Catto at the scene and in the ERISP;
	
	
	His statements in the first Defence he filed; and
	
	
	The version of events given by other witnesses.
	



	
	The first issue of significance was whether the defendant knew who the plaintiff was. This is of significance because of the contents of the 000 call, where he told the police that an intruder with no right to be there had come to “my property” and assaulted him.
	
	
	The defendant was asked in cross-examination:
	


“Q. When did you first see the plaintiff?

A. First see or - what do you mean see?

Q. See with your eyes. When did you first see him?

A. Maybe late December - late 2012. And I don't know - because I didn't see his, his face, I just know a, a man doing job over there. I don't know, I don't know that guy is this guy.

Q. Well you'd looked out from your place at number 60 and seen the plaintiff, hadn't you?

A. Sometimes. Sometimes I, I just saw - I just notice one person doing job over there. That's it.

Q. So what jobs did you see him doing?

A. I don't know, I didn't pay attention to that.

Q. But you looked out of number 60 and saw him going to number 64, is that right?

A. Yeah a person sometimes go there. Not all the time.

Q. When you say a person, did you see him or not?

A. I'm not quite sure - I just know a person because I didn't pay any attention to, to a guy to do work for, for that house.

Q. But your understanding was that there was somebody who was going‑‑

A. Yeah.

Q. ‑‑and doing work regularly at Amy's place, is that right?

A. Sometimes do, do works for, for his house. I don't know who the guy is. Maybe not this guy, I don't know.

Q. I suggest that you saw the plaintiff going over there regularly and you thought he might be Amy's new boyfriend, is that correct?

A. No, I never pay attention to this.

Q. You never thought that he might be Amy's new boyfriend?

A. I never - it - I don't care this, I doesn’t - I didn't know.

Q. The thought didn't cross your mind that he might be Amy's new boyfriend?

A. Not at that time.

Q. When did that cross your mind?

A. Long after, maybe two year - one or two years - until my son told me, George, as soon as George know my ex‑wife, he start courting her. That's my son told me later. Long, long after the‑‑

Q. Long after the incident?

A. Yeah, yeah, long after.

Q. See what I suggest is that you felt jealous that this new man was coming over to Amy's place.

A. No, never. I don't know what relation between he and my ex‑wife.

Q. You only knew him as somebody doing work‑‑

A. I just know - yeah, maybe he - she employ someone to do, do some kind of work for her. I don't know this, at all.” (T 79 – 80)


	
	The defendant was also asked about the circumstances in which the plaintiff asked him to move his car in early December 2000:
	


“Q. Then the first time you actually met him was late 2012, correct?

A. Yeah, December - early December in my memory.

Q. You had your car parked in the driveway?

A. I did, yeah.

Q. That was a red car at that time?

A. Yeah red car, at that time I drove a red car.

Q. He asked you or suggested that you move your car?

A. Yeah he come straight to me, yeah, and order me to remove the car. He said I don't have permission to park here.

Q. Yes, he wasn’t particularly polite in the way that he asked you, was he?

A. Sorry?

Q. He wasn’t very polite in the way he asked you, is that right?

A. He - yeah he didn't polite.

Q. He said, ""Why did you park your car here? Do you have permission from your ex‑wife to park here? You see me working every day here. Your house has two garages, why don't you park there? I need to get access to the garage, you should move your car,"" or something like that?

A. No, no. He didn't say, ""You see me every day working here,"" no, he didn't. He said, ""Just you - who give you the permission to park your car here? You don't have the permission to come - to park your car here. There are so many space on the street and in your house. Why you park here? You get out straight away."" He was so aggressive.

Q. How far away from you was he when you say he said those things?

A. A few metres. He come straight to me because at that time I remember I talking to my son in the porch, and then he get straight to me and order me to move the car.

Q. After he told you to move the car, you then moved it, is that right?

A. Sorry?

Q. After he told you to move the car, you moved it?

A. Yeah I ..(not transcribable).., I didn't talk to him, and I, I was really surprised why a guy come to, to ask me to, to move my car and then I - because it's time for me to go that - at that moment, that's why I just moved the car and go straight to, to work.

Q. Did he say he needed access to the garage, or something like that?

A. No, never. All things has been finished at that time‑‑

Q. I suggest he said he needed access to the garage?

A. No, haven't.

Q. But in any event you moved your car because you understood he needed to do some work there, correct?

A. No I didn't know he do it - because I haven't seen - he come for long time. He haven't been there for, for a long time and all the works has been finished.

Q. Well you didn't think he was some burglar or something, did you?

A. Sorry?

Q. You didn't think he was a thief coming to steal things from the property or something?

A. No, otherwise - no. I, I, I don't think‑‑

Q. Otherwise you would've called‑‑

A. Otherwise my son would kick him out.

Q. So you knew he was someone who was there with Amy's permission?

A. This - I didn't think about this because he, he, he told me to leave and then that - at that moment it's time for me to go as well. That's why I go straight away.

Q. But you understood that he was there to do work for Amy, correct?

A. At that time I don't know.

Q. I suggest to you that you saw him going there regularly, you got jealous and then when he ordered you to move your car you didn't like it, correct?

A. No I just surprised. I have - because I got ..(not transcribable).. didn't like, like it.” (T 79 – 80)


	
	This is very different to the description of the plaintiff that the defendant gave when he made a 000 call (this call was played in court and its contents recorded on the transcript: T 120 - 123. I propose to go through this call sentence by sentence.
	
	
	The first statement he made to the operator was that he “was hit by the other guy”:
	


“Q. That was a lie, wasn't it?

A. Not a lie. I, I been attacked.

Q. Just a moment ago you admitted that he never hit you. Correct?

A. But this my, due to my English I don't, I can't explain exactly meaning, you know, that I have been attacked. I, what I say, but ""hit"" and ""attack"" in my mind is the same thing.” (T 120)


	
	However, that is a minor issue. The next statement by the defendant not only repeated that the plaintiff had “hit” him but described him, more importantly, as:
	


“An intruder come [sic] to my place and then hit me.” (T 121)


	
	The defendant was asked both about this second use of the word “hit” and the description of the plaintiff as “an intruder”:
	


“Q. ""An intruder come to my place and then hit me."" That's what you said, isn't it?

A. Yeah. In my mind, ""hit"" and ""attack"" same thing.

Q. It was just another lie, wasn't it?

A. No.

Q. It was a lie because you knew he didn't hit you. Correct?

A. I don't know what is hit and attack. ""Hit"" and ""attack"" in Chinese is the same thing, same meaning, but I don't know in English it's different meaning. You, you can't just set, set me up like this.

Q. It was a lie because he wasn't an intruder. Correct?

A. No, he's a intruder. He's trespass.

Q. An intruder is someone who is not meant to be there. Correct?

A. He, he's not living there.

Q. You knew perfectly well that he was meant to be there to do jobs for Amy, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. That was your evidence yesterday, wasn't it?

A. Finish the job long time ago.” (T 121)


	
	Mr Stretton, in his written submissions (paragraph 65(b)), draws my attention to the personal attack on him (“set me up like this”). It is not to the credit of the defendant that he would make such an allegation.
	
	
	Any doubt that the defendant, by “intruder”, meant “trespasser”, as opposed to someone he did not know at all, was dispelled by the next sentence played to the court, where the defendant was heard to say “I don’t know the person at all”:
	


“Q. Let's go over what was said there. You said, ""I don't know the person at all,"" do you agree?

A. Yeah, I don't know him.

…

Q. You were trying to make it sound like you were the victim of an unknown intruder. Correct?

A. What does that mean?

Q. You were trying to make it sound like you had been the victim of an intruder whom you didn't know.

A. That's the truth, because I didn't know this guy at all.

Q. You were trying to make it sound like you were still scared? Correct?

A. That's what I, I feel at that moment. I am not trying to making something. That's what I feeling at that time.

Q. You were trying to make it sound like you were still in immediate danger, weren't you?

A. I, I don't know.” (T 121)


	
	What the defendant said after “I don’t know this person at all” was “Please come here, he’s here now”, which the defendant agreed he had said in an urgent tone (T 122). He also agreed that he had described the place where this incident occurred as “my property”:
	


“Q. ""Yeah, he's here now. Please come here as soon as possible."" You said that?

A. Mm‑hmm.

Q. Again in an urgent tone?

A. Mm‑hmm.

Q. Is that a yes?

A. Yes.

Q. ""The person is still in my property now."" You said that?

A. Yes.

Q. ""In the yard, in the front yard."" You said that?

A. Yeah.”


	
	Mr Stretton submits that the misleading impression of the defendant as the victim of an unknown intruder who had not only come onto the defendant’s property and hit him, but was remaining on the property and thus an imminent danger, is sufficiently false as an account for the defendant’s credit to be completely undermined and as being unable to be accepted unless corroborated (written submissions, paragraph 70).
	
	
	Not only was the evidence about the assault untruthful, Mr Stretton submits, but so is the evidence about why the plaintiff was at the premises. The defendant told the 000 operator “I don’t know why he comes to this place. This is not his place here”. Following on from the earlier statement that the assault occurred on “my property”, this statement by the defendant must be knowingly false. He was asked at T 123 - 4:
	


“Q. The operator said, ""Do you know why he did it, did he say anything?

And you said, ""No, I don't know why he come to this place. This is not his place here."" Do you agree that that's what was said?

A. Yes.

Q. That was another lie, wasn't it?

A. No, not lie.

Q. Because you knew why he came there. It was to water the garden for Amy. Correct?

A. I don't know. I don't, that's - I don't know he come to water the garden for Amy at that time. I don't know.

Q. You see, as you were telling these lies‑‑

A. I don't know what purpose he, he go there for.

Q. As you were telling these lies you realised how ridiculous they sounded, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. That's why you then came up with the story about being pushed over the arch.

A. No, not true.”


	
	Nor did the defendant tell the operator that the real reason the plaintiff was still on the property was because he was immobile and saying his leg was broken. Instead, he painted a picture of himself in imminent danger:
	


“Q. You were trying to make it sound like you were still scared? Correct?

A. That's what I, I feel at that moment. I am not trying to making something. That's what I feeling at that time.

Q. You were trying to make it sound like you were still in immediate danger, weren't you?

A. I, I don't know.

Q. But of course at that time the plaintiff was out there with a broken leg, not moving, do you agree?

A. I am not quite sure at that time he is real broken or, or just tell, tell the lie. He may, he may any time stand up to, to attack me again.

Q. But he certainly wasn't moving, was he?

A. He sit there, who, who knows?

Q. In other words, you were just trying to play the victim in this call, weren't you?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. You were trying to do that to make the plaintiff look like the guilty one.

A. I don't know. I, I, I don't agree.”


	
	This dishonesty extended in ascribing a motive to the plaintiff for this attack, namely the claim that “maybe he’s my ex-wife’s boyfriend, I don’t know”, thereby painting a picture of a dangerous domestic violence-related attack:
	


Q. ""Maybe he's my ex‑wife's boyfriend, I don't know."" You said that, didn't you?

A. Yeah.

Q. Do you remember your evidence yesterday was that it wasn't until much later that you thought that?

A. Yeah, I confirmed that. That's what I guess.

Q. Your evidence yesterday‑‑

A. Yeah, I, I remember that yesterday. Yeah, because my wife, my ex‑wife told my son he, he has been courting my ex‑wife for a long time, after I move out.

Q. See, your evidence yesterday was that you only thought he might be your ex‑wife's boyfriend long after the incident, do you agree?

A. Yeah, that's confirm, only confirm, yeah, confirm from my ex‑wife.

Q. Well, I suggest you were deliberately lying about that, sir. Do you agree?

A. Sorry?

Q. I suggest you were deliberately lying yesterday when you said that you didn't think he was Amy's new boyfriend.

A. No. That's confirm from my son.

Q. You lied about it because you didn't want to admit that you had a grudge against the plaintiff. Correct?

A. No.” (T 123 – 4).


	
	The defendant’s concerns for the plaintiff did not extend to calling an ambulance:
	


Q. Now, I suppose after you finished that triple‑0 call you immediately called an ambulance, did you?

A. I never call ambulance.

Q. Well, after all, you had somebody in the front yard, screaming out with a broken leg, unable to move? Correct?

A. Sorry?

Q. Well, the plaintiff was in the front yard, screaming out for help, saying he had a broken leg?

A. Yeah.

Q. You didn't think to call an ambulance in those circumstances?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. It would have been the decent thing to do, would it not?

[OBJECTION] …

Q. Yes.

A. I am not quite sure whether he's telling lie or not. I, I haven't confirm. He just said he, he - I broke his leg, I want to kill me - because he is telling lie. Who, which one - I never want to kill him, but I don't know which he is telling lie or not. Why I call the, the ambulance?

STRETTON

Q. You didn't call an ambulance because you were happy to see him injured? Is that right?

A. Happy to what?

Q. You were happy to see him injured. Is that right?

A. No.” (T 124 – 5)


	
	The ambulance came because the plaintiff’s friend Ms Fung, at the plaintiff’s request, rang 000 and an ambulance (Exhibit A tab 21). The unchallenged evidence of the next door neighbor was, it should be recalled, that “during this time Georges stayed in the same spot on the grass and Martin continued to wash his car” (Exhibit C, paragraph 11). Not only was he no danger to the defendant, but he was obviously seriously injured. It is indicative of the defendant’s state of mind that he ignored the plaintiff’s condition and went on washing his car (I do not accept his evidence that he was polishing his car).
	
	
	It was next put to the defendant that he had sworn a defence containing a similarly untruthful account of these events, and one which was inconsistent with the version he now gave from the witness box:
	


“Q. Now part of your defence says this, ""The occupier"" - so this is referring to the property, 64 Endeavour Street, it says, ""The occupier was requesting George before 21 December 2012 not return to the property during the period that the owner of the property was overseas since the occupier was fearful of George's aggressive nature."" That's what you wrote in your defence, isn't it?

A. Mm.

…

Q. But your son never said to you that he was fearful of the plaintiff, did he?

A. No, he said‑‑

Q. He never said that to police either, did he?

A. No the police, yeah. I, I don't, I don't think he, he talk to the police.

Q. See that's just something you made up, isn't it?

A. No. I, I‑‑

Q. You made it up to try and make the plaintiff look bad, didn't you?

A. No, because I tell you why, on that day after I left - because you know first time I met George, early December, I was talking to my son in the porch. He come straight and get me out. After that my son saw he's, he's saw aggress(as said) towards me and he finish all the garden job already. Why he come here just for watering the garden? My son told him he - my son can water the garden by himself. He doesn't need to come to the property again because Amy come back from overseas.

Q. Your son never said to you that the plaintiff had an aggressive nature, did he?

A. No he said, he, he, he‑‑

Q. He didn't say that to police either, did he?

A. No he, he - just for that time he, he said - he - why he so aggressive?

Q. It's just something you've made up, isn't it?

A. No.

Q. You made it up to try and make the plaintiff look bad, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. Another part of your defence says this, ""What I did was defensively push him away from me to avoid further assault from him. He tripped over and hit the ground presumably breaking his leg. These facts were witnessed by the occupier as well."" That’s what you wrote, isn't it?

A. I think so, yeah.

Q. But the occupier, that is your son, never said to you that he witnessed those things, did he?

A. Sorry?

Q. Your son never said to you that he witnessed the plaintiff tripping over, did he?

A. No he, he, he didn't see this part.

Q. Yet in your defence you said, ""These facts were witnessed by the occupier as well,"" didn't you?

A. No the - I mean is push by, by George. Not trip over.

Q. That's not what it says sir. It says, ""What I did was defensively push him away from me to avoid further assaults from him. He tripped over and hit the ground presumably breaking his leg. These facts were witnessed by the occupier as well.""

A. Yeah, some of these facts, yeah. Because he, he saw I have been pushed by him, water - spray water on me, all have been witnessed.

Q. See you were trying to make it look like your son had witnessed everything, weren't you?

A. No. Because this just - a what - brief statement, it's not in detail at that time. I don't know how to do it, a detail statement.” (T 126 – 8)


	
	The text of this defence paints a picture of the plaintiff and his son seeing the plaintiff trip over and hit the ground. However, in the ERISP, the defendant stated that he did not see how the plaintiff fell down when he was pushed (T 108 – 109). In neither of these accounts is there a description of the plaintiff catching his left foot in the base of the palm tree and falling down with his left leg impacting on one of the retaining wall stones, after causing the defendant to fall over an arch himself, which was how he described these events to the court:
	


“A. It's not, not, not a fighting you know, it's a push. Not fighting. It's a suddenly push. I, I don't expect he - I, I would not expect he will - walks to me and push me. I, I don't have any preparation.

Q. He never pushed you, did he?

A. No. That's not true.

Q. Now you say you fell over this arch.

A. Yeah.

Q. You say you fell over in about the middle of the arch?

A. You know the, the bend, the arch - the photo. I, I damage that—

…

Q. This is on photograph 3? Yes that's where I'm looking. You're saying it's broken there, is it?

A. Yeah, due to my fall, the brick was broken.” (T 102).


	
	However, the defendant did give an account to Senior Constable Catto which refers to the plaintiff as coming “to push me”, whereupon he “fell over on here”, at which time the defendant “fell over there”, pointing to a whole. He goes on to say:
	


“And then, and then when I fell over here, he comes here, he comes here, and , and then, I stand, I stand up and push him, that’s why he…that’s he…he’s fell [sic] over.”


	
	The defendant points to the hole that is still there where he fell. His description of the plaintiff is one of the plaintiff falling over when the defendant pushes him. There is some evidence of marks at the base of the palm tree (see the video walkthrough at 2.00 – 2.05 minutes). The question of whether these were made by the plaintiff’s fall is an issue which I have considered in the section of this judgment dealing with the expert evidence.
	


Did the plaintiff spray water on the defendant?


	
	As noted above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not deliberately spray water on the defendant. The most likely explanation is that the defendant was accidentally sprayed by the hose in the plaintiff’s hand at the time the dispute began.
	


Did the plaintiff yell at the defendant before or after the incident?


	
	As is set out above, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff continued to “yell” at him in Chinese:
	


“You are a useless shit man. You completely rely on your ex-wife. It was not fair that you took two houses from the divorce. I am the judge to make it fair today for Amy and you will go to jail when the police arrive”.


	
	Mr Khan, the next door neighbour, came out on his balcony and had a conversation with the plaintiff. He had his daughter call the police then went back outside onto the balcony and waited for the police to arrive, only going inside when they did. He did not describe any such yelling in his statement and was not cross-examined on it. He was in too much pain to speak to police by the time the ambulance arrived at 2.23 pm, according to Senior Constable Catto (T 147) and it seems unlikely in any event that he was able to do so.
	
	
	As previously noted, I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not yell these abusive words after the incident as alleged. I am similarly satisfied that he did not “yell” abuse at the defendant beforehand. This is a relatively minor issue, as both parties made mistakes in their evidence, but I am satisfied that there is a consistent pattern in the defendant’s evidence of painting the plaintiff as a belligerent person when that was not in fact the case.
	


The evidence of the defendant’s son, Maan Wong


	
	Maan Wong is the son of Ms Chui and the defendant. On the day in question he was inside the house studying, wearing headphones and listening to music. He claims to have witnessed all but ten seconds or so of the incident, and supports his father’s account of these events. He described these in his statement as follows:
	


“9. At or around 2:00pm, I heard yelling from the front yard. I looked outside the window and saw the plaintiff in the front yard with a hose in his hand. The plaintiff and the defendant were yelling at each other, however, I was unable to hear what they were saying because I had headphones on.

10. I saw the plaintiff walk towards the defendant with the hose in his hand from the opposite side of the front yard. The defendant stopped next to the top part of the brick arch in the front yard. The plaintiff then raised the hose, pointed it at the defendant and began to spray the defendant and his car with water.

11. The defendant began walking towards the plaintiff. The plaintiff suddenly threw the hose on the ground near the brick arch and rushed towards the defendant. The plaintiff then raised his arm and pushed the defendant in his chest, causing the defendant to fall over the stone arch.

12. I immediately ran to the front door to go outside and, accordingly, I lost sight of the plaintiff and the defendant for approximately ten (10) seconds.

13. I arrived outside and saw the plaintiff sitting on the ground next to the retaining wall and a palm tree in the front yard. The defendant was standing near the front porch, roughly three (3) meters from the plaintiff.

14. Upon seeing me arrive, the defendant asked me to hand him my mobile phone so that he could call the police. The defendant then called the police and I went to the tap to turn off the water hose.

15. I heard the plaintiff yelling at the defendant in Chinese. Specifically, I heard the plaintiff say “You are a shit man and you can’t live without your ex-wife’s money”, “You should not be entitled to two (2) houses from the divorce”, “Amy was so stupid” and “I am the judge for Amy today. You will be in jail as soon as the police come” (this is the closest English translation I am able to provide).”


	
	Before dealing with the issues about which Mr Maan Wong was cross-examined, I should note the chronology of events that are not in dispute:
	



	
	The plaintiff called out “Help me, help me, somebody call the police please” according to Mr Khan (Exhibit C, paragraph 6), which caused Mr Khan to go onto the balcony and observe the plaintiff on the grass, after the assault was over;
	
	
	When Mr Khan came out and saw the plaintiff, he said he would ring up, went inside and asked his daughter to do so;
	
	
	At 1:58:40 pm, the plaintiff makes a 23-second call to Ms Fung to ask her to call the police and an ambulance (see the plaintiff’s mobile phone records, Exhibit A, tab 21);
	
	
	When Maan Wong arrived outside, his father asked him for his mobile phone. He went back inside and fetched it, and at 2:00:21 pm the defendant used that phone to telephone the police (Exhibit A tab 23, page 3);
	
	
	At this stage the plaintiff was, according to Maan Wong and the defendant, lying on the ground calling out abuse.
	



	
	Mr Stretton submits that:
	



	
	Maan Wong says he saw the plaintiff spray his father and then rush towards him (statement, Exhibit 6, tab 11, paragraphs 8 and 10). He describes his attention being drawn by loud shouting. The only loud shouting Mr Khan heard was the plaintiff’s calls after the event;
	
	
	If Maan Wong had seen the parties just prior to the assault, and the assault start to happen, he would have seen all of the other events which followed the incident. However, his statement is silent as to seeing the plaintiff’s conversation with Mr Khan, or Mr Khan’s presence, or the plaintiff telephoning anyone, all of which are events which certainly occurred;
	
	
	If Maan Wong arrived outside at or shortly before 2 pm, this was after the plaintiff’s call to Ms Fung, which was in turn after his conversation with Mr Khan. The incident was already over by the time that the plaintiff was calling out to Mr Khan, and well over by the time that the plaintiff called Ms Fung. Not only does this suggest that Maan Wong arrived too late, but the part of the event that he missed while exiting the house could not have been the part that he says he missed;
	
	
	Mr Khan makes no mention of seeing Maan Wong at all, and was not cross-examined about this.
	



	
	All of the contemporaneous evidence points to Maan Wong having come outside at the end of the assault, returning to the house briefly to obtain his mobile phone, in which case he could not have seen what provoked it.
	
	
	In cross-examination Maan Wong said he had seen an altercation to the point where the plaintiff had pushed over his father and that he then rushed out of the house (T 169). He described what happened in the next few seconds:
	


“Q. When you rushed outside from the computer room, you saw your dad there and George there as well?

A. Yep.

Q. Your dad, when you rushed out, turned around and saw you and asked for your phone to call triple-0, something like that?

A. Yes. Yeah.

Q. What did he say to you when he asked for your phone? Did he say “Maan, I need to call triple-0”, or something like that?

A. He said I’m to go in and get my phone to call the police.

Q. How did he sound when he was saying that? Was he relaxed and calm, or something else?A. He was saying it, I guess it was as you would - I’m not really sure, sorry.

Q. Did you then rush in and get your phone, did you?

A. Yeah.

Q. Was that in the computer room?

A. Yep.

Q. So you rushed in and got that? It would have taken a few seconds I suppose?

A. Yeah.” (T 170)


	
	He told the court he had been in the computer room, close to the front door.
	
	
	This evidence clearly paints a picture of Maan Wong entering and returning to the house in a rush after seeing his father pushed, and returning with the mobile phone, all within the space of about a minute, whereupon his father made the call at 2:00:21. However, the incident had occurred several minutes prior to the plaintiff’s phone call of 1:58:40 pm. His father had not been pushed at 1:59 pm, or 1:58 pm, or even 1:57 pm, given the time Mr Khan took to go outside and hear the plaintiff’s repeated cries and have a conversation with him.
	
	
	If Maan Wong was standing by his father when he made the 000 call, he would have known that the information his father was giving to the police was incorrect. Maan Wong knew that the plaintiff had been coming to the property several times a week to do odd jobs for his mother (T 173). He admitted as much in the statement to police (T 174-175), saying:
	


“My mother went back to China about 1 – 2 months ago for a holiday. My mother organised for a family friend, Georges, to come to our house and do some garden maintenance”. (Exhibit 6, tab 11)


	
	However, the evidence in his statement in these proceedings was very different:
	


“By November 2012 the plaintiff had competed the painting tasks he was hired to do.

In or around early December 2012, the plaintiff attended the Property to water the garden. On this occasion, I reminded the plaintiff that he had completed the tasks he was hired to do, and informed the plaintiff that I would be able to water the garden until my mother returned from overseas.

In light of the above, on this occasion, I explicitly told the plaintiff not to return to the property.” (Exhibit 6, tab 4, paragraphs 6 – 8)


	
	Maan Wong’s answers in cross-examination about this inconsistency were unconvincing:
	


“A. Your answer was “My mother organised for a family friend, George, to come to our house and do some garden maintenance”?

A. Yep.

Q. That was your answer?

A. Yep.

Q. You didn’t say to the policeman that George wasn’t meant to be there?

A. No, I didn’t say it, yeah.

Q. You didn’t say that. You didn’t say to the policeman “Oh this guy George was coming to do some gardening but I already told him not to come back to the property”?

A. No I didn’t tell him that.

Q. You never told George not to come back to the property, did you?

A. I did.

Q. When you were describing George to the policeman, you didn’t say George was aggressive, did you?A. No. He didn’t ask.

Q. There’s nothing in your statement about George being aggressive, is there?

A. No, not in the - no.

Q. You never said to him that you thought George was aggressive or had an aggressive nature, did you?

A. No I didn’t tell the police officer that.

Q. You didn’t say to the policeman that you were afraid of George, did you?

A. No I didn’t say that to him.

Q. You weren’t afraid of George, were you?

A. I was a little bit.

Q. You’ve never told anyone you’re afraid of George, have you?

A. Not really.

Q. This whole thing in your statement about telling George not to come back to the property, that’s just not true, is it?

A. I did tell him not to come back from a previous incident.

Q. Sorry?

A. I told him after a previous incident.

Q. I suggest to you it’s something you’ve just made up to try and help your father’s case. What do you say?

A. That’s not true.

Q. You think it’ll help your father’s case if you say that George was trespassing, don’t you?

A. I don’t know.” (T 174 – 5)


	
	He was also asked about a similar claim by the defendant in an earlier defence:
	


“Q. Just to refer you to the next paragraph, which begins “Firstly” and then the end of the third line down from that it says “The occupier”, meaning you--

A. Right.

Q. --“was requesting George (before 21/12/2012) not return to the property during the period that the owner of the property was overseas, since the occupier was fearful of George’s aggressive nature.”

A. Right.

Q. Do you recall reading that before?A. I think so.

Q. In other words this defence, this document that’s in front of you now is saying that you told George not to come back to the property but he came back anyway, therefore he was trespassing?

A. Right, yep.

Q. So is this the sequence of events, just so it's clear, when you speak to the policeman on 21 December 2012, you don't mention anything about George trespassing?

A. Yeah.” (T 177)


	
	These are substantial inconsistencies which must cause serious doubt as to Maan Wong’s credibility. The whole of his evidence, and not only his assertion of having seen the commencement of the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant, is unreliable and inconsistent. Some of this may be due to his concern about the impact of this litigation on his father. His demeanour in the witness box was that of a person under great stress; he looked anxious, spoke slowly and apparently reluctantly, and generally appeared ill at ease.
	
	
	Taking all of the above into account, I would not accept the evidence of Maan Wong unless it was corroborated.
	
	
	Senior Constable Catto was also called by the defendant to give evidence. Does his evidence provide corroboration to the defendant’s claim of the plaintiff turning the hose on him and then injuring himself?
	


The evidence of Senior Constable Michael Catto


	
	Senior Constable Catto was a Constable at the time of these events and was stationed at Blacktown Police Station. He was called to the scene, together with Senior Constable Drew Henry Johnston to investigate a possible assault. Senior Constable Johnston talked to the plaintiff and Senior Constable Catto spoke to the defendant. According to paragraph 7 of his statement of evidence (Exhibit 4), the defendant said words to the effect:
	


“He [the plaintiff] sprayed me [with] a hose and then pushed me over the bricks in the front yard. Then he approached me and adopted a fighting stance. Then I stood up and pushed him over.”


	
	Senior Constable Catto has recorded his observations of the following (Exhibit 4, paragraph 8):
	



	
	The defendant’s shirt was wet on the bottom right-hand side;
	
	
	The defendant’s shorts were wet on the top right-hand side;
	
	
	The defendant’s car had a number of droplets on the outside and inside where the defendant claimed to have been standing when he was allegedly sprayed by the plaintiff with a hose;
	
	
	There were marks on the ground consistent with where the defendant stated he was pushed by the plaintiff; and,
	
	
	The defendant’s legs contained a number of scratches that appeared to be recent as they were slightly bleeding.
	



	
	Senior Constable Catto called an ambulance and the plaintiff was taken to Blacktown Hospital. He then conducted a video recording of the defendant’s version of events, which he notes at paragraph 10 of Exhibit 4 was the same as the version he had initially told him. That version is as follows:
	


Constable Catto: “Constable Catto from Blacktown Police and can you just say your name for the recording.”

Martin Wong: “Ah…”

Constable Catto: “What’s your name?”

Martin Wong: “Wong, Wong.”

Constable Catto: “First name?”

Martin Wong: “Zak Wong.”

Constable Catto: “And date of birth?”

Martin Wong: “Twenty October sixty five.”

Constable Catto: “Yep, so you understand I’m recording this now all right?”

Martin Wong: “Yep.”

Constable Catto: “So you were standing there, and OK … go through, what, what were you doing there?”

Martin Wong: “I just polish … and then he, guy comes in, he, firstly he watered here first and then come, lift the hose up, spray, he, when he come to water the garden he first said “You have to go out, you don’t have the rights to come in this property, you are a bloody man to treat your ex-wife rar rar rar rar or something … and you have to go out”, and then I said “You are the person to go out, not me.” I said “Stop doing watering on me”, still doing that to me.”

Constable Catto: “So he was watering you?”

Martin Wong: “Yeah, he come to water here …”

Constable Catto: “Yeah”

Martin Wong: “In the car, and the car as well … the other officer can witness the wet inside.”

Constable Catto: “So he sprayed you?”

Martin Wong: “Sprayed me”

Constable Catto: “And your car?”

Martin Wong: “in the car too.”

Constable Catto: “Yep, and then what happened?”

Martin Wong: “And then I said “Stop doing this to me”, I get close there…”

Constable Catto: “So you’ve walked towards him?”

Martin Wong: “Yep, roughly like that. Yeah, he he … just here”

Constable Catto: “Yep”

Martin Wong: “Roughly I walk here. He roughly stand here and then I get closer and I said “Stop doing this to me”, and then he suddenly throw the hose on the, on the ground…”

Constable Catto: “Yep”

Martin Wong: “and then come to push me … fell over on here.”

Constable Catto: “Yep”

Martin Wong: “And then I hurt all my legs.”

Constable Catto: “Yep, so I’ll just get that. Yep, so you’ve fallen over, over that.”

Martin Wong: “Fell over there.”

Constable Catto: “Yeah, then what?”

Martin Wong: “You can, you can still see the hole there, you can … the hole.”

Constable Catto: “Yep.”

Martin Wong: “And then, and then when I fell over here, he come here, he come here … and, and then I, I stand, I stand up and push him, that’s why he … that’s he … he’s fell over.”

Constable Catto: “He’s fallen there.”

Martin Wong: “That’s the story, that’s it.”


	
	On 22 December 2012 Senior Constable Catto attended Blacktown Hospital and conducted an electronic interview with the plaintiff. He describes the interview in paragraphs 11 and 12 of Exhibit 4:
	


“11. On 22 December 2012, I attended Blacktown Hospital and conducted an electronic interview with the plaintiff in relation to the Incident (the “Interview”). During the Interview, I recall the plaintiff saying words to the effect:

“He [the defendant] rushed towards me, pushed me over and stomped on my leg.”

I recall saying words to the effect:

“Zak [the defendant] said you sprayed him with a hose.”

I recall the plaintiff responding with words to the effect:

“I did not. The Police saw that he [the defendant] was dry.”

12. After the electronic recording had finished, I recall saying words to the effect:

“He [the defendant] was wet when I interviewed him.”

At this time, the plaintiff changed his version of events and said words to the effect:

“I saw him [the defendant] wet himself.””


	
	As Senior Constable Catto notes at paragraph 13, the electronic recording of the interview was unable to be saved due to damage of the personal recording device that was used.
	
	
	On 23 January 2013, Senior Constable Catto attended the home address of the plaintiff and obtained a 9-page statement in his official police notebook number F540519. On this occasion, Senior Constable Catto was assisted by an accredited interpreter, Ms Queenie Liu. He notes in paragraph 14 of Exhibit 4 that:
	


“This version was the same as the plaintiff had supplied at the hospital.”


	
	Senior Constable Catto was called to give evidence (T 142 ff). He agreed that he had made the statement (Exhibit 4) seven months after the incident “Basically based on the notebook” (T 145) but still had a good recollection of the events in question.
	
	
	Senior Constable Catto was cross-examined about the recording of the plaintiff’s answer as “I saw him wet himself” as follows:
	


“Q. You also indicate that after you’d stopped the recording you said to the plaintiff, “When I saw the defendant he was wet”?

A. Yes.

Q. The plaintiff responded to your suggestion and you say the plaintiff said words to the effect, “I saw him wet himself”?

A. Yes.

Q. That was a conversation two and a half years ago, do you agree?

A. Yes.

Q. It would be very hard to recall the exact words that were spoken?

A. I agree.

Q. Do you accept that you can’t recall whether he specifically used the words, “I saw” in his response?

A. Yeah, I, I - it’s only a recollection of what I remember of the conversation. The exact words may have been different.

Q. Can I suggest this as a possibility that you said, “He was wet when I interviewed him,” and he said, “He wet himself”?

A. That could be, yes.

Q. Meaning, “Well, I didn’t do it so he must have done it himself”?

A. Yeah, I can’t recall the exact conversation so that could be a possibility.” (T 149-150)


	
	This is an appropriate concession for Senior Constable Catto to make. I consider that this was in fact what the plaintiff said, or meant.
	
	
	Senior Constable Catto gave evidence in a neutral and fair manner. For example, when asked whether the disturbance of the ground underneath the palm tree (of which he took several photographs), could have been made by ambulance officers, he indicated simply that he could not say. The impression I gained of his evidence was that he wished to be of assistance to the court and was not partisan to either of the parties in this litigation. However, his role was simply to record the conflicting statements of the parties and to note relevant evidence. His evidence, while reliable, is not supportive of the defendant’s version of events.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the expert evidence of both parties concerning the mechanics of the plaintiff’s injury.
	


Expert evidence as to the manner of injury


	
	Both the plaintiff and defendant called expert evidence as to the mechanics of the fall. As noted at the beginning of this judgment, as these proceedings were case-managed only by consent timetables, no consideration was given, prior to the hearing, to these experts giving concurrent evidence, and it was not possible to arrange at the trial as it was simply too late to do so.
	
	
	The starting point for consideration of the evidence is the expert witness statement of Dr Bachar Hajyounes of 17 July 2013 (Exhibit A, tab 12). Dr Hajyounes, who was not required for cross-examination, was the RMO at Blacktown Hospital when the plaintiff was brought in, but he did not examine or take a history from the plaintiff. He did, however, review the notes and X-rays and, based on his RMO experience, opined:
	


On review of the notes and the xrays, it is my opinion that he has an oblique fracture of the femur. The cause of the injury is most likely a direct high energy trauma. There is no obvious osteoporosis on xray.

I do not believe this fracture is likely to be a result of a fall from standing height.”


	
	The plaintiff called Associate Professor Nigel Hope, an orthopaedic surgeon, who provided the court with two reports dated 1 April and 14 October 2014. His opinion was that the plaintiff suffered a midshaft femoral fracture “as a result of directed trauma to the middle of the thigh” and that this injury “did not result from a fall.” A bone density test dated 4 June 2014 (carried out after Associate Professor Hope’s first report) confirmed that the plaintiff did not have osteoporosis. He noted in his first report the plaintiff’s description that the defendant “stomped” on the plaintiff’s left femur. In his second report, he explained the mechanism of the fracture and how it could not have been caused by a fall.
	
	
	Subsequent to these reports, the defendant served reports from Dr Neil Berry, a general surgeon, who agreed that mid-shaft femoral fractures are normally associated with direct trauma, with the bone breaking at the point of impact, but doubted that a “stomp” could break someone’s femur, because the thigh muscles would cushion the impact. In addition, he had not heard of such cases occurring. He considered that the plaintiff’s short oblique fracture indicated a combination of twisting and falling. The fracture therefore indicated the plaintiff’s foot was caught, and he then fell onto something, resulting in the leg breaking (it was never explained, however, how this could occur without some kind of injury to the left foot also occurring).
	
	
	Associate Professor Hope, in cross-examination, AP Hope agreed that if the plaintiff’s foot had become caught against a palm tree and he then fell with his mid-thigh bone coming into contact with a low raised brick or stone, that could cause a midshaft femoral fracture of the kind he sustained. The mechanics of the plaintiff’s injury could, therefore, be explained in accordance with the defendant’s version of injury, as well as in accordance with the plaintiff’s description.
	
	
	A great deal of time in cross-examination and submissions was spent in argument about which of the two experts had better or more relevant qualifications, whether they had consulted the correct texts, whether they had sufficient experience of injuries of this kind and whether they had seen enough patients to warrant giving the opinions that they did. I found this to be of little assistance. Both experts are able to express opinions as to the mechanics of the fall, and both agree that the particular fracture pattern the plaintiff sustained (which was diagnosed after he had told ambulance officers, Ms Fung and possibly also Senior Constable Catto that the defendant had jumped or stomped on his leg) confirm the occurrence of direct high energy trauma to the fracture site.
	
	
	The issue of the mechanics of the fall can readily be resolved on the facts as having occurred when the defendant stomped or jumped on the plaintiff’s leg, because:
	



	
	The plaintiff told the ambulance officers that he tried to get up but was unable to move. Associate Professor Hope stated that movement with such a fracture was impossible. The place where the plaintiff fell was some distance from the stones upon which the defendant claims he had fallen.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave consistent evidence to every person, ranging from the ambulance officer to Ms Fung to the hospital, as well as in his statement, that the defendant had jumped on his leg. By comparison, as counsel for the defendant points out in his written submissions, the versions of events given by the defendant do not refer to the fall on the wall until after he was served with the report of Dr Hajyounes (written submissions, paragraph 61).
	
	
	I must exercise great caution when interpreting photographs (Blacktown City Council v Hocking [2008] NSWCA 144 at [149], [167] – [171]), although the value of expert evidence as to marks on palm trees are uncertain. Of more assistance is the description by ambulance officers that they found the plaintiff sitting up on the grass with his left leg bent underneath him (Exhibit A tab 1 p 2). The unchallenged evidence of Mr Khan was that the plaintiff’s feet were “just over a metre from the base of the palm tree and his body was about 2 or 3 metres from the palm tree” (Exhibit C, p. 7), not across the stone blocks where the defendant claimed the plaintiff fell, and too far from the palm tree to have caught his foot, given that the plaintiff would be unable to move any distance with such a fracture. Senior Constable Catto also confirmed that the plaintiff was sitting on the grass in the position shown in the photograph taken of the plaintiff’s solicitor sitting in such a spot (T 145 – 6).
	


Conclusions as to the manner of injury


	
	The accounts given by the plaintiff, the defendant and the defendant’s son appear to suggest three scenarios:
	



	
	The incident occurred as the plaintiff described, namely there was a “stomp” on his leg while he laid on the ground which was without provocation;
	
	
	The incident occurred as the defendant described, in that the defendant did not “stomp” on the plaintiff’s leg but pushed him, in self-defence, in circumstances where the plaintiff’s fall on the stone wall resulted in the injury;
	
	
	A mix of the two accounts, such as a “stomp” with provocation (namely the account given by the defendant and his son but containing a “stomp”).
	



	
	The following should be noted:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s account has consistently been that the defendant “stomped” on his leg and broke it; this was his account both to the ambulance officers and to Ms Fung, as well as to Senior Constable Catto the following day at the hospital and in the subsequent interview with an interpreter (T 148), as well as his evidence in these proceedings, both in his statement and in cross-examination.
	
	
	All of the medical evidence confirms that a fracture of this nature requires direct high energy trauma to the fractured site.
	
	
	The ambulance records and Mr Khan’s evidence described the plaintiff as sitting on the grass with his feet just over a metre from the base of the palm tree and with his body about 2-3 metres from the palm tree (Exhibit C, paragraph 7). I am satisfied that he did not move once his femur was broken. In those circumstances, he could not have hit his left thigh on the stone wall as claimed.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s call for help was answered by Mr Khan, whose observations (including his observation of the defendant continuing to wash his car, his failure to observe the defendant’s son in the yard and his failure to recall hearing the plaintiff continuing to yell abuse) are central to the fact finding in this case.
	
	
	Whether or not the defendant did fall over the brick arch, or in some way was injured, in such a way as to cause the scratches that are seen in the photographs, this could not have happened in the course of the plaintiff’s fall to the ground.
	



	
	Having regard to each of the matters set out above, independently of any finding as to credit, and independently of the expert evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff could not have fallen on the stone wall as alleged, and that he did not catch his foot on the palm tree as alleged, and that the cause of the accident is the version the plaintiff gave within minutes of the incident, namely that the defendant “stomped” on his leg, causing it to break.
	
	
	The defendant conceded that at no stage could he have any reason to stomp on the plaintiff’s leg if he was in fact lying on the ground:
	


“Q. You say you never stomped on his leg, correct?

A. Never. Never.

Q. You agree that you never had any reason to stomp on his leg, I understand you say you didn't do it, but I'm putting to you that you never had any reason to do it either.

A. Yeah, I don't have reason to stomp on his leg.” (T 118)


	
	Accordingly, if the defendant did stomp on the plaintiff’s leg while he was lying on the ground, it was an assault and battery for which the defendant must be liable.
	
	
	Even if there had been some form of provocation by the plaintiff preceding the stomp, namely spraying the defendant with water or pushing him over the arch or both, while that may reduce the award of damages, it is not a defence to the claim for assault and battery, as counsel for the plaintiff points out in his written submissions, citing Fontin v Katapodis (1962) 108 CLR 177.
	
	
	Mr Stretton goes on to submit (written submissions, paragraph 81) that if the plaintiff’s leg was broken through a push and not a stomp, I would still not be satisfied that the push was in self-defence. The defendant had plenty of means of escape or avoidance of the plaintiff, and had no need to step towards the plaintiff and push him. It is submitted that by failing to avoid the confrontation, a finding of self-defence is not available (Fontin v Katapodis at 182 and 186).
	
	
	For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the assault occurred in the manner described by the plaintiff, and that the injury the plaintiff suffered to his femur occurred as a result of the defendant jumping or “stomping” on his leg. If I have erred in this finding, I am nevertheless satisfied that any response by the defendant to the plaintiff was not in self-defence, and that by failing to avoid the confrontation a finding of self-defence is not available.
	


Conclusions as to credit


	
	Although my findings arise principally from my acceptance of the contemporaneous documentary and evidentiary support of the plaintiff’s case, findings of credit have played a part. Counsel for the defendant mounted a sustained attack on the plaintiff’s credit. I summarise the issues raised as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s account of the incident;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s alleged dishonesty in relation to the first interview with Senior Constable Catto;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s financial dishonesty;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s demeanour and general unreliability as a witness.
	



	
	I have dealt with all these issues above except the claim that the plaintiff is financially dishonest in that he was working for Ms Chui for cash while claiming a pension for the period June to December 2012. Additionally, while he was employed as a cleaner, he occasionally carried out handyman job, for cash.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s denial of knowledge that he had breached the reporting obligations (T 17) was submitted to be further evidence of dishonesty. The plaintiff is a man of very limited education and English, who at the time of the incident had resided in Australia for six years. His lack of understanding of reporting obligations is understandable in such circumstances. It is not to his credit that he has carried out odd jobs for cash, and I have taken that into account concerning his credibility, but I do not consider his evidence to have been untruthful otherwise.
	


Conclusions as to liability


	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered the injuries complained of as a result of the defendant’s assault and battery.
	
	
	This brings me to a consideration of the quantum of the claim.
	


Quantum


	
	The plaintiff claims general damages, interest, past and future out of pocket expenses, past and future care and past and future economic loss.

	Scarring of the left leg.
	



	
	The particulars of continuing disabilities are pleaded as follows:

	The defendant estimated non-economic loss as $75,000 together with interest ($1,850). Past out of pocket expenses at $575 were agreed. The only other item allowed by the defendant was a modest sum for future out of pocket expenses ($10,000) making a total of $87,425.
	
	
	I shall deal with each of the heads of damage in turn.
	


General damages


	
	The plaintiff, who was born in 1949 and is currently 65 years of age, was born and lived all of his life except the last nine years in Port Vila, Vanuatu. His education in Vanuatu was only to the end of primary school. He has spoken Cantonese for the whole of his adult life and speaks some limited French and about the same amount of English.
	
	
	Having been granted permanent residency in Australia in December 2006, he worked at a smash repairer’s yard for two years repairing vehicles for approximately $500 per week, as a restaurant kitchen hand for less than a year, and, between September 2010 and October 2012, as a cleaner, earning $255 per week before tax (Exhibit B, paragraphs 41-43).
	
	
	Although he is divorced, he returned to live with his former wife and their two sons in 2012 to help care for her as she was diagnosed with cancer. I understand she passed away during the adjournment of this hearing.
	
	
	After the plaintiff stopped working as a cleaner, he worked casually as a self-employed handyman, essentially for friends and through word of mouth. He said he thought he earned $350 per week from these jobs, but as the job was cash in hand and he did not keep records, this is uncertain.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s injury was a significant factor which Associate Professor Hope considered caused a moderate functional loss. He summarised the plaintiff’s ongoing disabilities as follows:
	



	
	Left femoral pain and weakness;
	
	
	Loss of the ability to ascend and descend hills, lift more than 5 kgs, and limitations of sitting and standing time;
	
	
	Left leg scarring, painful walking pattern, quadriceps weakens and wasting and a mildly stiff left hip; and,
	
	
	Sleep disturbance and rest pain requiring Panadol four days a week.
	



	
	Associate Professor Hope noted that there was no evidence of exaggeration, symptom fabrication or functional overlay. His condition was stabilised and would not improve.
	
	
	Dr Peter Klug, a forensic psychiatrist, provided a report as follows:
	


“From a psychiatric perspective, Mr. Wong is suffering from a chronic adjustment disorder with mixed features of anxiety and depression. An adjustment disorder is not a major mood disturbance but is nevertheless a significant psychiatric entity characterised by excessive distress and/or dysfunction in response to a significant stressor or stressors. In Mr. Wong’s case the stressors are the experience of the incident itself plus the consequences of the incident.

There are features of a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder but, from the history I obtained, his symptoms are insufficient to meet the full criteria. It is possible that he suffered from a full post-traumatic stress disorder and that his symptoms are in partial remission.” (Emphasis given by Dr Klug)


	
	As a witness, the plaintiff struggled to express himself about these ongoing problems. He clearly found the issues difficult to talk about. He has described, in his statement, his condition since the accident as follows:
	


“25. Since the incident I have had constant pain in my left thigh (towards the knee, in the middle and towards the hip). My left hip is also stiff. I did not have these problems before the incident.

26. The pain in my thigh gets worse if sit, stand or walk for long periods. It is also painful to do household tasks such as lawn mowing, vacuuming, cleaning and shopping. I was able to do these activities without any trouble before the incident.

27. I now take Panadol daily to help with my thigh pain, and sometimes I take sleeping tablets (Circadin) to help me sleep, but I try not to depend on sleeping tablets. Because of the pain, it is hard to sleep without medication. I did not need regular painkillers or sleeping medication before the incident.

28. Even with medication, I still wake up in pain sometimes during the night, and I continue to have recurrent nightmares. I also have intense “flashback” experiences to the incident, which cause me a lot of distress. I also find myself preoccupied with the incident at other times, and I have a general sense of being very disappointed, which I did not have before the incident.

29. Since the incident I have found it hard to concentrate and remember things. I have to try harder to stay focused on things. I also have recurrent headaches. I did not have any of these problems before the incident.

30. I am now very self-conscious about the way I look because of my limp and other problems since the incident. I think of myself as a disabled person now.

31. I used to enjoy regular social outings to places like Cabramatta, Darling Harbour and the Opera House. I used to go on these outings when I had free time, about 2 or 3 times a month. I don’t go on those outings anymore, because I am self-conscious about my limp. Also, walking is painful and I can’t walk at a normal pace, so I am worried about slowing friends down if I walk with them.

32. I also feel distressed and disappointed about the police investigation into the incident. The police did not press charges against the defendant and I feel this is unjust.”


	
	Ms Fung confirmed that he had withdrawn from social events since the incident (Exhibit A, tab 21, paragraphs 3, 10 and 11).
	
	
	Damages for an assault involving a fractured leg are, counsel for the plaintiff submits, generally compensated by an award of general damages of between $90,000 and $120,000. I must be careful, when assessing damages, not to err on the high side of the award by reason of there being no claim for aggravated or exemplary damages (the reason for this is that no particulars of these damages was provided in the statement of claim, apparently by oversight). The plaintiff has substantially recovered from the accident, in part because of his good attitude towards his health and well-being, as Associate Professor Hope notes. I am of the view that the $75,000 proposed by the defendant is too low, and that an award for general damages should be in the sum of $90,000. In making this award, I also take into account the plaintiff’s age (Reece v Reece (1994) 19 MVR 103).
	
	
	Interest on this sum is agreed to be $2,250. I shall, however, leave the calculation of the interest sum to the parties, as the hearing of these proceedings had to be adjourned by reason of inadequate listing time provided by the parties to the court.
	


Past and future out-of-pocket expenses


	
	Past out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $575.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims future out-of-pocket expenses for pain medication, removal of the femoral nail, ongoing counselling and devices to assist him in the home (for which there is an occupational therapist report prepared by Ms Mullen dated 30 May 2014). There is considerable debate about whether the femoral nail should be removed. I propose to adjust the sum claimed to regard this as being a probability rather than a certainty and I accordingly round down future out-of-pocket expenses to the sum of $20,000.
	


Domestic assistance (past and future)


	
	The entitlement to domestic assistance must be demonstrated by careful analysis of the assistance required in the method explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Sampco Pty Ltd v Wurth [2015] NSWCA 117. In the present case, this has been attended to by the report of Ms Mullen, who made the following findings:
	



	
	The plaintiff reported (at the time of the assessment) constant left hip and knee pain which he rated at 5/10, which “increased to 8/10 after prolonged standing and walking such as when lawn mowing, vacuuming, cleaning and shopping”, but “reduced to 0/10 at night after taking pain medications…and a sleeping tablet”;
	
	
	personal activities of daily living which are impacted by his condition include sitting (prolonged sitting exacerbates the pain), mobility (limp, reduced balance, difficulty crouching/kneeling), showering and dressing (modified technique required), and bed mobility (lying on his left side increases the pain);
	
	
	domestic activities which are impacted include vacuuming (“[u]sed to vacuum entire house in 1 hour but now only does 5 minutes at a time then rests then continues for 5 minutes [sic] periods”), cleaning the bathroom (“[d]ifficulty crouching and kneeling to scrub shower floor and bath”), lawn mowing (“[u]sed to mow for 1 hour straight and do front and backyards [sic], but [n]ow needs lots of rests and take 3 hours over a couple of days…[l]eft hip and knee pain increased after lawn mowing”);
	
	
	The plaintiff “has been unable to return to work… Considering his age, pain and physical limitations, history of manual labour and limited English, finding alternative employment would be difficult”;
	
	
	in the 8 weeks after the incident, the plaintiff received around 18 hours a week of domestic assistance from his ex-wife and sons as he was unable to do household chores;
	
	
	given his limitations, the plaintiff would benefit from a shower grab rail, a recliner lounge chair with elevating leg rest, and a lightweight stick vacuum cleaner; and,
	
	
	The plaintiff also now requires assistance from a commercial care agency for moving furniture and vacuuming (0.5 hours/week), scrubbing the bath and shower (0.5 hours/week), spring cleaning before Chinese New Year (washing windows, cleaning gutters, washing roof – 12 hours annually, 0.23 hours/week), and lawn mowing (0.5 hours/week).
	



	
	Ms Mullen notes that the plaintiff’s current vacuum cleaner and lawnmower use is over his 5 kgs safety limit and that he should not be using them. Similarly, while the plaintiff has told Associate Professor Hope that he could perform all activities of daily living except washing the tiles on his roof, this is clearly an unrealistic assessment of his own abilities. Ms Mullen’s careful report, based on her direct observation of the plaintiff performing relevant tasks, complete with photographs and measurements, demonstrated that a number of activities including moving furniture were functions of the plaintiff should not perform.
	
	
	When considering past and future care, counsel for the plaintiff was careful to take into account the New South Wales Court of Appeal’s warning in Metaxoulis v McDonalds Australia Ltd [2015] NSWCA 95 and to make a significant discount for the fact that this had occurred when the plaintiff was aged 63.
	
	
	The plaintiff should be entitled to past domestic assistance of $5,069. However, having regard to the future, given the plaintiff’s general state of good health and age, I propose to award only a relatively small buffer, and I have accordingly allowed $30,000.
	


Past and future economic loss


	
	The plaintiff suffered his injuries when he was in fact in the course of performing paid work, albeit cash in hand handyman. He enjoyed generally good health prior to the incident and the likelihood that he would continue to supplement his part pension with employment of this nature is high.
	
	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined at some length about his failure to report his income to Centrelink while receiving Centrelink benefits. The plaintiff denied knowingly breaching any reporting obligations (T 17), saying that due to his low income he thought that this was not necessary.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, the plaintiff was a very poorly educated man with little English with only six years’ experience living in Australia. His capacity to earn money part time would at best be pocket money. This is to a degree reflected in the low buffers for past and future economic loss. However, I am of the view that even those buffers are too high. Accordingly, I propose to award the plaintiff the sum of $10,000 as representing both past and future loss of earnings, which I consider would more accurately reflect the value of the work that he would have done in terms of odd jobs for friends or by word of mouth. The total absence of financial records to support the plaintiff’s claim is but one of a series of factors which I have taken into account, as are his age and the range of tasks he would be able to perform in any event. While I note counsel for the plaintiff’s submissions in relation to the test in New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536, the total absence of any documentary evidence is a significant barrier to the plaintiff’s claim.

		18 November 2015",2015-09-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767868,NSW Minister for Mental Health v BB [2015] NSWSC 1418,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	By a summons filed on 24 June 2015 the plaintiff, the Minister for Mental Health of NSW, seeks an order pursuant to Clause 7 of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”) extending the status of the defendant as a forensic patient. Although the summons seeks an extension of 5 years, counsel for the plaintiff informed me at the hearing that an extension of 2 years was now sought.
	
	
	The matter initially came before Adamson J on 30 June 2015 when, following a preliminary hearing, her Honour made an order appointing medical practitioners to conduct examinations of the defendant and furnish reports to the Court. Her Honour also made an Interim Extension Order for a period of 28 days from 1 July 2015. The matter again came before her Honour on 21 July 2015, at which time the Interim Extension Order was renewed for a further period of 28 days from 29 July 2015. The order was then renewed by her Honour for a further period of 28 days from 25 August 2015.
	


A PRELIMINARY ISSUE


	
	At the commencement of the hearing before me, counsel for the defendant made application for an order that there be no publication of the name of the defendant. The plaintiff neither consented to, nor opposed, that application. My attention was drawn to s. 162 of the Mental Health Act 2007 (“the MHA”) which is in the following terms:
	


Publication of names

(1) A person must not, except with the consent of the Tribunal, publish or broadcast the name of any person:

(a) to whom a matter before the Tribunal relates;

(b) who appears as a witness before the Tribunal in any proceedings; or

(c) who is mentioned or otherwise involved in any proceedings under this Act or the Mental Health Forensic Provisions Act 1990

either before or after the hearing is completed.

Maximum penalty:

In the case of an individual – 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months or both; or

In the case of a corporation – 100 penalty units.

(2) This section does not prohibit the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the proceedings of the Tribunal that includes the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by this section.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of the person includes a reference to any information, picture or material that identifies the person or is likely to lead to the identification of the person.


	
	Section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) is in (inter alia) the following terms:
	


Meaning of commonly used words and expressions

(1) In any Act or instrument:

…

“person” includes an individual, a corporation, and a body corporate or politic.


	
	I was referred by counsel for the plaintiff to the decision in Kizon v Palmer (1998) 82 FCR 310. In that case the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia upheld a conclusion of the primary Judge that the word “person” where it was used in provisions of the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979 (Cth) which prohibited the disclosure of material did not apply to, or include, a Court hearing a public interest immunity claim, such that the Judge hearing the claim could examine affidavit material which contained prohibited information.
	
	
	In Attorney-General (NSW) v XY [2014] NSWCA 466, McColl JA concluded (at [186]-[187]) that the making of an order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 prohibiting the publication of the name of the defendant was not necessary in light of s. 162 of the MHA which, her Honour accepted, applied to proceedings in the Court of Appeal. In those circumstances her Honour concluded that it was appropriate that the Court’s judgment not use the Respondent’s name.
	
	
	More recently in Sarah White v Local Health Authority [2015] NSWSC 417, Slattery J noted (at [3]) that some of the parties to the proceedings before the Court were parties to proceedings before the Mental Health Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). His Honour concluded:
	


“To avoid the publication of the names of any person involved in those MHR Tribunal proceedings in contravention of the Mental Health Act s. 162, this judgment uses pseudonyms for all parties and witnesses”.


	
	Although I have not had the benefit of full argument in relation to this issue, the judgments in XY and White clearly support the proposition that s. 162 of the Act applies to a Court. In these circumstances I propose to refer to the defendant as “BB”.
	


THE EVIDENCE


	
	In support of the application the plaintiff read the following affidavits:
	



	
	Dana McMullen affirmed 24 June 2015;
	
	
	Dana McMullen affirmed 25 June 2015 along with exhibits DM-1 and DM-2;

	Dana McMullen of 31 August 2015;
	
	
	Jenny Howell of 3 September 2015;
	
	
	Danielle Matsuo of 11 September 2015;
	



	
	The plaintiff also tendered:
	



	
	a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, Forensic Psychiatrist, of 21 August 2015;
	
	
	an amended report of Dr Allnutt of 21 September 2015;
	
	
	reports of Associate Professor Stephen Woods, Forensic Psychologist, of 24 August 2015 together with an updated report of 21 September 2015.
	



	
	The defendant read the affidavit of Joanna Kwan of 9 September 2015.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt, Associate Professor Woods and Ms Howell all gave oral evidence before me in the course of the hearing. I have referred to aspects of their evidence in more detail below. Ms Judy Hunt, a Principal Guardian at the Office of the Public Guardian in Sydney also gave evidence to which I have referred below.
	


THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	There is no dispute as to the factual background which gives rise to the defendant’s present status as a forensic patient. That background may be summarised as follows.
	


The offending


	
	The defendant’s status as a forensic patient arises out of his commission of an offence of sexual intercourse with a child under 10, contrary to s. 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The facts prepared in relation to that offending state that in the late afternoon of 1 January 2011 several young children, ranging in ages from 2 to 12 years, were playing in a bus which was parked in the rear yard area of a unit block in the township of Inverell in NSW. The yard area was shared between the residents of the block. The bus was used by the victim’s mother. The victim was 4 years old at the time.
	
	
	The defendant walked towards the bus. He had removed most of his clothing and was wearing only a pair of blue boxer shorts. He took hold of the victim by her body and arms and pulled her through the window, and out of the bus. He dragged her towards his premises within the unit block. In the course of doing so, he placed her on the ground and inserted his penis into her mouth, to the point that she was observed to have trouble breathing. Another child intervened and removed the victim, taking her to her parents.
	
	
	On the following day the defendant was arrested by police. He was observed to be highly intoxicated and was described as being slow and unsteady on his feet. Ultimately, police made a determination not to interview him due to his level of intoxication.
	


The proceedings before the District Court – the defendant’s fitness


	
	On 30 April 2012 in the District Court at Armidale, Judge Toner found that the defendant was unfit to be tried. His Honour remanded the defendant in custody and referred him to the Tribunal. On 28 June 2012 the Tribunal ordered that the defendant be detained at the Long Bay Correctional Centre for care and treatment. On 23 August 2012 the Tribunal confirmed that the defendant remained unfit to be tried and, on the balance of probabilities, would not become fit within 12 months.
	


The proceedings before the District Court – the special hearing


	
	On 5 November 2013 the defendant appeared before his Honour Judge King in the District Court. Having held a special hearing pursuant to the provisions of the Act, his Honour was satisfied that on the limited evidence available, the defendant committed the offence to which I previously referred. In the course of his judgment (at T7) his Honour noted that at the time of his arrest, the defendant was assessed by police to be so affected by alcohol that it was inappropriate to try to conduct an interview with him.
	
	
	The matter again came before Judge King on 5 December 2013. On that occasion, having noted his previous conclusions, his Honour imposed a limiting term of 4½ years commencing on 2 January 2011 and expiring on 1 July 2015. The defendant was referred to the Tribunal pursuant to s. 24(1)(a) of the Act. His Honour further ordered, pursuant to s. 24(1)(b) of the Act, that the defendant be detained in such place as directed by the Tribunal. The defendant thereby became a Forensic Patient by reason of s. 42 of the Act.
	
	
	In the course of his judgment, his Honour observed (at T9) that on 3 January 2011, following his arrest on the previous day, the defendant was noted to suffer a seizure (secondary to alcohol withdrawal). His Honour went on to say:
	


“Although he was not interviewed until 2 January, and there is no specific evidence about his state of sobriety at the time of the offence, I have no doubt that the offender was at least significantly affected by alcohol at the time of the commission of the offence, on the basis of his past history, and also as a result of the fact that he suffered the secondary seizures within a short time after being taken into custody. That may provide some understanding for the commission of what I have previously referred to as an offence that in the circumstances was somewhat bizarre”.


	
	His Honour recounted the defendant’s criminal history as follows (at T10):
	


“In 1978, a PCA and some four months approximately after that offence, a further PCA; In 1979, there was further PCA as well as a subsequent disqualified driver; In 1990, an assault dismissed pursuant to s. 556A without conviction, and an offence of assault female dealt with by a fine; In 1993, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm dealt with in the Local Court by a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months; Further, in 1993, one offence of malicious damage by fire and a further offence of malicious damage by fire with intent to cause bodily injury. In respect of each of those offences, he received concurrent terms of imprisonment for 12 months with a 2-month non-parole period. In 2000, he received a fine for destroy or damage property. In 2005 he received a fine for behave in offensive manner in or near a public place or school and a similar offence in 2008. There was a further common assault in 2009 as well as an offence of larceny. All of those matters were dealt with by way of fines.”


	
	His Honour then observed (at T11):
	


“What can be said of his criminal history is that up until the age fifty-two, when he committed this offence, there is no suggestion of any offending of a sexual nature. In that sense, although the offender has a criminal history, it is not of significant relevance to the limiting term to be imposed, and does not contain any like offence.”


	
	His Honour then said (at T13):
	


“In view of the offender’s mental health issues, I am of the view that he is not a good example by which to provide general deterrence to the community. Considering his current ongoing mental health issues, it is extremely difficult to make any evaluation as to the likely rehabilitation of the offender, particularly where he has a significant alcohol problem that has already caused major physical damage to his intellectual abilities. Considering his lack of any similar offending in the past, and my conclusion that he was no doubt significantly affected by alcohol on the occasion of the offending, it might be said that in the absence of alcohol there would be a low prospect of re-offending. The difficulty is that with an individual such as (BB), who has a twenty year history of alcoholism, there can be little assurance that reform in relation to alcohol consumption will ever be achieved, particularly having regard to the effects that it has already had on him, and the court must, apart from general and specific deterrence and rehabilitation, take into account the need for protection of the community.”

Events following the imposition of the limiting term


	
	In the course of the limiting term imposed by Judge King, the defendant was reviewed by the Tribunal in accordance with s. 46(1) of the Act. Whilst I do not propose to recount the entirety of the material which relates to those various reviews, there are aspects of it to which I was specifically taken in the course of argument, and to which I should refer.
	
	
	The defendant was reviewed by the Tribunal on 12 December 2013. On that occasion Dr Anna Farrer reported that he had alcohol induced dementia, characterised by deficits in memory, attention, concentration and executive function. Dr Farrer noted that the defendant had a history of alcohol dependence over a period of at least 20 years and that his cognitive function appeared to have deteriorated mildly over the preceding 6 months. She expressed an expectation that the defendant’s cognitive function would continue to deteriorate slowly, and she concluded that he presented in a manner which was consistent with a person suffering a borderline intellectual impairment. Dr Farrer concluded (at page 5):
	


“His alcohol dependence and abuse disorder is in long-term remission in a controlled environment”.


	
	A further review took place on 17 July 2014. On that occasion, the Tribunal concluded that the defendant should be detained in the aged care rehabilitation unit at Long Bay Hospital. The reasons of the Tribunal set out (at page 5) an extract of a report of Dr Morgan, Psychiatry Registrar, of 17 July 2014 in which the following was stated:
	


“(BB) is described as having had a slow but progressive decline in mental state over the last 6 months. His memory has steadily declined with an associated increase in delusional beliefs. He is described as believing that staff are poisoning him and have given him AIDS. He has been noted to be engaging in bizarre behaviours such as eating cigarette butts and talking to himself. He has been confused at times and was transferred to POWH on two occasions due to concerns for his level of orientation. No acute medical problems were identified to account for his confusion despite extensive investigation”.


	
	A further review was undertaken on 5 February 2015. On that occasion, the Tribunal’s report stated:
	


“(BB) has alcohol induced persisting dementia. He has a history of depression and suicidal ideation. His criminal history most significantly involves sexual assault on children. He remains unfit to be tried. His limiting expires on 1 July 2015 and no placement has been found at this stage – now URGENT. He is diagnosed as neither psychotic nor with cognitive impairment, so falls between all categories of suitability for hostels HASI Plus etc, especially when his age (56), criminal behaviour and alcohol issues are taken into account” (emphasis in original).


	
	The Tribunal’s report noted that no risk assessment had been proffered by the defendant’s treating medical practitioners and that his risk was therefore assumed to be low. The report also noted that in the opinion of Dr Kheng Chan, the Psychiatry Registrar at Long Bay Hospital, no Community Treatment Order would be needed if appropriate accommodation could be found, but that if this was not the case there would be concerns about supervision of the defendant’s living arrangements, particularly from the perspective of alcohol abuse. The report also noted that Dr Wilkee Sim, a Geriatrician, had suggested that if all else failed, the defendant should be placed on a Community Treatment Order in Department of Housing accommodation.
	
	
	On 22 January 2015, Dr Chan provided a report to the Tribunal in which he stated (inter alia):
	


“(BB’s) depressive illness had significantly improved. He no longer suffers from persistent low mood or psychotic symptom (sic). (BB) suffers from alcohol related cognitive impairment which is progressive and is unlikely to improve in (the) near future. The treating team is of the opinion that (BB) cease (sic) to be become a mentally ill person as defined under the NSW Mental Health Act 2007…Owing to his vulnerability, the psychiatric team is of the opinion that (BB) will benefit from ongoing management at Age Care and Rehabilitation Unit at Long Bay Hospital. In view of his limiting term expiring soon, (BB) has had an ACAT assessment and currently is waiting for acceptance into an appropriate age care facility” (emphasis in original).


	
	A further review was undertaken by the Tribunal on 14 May 2015. On that occasion the Tribunal reported:
	


“On the one hand, (BB) is a low risk to others because of his physical impairment. However, Dr Bhattacharyya expressed serious concern that (BB) NOT have any contact with children, to whom he would pose a risk.”


	
	It is noted that Dr Bhattacharrya is the defendant’s treating psychiatrist.
	
	
	On 29 April 2015, Dr Lee wrote to the Tribunal on behalf of Dr Bhattacharrya. He expressed the view that the defendant’s depressive illness had significantly improved and that he no longer suffered from persistent low mood or psychotic symptoms. He reported that the defendant suffered from alcohol-related cognitive impairment which was progressive, and which was not likely to improve in the near future. He noted that the defendant’s treating doctors were of the opinion that the defendant had ceased to become a mentally ill person within the meaning of the MHA. In terms of the defendant’s ongoing placement Dr Lee said the following:
	


“Owing to his vulnerability, the psychiatric team is of the opinion that (BB) will benefit from ongoing management at Age Care and Rehabilitation Unit at Long Bay Hospital. In view of his limiting term expiring soon, (BB) has had an ACAT assessment. The recommendation has been for low level respite care. It is recommended he not be placed in close vicinity of children. It is recommended he abstain from alcohol. Further occupational therapy assessment of 28/4/15 confirmed independence in personal activities in daily living and would benefit from low level care.

Therefore the psychiatric team respectfully recommends for no change to his current order but will support his conditional release to an appropriate Age Care Facility when a bed becomes available” (emphasis in original).


	
	On 30 April 2015, bearing in mind the opinions expressed by Dr Lee in the passage set out above as to the defendant’s placement in an appropriate aged care facility, the Manager of the Bexley Care Centre (“the Centre”) confirmed that a bed had been booked at that Centre for the defendant which would be available for him following his discharge from Long Bay Hospital.
	


THE EXPERT MEDICAL EVIDENCE

Associate Professor Woods


	
	Associate Professor Woods provided two reports. The first was dated 24 August 2015 and followed an assessment of the defendant undertaken on 14 August 2015. In the course of that assessment, Prof. Woods administered testing for the purposes of assessing the defendant’s level of cognitive functioning. He concluded (at p.12) that the results were consistent with impaired executive functioning, and he expressed the view that although there appeared to have been some improvement in that regard, the defendant’s level of cognitive functioning would rapidly decline in the absence of continued treatment. In expressing these views, Prof. Woods stressed the importance of bearing in mind that the defendant had been diagnosed with alcohol and vascular dementia. He considered that one factor relevant to the risk of re-offending was the expectation that the defendant’s level of cognitive function would continue to decline, regardless of whether symptoms of his mental illness were controlled by appropriate medication.
	
	
	For the purposes of preparing his report, Prof. Woods spoke with Ms Twomey, the Nurse Unit Manager at Long Bay Hospital. He noted that Ms Twomey supported the defendant’s proposed transfer to the Centre and had advised that:
	



	
	the defendant was fully compliant with all aspects of his treatment and with the directions of staff;
	
	
	he engaged well with other patients and staff; and
	
	
	there had been no incidents, or indications, of sexually inappropriate behaviour on the defendant’s part.
	



	
	Prof. Woods also spoke with Dr Sim, who expressed the opinion that the defendant could be safely managed at the Centre. That expression of opinion is consistent with the report of Dr Sim which is annexed to the affidavit of Ms Kwan, and in which Dr Sim offered to work closely with any medical practitioner(s) at the Centre. Prof. Woods noted that Dr Sim expressly rejected the possibility, suggested by Ms Howell in her report of 22 June 2015, that the defendant would be capable of “scaling walls and gates” in order to abscond from the Centre. Prof. Woods further noted that Dr Sim had made specific comment about the defendant’s reduced level of mobility.
	
	
	Prof. Woods himself visited the Centre and documented the following (commencing at p.16 of his first report):
	


“4:1   General

The Bexley Care Centre is a two (2) level secure facility. The thirty-six (36) bed dementia specific ward is located on the first (1st) level.

An elevator, accessible by the residents, enables movement from the first level down to the ground level where the main recreation room that leads to the garden is located; the elevator is only able to access the basement by use of key lock.

At least one (1), but generally at least three (3) staff members are present in the recreation room at all times when open to residents. At other times, the recreation room is locked thus preventing a resident from also accessing the gardens. All internal security doors, including one (1) that leads to the reception area have coded locks. The door leading from reception to be outside (street) entrance is code locked and supervised by (reception) staff at all times.

All doors that would enable a resident to leave the facility are code locked at all times. Any residents wishing to access the “fence enclosed garden” can do so only via the recreation room and when doing so are observed by staff members.

The Centre's Manager, Ms Christine Hayes, advised that any resident who accesses the garden is always monitored by staff members. In cases where the resident is identified as a) a potential risk to other patients and/or b) at risk of ""escaping"", they are either physically accompanied when in the garden or kept in ""line of sight"".

Ms Christine Hayes, Centre Manager, reported to have met (BB) and to being confident of being able to manage and provide him with appropriate care and treatment in a safe environment.

4:2   Identified Risk

A register of residents who are identified as being a potential risk to others or of possibly attempting to leave the Centre is kept and all staff briefed accordingly. These identified residents are closely monitored (i.e. it least hourly) and in general receive a higher level of supervision, including line of sight, when in situation/locations where there is even a remote potential risk/possibility of absconding. When on a supervised outing, these residents are closely supervised by a nominated member of staff.

4:3    The Garden

The Centre’s garden is fully enclosed by colour bond fences. All but one (1) fence, estimated height of 1.5 metres, are estimated to be at least (2) metres in height. I note that Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, has given an undertaking to, if deemed necessary to the Court, have the existing (estimated) 1.5 m fence raised in height by way of wood panelling.

In order to access the colour bond fence that leads to the street, it would be necessary to first climb over two (2) gates estimated height of each being 1 to 1.3 metres, and then a colour bond fence estimated to be at least two (2), but possibly more, metres.

There are no rails etc. on any fence or gate that would assist a resident in attempting to climb.

4:4    Staff

Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, advised that all staff at the Centre are trained and experienced in the care, management and supervision of old age and dementing residents.

She further advised that the Centre has previously successfully cared for a resident who has/had a history of sexual offending and attempted absconding.

4:5    Support Services

All residents have access to a general medical practitioner; either at the Centre or St. George Hospital.

St George Hospital, located an estimated “ten (10) minutes"" travel time from the Centre provides ancillary and medical support for residents.

The Centre reportedly has a close working relationship with the St. George Hospital Mental Health team.

If a deterioration in (BB’s) mental health is identified or he requires review, Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, has undertaken to arrange for him to be seen by a psychiatrist attached to the St. George Hospital Mental Health team.

Risk Analysis

The following factors pertaining to risk of reoffending are, in my opinion, relevant to (BB).

Monitoring

If transferred to the Bexley Care Centre, (BB) will, I am advised, be placed on a Unit register of high-risk patients (i.e. history of sexual offending and increased risk of absconding) and arising from this ""classification"" subject to a greater level of monitoring by experienced staff than other patients. If permitted to go on outings, he will be supervised at all times and kept in ""line of sight"".

If he wishes to utilise the Centre’s garden, it will be necessary to gain access via the Centre’s recreation room and thus will come to the attention of a staff member who will a) supervise (BB) in the garden and b) as far as possible, keep him in line of sight; if unable to see (BB) a staff member will check on his whereabouts in the garden. I understand from Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, that all residents are monitored at least hourly while in the garden.

Outings and External Medical Care

(BB), as already indicated, would be closely monitored on any and all occasions he is permitted to go on supervised outings or attend for medical/health related treatment provided externally.

Opportunity

(BB), as indicated above, will be placed on the register of high-risk patients. On occasions when patients at the Centre receive visits from family and/or friends, particularly if accompanied by children, his level of supervision will, I am advised by Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, be appropriately increased.

Alcohol

Ms Hayes, Centre Manager, has provided an absolute assurance that (BB) will not (at any time) be permitted to gain access to alcohol.

Erectile Dysfunction

(BB) reportedly suffers from erectile dysfunction. Further, he reports to not have sexual urges or entertain sexual fantasies of any type.

Ms Liz Twoomey, Nursing Unit Manager, Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit, Long Bay Gaol Hospital, has advised that there have been no instances of (BB) behaving in a sexually inappropriate manner. She described (BB) as being compliant and an “ideal patient”.”


	
	Prof. Woods accepted that the defendant had a disturbing history of alcohol abuse and dependence, and that he satisfied the criteria for:
	



	
	alcohol use disorder (in remission since entering a controlled environment); and
	
	
	major vascular neurocognitive disorder (dementia) currently without behavioural disturbance, secondary to chronic alcohol abuse.
	



	
	He concluded that the defendant’s dementia, even in the absence resumed use of alcohol, would continue to deteriorate.
	
	
	In terms of the management of any risk which was found to be posed by the defendant, Prof. Woods said the following (at p.23):
	


“(BB) can, in my opinion, be safely managed and treated in a secure aged care facility. Having visited the Bexley Care Centre, and spoken with relevant ""stakeholders"", I am of the opinion that referral to the Bexley Care Centre represents the least restrictive safe and effective care/treatment option.

In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that (BB) is subject to a Guardianship Order (with coercive powers; treatment and residence) I do not believe it necessary for him to remain a forensic patient.”


	
	Prof Woods summarised his conclusions as follows:
	


“Assessment of (BB) has revealed an extensive and well-documented history of a depressive mental illness and cognitive impairment secondary to Alcohol and Vascular dementia.

CT and MRI scans carried out in April and May, 2014, revealed cerebral atrophy with prominent ventricles in the brain as well as white-matter disease; continuing cognitive decline is commonly associated with vascular dementia.

(BB) also presents with multiple medical illnesses/conditions that include, but are not limited to, emphysema, osteoarthritis, chronic renal failure, deficiency anaemia, and non-obstructive coronary artery disease; all of these physical conditions, especially in the context of his ""shuffling gait"", will, to an increasing degree, further impact on (BB’s) already impaired level of physical functioning and mobility.

(BB) is not currently exhibiting active symptoms of mental illness, but would, in all probability, relapse into a depressive illness if he ceased appropriate antidepressant medication; in these circumstances I believe he satisfies the criteria of “Continuing Condition”.

In my opinion, (BB) medical conditions and deteriorating cognitive functioning can be managed in a secure aged care facility. (BB) has been accepted by the Bexley Care Centre where, I believe, he can be safely managed while receiving appropriate care. “


	
	Prof. Woods provided a supplementary report of 21 September 2015 after having the benefit of reading the reports of Dr Allnutt and Ms Howell. In the course of that supplementary report (commencing at p.5) he again addressed the level of risk that the defendant might pose in the event that he ceased to be a forensic patient. In that regard he said the following:
	


“When assessing the possible level of risk (BB) may pose in the event he ceases to be ""a forensic patient"" detained at the Aged Care and Rehabilitation Unit, Long Bay Gaol Hospital, I was cognisant of the following:-

(BB’s) deteriorating cognitive and physical functioning.

The index offence occurred in the context of him being heavily intoxicated and (also) suffering from active symptoms of mental illness.

Whether or not (BB) will, if placed at the Bexley Care Centre he will be subject to strict supervision and a) will not have access to alcohol and b) potential victims.

Availability of treatment, including ""diversional therapy"", if he continues to be detained in the Aged Care and Rehab Unit, Long Bay Hospital, Long Bay Correctional Centre, or other correctional facility.”

The Bexley Care Centre is a ""locked"" (secure) facility"". Staff at the Centre have, I am advised, previously successfully managed a sex offender who had a history of attempting to abscond.

In order to abscond from the facility, it would be necessary for (BB) to a) obtain and use “lock codes” on doors as well as pass by a member of staff who supervises entry to and exit from the locked door that leads to the street, or b) climb over fences whilst in “line of sight” of a member of staff. Given his level of impaired cognitive and physical functioning, I believe he is incapable of breaching the security of the Bexley Care Centre.

Based on my assessment of (BB) and having had an opportunity to a) case conference with relevant stakeholders, and b) visit the Bexley Care Centre, I am of the opinion that (BB) can, in accordance with the principle of the least restrictive form of safe and effective care"" be effectively managed at the Bexley Care Centre where he will have the benefit of “diversional therapy programs” (relevant to his dementia related needs) as well as access to appropriate medical (including psychiatric) care.

Finally, I would emphasise that my stated opinion is contingent upon (BB) remaining subject to a Guardianship Order with (full) coercive powers.


	
	Prof. Woods gave oral evidence before me. He confirmed (at T11 L5-7) that his view about the suitability of the Bexley Care Centre was contingent upon the defendant remaining subject to guardianship with coercive powers which, as he understood it, permitted a guardian to (for example) authorise police to return him to their place of accommodation. As I have set out further below when considering the evidence of Ms Hunt, there are presently no coercive powers in force, although steps have been taken to ensure that an application for such powers can be made at short notice if necessary.
	
	
	Prof. Woods confirmed (commencing at T11 L15) that he did not believe that the defendant should be placed in the community with the “normal freedoms” that members of the community enjoy. He expressed the view that it would be necessary for the defendant to be subject to some degree of control, particularly with respect to factors such as his living arrangements and the acceptance of ongoing treatment. He was then asked (at T11 L23):
	


Q. So without those sorts of controls on him, you consider that he does pose a risk of harm to others; is that the case?

A. Yes. And that risk would arise, in my opinion, from two factors: The potential for him to consume alcohol and also not to be compliant with medication.


	
	Prof. Woods had incorrectly assumed that coercive powers were already in place in association with the defendant’s guardianship. In bringing this to his attention, counsel for the plaintiff asked (at T11 L45):
	


Q. In the absence of coercive powers, does that change your opinion about whether forensic patient status should continue?

A. Well, of course. I certainly believe that, as I've said and I'm repeating myself now, but just to be absolutely clear, I do not believe, given the history, given the possibility of resumed alcohol, et cetera, et cetera, that he should be released into the community. I think, as I've said in my addendum, I'm working on the assumption that he's not going to be released into the community and I base my view on that.


	
	Prof. Woods confirmed (commencing at T 12 L7) that in his opinion the defendant would not be adequately managed in the wider community, or in a low security aged care facility where he did not have the benefit of a high level of care. He said (commencing at T12 L15) that the Centre was, as he understood it, able to provide close supervision and monitoring throughout the day. He agreed that in the case of the defendant, close supervision would necessarily have to include:
	



	
	monitoring the defendant’s physical whereabouts;
	
	
	ensuring that he did not have access to children;
	
	
	ensuring that he did not consume alcohol;
	
	
	ensuring compliance with his medication regime; and
	
	
	supervising any outings or excursions.
	



	
	Importantly, Prof. Woods confirmed (commencing at T17 L5) that in his opinion the defendant’s level of cognitive functioning would continue to decline. He agreed that a person’s cognitive functioning affected his or her capacity to control behaviour and make decisions. He also agreed that as the defendant’s cognitive functioning declined, so too would his ability to inhibit any anti-social behaviour. He was then asked by counsel for the plaintiff (commencing at T17 L40):
	


Q. A decline in his level of cognitive functioning won't reduce his risk of re‑offending; do you agree with that?

A. Well, if we think in terms of cognitive functioning also controlling motor ability, and factoring in also his already limited mobility, as the base vascular dementia increases or develops, as he goes down the road, I would say that his ability, physical ability, to pose a risk will decrease.

Q. His ability to comply with directions will also decrease; do you agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. And his memory will have greater memory loss as his cognitive functioning declines?

A. Yes.


	
	Importantly, Prof. Woods also gave the following evidence (commencing at T21 L30):
	


Q. I took you to a number of risk factors such as access to children, access to alcohol, those matters?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree that a forensic patient status would allow those risk factors to be monitored in a compulsory way?

A. Of course.

Q. But it is not required?

A. I am saying they could manage him in a different way as well by what you could do by forensic order, an order under Guardianship that requires him to stay in the Bexley Health Care Centre. That is another way of controlling risk factors.

Q. Assuming a coercive function is not granted to the Guardian?

A. Yes.

Q. Assuming that is not an option for the moment?

A. Yes.

Q. The only legally compulsory option being forensic patient status, do you consider that he should remain a forensic patient?

A. In the absence of a coercive order?

Q. Yes?

A. Yes.

Dr Stephen Allnutt


	
	Dr Allnutt provided two reports, the first dated 21 August 2015 and the second dated 21 September 2015. The second report was effectively an amended version of the first and in those circumstances it is the second report to which I will refer.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt assessed the defendant on 13 August 2015. In his opinion, the defendant met diagnostic criteria for (inter alia):
	



	
	mild neurocognitive disorder, secondary to alcohol and vascular problems;
	
	
	a recurrent depression disorder;
	
	
	hypothyroidism;
	
	
	an alcohol use disorder (moderate to severe) which was currently in remission in light of his controlled environment;
	
	
	a history of anti-social behaviour manifesting anti-social traits; and
	
	
	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, iron deficiency anaemia, hearing impairment, osteoarthritis, mild concentric ventricular hypertrophy, AV stenosis and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
	



	
	Dr Allnutt had been asked to specifically address the question of whether the defendant posed a risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceased being a forensic patient. He addressed that issue as follows (at p. 13):
	


“In providing an opinion on risk of recidivism it is important for the court to be aware that the quality of expert opinion in this regard is limited, as the scientific foundation has limitations. Any opinion on risk of recidivism is more professional than scientific. Risk assessment is the process of determining whether a person falls into in a particular risk group for committing a further offence. It is not an exercise in predicting if a person would in fact recidivate. Risk fluctuates depending on changes in the person or their environment and thus re-assessment is required over time. The evidence suggests that risk assessment can place a person in a risk group with moderate accuracy. It is not possible to categorise the individual’s risk level with reasonable clinical accuracy. In this the court is alone.

Given his history of violent and sexual offending, I have addressed both risks.”


	
	Having recounted a summary of the evidence, Dr Allnutt said (at p. 17):
	


“The unpredictable nature of the index offence and its brazenness; the deterioration in his cognitive mental state since the index offences (in particular with executive impairment and thus reduced problem-solving ability, impaired social judgment and reduced inhibitory capacities); and his increased needs, lead me to a final opinion on his risk status.

Without relatively intense supervision, remaining a forensic patient and in a restricted placement, he would fall into a group of mentally disordered offenders who are at moderate risk of engaging in aggressive offensive behaviour and are at moderate to high risk of engaging in serious sexual offending compared to other sexual offenders and mentally disordered offenders.

I believe he poses a risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient.”


	
	In response to being asked whether, if the defendant posed such a risk, it could be adequately managed by other less restrictive means, Dr Allnutt said (at p. 17):
	


“Having regard to the loading of factors that perpetuate his risk as outlined above, he manifests a number of factors that require intervention and rehabilitation before he is able to move to non-conditional dispositional status. On this basis he requires ongoing treatment and rehabilitation, preferably in a clinical facility with expertise in managing people with mental disorder and who offend sexually. His cognitive impairment makes him more resistant to responding to rehabilitation.

If he remains a forensic patient then he would be eligible for rehabilitation in a medium forensic mental health unit (such as Mariette, Macquarie Unit or Bunya Unit). These units have specialist forensic clinicians who have expertise in managing mentally disordered offenders and his risk could be managed in such a unit.

His risk could be managed in a civil psychiatric unit as long as that unit is a locked unit. It is important to note that staff civil units do not have forensic mental health professionals. A guardianship order alone without restrictions to his access to children, supervision and 24- hour monitoring at this stage would not be sufficient to manage his risk. Coercive powers in regard to the guardian would provide some capacity to determine placement in a secure facility.”


	
	Ultimately, Dr Allnutt expressed the view (at p.18) that the defendant required ongoing management as a forensic patient. He made a series of recommendations for a risk management plan incorporating medication and counselling. In terms of an appropriate placement Dr Allnutt said (at p.18):
	


“He requires ongoing treatment and rehabilitation, preferably in a clinical facility that limits and/or supervises his access to the community and is able to manage, assess and monitor him for impulsive sexual behaviour and mental state changes.

I note that others have visited Bexley. I have not had the opportunity to do so at this stage. Having regard to the list of characteristic for Bexley provided by Ms Howells, it appears that the environment provides for restrictions on his movement, association, activities and communication. Such an environment could be appropriate. However, I would recommend the ongoing consultation between whatever facility he is placed in and the Justice Health Forensic and Mental Health Network, (the Community Forensic Mental Health Service), providing forensic psychiatric consultation at least every six months.

My preference is that his move to Bexley occurs after a period in a medium secure unit, which allows for “testing” of alternative community situations.”


	
	Finally, in response to being asked whether, in the event that the defendant ceased to be a forensic patient, he would be able to understand and comply management conditions and directions imposed by his guardian, doctors and carers in light of his cognitive functioning, Dr Allnutt stated (at p. 19):
	


“At this stage I believe he would have difficulty understanding and complying with the management conditions and directions imposed by his guardian, doctors, and carers taking into account his cognitive function”.


	
	Dr Allnutt gave evidence before me. He confirmed (commencing at T27 L28) that management of the defendant’s risk required the adoption of what was described as a “multipronged” approach. He then gave the following evidence (commencing at T27 L28):
	


“Q. It is your view that managing (BB’s) risk requires a multipronged approach?

A. Correct.

Q. It is your view that continued management as a forensic patient is the means by which his current risk should be managed?

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. Why do you say that?

A. I believe that as a forensic patient he will come under the purview of the Mental Health Tribunal. The Mental Health Tribunal is a body comprised of people with a variety of expertise including legal, psychiatric and psychological expertise as well as - those are the two main areas of expertise - there is forensic and psychiatric expertise. The Mental Health Tribunal also has the ability to implement control restrictions that might be required. They would have regular opportunity to assist him over time and obtain feedback from the clinical staff of whatever area he is in and to have the experience to make judgments in relation to restrictions. As a forensic patient he would come under the purview of the forensic mental health arm of the Mental Health Tribunal. I think he needs coherence of some type. I am aware that there is a Guardian appointed. My concern is that the Guardian does not have the necessary forensic experience and this is an issue that has forensically related aspects to it. The reason why he needs legal coherence is because he has been diagnosed with mild neo-cognitive disorder which is the same as early dementia. This is a sort of condition which is likely to decline and worsen with time. The speed at which it is likely to worsen is difficult to predict.”


	
	Dr Allnutt noted (commencing at T 28 L22) that the defendant’s offending which resulted in the implementation of the limiting term was alcohol related and said (commencing at T28 L23):
	


“One thing to do is to ensure that he does not use alcohol again. The neurocognitive dysfunction increases the risk for less control. So there is more risk of being less capable of inhibiting drives. So those two components would make matters worse as far as inhibition is concerned, and sexual inhibition is concerned.”


	
	When asked (commencing at T28 L41) about the decline in the defendant’s cognitive functioning, and its impact upon his risk of re-offending, Dr Allnutt said:
	


“I think, given that he is in the mild range, it will initially increase the risk, but depending on how badly unwell he becomes with the dementia, that risk might diminish over time, but I think there will be a potential period of increased risk, but more often with people who develop more severe dementias they can become quite impulsive. There is a point where that will decline but there is a risk that might increase for impulsive behaviours.”


	
	In terms of the defendant’s consumption of alcohol constituting or contributing to a risk, Dr Allnutt said (commencing at T29 L15):
	


“I think it would be fair to say that one has to hold a level of concern that if he was in the community there would be a risk that he would eventually go into the closest pub and begin drinking again and, having had quite a significant problem with alcoholism, we know there is a risk of relapse with alcoholism, and particularly given his neurocognitive disorder and less ability to inhibit himself in whatever he does.

I think one has to maintain a concern that the only reason he has stopped drinking is because he is in a controlled environment. The plus side is he is detoxified so the craving has probably diminished but the risk is if he does relapse there is a reasonable risk that he would gradually begin developing an alcohol abuse and then become dependent.”

Ms Jenny Howell


	
	Ms Howell, a Forensic Psychologist, provided an affidavit of 25 June 2015 annexed to which was (inter alia) a report of 22 June 2015, which was prepared following her assessment of the defendant conducted on 12 June 2015.
	
	
	Ms Howell expressed the view that the defendant posed an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceased being a forensic patient. In this regard she said (at p.21):
	


“Risk assessed around the time of (BB’s) offence included: his chronic alcohol use and the associated cognitive impairment and emotional regulation problems; persisting dementia with evidence of early cerebral atrophy with prominent ventricles in the brain; and major depressive illness. Dr Hearps,

Consulting Psychiatrist, found (BB’s) dementia was a permanent condition and that depression may also be a contributing factor to (BB’s) cognitive impairment.

Dr Susan Pulman, clinical and forensic neuropsychologist, concluded that (BB’s) intellectual functioning lies within the extremely low range. This suggests that (BB’s) cognitive ability may fall between the moderate to high intellectual disability range. During this assessment (BB) exhibited problems with frustration and impulsivity.

Assessment of (BB’s) risk of sexual recidivism, using actuarial measures and structured clinical judgement, suggests it is in the moderate-high range. He has not participated in treatment and as such has not developed new skills to manage his risk of re-offending and has little insight into the aetiology or effect of his behaviour.

When these factors are considered together it is unlikely that (BB’s) risk of re-offending will significantly diminish.

It is my view that (BB) poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm if he ceases being a forensic patient.”


	
	Ms Howell expressed the view that the defendant’s continuing abstinence from drinking alcohol was a factor of critical importance to any assessment of risk because his chronic problems with alcohol had underpinned the offending. She concluded that the defendant’s alcohol related dementia was a permanent condition, and that he required ongoing management as a forensic patient.
	
	
	Ms Howell specifically addressed the adequacy of the Centre as a facility for managing the risk as follows (at p.22):
	


“Correspondence of the Crown Solicitors Office, dated 17 June 2015, provides information from the Bexley Care Centre with respect to how they would manage (BB’s) care and supervision in the community. A visit to the Bexley Care Centre and discussion with the Manager, Ms Hayes, identified a number of positive aspects in relation to their ability to care for (BB). These include staff with training and experience in the care of residents with dementia and mental health problems. Ms Hayes said that the Bexley Care Centre has formed a good working relationship with the South Eastern Sydney Local Area Health District, Mental Health and Older Adult Mental Health Service. They also have an understanding of patients with alcohol related health problems. Ms Hayes acknowledged that the Bexley Care Centre staff have not received any training in relation to sexual offending and expressed a view that this would support staff manage (BB).

The Bexley Care Centre is staffed by registered nurses, care staff (who have enrolled nurse certification) and they are supported by a behaviour support manager and dementia specialist manager 24 hours a day seven days a week. A local GP visits the home several times a week and a Psychiatrist from St George Hospital visits weekly.

The Bexley Care centre is an older, purpose built nursing home with two floors and is situated in a residential neighbourhood. There are 60 residents currently at the centre who have individual safety plans that have clinical oversight, are monitored and reviewed regularly.

A number of impediments to the Bexley Care Centre’s ability to safely manage (BB) were also identified; including a lack of relevant experience in their clinical capacity and security issues. Ms Hayes reported that the Bexley Care Centre has very limited experience (one previous patient) in the care and safe management of a patient with a sexual offending history.

I understood from correspondence, that the Bexley Care Centre is a secure facility, has keypad doorways and that (BB) would be accommodated in the secure unit. On the visit to the Bexley Care Centre I observed a keypad on the doorway into and out of the secure unit on the second floor. However, the doors were open and residents were able to walk in and out of the unit. There is a lift between the first floor and ground floor which does not require a keypad to operate and is available to residents. Once on the ground floor residents are able to walk freely around that unit and access the garden through an unsecured (non- keypad) doorway.

The garden at the Bexley Care Centre is large with a winding walking path, several different gardening areas, trees and seats. The garden shares common boundaries with private residential homes and is fenced between the different properties. These fences would conform to council regulations; they are not secure, and able to be scaled. At one side of the garden there is also a series of three gates along a driveway which could be scaled to reach the road.

(BB) has been told that he will be going to the Bexley Care Centre on release from custody and during the assessment indicated that if he was not released to the Bexley Care Centre then he would “give up” and “not take” his medication. It is my view that if the Bexley Care Centre provided their staff with training in relation to working with and managing the risk of sexual offenders in conjunction with upgrading security, they have the potential to safely manage (BB) on a day to day basis. However, if (BB) was determined to leave the centre at some time in the future and consume alcohol his risk of sexually re-offending would significantly increase.

Without the certainty that (BB) can be safely managed at the Bexley Care Centre, it is my view that (BB) would require ongoing management as a forensic patient.”


	
	Ms Howell also gave evidence before me. She agreed (at T44 L1-5) that in her observation, and on the basis of the entirety of the available evidence, the defendant had always been compliant with requests made of him. However she was not moved from her stated view that the defendant should remain a forensic patient.
	


Judy Ann Hunt


	
	Oral evidence was also given before me by Judy Ann Hunt, a Principal Guardian at the Office of the NSW Public Guardian. Ms Hunt has the carriage, within the Public Guardian’s office, of matters pertaining to the defendant.
	
	
	Ms Hunt confirmed that the defendant is currently the subject of a Guardianship Order which does not include coercive powers. She confirmed that an application for an order for such powers was ready to be filed and that the effect of powers is that the Public Guardian is given “the legal right to ask police and ambulance to retrieve and return anybody who has left their place of residence that we have provided consent to” (at T49 L16-19). Ms Hunt gave evidence (at T49 L26-28) that she anticipated, given the fact that there would be a “very strong recommendation” for the making of an order (at T50 L5-8) that if sought, coercive powers would be granted.
	


THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS


	
	Clauses 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the Act are in the following terms:
	


1 Extension orders for forensic patients

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under Part 2 of this Schedule, make an order for the extension of a person’s status as a forensic patient.

(2) An order made under this clause is an

""extension order"" .

2 Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made

(1) A forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Schedule if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that:

(a) the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he or she ceases being a forensic patient, and

(b) the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under section 53).

(2) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.


	
	Clauses 7 to 9 of Schedule 1 are in the following terms:
	


Division 2 - Determination of application

7 Determination of application for extension order

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application under this Part for an extension order:

(a) by making the order, or

(b) by dismissing the application.

(2) In determining whether or not to make an extension order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under clause 6 (5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,

(c) the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under clause 5 (b),

(d) any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,

(e) any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,

(f) any report of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Director-General of the Department of Family and Community Services or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,

(g) the level of the forensic patient’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on a leave of absence in accordance with section 49 or 50),

(h) the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,

(i) any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.

(3) If the Supreme Court makes an extension order in respect of a forensic patient, the Court is to notify the Tribunal of the making of the order.

8 Term of extension order

(1) An extension order:

(a) commences when it is made, or when the limiting term or existing extension order to which the forensic patient is subject expires, whichever is the later, and

(b) expires at the end of the period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) that is specified in the order.

(2) Nothing in this clause prevents the Supreme Court from making a second or subsequent extension order against the same forensic patient.

9 Continuation of order relating to forensic patient

The making of an extension order or interim extension order in respect of a forensic patient does not affect the operation of any order as to the forensic patient’s care, detention, treatment or release from custody to which the forensic patient was subject immediately before the making of the extension order.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF


	
	Counsel for the plaintiff emphasised the medical evidence which, it was submitted, justified the making of the order sought. Counsel relied generally upon Dr Allnutt’s opinion that the defendant posed a risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceased being a forensic patient. In particular, counsel relied on Dr Allnutt’s opinion that the defendant:
	



	
	would, in the absence of relatively intense supervision in a restricted placement, fall into a group of mentally disordered offenders who are at moderate risk of engaging in aggressive and offensive behaviour, and who are at a relatively high risk of engaging in serious sexual offending;
	
	
	would, as a consequence of his history of substance abuse disorder, be predisposed to violent and/or sexual recidivism;
	
	
	would be at risk of relapsing into substance abuse if the opportunity arose;
	
	
	would not adhere to supervision in the absence of formal legal compulsion; and
	
	
	suffered from cognitive difficulties and a level of instability which were unlikely to respond to treatment, and which warranted ongoing monitoring and supervision.
	



	
	Counsel for the plaintiff also relied upon the opinion of Ms Howell in support of a conclusion that the defendant posed an unacceptable risk if he ceased to be a forensic patient and was released into the community. In particular, counsel pointed to the fact that Ms Howell had:
	



	
	assessed the defendant’s risk of engaging in a further sexual offence as falling within the moderate to high range;
	
	
	concluded that the defendant had ongoing problems with impulse control and frustration, and had little insight into his offending;
	
	
	considered that the defendant’s chronic alcohol abuse, and its associated cognitive impairment, posed a particular risk; and
	
	
	concluded that the defendant had not developed new skills to manage his risk of re-offending, and that such risk was unlikely to significantly diminish.
	



	
	Counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that although Prof. Woods had expressed the view that there was no necessity for the defendant to remain a forensic patient, he nevertheless did not believe that the defendant could be adequately managed in the wider community, or in a low security aged care facility, in circumstances where he was not subject to close supervision and not provided with a high level of care.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff also pointed to the fact that the defendant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Bhattacharrya, had expressed serious concern about the possibility of the defendant having any contact with children in light of the risk which would be posed. It was submitted that in circumstances where the defendant’s risk factors had not been mitigated, and given the preponderance of expert opinion, the test in cl. 2(1)(a) of Schedule 1 was satisfied.
	
	
	As to the provisions of cl. 2(1)(b), counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the relevant focus was upon the question of adequately managing the risk, rather than upon identifying, or attempting to identify, whether one proposed regime was more or less restrictive than another: Attorney General of New South Wales v Skerry [2015] NSWSC 859 at [54] per R A Hulme J. It was submitted that there was no adequate alternative pathway through which the defendant could be compulsorily supervised or treated other than as a forensic patient, and that involuntary patient status and/or guardianship would not be adequate to manage the risk that he continued to pose.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in circumstances where the defendant remained cognitively impaired, there were no grounds upon which to conclude that his risk could be managed by classification as an involuntary patient. It was submitted, in particular, that in circumstances where the Tribunal, at its most recent review, had stated that the defendant was not mentally ill, classification as an involuntary patient was not relevant. It was submitted that whether or not the defendant was a mentally ill person under s. 14(2) of the Mental Health Act was a speculative exercise, and that in the absence of any proposal or intention on the part of the Tribunal that he be classified as an involuntary patient, the management of his risk by the civil mental health system was neither available nor relevant to my consideration of cl. 2(1)(b).
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that:
	



	
	guardianship may, at least in principle, fall within the expression “other less restrictive means” in cl. 2(1)(b);
	
	
	guardianship arrangements may, in some circumstances, provide an alternative means of intervention in respect of a forensic patient who has been released at the end of his or her limiting term;
	
	
	the defendant was subject to guardianship orders, the effect of which was to grant, to the Public Guardian, functions in respect of accommodation and matters of health care; and
	
	
	the defendant remains the subject of a financial management order.
	



	
	However counsel pointed out that at present, there were no coercive orders in place. Counsel also pointed to the opinion of Dr Allnutt that a guardianship order alone, absent restriction as to the defendant’s access to children, and absent supervision which included 24 hour monitoring, would be insufficient to manage the identified risk. It was submitted that even if the evidence of Ms Hunt were accepted and coercive powers were implemented, and even allowing for the fact that such powers would provide some capacity to determine placement in a secure facility, guardianship did not incorporate the same degree of supervision as that which applied to a forensic patient.
	
	
	Counsel also pointed out that the need to protect the community was not a relevant principle under the Guardianship Act 1987 and that accordingly, reliance solely upon guardianship arrangements to manage and/or detain a person who presents a risk of serious harm to the community may not be sufficient. Counsel further submitted that even if it were assumed that coercive powers could be implemented, there remained important differences between the powers of the Tribunal (exercisable in the event that the defendant remained a forensic patient) and the powers of the Public Guardian.
	
	
	It was further submitted that in any event, the risk that the defendant continued to pose could not be adequately managed by his unconditional discharge into any community setting, be it at the Centre or some other similar facility. Counsel pointed out that although it was proposed, in the event that the defendant was placed at the Centre, to restrict him from using alcohol and to supervise him and monitor his medication regime, his engagement in, and compliance with, any such placement was voluntary, such that he was under no legal obligation to reside or remain at the Centre, and was under no obligation to abide by any instructions of staff in any relevant respect.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff also relied upon the opinion of Dr Allnutt that even if the defendant was placed at the Centre, he should nevertheless remain a forensic patient until the Tribunal determined otherwise. Counsel also pointed to the fact that Dr Allnutt’s clear preference was that any move to the Centre should only occur, if at all, after a period of placement in a medium security unit so as to allow for the testing of alternative placements.
	
	
	Ultimately, Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the focus of the forensic mental health system is upon risk avoidance and that there was no legislative provision or regime available which was capable of addressing the defendant’s ongoing risk other than Schedule 1 of the Act. It was submitted that the defendant’s continued status as a forensic patient was necessary in order to meet his needs for psychiatric treatment, supervision and monitoring, as well as to ensure his safe reintegration into the community. It was submitted that a placement which relied, in effect, upon his voluntary compliance was not adequate for that purpose.
	
	
	It was submitted that in these circumstances, it was appropriate that the defendant be the subject of continued supervision and monitoring by the Tribunal, with the potential, at some time in the future, for the implementation of a structured regime of conditions, in the event that the defendant was able to meet the threshold for release.
	


Submissions of the defendant


	
	Counsel for the defendant submitted that I would find that the defendant did not pose an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceased being a forensic patient. If such a risk were established, counsel submitted that it could be adequately managed by other, less restrictive, means.
	
	
	As to the issue of whether the defendant posed an unacceptable risk of harm to others, counsel submitted that given his personal circumstances and his incapacity, the conditions under which the defendant would live meant that there was little likelihood that he would commit any offence. In this regard, counsel pointed to a number of factors, including that the defendant:
	



	
	is 56 years of age;
	
	
	is cognitively impaired, to the extent that decisions are made for him by the public guardian;
	
	
	suffers from a series of cognitive deficits which means that he is unable to manage his finances;
	
	
	is physically impaired; and
	
	
	suffers from a range of other physical illnesses including pulmonary disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
	



	
	Counsel submitted that in these circumstances, the conditions under which the defendant would live meant that there was little likelihood that he would commit any offence, providing he was medicated, alcohol free and in a secure facility. Counsel submitted that the consequences of the defendant’s state of health were such that he is gradually losing the ability to function and will deteriorate further over time, such that it is in his interests to be integrated into a secure facility in the community.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant stressed the necessity to have proper regard to the fact that the defendant had completed the limiting term fixed by Judge King in the District Court. It was submitted that in these circumstances he should be allowed to live his life in a way which enabled him to exercise the liberty which would be exercised by any other member of society who was in a similar position.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant emphasised the views of Dr Allnutt that any expert opinion which might be expressed as to a risk of recidivism was more professional than scientific. It was submitted that this observation should operate to temper the use of professional opinion in determining whether an unacceptable risk existed.
	
	
	Counsel stressed the opinion of Prof. Woods that the defendant’s medical conditions, and in his deteriorating cognitive functioning, could be safely managed at the Centre. Counsel also pointed out, relevant to an assessment of the defendant’s risk of relapsing into substance abuse, that there was no evidence that there was an opportunity to drink alcohol at the Centre.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that the defendant’s criminal history, in the context of a long standing cognitive disability, added little to the assessment of the risk which had been described by the expert witnesses. It was pointed out that the vast majority of the defendant’s convictions occurred more than two decades ago and that in any event, none of those convictions involved significant violence or the commission of any sexual offence.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, it was submitted that I would not be satisfied that the defendant posed an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.
	
	
	In support of the proposition that any identified risk could be adequately managed by other less restrictive means, counsel for the defendant submitted that in essence, Dr Allnutt had not expressed a definitive view that placement at the Centre was not suitable. It was submitted that an identified risk was capable of adequate management at the Centre, and that such management would meet the behavioural, physical and psychiatric needs of the defendant.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant made lengthy submissions as to the nature of any placement at the Centre including the availability of experienced support staff, the level of security provided, and the fact that there was medical assistance available which included the capacity to provide psychiatric and psychological treatment and counselling. It was submitted that any suggestion that an identified risk could not be adequately managed by other less restrictive means ignored the powers of the Public Guardian, Community Treatment Management, and the skills and resources of the Centre.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that a guardianship arrangement may provide an alternative means of intervention for a forensic patient who has been released at the end of his or her limiting term. It was pointed out, in particular, that Prof. Woods considered guardianship appropriate subject to the implementation of relevant coercive powers which, on the evidence of Ms Hunt, were available. It was submitted that associated placement at the Centre, including the imposition of constraints which restricted the defendant’s access to alcohol, allowed him to be supervised, and permitted monitoring of his medication regime, would ensure that any risk was adequately and appropriately managed.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	The provisions of cl. 2(1) of Schedule 1 confer a discretionary power to make an extension order if, but only if, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability of two matters, namely that:
	



	
	the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient; and
	
	
	the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means, including classification as an involuntary patient under s. 53.
	



	
	The term “high degree of probability” in cl. 2(1) was considered by Garling J in Attorney-General for NSW v McGuire (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 288. His Honour cited (at [47]) the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Mason P, Giles and Hodgson JJA) in Cornwall v Attorney-General for NSW [2007] NSWCA 374 where the following was observed (at [21]):
	


“[21] The expression “a high degree of probability” indicates something “beyond more probably than not”; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt...”


	
	Garling J went on to observe (at [48]) that an applicant for an order under cl. 2(1) carries the onus. In Attorney-General of NSW v McGuire [2015] NSWSC 152 Hoeben CJ at CL took the same approach (at [37]).
	
	
	There are differing views as to the approach to be taken to a consideration of whether or not there is an “unacceptable risk” within the meaning of cl. 2(1)(a). The first is the “everyday meaning approach” under which the test of unacceptable risk will be satisfied if a risk is present to a sufficient degree that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made: State of NSW v Thomas [2011] NSWSC 118 at [20]; State of NSW v Thomas [2011] NSWSC 308 at [28] (per RA Hulme J in each case).
	
	
	The alternative is the “balancing exercise approach”, which involves balancing the likelihood of committing a further serious offence, the gravity of such an offence, and the consequences of an order on the offender: State of NSW v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 at [90].
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case, it is unnecessary for me to resolve such conflict which might exist as to the appropriate approach to be taken. Irrespective of which of the two tests is applied, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability on the evidence that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient.
	
	
	As counsel for the defendant pointed out, Dr Allnutt emphasised that the “quality” of expert opinion as to risk of recidivism was limited. However even when appropriate allowance in made for that limitation, Dr Allnutt’s unequivocal opinion was that the defendant poses a risk of causing serious harm to others. In expressing that view, Dr Allnutt took into account the nature of the defendant’s offending and the deterioration in the defendant’s cognitive state in the years which have passed since that offending occurred. That cognitive deterioration is, in my view, of particular importance. The evidence satisfies me that it has resulted in the defendant having an impaired executive function. It has also seen a reduction in his problem solving abilities and an impaired degree of social judgment. Even allowing for the fact that his criminal history is comparatively limited, and includes no history of sexual offending, the consequences of the deterioration in the defendant’s cognitive state, coupled with the nature of the offending, support the conclusion that the relevant risk exists. Also of importance is the fact that Dr Allnutt identified that as a result of the deterioration in the defendant’s cognitive state, he suffers from a difficulty in understanding and complying with directions given to him.
	
	
	The opinion of Ms Howell provides further support for this conclusion that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient. She too cited the deterioration in the defendant’s cognitive state as a relevant factor in reaching that conclusion.
	
	
	Prof. Woods also identified the deteriorating level of the defendant’s cognitive functioning as a factor which was relevant to an assessment of his risk of re-offending. Like Dr Allnutt, he concluded that the defendant’s already impaired level of cognitive function would further decline in the future. Importantly, although he expressed the opinion that the defendant could be properly treated in a secure aged care facility (an issue which I have addressed further below), Prof. Woods expressly accepted that absent an appropriate degree of control, the defendant posed a risk to others and that such risk arose principally from the potential for him to consume alcohol, along with the potential for a lack of compliance with prescribed medication.
	
	
	I have had regard, in determining the question of risk, to the fact that the defendant’s criminal history is both limited and dated. However, as Dr Allnutt has pointed out, the bizarre nature of the offending, and perhaps more importantly its unpredictability, along with the other factors he identified, support a conclusion that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk to others if he ceases to be a forensic patient. The evidence to which I have referred satisfies me of that fact to a high degree of probability.
	
	
	Having reached the conclusion that an unacceptable risk is posed, I must proceed to consider the question of whether I am satisfied, to a similarly high degree of probability, that such risk cannot be adequately managed by other, less restrictive means. In McGuire (No. 2) Garling J observed (at [60]-[63]) that the term “adequately managed” means that “the unacceptable risk is mitigated by the proposed management regime so that the community’s interest in being kept safe is outweighed by the community’s interest in not having mentally ill or mentally disordered individuals or forensic patients being confined in some form of institutional care rather than taking their place in the community”.
	
	
	In the context of the present case, the suggested less restrictive means essentially comprise:
	



	
	classification of the defendant as an involuntary patient; and/or
	
	
	guardianship with coercive powers; and/or
	
	
	placement at the Centre.
	



	
	As to the first of those means, I accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that in circumstances where the defendant is not, according to the most recent assessment of the Tribunal, mentally ill, issues of the defendant being classified as an involuntary patient do not arise. In considering the remaining two issues, it is again necessary to turn to the expert evidence.
	
	
	Prof. Woods expressed the view that a guardianship arrangement which saw the defendant placed at the Centre would be an appropriate alternative, and one which would adequately control the risk that I have identified. In expressing that view, Prof. Woods was under the misapprehension that the present Guardianship arrangements included coercive powers. Clearly, that is not the case. Prof. Woods expressly conceded that in the absence of such powers the defendant should remain a forensic patient.
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Hunt, which I accept, establishes that an application for the implementation of coercive powers can be made at short notice. Whilst the granting of such power could not be regarded as certain, I have noted the evidence of Ms Hunt that such powers would be recommended, and that this recommendation would necessarily carry considerable weight. I am prepared, in these circumstances, to proceed on the basis that it is more likely than not that if application were made, coercive powers would be granted. However even if this is so, I am not satisfied, for the reasons that follow, that the identified risk can be appropriately managed by other less restrictive means of the kind suggested.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt expressed the view that the various factors which give rise to the identified risk meant that the defendant required ongoing treatment and rehabilitation which was preferably carried out in a clinical environment, and where those having the requisite expertise in the medical management of a person such as the defendant were able to treat him. In this respect, Dr Allnutt again emphasised the defendant’s cognitive impairment which, he pointed out, rendered the defendant more resistant to responding to rehabilitation. Dr Allnutt also stressed the necessity for the ongoing management of the defendant’s condition to involve a multi-factorial approach which, in his view, was more appropriately administered under the purview of the Tribunal.
	
	
	Ms Howell was prepared to accept that the Centre had the potential to manage the defendant on a day to day basis. However she expressed concern at what would occur in the event that at some future time, the defendant determined to leave the Centre and consume alcohol, a circumstance which, in her view, would accelerate the risk of sexual offending.
	
	
	Prof. Woods visited the Centre and provided a comprehensive overview of its functions, administration and capabilities. Clearly, if the defendant were placed at the Centre, he would be monitored, although perhaps not on a 24 hour basis. The facility is also secure. The defendant would not, absent anything unforseen or out of the ordinary, have access to alcohol. Residents of the Centre have access to medical treatment from a General Practitioner, as well as access to medical facilities at the St George Hospital which is only a short distance away. A psychiatrist attends regularly.
	
	
	Whilst all of these factors are obviously relevant considerations, I am persuaded that the risk that I have identified cannot be adequately managed by that particular means, or indeed any means other that the defendant remaining a forensic patient. I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons.
	
	
	To begin with, even when full weight is given to the facilities and set-up which is available at the Centre, the defendant, in the opinion of Dr Allnutt, would have difficulty understanding and complying with management conditions and directions in that type of setting. This difficulty comes about as a consequence of his impaired cognitive state, an issue about which all of the experts are generally agreed.
	
	
	Further, whilst access to medical assistance and treatment is obviously available at the Centre, such access in comparatively limited. The Centre is staffed essentially by registered nurses. Access is available to a General Practitioner. Access to a special psychiatrist is also available through weekly visits. Any further treatment required is seemingly accessed through the St George Hospital. On any view of the evidence, appropriate treatment is essential to the management of the defendant’s condition generally, and to the management of the identified risk in particular. I have no doubt that the level of care and treatment available through the Centre is administered by properly qualified and caring professionals. However, it cannot compare with that which would be provided in the clinical setting envisaged, and regarded as necessary, by Dr Allnutt, under the purview of the Tribunal. On the evidence, the ongoing treatment, management, and monitoring of the defendant’s condition will be carried out at a substantially higher level if he were to remain a forensic patient.
	
	
	Importantly, in his risk management plan, Dr Allnutt made specific reference to the defendant’s need for ongoing treatment and counselling of a kind which not only managed the defendant, but which monitored him. Although, as counsel for the defendant pointed out, Dr Allnutt accepted that the environment provided by the Centre “could” be appropriate, his clearly expressed preference was that any move to a facility of that kind occur at a time following the carrying of appropriate testing directed towards assessing the adequacy of alternative solutions.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the defendant’s physical movements would, in all probability, be monitored (and appropriately restrained) at the centre. In these circumstances, even though it is theoretically possible, it would be unlikely that he would have access to alcohol which, as outlined by the experts, has a direct bearing on his condition. However, as Dr Allnutt pointed out in his evidence, managing the relevant risk requires a multi-factorial approach. That approach extends substantially beyond the imposition of physical control. It involves the administration of appropriate treatment and the monitoring of its effect. Significantly, and as I have previously noted, Prof. Woods took the view that the defendant would not be adequately managed in a setting where he did not have the benefit of a high level of care. Care and treatment administered under the purview of the Mental Health Tribunal, which as Dr Allnutt pointed out provides essentially immediate access to a variety of expertise, cannot be compared to the limited availability of such care and treatment which is available at the Centre.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, I am satisfied to the requisite standard that the identified risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons that follow I make the following order:
	



	
	Pursuant to Clause 7(1)(a) of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the status of the defendant as a forensic patient is extended for a period of 2 years on and from 30 September 2015.

The applications before the court


	
	The plaintiff and defendant each bring applications in relation to the three causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim filed on 4 February 2011.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application is for leave to abandon two of those three claims, namely the causes of action pleaded under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and for injurious falsehood. An application to amend to seek special damages and claim damages for republication was also brought, but was abandoned after the hearing of the motion on 19 August 2015.
	
	
	The defendant’s application is for summary dismissal of these two causes of action and the defamation damages claims, as opposed to permitting the plaintiff merely to abandon them, and for special orders as to costs.
	
	
	The defendant’s application is technically first in time, as the plaintiff sought to list his challenge to the statement of claim on 5 May and 7 June 2015 but could not do so because of late amendments by the plaintiff. However, for reasons of convenience, I have dealt with the applications together.
	
	
	In order to explain why the defendant seeks summary dismissal of two of the three causes of action pleaded against him, as opposed to merely consenting to the plaintiff abandoning them, it is necessary to set out the procedural history of this bitterly fought claim.
	


The plaintiff files, but does not serve, proceedings commenced in the Defamation List


	
	The background to these proceedings is as follows. The plaintiff (a medical practitioner) and the defendant (a builder) own adjoining rural properties. They fell out over fencing issues and there were proceedings in the Local Court. The defendant made a complaint about the plaintiff to the NSW Medical Board on 5 February 2010. He then sent a shorter follow-up letter on 28 March 2010 complaining that, after he lodged the complaint, the plaintiff had sought a restraining order from police.
	
	
	The defendant’s complaint to the Medical Board was dismissed on 12 July 2010 (Exhibit 1). Six months later, on 14 December 2010, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant, stating that they had instructions “to bring proceedings for, inter alia, injurious falsehood, as a consequence of various complaints made by you” and indicating a willingness to desist in the instituting of proceedings for damages if an apology and the withdrawal of the complaints occurred. The defendant did not reply to this letter, or to a follow-up letter of 11 January 2011. On 4 February 2011, the last day of the defamation limitation period for the first matter complained of, the plaintiff’s statement of claim, seeking damages for injurious falsehood, defamation and a claim under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), was filed in this court’s Defamation List.
	
	
	Service must be effected within a month of commencement (r 6.2(4)(b)(ii) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”)) unless an extension is granted. However, the plaintiff did not effect service of the statement of claim for another one and a half years, as he was waiting for the NSW Court of Appeal to hand down Lucire v Parmegiani [2012] NSWCA 86. After the first return date on 25 February 2011, the plaintiff’s claim (stale by 4 March 2011) was stood over four further times in 2011 and another three times in 2012. It was not until 4 May 2012 that an application for extension of time was made (ex parte) and granted. Even then, the statement of claim was not served within one month of that order, being served on 21 June 2012.
	
	
	The defendant then sought an order setting aside service of the statement of claim. The plaintiff sought an order extending time for service up to and including 21 June 2012. Both applications were set down for hearing on 10 August 2012 and then adjourned to subsequent dates. In Hanson v Hunter (District Court of New South Wales, Bozic SC DCJ, 10 May 2013) Bozic SC DCJ extended time for service to 21 June 2012 and dismissed the defendant’s application.
	


The defendant appeals unsuccessfully


	
	The defendant’s application for leave to appeal from this order was filed and heard concurrently with the leave application on 13 August 2014 (Hunter v Hanson [2014] NSWCA 263). The appeal was dismissed (McColl and Macfarlan JJA; Emmett JA dissenting). An application for leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was brought. Leave was refused on 13 February 2015 (Hunter v Hanson [2015] HCATrans 16). The proceedings were then relisted in the Defamation List on 26 March 2015 for directions.
	


The defendant seeks particulars of the plaintiff’s claim


	
	At the directions hearing on 26 March 2015, I ordered the defendant to serve a request for further and better particulars and “any objections to the statement of claim” on or before 16 April 2015, with replies to be received by 30 April 2015, with the matter listed “for argument, if necessary, or directions” on 7 May 2015. The plaintiff would have been on notice, from this application, that there were likely to be objections to the pleading of the causes of action heard on 7 May 2015 and that an argument about the statement of claim was likely to take place.
	
	
	On 5 May 2015, two days before the proceedings were listed, the solicitors for the plaintiff provided not only answers to particulars (of the defamation claim only) but a proposed amended statement of claim. This letter was received the day before the proceedings came before the court for directions.
	
	
	The answer to a number of the requests for particulars (which sought to flush out material necessary to attack the pleadings), was that the plaintiff now sought to abandon the claims for injurious falsehood and under the Fair Trading Act, and a draft pleading to that effect was attached. The solicitors for the plaintiff asked the defendant to consent to the filing of this draft amended statement of claim, in which case “there will be no need for argument before the Court on 7 May 2015”. To this effect, Short Minutes of Order were attached so that this order could be made in chambers (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	There are three matters to note in relation to this covering letter. First, the plaintiff was well aware the proceedings were in for argument. Second, although not referred to in the covering letter, a claim for republication, in the same form as that in the most recent version of the proposed statement of claim, was also included. Third, no claim was made for special damages, which is of particular relevance to the hopelessness of the injurious falsehood claim. The following statement was made at paragraph 15 on page 2:
	


“The plaintiff does not claim special damages.”


	
	The triggering event in this decision appears to have been events in other proceedings (Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 610 at [41]), in which the solicitors for the defendant, who are also the solicitors for the plaintiff in these proceedings, brought an application before McCallum J on 1 May 2015 to strike out a claim for injurious falsehood which suffered the same fatal defect as the claim for injurious falsehood in these proceedings – no particulars of special damage (McCallum J went on to strike out the injurious falsehood claim on 26 June 2015: Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 5) [2015] NSWSC 830).
	
	
	When Dr Hanson’s proceedings came before the court on 7 May, Mr Bevan, for the defendant, was unable to deal with this sudden acknowledgement that the plaintiff proposed to abandon two of his three causes of action, but was not prepared to abandon his own argument, and the proceedings were stood over by me “for argument if necessary” on 11 June.
	
	
	Once again, the day before this adjourned argument (10 June 2015), a further proposed statement of claim was sent to the solicitors for the defendant. The letter of 10 June 2015 stated that they had “recently been provided with further information in relation to our client’s claim”, but does not say what this information is, or that a claim has been added for special damages for the defamation claim. Not only the “proposed amended pleading” and “proposed short minutes” were attached, but the complaint is made that “despite our requests” the basis for the objection to the amendment of the statement of claim had still not been explained.
	
	
	Ms White, for the plaintiff, has told the court that the information the basis for this claim for special damages only came to the plaintiff’s lawyers’ attention after 5 May 2015, and that this was why they had stated, in the letter of 5 May 2015 enclosing the previous draft statement of claim, that no claim was made for special damages, and had made no such claim in the previous draft.
	
	
	This means that this current claim for special damages could not have formed part of the plaintiff’s 2010 claims for injurious falsehood (or, for that matter, form any part of the claim for misleading or deceptive conduct under s 42 Fair Trading Act, where the puzzling claim is made in paragraph 20 that the representations were made “in the course of business of applying to purchase land”).
	
	
	The late service of this additional claim meant that the hearing of any application could not proceed on 11 June 2015. I accordingly fixed the plaintiff’s application for hearing on Thursday 30 July (later changed to 19 August 2015), with a timetable for submissions. At the request of Mr Bevan, who complained about receiving amended pleadings the day before the two previous dates for argument, I directed that no further amendments to the statement of claim could be made until further order.
	
	
	An outline of submissions from the plaintiff dated 3 July 2015, and a reply on behalf of the defendant dated 20 July 2015, were sent. Following the hearing of the applications on 19 August 2015, I reserved judgment, but gave counsel for the plaintiff leave to deal with some minor matters in written submissions. The submissions I received contained yet another proposed amended statement of claim and extensive submissions, requiring the relisting of the proceedings for further argument on 30 August 2015. The parties have now provided six sets of submissions in support of their oral argument on these two occasions and I have referred to those submissions by date when quoting from them.
	


The proposed amendments to the statement of claim


	
	The plaintiff initially sought leave to amend the statement of claim as follows:
	



	
	To delete paragraphs (2) and (3) from the relief claimed;
	
	
	To delete the claim for injurious falsehood set out at paragraphs 10 to 18 in the statement of claim;
	
	
	To delete the claim under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) set out at paragraphs 19 to 22 of the statement of claim;
	
	
	To include in paragraphs 2 (at subparagraphs (ii) and (iii)), 3 (at subparagraphs (ii) and (iii)) and in the particulars of aggravated damages (at subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv)) a claim for republication of the matters complained of to “at least the following” bodies, namely the Health Care Complaints Commission and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, on dates and in circumstances which are unspecified;
	
	
	To include a new claim for an unspecified sum for special damages, the text of which is set out in the paragraph below.
	



	
	The proposed amendment claiming special damages for defamation was as follows:
	


“Particulars of Special Damages

(a) Prior to the publication of the matters complained of, the Plaintiff was engaged in negotiations with a potential purchaser to sell his medical practice and commence employment with the potential purchaser in or about May 2010.

(b) The Plaintiff expected and anticipated that the negotiations referred to in paragraph (a) above would result in a concluded contract with the potential purchaser, following a formal offer received by the potential purchaser on or about 15 March 2010, as contained in a confidential draft Sale and Purchase of Business Deed.

(c) As a result of the matters complained of the Plaintiff was unable to proceed with the sale of his medical practice.”


	
	The defendant seeks the following orders:
	



	
	The summary dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for injurious falsehood and misleading and deceptive conduct, on the basis that the causes of action pleaded disclose no claim maintainable in law;
	
	
	The plaintiff’s application to amend the statement of claim to bring a claim for special damages and to rely upon republications (whether as going to damages only, or liability) be dismissed.
	


Should the plaintiff be permitted to abandon the defective pleadings, or should they be summarily dismissed?


	
	As is noted above, the plaintiff abandoned both the proposed amendments after the 19 August 2015 hearing, but maintains a position that he should be permitted to abandon both these claims and the abandoned Fair Trading Act and injurious falsehood claims without any examination as to their merit (or lack thereof) in the form of a summary dismissal application, or (in the case of the defamation claim) a strike-out without leave to amend.
	
	
	Rules 13.4 and 14.28 UCPR both provide for the dismissal of proceedings where there is no cause of action, and the principles set out in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129 – 130 are generally invoked. However, the list of circumstances in which such orders do not include a situation such as the present, where the party whose pleading is the subject of challenge abandons the proceedings in the face of such an application but effectively asks the court not to inquire further.
	
	
	The injurious falsehood and Fair Trading Act claims are currently “on the record” and the plaintiff requires leave to amend in order to abandon them. The question in relation to these two claims is whether the plaintiff (whose counsel has effectively conceded that the injurious falsehood claim, at least, is hopeless) should be entitled to drop these claims, or whether the defendant’s application for summary dismissal (which is technically first in time) should be granted. The proposed amendments to plead republication and special damages are the subject of an application for leave to amend which has now been abandoned and the question is whether any determination of their lack of merits (to determine if leave to replead should be granted) should proceed.
	
	
	The defendant submits that he needs a summary dismissal as the limitation period still has some time to run, and his client should have the certainty of the claims being concluded in his favour. The plaintiff submits that undertakings can be given to the court not to commence fresh proceedings (plaintiff’s submissions number 5, paragraph 53).
	
	
	The concept of a plaintiff giving a defendant an indemnity against his own claim may seem ‘at first slightly absurd” (Equuscorp Pty Ltd and Anor v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd and Ors [2006] QCA 194 at [12]), but it does have a place, albeit a limited one, in commercial contracts. However, the difficulties that it could give rise to in this litigation are considerable, and may create difficulties at the trial if it is asserted that the undertaking extends to particular kinds of evidence or submissions.
	
	
	The plaintiff has effectively conceded that at least one, and probably both, of his two proposed abandoned claims are hopeless, and has complicated the situation by bringing, and then abandoning, significant amendments to the defamation claim.
	
	
	Taking into account the confusion caused by the plaintiff’s chopping and changing of position, the undesirability of further delays and complications in these proceedings, and the obvious antagonism between the parties, I consider that the only sensible course to take is to permit the defendant to continue with his application to strike out these claims summarily. These proceedings need to progress towards a hearing untrammelled with complicated arguments about the nature and extent of the undertaking offered (the terms of which were not set out), and with a degree of finality sufficient to encourage the parties to focus on the claim for defamation.
	
	
	The most practical order to make, however, is not the judgment sought by the defendant, but an order for the summary dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for injurious falsehood and under the Fair Trading Act, of the same kind as that made by McCallum J in Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd. McCallum J’s orders refusing leave to amend and dismissing the claim are a simple and straightforward way of terminating these claims so that the parties can get on with the rest of the litigation in a more satisfactory manner than has heretofore been the case.
	
	
	The now-abandoned claims for special damages and republication claims require consideration on a separate basis, namely whether these should be abandoned or struck out without leave to replead. While the plaintiff does not seek leave to replead, no undertaking is offered in relation to these issues and they could be repleaded at any time.
	


The defendant’s submissions


	
	Why would the defendant be so troubled by the plaintiff dropping two of the three claims against him, assuming appropriate costs orders were made?
	
	
	The defendant’s first submission, when these applications came before me on 19 August 2015, is that, when the plaintiff first sought to excuse his 18-month delay in serving the statement of claim. But for the “timely threat” (defendant’s written submissions, 20 July 2015, paragraph 11) of an action for injurious falsehood in the letters before action, the plaintiff would never have obtained the extension of time he needed under UCPR r 1.2 to serve the statement of claim almost two and a half years after the cause of action accrued and one and a half years after time for service (under UCPR r 6.2(4)(b)(ii)) had expired.
	
	
	But for his letters before suit (which referred only to injurious falsehood) and the commencement of proceedings for injurious falsehood and under the Fair Trading Act (both of which had 6-year limitation periods, unlike defamation actions) the plaintiff’s claim for extension of time for service would have been dismissed (defendant’s written submissions, 20 July 2015, paragraph 12). He could still have commenced fresh proceedings for the injurious falsehood and Fair Trading Act claims, but no application for an extension of time to sue for defamation could have survived the strict limitation test (defendant’s written submissions, 20 July 2015, paragraphs 13 – 14).
	
	
	In other words, the defendant submits that the injurious falsehood and Fair Trading Act claims were an abuse of process designed to help the plaintiff get time to serve his claim extended and, once he had that, they were to be dropped because he knew, as did his legal advisers, that he had suffered no special damage, and the complaint letters were not sent in relation to the purchase of land as claimed in paragraph 20 of the statement of claim.
	
	
	The defendant’s second submission was that these claims were hopeless on their face, and that the plaintiff should not be let off easily by abandoning them when confronted with an application for them to be struck out. Instead, as had been the plan when seeking a timetable to argue these matters, the defendant should remain entitled to summary dismissal both of these claims as well as to bring an application to strike out the proposed pleas of special damages and republication claims, which were simply further abuses of process, as well as costs orders appropriate to the hopelessness of the pleadings allowed to remain in the claim for the past four and a half years.
	
	
	Mr Bevan also submitted that the hopeless nature of the proposed additional pleadings of republication and special damages should be seen in the prism of the equally hopeless nature of the injurious falsehood and Fair Trading Act claims, on the basis that prior inadequate pleadings would be relevant to the exercise of discretion to amend.
	
	
	The defendant’s final submission was that unless these causes of action were summarily dismissed, the plaintiff would be at liberty to seek leave afresh to add them in.
	
	
	As to lack of merit, Mr Bevan did not spend long on the injurious falsehood claim, as counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that it was a hopeless pleading. He did, however, make a series of attacks on the Fair Trading Act claim:
	



	
	Paragraph 20 of the statement of claim identifies these publications as having been made “in the course of purchase of land”, which Mr Bevan submitted was “arrant nonsense”. These were two letters of complaint to the Medical Board. No purchase of land was involved. This whole paragraph would have to be repleaded in order to identify the trade or commerce in which the representations occurred. The claim could be struck out on this basis alone.
	
	
	If the basis of the claim is that the representations were those made in the two letters sent to the Medical Board, it now appears to be accepted law that a complaint made to (or as part of) a tribunal process may not amount to conduct in trade or commerce. While there was sufficient doubt in the past about the issue for the court to refuse summary dismissal in Merman Pty Ltd v Cockburn Cement Ltd (1988) 84 ALR 521, Campbell J held, in Energetech Australia Pty Ltd v Sides Engineering Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1143 at [52] - [57], that the submission of a payment claim to an adjudicator was not made in trade and commerce. This is a logical conclusion to draw from representations in the form of a complaint being made to a body with an obligation to investigate them, as opposed to rely upon them.
	
	
	The pleading fails to set out the material facts beyond publication, and consists of “general uninformative language” (Shelton v NRMA [2004] FCA 1393 at [35]) in the form of imputations. The question of what actual representations were made, as opposed to what imputations of a defamatory nature were conveyed, is not addressed.
	
	
	The essential elements for the claim for damages are all missing. The claim has not been pleaded or particularised as a Fair Trading Act claim at all; it is simply pleaded as another form of defamation claim, complete with aggravated damages, which may not be claimed for such actions: Seafolly Pty Ltd v Madden (No 4) (2014) 320 ALR 763 at [55].
	
	
	There is also a specific claim for punitive damages pleaded for the Fair Trading Act claim. In Boland v Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd (1999) 167 ALR 575, Gaudron J warns generally about the conflation of different heads of damages for different causes of action and specifically notes the unavailability of punitive damages for claims of misleading and deceptive conduct (at [106]):
	


“Moreover, the damages recoverable for breach of s 52 of the Act are not necessarily co-extensive with those recoverable in negligence. In particular, damages are confined to actual loss and, thus, do not include punitive damages. Further, it is possible that they are not limited either by the foreseeability of consequential damage or remoteness. And significantly for present purposes, if s 52 had applied in this case, there would be no occasion to consider whether the appellants were “immune from suit“. That question could only arise if it were found that the appellants were negligent but that s 52 did not apply to their conduct.”


	
	Mr Bevan also addressed me as to the inadequacy of the claim for special damages, a topic which I have considered separately below.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Ms White states that her client’s explanation for dropping two of the three causes of action was “to narrow the issues in dispute, thereby reducing the costs for both parties” (plaintiff’s written submission, 3 July 2015, paragraph 14), “to determine the real issues in the proceedings” (plaintiff’s written submission, 3 July 2015, paragraph 25) and to “focus the attention of the parties to the defamation cause of action (plaintiff’s written submission, 3 July 2015, paragraph 26), placing reliance upon ss 56, 57 and 64 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and to Aon Risk Services Australia Pty Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175. An amendment “will be allowed if sought at an early stage of the proceedings” (plaintiff’s written submission, 3 July 2015, paragraph 22) and as the proceedings had not yet proceeded beyond the statement of claim, the proceedings were still in their early stages, notwithstanding the effluxion of time for reasons for which the defendant should be held responsible by reason of his failed appeal.
	
	
	Ms White added that there could be no prejudice to the defendant from this rearranging of the case by the bringing of the special damages claim in such circumstances, and the republication plea would only go to the issue of damages.
	
	
	Ms White complained that the defendant has “taken every point” and “taken an argument about late service” (which I infer is submitted to be a complaint of a trivial nature) all the way to the High Court and that the proceedings before me are effectively the second return date. In those circumstances, there has been no delay by her client and there was thus no need for any explanation of the lateness with which the application to amend is brought: Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University at [99]-[102]. Her client abandoned these claims not because they were hopeless but with the obligations of ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) in mind.
	
	
	However, the real reason the injurious falsehood claim was dropped, as Ms White acknowledged, was that the defendant’s legal representatives had been alerted to the problem of failure to plead special damages by Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 4) and Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 5). Although there is a reference to “actual and special damages” in Dr Hanson’s statement of claim, the only particulars ever provided was the statement “particulars to be supplied” at paragraph 18. Her instructing solicitors had advised the plaintiff, in their answers to particulars dated 3 May 2015, that there was no claim for special damages. Although a claim for special damages was now proposed for the defamation claim, there was no intention to revive the injurious falsehood claim by adding this essential element – a claim for special damages – now that new information about special damages had come to hand. She acknowledged that, without special damages being pleaded, any claim for injurious falsehood would be hopeless, for the reasons outlines by McCallum J in Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 5).
	
	
	Ms White submitted that the Fair Trading Act claim was a strong claim and was only being dropped to narrow the issues at trial. However, in reply to Mr Bevan’s list of complaints, she conceded that there was not a lot she could say to defend the pleading.
	


Conclusions – The pleadings are hopeless and should be struck out


	
	Both the Fair Trading Act and injurious falsehood claims are hopelessly pleaded, disclose no cause of action and fail to identify the loss or damage. They should be struck out.
	
	
	I do not, however, propose to make any findings as to whether the lack of merits of these claims amounts to an abuse of process. Issues of abuse of process are matters for the trial.
	


The proposed special damages claim in the defamation proceedings


	
	Courts are increasingly concerned about the need for precision when claims for special damages are brought in defamation proceedings. As is discussed in more detail below, in Heugh v Askin [2014] WASC 30 and Pisano v Thrum (No 4) [2011] WASC 290, the plaintiff was not granted leave to replead the struck out special damages claim. Although the plaintiff does not ask now for leave to replead, the defendant fears, given the “track record” of these proceedings, that such an application may be made, and asks me to strike out this claim in clear terms, without any leave to replead being possible.
	
	
	The bringing of fanciful or unparticularised claims for special damages in defamation proceedings has been commented upon in a series of judgments in Australia (see, for example Lighthouse Forward Planning Pty Ltd v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2014] QSC 217 at [42]-[49]) and the United Kingdom (Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 3721 (QB)) . Prolonged failure to provide adequate particulars may result in the whole claim being dismissed, as was the case with in McGrane v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2012] QSC 133. Dr McGrane brought a claim for $95 million despite being unable to work as he had been sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment for murder.
	
	
	An example of a claim for special damages of a similar kind to the present may be found in Pisano v Thrum (No 4), where an orthopaedic specialist brought a claim for special damages following publication of a letter to hospital authorities. Dr Pisano, like the plaintiff in these proceedings, initially brought a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct and abandoned it, and then sought special damages in relation to the sole remaining claim for defamation.
	
	
	Le Miere J identified the requirement to link the publication and the financial loss, as opposed to making bald assertions, at [10] – [12]:
	


“[10] Where a plaintiff has suffered financial loss as a result of a publication he is entitled to claim for the loss as special damages. The plaintiff must prove that the defamatory publication is the cause of the financial loss. The defendant submits, in effect, that the plaintiff has not pleaded or established any causative link between the letter and the plaintiff working fewer hours per week.

[11] In Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Ltd v Ensham Resources Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 457 Chesterman J in the Supreme Court of Queensland said:

In any cause of action in respect of which causation is an essential element it is necessary to plead the material facts which are said to give rise to the causal connection. In particular it is necessary to plead the facts which lead to a reasonable inference that the acts complained of … and the alleged later event … stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect [15].

[12] The degree of certainty and particularity with which the special damage must be pleaded will vary from case to case and will depend on the circumstances. In Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 Bowen LJ said:

“In all actions accordingly on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves will produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done. To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles. To insist upon more would be manifest pedantry (532–533).”

[13] Working fewer hours is not an obvious or logical consequence of the publication of the letter complained of. Paragraph 19 does not plead the facts which lead to a reasonable inference that the publications complained of and the plaintiff working fewer hours stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect. The current plea is nothing more than a bald assertion than the publications caused the plaintiff to work fewer hours. The question for the court is whether [19] is a sufficient plea of special damage in all the circumstances. The court should require as much certainty and particularity as is reasonable having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts by which the damage is alleged to have been done.


	
	Dr Pisano sought special damages on two bases: he was being offered less hours of work, and received fewer referrals. Le Miere J considered the particulars of fewer referrals was inadequately pleaded, as:
	


“No particulars are given that would enable the defendant to know how those special damages are calculated and, if he wishes, to make an appropriate payment into court. The plaintiff’s particulars in relation to “lost referrals” fail to state the nature of the loss and the circumstances in which the loss was suffered.”


	
	Le Miere J was, however, satisfied that the plaintiff had provided sufficient particulars of the fewer hours worked. Nevertheless, his Honour struck out the whole of the claim for economic loss, for the following reasons:
	


“[16] If (d) and (e) of the particulars of loss and damage could be severed from the remaining particulars I would have struck out only those paragraphs of the particulars. However, it is not clear whether the plaintiff’s case that he suffered loss as a result of working 2.4 hours less per week after the defendant wrote the letter is confined to the period from 2 July 2002 to 11 December 2002 or continued until 2 July 2004. In those circumstances all of the particulars should be struck out. If the particulars are struck out then the whole of [19] should be struck out because without the particulars [19] fails to state any material facts giving rise to a claim for special damage.”


	
	In Heugh v Askin Kenneth Martin J similarly struck out claims for loss of earning capacity and loss of a chance because they were, in addition to being too broad, claimed without the pleading of the intermediate steps to establish why there would be such a loss following the publication:
	


“[30] Paragraph 19.3 reads that Mr Heugh suffered a loss of earning capacity. That is untenable; little more needs to be said about it because the plaintiff, I think, properly accepted it was simply too broad. There presents no arguable linkage to the passing of resolution 6 in terms of Mr Heugh’s removal of a director as to his loss of earning capacity generally in circumstances where earning capacity is not confined to the lost capacity as a director or, indeed, in any capacity at all. This is way too wide.

[31] Paragraph 19.4 contends for a loss of a chance for future employment as a managing director of Central Petroleum. That also cannot stand. Resolution 6, as carried, was for Mr Heugh’s removal as a director, not as managing director. He had already been removed at an earlier time as Central Petroleum’s managing director. If the argument was in terms of a loss of a chance, clearly various things must have fallen into place for Mr Heugh to be reappointed as a managing director, and the foundation stones to get one to that point are missing. Their absence exposes a conceptual deficiency in its own right. Hence, 19.4 should also be struck out.

[32] Paragraph 19.5 seeks loss of expected salary as a director and managing director of a comparable public company as the fourth defendant. Again, the intermediate steps to arguably reach that conclusion are simply not there. If it is meant that there is loss of salary for a non-executive director in other public companies then there is some material missing in terms of why there would be that loss, and the deficiency is even more obvious as regards the managing director scenario. That seems to me to be a totally different category to that of resolution 6 as regards the removal of a bare director of Central Petroleum. Hence, 19.5 cannot survive either.”


	
	The imposition of such a requirement is not limited to very restricted publications of the kind seen here. The matter complained of in Heugh v Askin was a circular to shareholders, where a degree of latitude might be expected, and indeed paragraph 19.1 of the special damages claim did survive, for this reason.
	
	
	Not only are there temporal problems (in that the special damages loss appears to have occurred before publication of the second matter complained of) but the vagueness of the pleadings, the uncertainties of the “confidential document” and the lack of causative link between the plaintiff’s failure to sell his Sydney practice and a complaint by his neighbour to the Medical Board must be fatal. No attempt has been made by the plaintiff to reformulate this plea; it is simply abandoned.
	
	
	Accordingly the proposed claim for special damages is struck out without any leave to replead being granted.
	


The republication claim


	
	This claim, which was to go to damages only, was abandoned in submissions sent after the first day of argument, apparently in acknowledgement of the unavailability of that course, for the reasons explained by McCallum J in Bateman v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd (No 4) at [17] – [27].
	
	
	The confidentiality of the proceedings and the fact that one of the bodies to whom the matter complained of was republished did not come into existence until after the matters complained of were published are only some of the difficulties touched upon in argument. I propose to strike out the proposed republication claim without any leave to replead being granted.
	
	
	The defendant has been successful in his application for summary dismissal of the claims under the Fair Trading Act and the injurious falsehood claim, and in having the claims for special damage and republication in the defamation claim dismissed. What should the costs consequences be?
	


Costs


	
	This was really the defendant’s application for summary dismissal, rather than the plaintiff’s application for leave to amend. However, the plaintiff has not only abandoned two out of three of the claims brought, but also the amendments to the defamation claim that he sought leave to make.
	
	
	Mr Bevan seeks an intricate series of costs orders, the pattern for which changed as the plaintiff’s amendments successively fell away. This has included stays and an application for me to reconsider earlier costs orders, including orders made by Bozic SC DCJ, which I decline to do. I appreciate Mr Bevan’s concerns for his client, but I propose to consider the issue of costs of this application in accordance with the usual principles, namely whether the costs should follow the event, be assessable now or at the end of the proceedings, and be assessed on the ordinary or the indemnity basis. In particular, I do not intend to revisit the orders of Bozic SC DCJ, who took into account considerations of an entirely different nature to those before me in this application.
	
	
	The general principles applicable where a party abandons a claim or seeks leave to amend to that effect are that the amending party must pay the costs thrown away. While counsel for the defendant submitted that this would be little more than the costs of answering the particulars, having regard to the circumstances in which the plaintiff further amended his claim after the hearing of the argument (in the face of an order I had made for no further amendments, and without the leave of the court), resulting in the proceedings being listed for argument on a second occasion, I consider that any such costs order should relate to the whole of the application, given the unsatisfactory way in which it was conducted.
	
	
	Where a party abandons a claim, or it is struck out as hopeless, as part of defamation proceedings, costs orders have been made on the basis that these be assessable forthwith, as those issues are now no longer a part of the proceedings: Oliver v Bryant Strata Management Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 16 May 1995); Prebble v Australian Broadcasting Commission (Levine J, 11 July 1997, unreported). The same principles have been considered in other areas of litigation where the claim struck out is futile (see for example Johnson v Department of Community Services (No 2) [1999] NSWSC 1251 at [17]–[19], which refers to Prebble v Australian Broadcasting Commission, and Shelton v NRMA at [58]), or where interlocutory proceedings are separate and completed (Fiduciary Lt v Morningstar Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 432), or where a party’s conduct of the application has caused delay or been unsatisfactory. It is a power sparingly used, because of the possibility of stultification of litigation on the merits of the claim by the making of such an order.
	
	
	In the present case, the defendant is already liable for very substantial costs as a result of his failed appeals to the Court of Appeal and the High Court. He is in an unusual position for that reason. It is clear, from Mr Bevan’s submissions, that the defendant considers it unjust that, having gone all the way to the High Court on a separate issue resulting in costs orders against him, the very pleadings that were relied upon then are now being abandoned. Mr Bevan submits that the defendant should not labour under the disadvantage of further costs in successfully opposing an unmeritorious claim. He also points out that the costs orders made against his client did not result from any wrongdoing or improper conduct, but from unsuccessfully complaining about a two and a half year delay by the plaintiff in commencing proceedings and serving the defendant.
	
	
	These factors are capable of being a special or unusual feature of the application before me, capable of warranting a departure from the usual rule. However, would the making of such an order be disproportionate? Ms White relies upon the discussion of proportionality in costs by Ipp JA in Skalkos v T & S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 281 and the provisions of s 60, arguing that the plaintiff already has costs orders in his favour, and that costs should await the determination of the merits of the proceedings (plaintiff’s written submissions, 28 August 2015, paragraphs 21 – 22).
	
	
	Concepts of proportionality must, in my view, take into account not only these issues, but other issues, including the manner of conduct of the application, the merit of the application, and the conduct of the proceedings generally. First, the claims under the Fair Trading Act and for injurious falsehood are hopeless and should be summarily struck out, and as a result those parts of the case are completed, in the sense of a finding on the merits. Second, concepts of proportionality should not outweigh the purpose of making such orders where the conduct of the application has been particularly unsatisfactory, as I am satisfied is the case here. The plaintiff’s conduct of this application has consisted of a series of last-minute amendments which resulted in the adjournment of this argument and the reopening of the argument after submissions were completed. The circumstances in which the most recent amendments were provided at “the heel of the hunt” and without leave are regrettable, and have considerably delayed the prompt resolution of the application.
	
	
	Taking into account the special circumstances of this case, I am of the view that this is an appropriate case for the costs in question to be assessable and assessed forthwith.
	
	
	Should such costs, if assessed now, be payable on an indemnity basis? Issues noted in Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure NSW (LexisNexis) at [42.5.7] as being capable of warranting such an order to include the abandoning of a claim: Ianelli v Hancock t/as Hancocks Solicitors [2012] NSWSC 417. However, the abandonment of a claim for the purpose of narrowing the issues in dispute would not warrant such an order: Lahoud v Lahoud [2006] NSWSC 126.
	
	
	Despite the language of the plaintiff’s written submissions, which framed this application in terms of narrowing the issues and focussing on the defamation. I am satisfied that the plaintiff and his legal advisers have known for some time that there was no evidence of special damage for the injurious falsehood claim and that there were real difficulties framing a Fair Trading Act claim as arising out of a complaint to the Medical Tribunal (Chaina v Alvaro Homes Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 353), but that alone would not be sufficient grounds for the awarding of costs on an indemnity basis. Whether viable or not, these claims and proposed amendments are hopelessly pleaded, and the plaintiff should, in the words of Jackson J (making indemnity costs orders for a similarly poorly pleaded claim) pay the costs of this “battle royal” on an indemnity basis: Mio Art Pty Ltd v Macequest Pty Ltd [2013] QSC 211 at [11].

		30 September 2015",2015-09-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767878,R v Gouliaditis [2015] NSWDC 383,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Drugs are terrible things, and users of drugs are often, when they are using drugs, terrible people. They lie, they cheat and they deceive as they pursue their desperate need to obtain drugs. The people who are responsible for much of this misery are drug dealers, such as the offender who appears for sentence today.
	
	
	Nicholaos Gouliaditis is however, a very different man today than he was when he was supplying drugs. No longer under the addiction of drugs, he is no longer a person who lies, cheats and deceives, and no longer a person who funds a drug habit through dealing in drugs. It is my job to sentence the offender for what he has done, taking into account the person that he is today.
	
	
	The offender’s experience in attending fulltime residential rehabilitation and his experience of seeing others like him, whose lives are being destroyed by drugs, has made him realise how he contributed to those terrible circumstances. The community, parliament and judges regard drug dealing as seriously as we do because it does destroy lives, the lives of addicts and the lives of their families and friends.
	
	
	The offender has pleaded guilty to two offences. The first is one of supplying methylamphetamine and butanediol on an ongoing basis. He asks when I sentence him for that offence that I take into account five other matters on a Form 1,( which has been amended many times during today’s proceedings). Those five matters include an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, resisting arrest, possession of methylamphetamine, possession of 1,4-Butanediol, and dealing with the proceeds of crime being related to $1,145 found after his arrest.
	
	
	The second matter to which he has pleaded guilty is possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a TASER, without being authorised to do so by permit.
	
	
	The seriousness with which those offences are considered is easily demonstrated by consideration of the maximum penalties, 20 years for the ongoing drug supply matter, and 14 years with a standard non‑parole period of three years for the possess prohibited weapon matter. Of course, I have taken into account the maximum penalties and the standard non‑parole period for the prohibited weapon matter in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender.
	
	
	Mr Boulten, who appears for the offender, concedes his client was trafficking to a substantial degree. He therefore embarked upon the process of submitting to me that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify the offender being sentenced to other than fulltime custody. He first referred to the offender’s motive for committing his offences. This was not a case where the offender was doing this to make money. Certainly he was getting a financial benefit in that he was funding his own drug habit, but it is not a case where he was lured by the ease with which money can be made from drug supply so that he could spend money on luxuries of life.
	
	
	The next matter Mr Boulten relied on was the psychiatric disorder from which his client suffered at the time his drug use escalated leading to him becoming a drug supplier. At that time the offender was going through a number of challenges in his life. He had recently broken up with a partner. He had revealed his sexuality to his family, which at least initially did not go well, and he had formed a new relationship with another partner who was a drug user himself.
	
	
	Mr Boulten next said that the offender’s rehabilitation, which was substantial, was another factor to be considered when deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	There was another matter dealt with which Mr Boulten relied on which it is inappropriate for me to mention.
	
	
	Then there was quasi custody of 11 months in two residential rehabilitation programs, his plea of guilty, a particular vulnerability in gaol and the loss of a career, which the offender loved and was good at.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that nothing less than fulltime custody was appropriate. Quite accurately the Crown pointed to community concern with drugs in the community and particular with the drug ice.
	
	
	Mr Boulten made a submission that one sentencing option which may be appropriate would be to adjourn this matter under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender has only recently been released from fulltime rehabilitation. Although he has apparently done exceptionally well and he in fact has done all which he could do to rehabilitate himself, there is some uncertainty as to whether that rehabilitation will continue now that he is no longer under the highly structured program at William Booth House. It was Mr Boulten’s submission that, if it was going to make a difference between fulltime custody and something else, then it would be appropriate for the matter to be adjourned for a period to allow Mr Gouliaditis to demonstrate what he will be doing with his life, to demonstrate that he can remain drug free, and to demonstrate that he is unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	The Crown’s submission was clear, the Crown said that no matter what rehabilitation was achieved by the offender, he had to go to gaol fulltime.
	
	
	I am not prepared to say that fulltime custody is required today. Although the offender’s crimes were serious indeed and although he has been himself responsible for harming the community in a significant way, there are a number of factors which have made me pause when I consider whether fulltime custody is required. It may be that after the period of adjournment I will allow, that the offender ultimately does receive a fulltime custodial sentence, but the period of adjournment will allow me to determine how long that period of custody will be and the extent to which special circumstances, if any, should allow a variation of the ratio of non‑parole period to head sentence. It may be that after the period of adjournment, the offender comes back with evidence of a kind that would persuade me that fulltime custody is not required because this case is exceptional.
	
	
	Whether it is truly exceptional or not, in my view, remains to be seen but I consider it appropriate to give the offender the opportunity of proving, if he can, that his rehabilitation is long lasting and that he can give up drugs whilst in the community, for more than a little over a month as he has so far.
	
	
	So I will adjourn the proceedings under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, for a substantial period of time. I will grant him bail. The conditions of that bail are as follows.
	



	
	He is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	He is to use no illegal drugs whatsoever and, I know it should not be necessary to say this but I will, that includes the drug cannabis.
	
	
	In order to demonstrate that he is not using drugs, he is to undergo regular and random urinalysis as directed by the Probation and Parole Service.
	
	
	In addition, he is, at his own expense, to undergo fortnightly urinalysis in order to prove that he is not using drugs.
	
	
	He is to notify the officer in‑charge who is present in court today, of his address and notify him of any change in that residential address within 24 hours of having moved.
	



	
	He is to report to the Sutherland Office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days.
	



	
	I also order Pre Sentence Report
	
	
	ADJOURNED FOR FURTHER SENTENCE TO FRIDAY 29 JULY 2016

2767879,R v Brewer (No 1) [2015] NSWSC 1471,"Judgment ex tempore (revised)


	
	This trial commenced before me earlier today, an order having been previously made that it proceed without a jury. The accused has pleaded not guilty to a charge that on 13 March 2014, at Pendle Hill in the State of New South Wales, he murdered Visakesvaran Velupillai (“the deceased”).
	
	
	Much of the Crown case is not in dispute and has been dealt with by the agreed tender of a number of statements. I am informed that leaving aside any expert psychiatric evidence which might be adduced, there will only be one other witness called in the Crown case. The focus of the proceedings today has been upon the Crown’s playing of excerpts of CCTV footage of the period up to and including the death of the deceased.
	
	
	I indicated to the Crown earlier today that I anticipated, given the nature and extent of that footage, that there would be an application for access to it by one or more media outlets. I have since been informed by the Court's media officer that in fact three commercial television stations have sought access to the footage. Whilst the information made available to me has not identified, with complete precision, the particular footage to which access has been sought, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the focus is upon two particular areas.
	
	
	The first concerns what footage of what is, on the Crown case, an altercation between the accused and the deceased in an arcade near the deceased’s business premises. In summary, that footage shows (inter alia) the deceased in possession of a broom, one inference being that he may have sought to use it as a weapon. A physical altercation follows between the deceased and the accused during which both disappear from view. The deceased is then seen to come back into view. On the Crown case the cause of death was a stab wound to the heart. The deceased’s movements when he comes back into view are consistent with a fatal injury having been inflicted upon him a short time before. Putting it bluntly, that footage depicts the final moments of the deceased's life.
	
	
	The second part of the footage in which I anticipate media outlets may be interested concerns the arrest of the accused. In the course of his arrest the accused gave his account of what had occurred. In doing so, he referred to the deceased in quite disparaging terms.
	
	
	The Crown has opposed the release of that part of the footage which shows the altercation and its immediate aftermath. The Crown's objection is based principally upon the likely distress that public dissemination of the footage would cause members of the deceased's immediate and extended family. Although not specifically stated, I infer that the Crown had in mind not only publication in the media, but the possibility of wider dissemination of the footage via the internet. I am told by the Crown, and I accept, that the deceased had young children. It is not hard to imagine the stress, anguish and grief which the deceased's death has already caused his family. I am satisfied that such emotions would be exacerbated, to a not insubstantial degree, if footage of the final moments of the deceased’s life were to be made public.
	
	
	Mr Skinner of counsel, who appears for the accused, has made no submissions in relation to the release of the footage leading up to the deceased’s death. However he has objected to the release of the footage of the accused's arrest. Mr Skinner made it clear that such opposition was based on his instructions that the accused was concerned at the embarrassment that he may suffer if that footage was released. The Crown did not oppose such release.
	
	
	Section 314 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides for media access to Court documents including the indictment, witness statements, transcripts as well as the police brief of evidence. There is no suggestion by either party that the CCTV footage to which access has been sought falls outside the provisions of s 314(2).
	
	
	There is also a Practice Note (No. SC Gen 2) which governs access to material of this nature. It provides that such access is restricted to parties to the proceedings, except with the leave of the Court. Para (7) of the Practice Note provides that access will normally be granted to non-parties in respect of (inter alia) material admitted into evidence, unless the judge dealing with the application considers that the material, or portions of it, should be kept confidential.
	
	
	In the present case, the CCTV footage has been played in open court. Access to the footage should, in terms of the Practice Note, be granted unless I come to the conclusion that it should be kept confidential.
	
	
	I have been referred to a decision of Adamson J in R v Abdallah (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 121 in which application was made by a media outlet for access to CCTV footage, and to an audio recording of a 000 call. Her Honour refused that application. It is evident from the judgment that her Honour had the benefit of considered submissions from counsel for the applicant in that case. In the present case, none of the media organisations who seek access to the footage have been represented.
	
	
	It is apparent that in refusing the application in Abdallah Adamson J had regard to the fact that the proceedings were before a jury. In particular, her Honour made reference (at [17]) to the necessity to balance the interests of open justice against the need for circumspection with respect to the release of information. Her Honour also made reference to the associated need to protect the administration of justice.
	
	
	Her Honour observed that judges who make decisions alone in civil trials are thought to be capable of putting out of their mind extraneous matters, and of suspending judgment until the time for decision arrives. However, her Honour also observed that press coverage and commentary may influence members of the public who may be called upon to be jurors, and may give rise to pressure being placed on those who are jurors, notwithstanding the safeguards built into the system to prevent this from occurring.
	
	
	It is evident that the circumstances in [12] and [13] above played a part in her Honour coming to the conclusion that the application should be refused. The present proceedings before me are not a trial by a jury. It follows that at least part of the factual basis of her Honour’s decision is distinguishable.
	
	
	However, her Honour also made the following relevant observation (at [24]):
	


“I have also weighed the interests of the deceased's family to which, as it happens the accused also belongs, as she and the deceased were cousins. The difficulty of coming to terms with the loss of a 21 year old woman who died as a result of violence cannot be overestimated. The publicity that can be expected to be given to moving images of her last hours of life could not but aggravate their grief and distress.”


	
	In the present case there is no suggestion that the accused and the deceased belong to the same family. However in my view, the difficulty to which her Honour referred also arises in the present case, and is no less important. In my view, the likelihood is that the grief and distress obviously felt by the members of the accused's family would be significantly aggravated if images of the last moments of the deceased's life were to be broadcast to the public at large.
	
	
	For those reasons I refuse the application for access to that part of the CCTV footage which depicts the altercation between the deceased and the accused in the arcade, and which also depicts the last moments of the deceased's life in the way in which I have described it.
	
	
	The considerations which lead me to refuse access to that part of the footage do not apply to the footage of the accused's arrest. In my view, given that the trial is not before a jury, the accused would suffer no prejudice if that footage were made available. I accept that the accused may feel some embarrassment as a consequence of some of the things he said when he was arrested. However in the circumstances of the present case that does not, in my view, justify refusing an application for access to the footage. The principles of open justice weigh in favour of that application being granted.
	
	
	Accordingly, I grant the application for access to the footage of the accused's arrest.

		07 October 2015",2015-10-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767881,R v Weismantel (No 3) [2015] NSWDC 227,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Blake Weismantel stands for sentence for five crimes. The first four of those crimes are part of the subject of my evidentiary ruling reported at [2015] NSWDC 122. At that time I was concerned with five counts in an indictment that had been presented by the Crown. After my ruling, which concerned coincidence evidence, the parties asked for an adjournment which was granted and the Crown eventually presented a fresh indictment containing four counts only, to each of which counts the offender pleaded that he was guilty.
	
	
	The offender was then called on for trial on an indictment containing one count. That indictment alleged an offence on 31 December 2013 contrary to the provisions of s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offender made an application for trial by judge alone, which I granted. I then conducted the trial. I found the offender guilty of the charge. My reasons for bringing in that verdict are reported at [2015] NSWDC 213. In essence, the trial was purely documentary. The defence offered by the offender was a legal one but he was unsuccessful in that regard. The nature of the defence is discussed commencing at [49] of that judgment. The facts are well known to the offender and to the Crown and are readily available to members of the public. I need not recite them.
	
	
	I shall, however, record the agreed facts placed before me at this sentencing hearing concerning the four offences which occurred on 23 September 2013. On that day Daniel Roach and Amanda Ridden checked into room 333 at the Linwood Lodge at Artarmon under an alias. Later that afternoon they were joined by the current offender and Anthony Woodman. At about 4.45pm on that afternoon the offender and Woodman attended the Freeway Hotel at Artarmon. CCTV footage from the Freeway Hotel depicted the offender wearing a grey “Canterbury” brand T-shirt, black “Canterbury” brand shorts with a white stripe and red underwear. Woodman purchased a case of VB beer. The offender and Woodman were later seen returning to the Linwood Lodge with that case of beer.
	
	
	At about 7.30pm that evening, Phillip Brighton, an 87 year old gentleman, was returning to his home in Lane Cove in his motor car. He noticed a group of young people standing on the pavement at the intersection of his street and another road. As Mr Brighton turned into the street in which he resided he noticed a young lady walking ahead of the group of other young people. As he turned into his driveway he remotely activated the garage door and drove into the garage. As he switched off the engine he noticed Daniel Roach, Anthony Woodman and the offender standing alongside his car inside the garage. Those three appeared to Mr Brighton to be the same persons he had seen standing at the intersection of his street as he was about to drive into his street. One of the male offenders demanded that Mr Brighton hand over his keys. That male offender said, “Give me the car keys. We’re not going to hurt you.” Mr Brighton held his hand out with the keys while he was sitting in the car. The male offender who had made the demand took the keys from Mr Brighton's hand and told him to get out of the car. He did so. It is an agreed fact that Mr Brighton handed over the keys of his car for fear of his safety. Mr Brighton was unable to say if the female, Amanda Ridden, was inside the garage as well as the three young male offenders. His car was then driven away. It was a 2003 dark blue Nissan Pulsar motor vehicle.
	
	
	At 7.54pm that same evening Roach, Ridden, Woodman and the offender entered the Roseville Cinema on the Pacific Highway Roseville. One was armed with a sawn off shotgun. That person was the present offender. Roach was armed with an axe. Each of the four offenders had covered his or her face with other items of clothing. A movie was about to commence at the cinema and, accordingly, there were a number of patrons inside the cinema about to enter the auditorium room itself. Roach initially threatened an employee, Michael Sheppard, who was working in the Candy Bar. He demanded that Mr Sheppard hand over the money contained in the cash register of the cinema. Sheppard, perhaps foolhardily, told Roach to decamp using foul language. He ran to the box office to trigger an alarm. Roach then jumped over the Candy Bar onto the same side of the counter as Mr Sheppard. At this stage the present offender who was armed with the sawn off shotgun pointed it towards Sheppard and shouted words to the effect of, “Do you want to die?” Roach then entered the box office and demanded that Sheppard open the safe. Sheppard replied that there was no safe and told him that the silent alarm had been tripped. Sheppard took a bunch of $50 notes from the cash register and passed those notes to Roach telling him to take it and leave as the police were about to arrive. Whilst that was happening, Woodman threatened customers and demanded that they hand over their wallets. One of the customers, a gentleman named Mr Barry Price, who is described in the facts as “elderly”, handed over his wallet which contained $90 in cash together with Mr Price’s driver’s licence, credit cards and a number of personal papers. During this, the female, Amanda Ridden, was a “lookout”, or, to use the old Australian vernacular, playing the cockatoo. These four offenders then decided to decamp. A total of $506.50 was taken from the Roseville Cinema as well as the $90 which was taken from Mr Price.
	
	
	The agreed facts tell me that the CCTV footage taken within the Roseville Cinema depicts the offender wearing red underwear which bore a similarity to the underwear worn by him in the Freeway Hotel at Artarmon earlier on that day. I have seen that CCTV footage in the process of making the evidentiary ruling to which I have referred. What is striking is not the offender’s underwear but the way in which he sought to disguise head, swathing it with other items of clothing. His head was swathed in exactly the same way at a subsequent armed robbery on the same evening, from film of which it can be seen that the offender dropped packets of cigarettes which, when examined were found to carry his DNA, thereby positively establishing the offender’s identity as the man with the sawn-off shotgun with his head swathed in a certain way at the Roseville Cinema as well as having his head swathed the same way at the subsequent crime scene.
	
	
	The four offenders had arrived at the Roseville Cinema in Mr Brighton’s motor car. The toll and other records indicate that that car was then driven to the Revesby Pacific Hotel at Revesby. The four offenders who had participated in the armed robbery at the Roseville Cinema participated in a robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel which commenced about 9.40pm. At that robbery, Woodman was carrying the sawn-off shotgun, Roach was still carrying a small axe and Amanda Ridden had armed herself with a walking stick which belonged to Mr Phillip Brighton and had been taken from his car where it was normally kept by Mr Brighton. At this robbery the offender was not armed. Again, the CCTV footage taken at the Revesby Pacific Hotel shows the present offender wearing the same red underwear and his head swathed in the same fashion as it was at the Roseville Cinema. The CCTV footage clearly shows the offender accidentally spilling packets of cigarettes which he had taken from the office of the hotel into a cash register behind a bar which when tested revealed the DNA of the offender. The proceeds taken from the Revesby Pacific Hotel were $3,873 from three separate funds, the largest of the three funds being the takings of the pool table. The four offenders left the Revesby Pacific Hotel before the arrival of the police, driving the vehicle that had been taken from Mr Brighton. That vehicle was subsequently found burned out, that is, destroyed somewhere close to Parramatta but the current offender had no part to play in the destruction of Mr Brighton’s vehicle.
	
	
	I am required to discuss the objective seriousness of the various offences which the offender committed. Clearly a degree of planning was required for these four offences. However, the evidence before me clearly indicates that the organising mind of the person who decided to carry out these robberies, the person who planned them, was not the present offender but more probably than not, Daniel Roach. Learned counsel for the offender reminded me of a statement that had been made by a witness, Ms Natalie Donaldson, a half-sister of Daniel Roach, which statement was before me when I made the evidentiary ruling to which I have earlier referred. In that statement Ms Donaldson said this:
	


“During one afternoon after a couple of days of them having stayed at my unit I was sitting at the dining table with Daniel and Amanda....Both Daniel and Amanda were saying they had no money. Amanda said, ‘We need money’. Daniel said, ‘Let’s do a job’. Amanda said, ‘Okay’. Daniel said he had arranged for a gun and it was coming. I said, ‘Oh, who’...The conversation chopped and changed but always seemed to return to getting the gun...I did overhear a conversation between Daniel and Amanda where Daniel mentioned the name of the person he intended to buy the gun off....During the late afternoon/early evening a day or two before the robberies, the gun supplier, along with his little son and another male came to my unit....the morning after the gun dealer had come to my unit, there was a lot of talk between Daniel and Amanda about having the gun....Daniel went and got a blue enviro bag from my bedroom. Daniel sat on the mattress in the living room and removed the gun from the blue bag....Daniel ripped (the gun) off Jordan [her son] and started pointing it at me.

I said, ‘Don’t point it at me’. Daniel said, ‘It’s not loaded’...Daniel asked me to steal a car and drive him and Amanda around while they did robberies. Daniel said, ‘Get us a car and I’ll give you half of what we get’. I said, ‘No way’. Daniel said, ‘Okay, don’t steal it, borrow a car off one of your friends’. I said, ‘No way’. Daniel said, ‘Does any of your friends need to earn any money?’. I said, ‘No way’....Daniel got mad at that and said words along the lines that I didn’t have any backbone or ticker. Daniel and Amanda started using Jorden’s mobile phone and Facebook profile in an effort to find someone to drive a car while they did robberies.”

The inference to be drawn is that Roach and/or Ridden recruited Woodman and the current offender. Other evidence that I read on the evidentiary application indicates that of the two, that is Woodman and the current offender, Woodman is perhaps the leader and the offender might be described as his acquaintance or follower. Accordingly for these four offences I can accept that the current offender was not the ringleader or planner but merely a “soldier” in a joint criminal enterprise that was organised by others.


	
	As far as the carjacking is concerned, I am required to consider a number of different factors as set out in R v Barker [2006] NSWCCA 20:
	



	
	they are the level of planning,
	
	
	the number of persons involved,
	
	
	the type of threats made,
	
	
	the degree of violence,
	
	
	the number of persons in the vehicle at the time of the offence,
	
	
	the degree of fear instilled in the victim,
	
	
	the period of time in which the vehicle was used by those who had stolen it,
	
	
	the damage to the vehicle, if such damage does not give rise to a separate charge,
	
	
	the time and place at which the offence was committed, and
	
	
	the motive for the commission of the offence.
	


Here I accept that the planning was not done by this offender. However there were at least three offenders confronting one victim. A threat was made but the threat clearly indicated that no harm was intended to the victim. No violence was actually used. There was only one victim. Although I accept that a degree of fear was instilled in the victim the fear was not particularly great – I will shortly turn to evidence concerning that. Clearly the victim’s vehicle was used for criminal offences committed on over the evening after the stealing of the car. The car was destroyed, but I accept that the offender had no part to play in that destruction. The purpose clearly of the taking of the car was to use it as a tool in the joint criminal enterprise.


	
	In a statement made to police on 21 September 2013, Mr Brighton said amongst other things that, although he felt fear during the incident, the offenders “did not appear to be menacing.” In a transcript of the triple-0 call made by Mr Brighton, he states that the offenders acted in a “kindly” fashion to him. He is reported as saying this:
	


“In fact they kindly said, ‘we’re not going to hurt you old fella, because I’m 87 you see.’”

Looking at things objectively, this case of aggravated taking and driving of a motor vehicle is towards the bottom of the range of seriousness. The only thing which places it not at the very bottom of the range of seriousness is a number of young offenders confronting an old man.


	
	It is to be noted that the offender Roach has already been sentenced by his Honour Judge Haesler. His Honour passed an aggregate sentence on Roach. However, for the current offence his Honour gave an indicative sentence of three years and nine months with a non-parole period of two years and five months but took into account at the same time the destruction of the vehicle on a Form 1, which destruction was admitted by Roach. Clearly, any sentence to be passed upon the current offender for the same crime must be substantially less.
	
	
	The three armed robberies are clearly to be considered in light of the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In that case a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that a full term sentence of between four or five years imprisonment was warranted in a case involving seven characteristics. Those characteristics are these:
	


1.   a young offender with no, or little, criminal history;

2.   a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;

3.   limited degree of planning;

4.   limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;

5.   the victim in a vulnerable position, such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;

6.   a small amount taken;

7.   a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

In R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 it was said that the guideline judgment in R v Henry should be understood as involving a late plea of guilty for the purposes of the application of the guilty plea guideline promulgated in Thomson itself.


	
	The offender was a young man at the time. He is currently 23 years old. At the time of these four offences he was 21 years old. He has a criminal history but it could not be described as “little.” He has previously been sentenced to juvenile detention on two counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon. He has also previously been sentenced by this Court, as an adult, to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years for robbery armed with an offensive weapon. The weapons here were a sawn-off shotgun, as well as an axe, and, at the Revesby Pacific Hotel a walking stick. At the Roseville Cinema the shotgun was wielded by this offender but it was wielded by Woodman at the Revesby Pacific Hotel. The problem with a sawn-off shotgun is the same problem as encountered with any firearm. A person confronted by it does not know whether it is loaded or not and cannot escape its reach as one can escape the reach of a knife or other hand-held implement not capable of being discharged. In my view, robbery whilst armed with a sawn-off is outside the category of weapon considered in the guideline judgment in R v Henry. Clearly there was some degree of planning but it does not appear to have been particularly sophisticated. For example, the group did not bother to obtain balaclavas for them to hide their appearance but improvised using other items of clothing. No attempt was made to change their clothing in between, for example, the robberies at the Roseville Cinema and the robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel. I accept that there was no actual violence but clearly there was a real threat in robbery. The victim in each case should not be seen as being, “in a vulnerable position”, as a shopkeeper and taxi driver, arguably alone, or accompanied only by some junior insofar as the shopkeeper is concerned. Here, both the manager of the Revesby Pacific Hotel and the employee of the Roseville Cinema, were surrounded by others and company creates solidarity, and it lessens the fear felt by the victim, just as robbers in company because of their solidarity, increase the threat to the victim(s) of the robbery. As far as the Roseville Cinema is concerned, there was a small amount taken but the same cannot be said for the robbery at the Revesby Pacific Hotel. In the current case, the offender pleaded guilty after an evidentiary ruling which made the prospect of conviction more certain but also only after the Crown dropped one of the charges.
	
	
	In respect of the armed robbery at the Roseville Cinema, Judge Haesler fixed an indicative sentence of seven years and six months but that was for one offence only and the robbery of Mr Price was, as far as Roach was concerned, a matter contained on a Form 1. As far as the Revesby Pacific Hotel was concerned, Judge Haesler gave an indicative sentence of seven years’ imprisonment for the armed robbery, when sentencing Roach. When discussing the seriousness of the robberies carried out on the 23 September 2014 Judge Haesler said this:
	


“The objective seriousness of the two robberies, armed with dangerous weapons would be obvious to anyone from my brief recitation of the facts. The offenders were in company with each other. An axe and a sawn off shotgun were used. A number of staff and patrons were present and threatened. The co-offender’s threats, as part of this enterprise, were to kill. While the planning and execution appeared to be haphazard, ill thought out, and inept, it was planning nevertheless.

There appeared to be little thought to the consequences of their crime on the individual victims, those nearby and to the community in general. There appears to be little thought given to the consequences of themselves, as arrest would have been, had anyone thought about the matter, almost inevitable.”


	
	I turn now to the fifth offence, that carried out on 31 December 2013. On that occasion the offender was armed with a knife and he assaulted Mr Sathaporn Wongsamak with intent to rob him and at the time of the assault the offender inflicted grievous bodily harm upon him. This is an offence contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has prescribed a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and fixed a standard non-parole period of seven years. I do not wish to recite the facts in greater detail. If they are required by anybody they can be found at the reported decision which I have earlier mentioned.
	
	
	I have no hesitation in finding that the offender did not intend to inflict any harm upon the victim either actual bodily harm, let alone grievous bodily harm. The law only required an intentional act by the offender. That intentional act was seeking to ward off the victim’s attempt to stop the offender robbing the victim’s business. In the process of doing that the victim was pushed backwards and fell accidentally to the floor suffering a bad fracture of his right ankle. The offence alleged could be committed by somebody actually intending to inflict harm or actually intending to inflict grievous bodily harm. In my view the lack of any intention to harm the victim, the harm being accidental to a large extent, puts this case below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	In determining an appropriate sentence for this offence I am not required to assess whether or not, having regard to the standard non-parole period, the offence is within the middle range of objective seriousness. Similarly, I am not required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period. The relevant statutory provisions particularly ss 21A, 54B(2) and 54B(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 require an approach to sentencing with all of the relevant factors identified and, having regard to all such factors, a determination reached as to the appropriate sentence to be applied. That is the outcome of the decision in Muldrock’s case. However I am required by the statute where there is a standard non-parole period to indicate what non-parole period I would impose for an offence which carries a standard non-parole period even if I proceed as I intend to do to impose an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	I now turn to the offender’s personal circumstances. They are a matter of great concern, not only to the offender, but to the Court and also ought be to the community. They cause many complications in any sentencing exercise. The offender was interviewed by Dr Richard Furst, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, on 24 July 2015. Dr Furst had first assessed the offender on 1 February 2012. At that time the offender was aged 19. At the time of the more recent interview the offender was, as he is now, 23 years old. I take much of the following from the history reported by Dr Furst.
	
	
	The offender identifies himself as an Aboriginal Australian. The offender’s father was an alcoholic and his mother was addicted to heroin. His parents separated when he was about eight years old. The offender was then raised by his mother. His mother struggled to provide for him both financially and emotionally. He was regarded as a “child at risk” by the Department of Community Services as that Department used to be known. The offender was also thought to be angrily disturbed, having anger issues and mood swings throughout childhood. He was also thought to be suffering from Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder. He had a history of conduct problems throughout his childhood and during his schooling. He was suspended on multiple occasions from school and struggled in class. He ended up at a special school at Naremburn as a teenager but was expelled in year 9 because of violent behaviour. He subsequently obtained the School Certificate while in the Hornsby TAFE. The offender has been unable to gain employment. He was incarcerated as a juvenile.
	
	
	He has been incarcerated as an adult. He has a history of psychotic symptoms dating back to his childhood, including hearing voices. He has been treated in the past by Juvenile Justice and also by Justice Health with antipsychotic medication. The offender reported a range of psychotic symptoms when assessed in custody in January 2010 including command auditory hallucinations, paranoid thoughts and a belief that God was sending him messages through the television. The offender was experiencing apparent delusions of reference when assessed by Dr Furst in February 2012 and at that time he also reported various auditory hallucinations. Dr Furst thought he was paranoid at that time. The offender told Dr Furst that people were “plotting to kill him”. He gave a history of hearing voices and seeing images of a deceased friend who had committed suicide in 2011. The offender also gave a history of visual allusions. Dr Furst thought in February of 2010 that the offender was low in mood and was suffering from anxiety and had unresolved grief issues.
	
	
	The offender continued to experience auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations and paranoia when discharged from custody and returning to the community in 2013. He was under the care of the Chatswood Community Health Team operating from the Royal North Shore Hospital. He was then being treated by a psychiatrist, Dr David Bell, who prescribed a range of pharmacological treatments. He was also seeing a case manager every fortnight because he was on parole. When asked about his condition in 2013 the offender said that he “was having continual arguments within my own head. Like someone hacked my own head...constant threats, commands, like a live commentary...all the time”.
	
	
	The offender had attempted to take his own life in the 36 hours prior to the offence on New Year’s Eve 2013 because he perceived that he was unable to cope with his mental health concerns. Clearly he was very ill immediately after the events and required urgent admission to the Intensive Care Unit at the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital. When the offender discussed that offence with Dr Furst the offender told Dr Furst that he was “a bit intoxicated” and “confused” at the time, that he was apparently arguing with himself earlier that day. He gave a history of hearing voices telling him that others were going “to get him” and his family. He was under the illusion that he was being attacked by others. He clearly had little memory of the offence that he committed on New Year’s Eve 2013. It is also clear from what the offender told Dr Furst that he had little active recollection of the offences on 23 September 2013.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the offender’s background which I have thus far described it is unsurprising that he took to alcohol and drugs to seek to ease his existential stress. He commenced abusing alcohol at the age of 12. He was drinking up to one litre of spirits at a time three times each week in his late teens. He continued drinking in that manner up until his arrest in December 2010. At the age of 14 he started abusing cannabis and valium. Very shortly thereafter, still aged 14, he took up using amphetamines and methamphetamine. He graduated to increasing doses of methamphetamine after the age of 14 years. He also used ecstasy and MDMA in his teenage years, party drugs. He used heroin between the ages of 15 and 16. He occasionally resorted to using “magic mushrooms.” His use of drugs decreased significantly when in custody but after his release from custody he involved himself in episodic binges involving the use of cannabis and methamphetamine as well as LSD.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, the offender had completed the drug and alcohol course in Young Offenders Program at the John Morony Correctional Centre ending up completing that course at the Oberon Correctional Centre before being released on parole in December 2012. However, it is clear that the offender quickly relapsed and was labouring under the effects of illicit drugs at the time he committed the current offences.
	
	
	When interviewed by Dr Furst on 24 July 2015, the offender reported ongoing symptoms of auditory hallucinations on a daily basis and symptoms of paranoia and he was clearly frustrated in his mood. The diagnoses offered by Dr Furst are firstly of Schizophrenia; secondly of Substance Use Disorder; and thirdly of an Anti-social/Borderline Personality Disorder. The features of Borderline Personality Disorder included multiple episodes of self‑harm in the offender’s teenage years. Dr Furst was of the opinion that that was most likely a product of the harsh treatment the offender received at the hands of his alcoholic father which included witnessing domestic violence, himself being the victim of physical violence, abuse and neglect. Both the offender’s parents were “addicts,” his father being addicted to alcohol and his mother to heroin, inferring a biological predisposition to addiction and providing poor role models for the offender in his formative years. During some formative years, namely, the offender’s early teenage years, his father was absent and the presence of a father for a male during the early teenage years is critical to social development. Dr Furst was of the opinion that the schizophrenia most likely had its onset when the offender was about 15 years old and perhaps results from or was precipitated by “chronic substance abuse.” The offender, himself, could hardly be said to be morally culpable for such psychiatric illnesses which result not from something innate to itself but from his background and upbringing.
	
	
	There are two significant opinions offered by Dr Furst. They are contained on p 8 of his report and are these:
	


“Negative peer associations, limited capacity for self-reflection, and chronic impairment in his level of function by virtue of his schizophrenia and personality disorder were probably the main factors contributing to the robbery offences in question before the court.

He remains at significant risk [of] relapsing into drug use and reoffending when released into the community as a product of his personality structure, poor role models and previous history of offences, warranting more intensive interventions for his addiction problems and mental illness.”

The first paragraph which I have just quoted points in the direction of a sentence that should be reduced. The second paragraph points in exactly the opposite direction.


	
	However, Dr Furst then sets out a number of recommendations for future treatment which commend themselves to me as being the most likely way of rehabilitating the present offender and returning him into the community as a worthwhile participant in it, as a man who can live without committing crime, a man who can live without drug addiction, a man who can support himself in the community. Time is running out and shall not cite in detail what is proposed by Dr Furst in any great detail. He recommends however that the offender complete an addiction program whilst in custody and a violent offender therapeutic program whilst in custody, has ongoing treatment for his psychotic condition and that he undertake educational and vocational training. Dr Furst recommends that when eligible for admission to parole, the offender not go directly into the community but go into a community-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre which will reinforce the previous addiction program that he has undertaken in custody, and operate in some way as a “halfway house” to ease the offender from institutionalisation in prison to independence in the community. Dr Furst recommends a higher level of monitoring and support by Community Corrections which might help the offender adjust to living in the community in the future. He also recommends psychiatric surveillance by Community Corrections and the local community mental health team.
	
	
	In Veen v The Queen No 2 [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465, the majority said at 476:
	


“However, sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. There are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. And so a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.”

As I have already indicated, the offender’s mental condition mitigates his moral culpability for these crimes. However, until properly treated, the offender is a threat to the community.


	
	I have come to the view that the best way of helping both the offender and the community is to impose a lengthy period in which the offender will be eligible for parole, in the expectation that the plan of treatment proposed by Dr Furst can be carried out. However, that does not mean that the offender is entitled to some nominal sentence. Far from it. The crimes which he has committed are serious. Whilst he is not an appropriate subject for general deterrence, because there are few in the community who labour under the disadvantage under which this offender labours, specific deterrence is still applicable. He must realise that he must do whatever he can to turn his life around. Furthermore, retribution is something that the law demands be imposed.
	
	
	I bear in mind proportionality when I consider the crimes committed by Daniel Roach, proportionality to his offences, that is parity. I also have to bear in mind proportionality insofar as it concerns the length of the sentence to be passed. That is the principle referred to as totality. In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381 the court identified at least two matters that are considered under the totality principle. The first is that:
	


“The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of the sentence.”

The Court of Criminal Appeal quoted R v Clinch (1994) 72 A Crim R 301, where the Chief Justice of South Australia said, “a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year”, and that a simple arithmetical addition of two sets of sentences of seven and eight years, resulting in a 15 year sentence:

“may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence, by simply aggregating the two sets of sentences”.

The second matter referred to the by Court of Criminal Appeal in R v MAK, is that the totality principle is to avoid the Court imposing a, “crushing sentence”. In MAK, the Court said at [17]:

“...an extremely long total sentence may be ‘crushing’ upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform”.


	
	It is to be noted that Daniel Roach committed a number of offences which this offender did not commit. For example, Roach committed an armed robbery on a pharmacy and participated in a breaking, entering and stealing from a residence, in which the residence was ransacked. He also assaulted a police officer and assaulted another police officer and inflicted actual bodily harm on that police officer.
	
	
	As I said, I intend to impose an aggregate sentence. For the first offence, there is maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment and a standard non‑parole period of five years. I have already referred to the sentence indicated by Judge Haesler for Roach. I have come to the view that in the current offender’s case, I should start with a head sentence of three years which I discount by 10% for the late plea of guilty. That gives me a head sentence of two years and eight months. I indicate a non‑parole period of one year and six months.
	
	
	For each of the three armed robberies, Parliament has prescribed a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment. There is no standard non‑parole period. In respect of the armed robbery of Michael Sheppard, and the taking from him of $506.50, the property of Roseville Cinema, I commence with a head sentence of six years imprisonment. I discount that by 10 per cent to arrive at 64 months or five years and four months imprisonment. For the same offence committed upon Mr Barry Price, I would impose the same sentence, that is five years and four months, but I do indicate that were those the only two offences concerned I would accumulate those two offences by only six months. For the armed robbery of the Revesby Pacific Hotel, I start with a head sentence of six years, which I discount by 10 per cent because of offender’s late plea of guilty. That is another head sentence of five years and four months.
	
	
	For the offence of 31 December 2013, I have come to the view that I should start with a head sentence, again, of six years. I discount that by 15 per cent pursuant to s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the power to reduce penalties for facilitating the administration of justice. Here the offender clearly had little, if any, recollection of the offence. He clearly was advised that his only defence was a legal, technical defence. That was the issue tendered for my determination as the tribunal of fact. The matter proceeded on documentary evidence only. A large number of witnesses were spared giving evidence. The trial was conducted over a few days rather than over a few weeks. The offender did facilitate the administration of justice by tendering the real issue, by his counsel making appropriate submissions and taking no issue as to the reliability or credibility of the evidence obtained by the Crown. That reduces the head sentence to 61 months, which I round off at 60 months or five years. As the matter carries a standard non-parole period I indicate that the non-parole period I would impose would be three years.
	
	
	I have come to the view that the head aggregate sentence ought be a sentence of eight years and six months imprisonment. Applying the statutory nexus between the head sentence and the non-parole period the non-parole period should be some six years and four months. I have come to the view that because the existence of special circumstances, to which I have already adverted, the treatment proposed by Dr Furst, the need for the offender to be supported for as long as possible by Community Corrections once released on parole, the non-parole period should be four years and six months.
	
	
	The remaining issue is the date on which the sentence should commence. The offender was on parole when taken into custody on 31 December 2013. The parole authority revoked the offender’s parole. Theoretically his sentence expired on 9 December 2014. I could commence the sentence on 31 December 2013 and I could commence the sentence on 10 December 2014. The authorities make it clear that I have a discretion. In essence, the offender went into custody on 31 December 2013 because of the offence of attempted armed robbery of the Thai restaurant at Pennant Hills. However it is clear from the other material before me that the offender was at risk of having his parole revoked in any event. He had committed other offences, but they were driving offences.
	
	
	Clearly the commission of the offences for which the offender is being currently sentenced whilst on parole was an aggravating factor. I have borne that in mind. Equally, the offender ought to have served out the whole of the remainder of the sentence for the earlier offence of 9 December 2010. As I said, the authorities make it clear that I have discretion. I believe that some portion of the offender’s period of custody between 31 December 2013 and 9 December 2014 should be attributed to the earlier sentence but the majority of it I believe I ought take into account in the current sentencing exercise.
	
	
	I accordingly intend to commence the head sentence on 1 March 2014. If my mathematics be correct, the offender would be entitled to be eligible for parole on 31 August 2018, and the head sentence will expire on 31 August 2022.
	
	
	Are those mathematics correct, gentlemen?
	
	
	BOYD: That’s how I’ve worked it out, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Of each of the five offences which I have discussed in these reasons for sentence you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 1 March 2014 and expiring on 31 August 2018. I impose a further period of imprisonment of four years to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 31 August 2022. The total sentence is therefore eight years and six months comprising the non‑parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Any other orders sought, gentlemen?
	


BOYD: No, your Honour.

SCHAUDIN: No, your Honour. Sorry to ask this your Honour, I just wanted to clarify something with respect to the discount applied for the s 98 offence.

HIS HONOUR: It was fifteen per cent.

SCHAUDIN: Sorry, I heard twenty-five.

HIS HONOUR: No, fifteen.

SCHAUDIN: Yes, thanks, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Fifteen per cent off six years, twelve sixes are seventy-two, fifteen per cent off seventy-two gives you sixty-one and then I round that down to sixty.

SCHAUDIN: Thanks, your Honour.

BOYD: I heard what my friend heard. I think it might have been an infelicity. You might have said “twenty-five” but you’d articulated during the sentencing proceedings it was going to be fifteen.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, it was fifteen.

		16 May 2016",2015-09-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767884,R v Munro [2015] NSWDC 353,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing Neesha Munro for stabbing her own mother. It was a serious crime.
	
	
	What a judge does when they are sentencing an offender is to say something about the crime and then something about the offender themselves before announcing what the sentence is. The judge needs to make an assessment of how serious an example of the offence this particular one was but also take into account any factors that are personal to the offender which should be taken into account.
	
	
	The first thing I should say is that Ms Munro has pleaded guilty to the crime that she was charged with. The crime is called reckless wounding. It is an offence against s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It is so serious that Parliament has fixed a maximum of seven years imprisonment to the crime. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of three years to the same crime.
	
	
	As a result of Ms Munro’s plea of guilty I will formally convict her of the offence. In addition, in due course I will reduce her sentence by some 25% because she pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity.
	
	
	First, the crime. Neesha Munro’s mother lived in Coledale with Neesha Munro. She was at home on the night of Sunday 4 January this year, when Neesha Munro arrived at the door. She went to the door and yelled “Let me in, let me in.” The light came on, the front door opened and Neesha Munro went inside. She and her mother were yelling at each other for some minutes inside. Neesha Munro was heard saying “[c]an I get my bottle, give me my bottle, give me my bottle, give me bottle or I'll stab ya.”
	
	
	At some stage they moved to the front of the house. A witness saw Mrs Munro, Neesha Munro’s mother, “grab her chest above her breasts and walk towards the roadway where she collapsed.” Neesha Munro left the scene. An ambulance came and Mrs Munro was taken to hospital. There they found “a stab wound to her chest.” What the doctors found was that Mrs Munro “had sustained a stab wound which penetrated her left upper chest, extending through the chest wall into the pleural cavity. She had sustained a collapsed lung as a result.” When the police came to the scene they found a pair of scissors in front of the house with blood on them.
	
	
	Neesha Munro turned up at the police station the next day and was arrested and charged. She has been in custody since 11 May this year and her sentence will commence on that date.
	
	
	At this stage, I should make some findings about how serious an example of a reckless wounding this particular crime was. There is a small difference in the submissions made by Neesha Munro’s counsel, Mr P Coady, and the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ms G Wasilewicz. Mr Coady realistically acknowledges that the criminality of the crime “should be assessed at toward the midrange of objective seriousness.” On the other hand, Ms Wasilewicz argues that the objective seriousness of the crime is above the midrange. She says slightly above the midrange, but above the midrange, because of the place where the wound was and the amount of force needed to inflict it. It was, Ms Wasilewicz argues, a very serious part of the body.
	
	
	Given that it is a wounding and not a grievous bodily harm and given that a wounding can occur to many other parts of the body, I agree with Ms Wasilewicz that this particular wound was in a very serious part of the body. Judges are used to dealing with tragic cases where someone has lunged at another person with a knife or scissors and slightly penetrated their chest, but the wound has punctured the heart and the person has died. Not only that, in this case although missing the heart, the wound caused - as I said - a penetration through the chest wall and into the pleural cavity.
	
	
	There was also some debate about the fact that the offence took place at the home of the victim. It was also the home of Neesha Munro. Ms Wasilewicz argues that this was an aggravating factor. Again, I agree with her. Neesha Munro’s mother was at home in her house minding her own business when her daughter - the offender - knocked on the door, came in, argued with her and then stabbed her outside the house. The purpose of the aggravating feature is that a person is entitled to feel safe and unmolested in their own home, even though that home might be shared with the offender.
	
	
	As I said, it is also important to take into account factors which are personal to an offender. A judge always starts with the criminal record. That can be relevant for a number of reasons. In this case Neesha Munro, who turned 31 earlier this year, has a criminal record which commenced with relatively minor offences in the Children’s Court but then when she became an adult she found herself in the Local Court, again with common assault offences. But in 2014 she was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm - in fact twice - and those sentences were imposed on 15 January 2014, about a year before Ms Munro committed this offence.
	
	
	Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 includes, as aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the fact that “the offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences)”. I regard Neesha Munro’s record including assault occasioning actual bodily harm about a year before this offence as a relevant factor to take into account in accordance with s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	But there is more information about Ms Munro. A lot of it is contained in a detailed report from the experienced clinical psychologist, Anna Robilliard, which was prepared on 10 September 2015. When Mr Coady called his client to give evidence, she confirmed the history which she had given to the psychologist.
	
	
	I think Mr Coady’s submission in para 15 of MFI 1 - his written submissions - is correct, that his client -
	


“…is an indigenous woman, who comes from an unstable background that included frequent violence as well as alcohol and drug abuse. Her offending conduct must be seen in the context of her observing violent abusive and addictive models of behaviour in her formative years. She has developed addictions to escape the outcomes of this upbringing...”.

He refers to the report of Dr Robilliard to sustain the last sentence. I agree with that submission.


	
	Ms Munro has seven children, none of whom she cares for personally. Her youngest boy Jarmarley, is looked after by her father. Ms Robilliard acknowledged that Ms Munro “will be vulnerable to relapsing with the associated consequence of increased likelihood of re-offending.” In addition to Jarmarley, Ms Munro has six other children. Her education is limited and she has also participated in substance abuse, including the drug commonly known as ice.
	
	
	When Ms Munro was called to give evidence, she not only expressed remorse and apologised to her mother, but explained some of the efforts that she had been making towards her own rehabilitation. In custody she has been undergoing a rehabilitation program. In the past before committing this crime she has attempted to undergo rehabilitation. Once she went to Dooralong in Wyong but was ordered to leave because of an anger issue. Another time she went to William Booth House in Sydney. She was going well there but discharged herself when her brother left gaol and she needed to look after him and get him back home. She was not accepted back into the program. In addition, she has made her own enquiries about programs that might be available on her release and she has mentioned the Bridge program here in Tamworth and an Aboriginal medical service program in Inverell as well as a program in Moree.
	
	
	Ms Munro hopes to live with her father when she is released. He will be moving to Inverell. She acknowledged that alcohol as well as drug abuse featured in the crime which she committed against her mother and that alcohol has been a problem all her life and often leads to violence. The program she is doing in custody has been helping. She acknowledges her drug use and acknowledges that it will be a battle to overcome it. Her strong driving motivation is to secure the custody of her children who have been removed from her.
	
	
	Mr Coady also called Terrence Munro, Ms Munro’s father. Having had an alcohol problem in the past it is clear that he has now given up alcohol and leads a stable life to such an extent that he has custody of Jarmarley. Mr Munro confirmed that he hopes to move to Inverell once he secures some accommodation there and that he is prepared to take his daughter back and he confirmed that she was very sorry for what she had done. He has visited his daughter in custody, taking along Jarmarley to maintain the contact.
	
	
	I have had the benefit of very helpful submissions from both Mr Coady and Ms Wasilewicz about the factors relevant to sentencing Ms Munro. Mr Coady realistically acknowledged that the prospects of his client’s rehabilitation were no more than fair. I think that that was a correct acknowledgement. He did however point to the strength of her motivation and the fact she had made her own enquiries and was undergoing a program whilst she was in custody. He described her as honest and realistic and I think that is probably a fair description. He referred to Ms Munro’s remorse and her early plea of guilty. Ms Wasilewicz acknowledged both of those.
	
	
	Mr Coady referred to the decision of Wood J, as his Honour then was, in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 and the factors relevant to sentencing an Aboriginal offender, which his Honour set out there and to the confirmation of that approach by the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v The Queen (2013) 249 CLR 571. One of the factors in Fernando which Mr Coady reminded me of was -
	


“While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects.”

A sentence can be particularly harsh on an Aboriginal person removing them from their home.


	
	Ms Wasilewicz acknowledged the relevance of those factors referred to in Fernando. Ms Wasilewicz emphasised that the offence had a domestic violence aspect about it. That is the case. It means that I need to give more weight to general deterrence. Relevant to specific deterrence, as Mr Coady pointed out on the other hand, is his client’s remorse and the steps taken towards her own rehabilitation.
	
	
	I have taken into account all of those submissions and have also had regard to some statistics made available by the New South Wales Judicial Commission.
	
	
	I should add one observation about some cases which Mr Coady referred me to. He made it clear that the cases referred to in para 17 of his written submissions were not indicating a range but illustrated examples of this kind of offence. Bearing that qualification in mind, I do note that in both Zreika [2012] NSWCCA 44 and Hyunwook [2010] NSWCCA 148, observations were made by one or more judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal about the relative leniency of the sentences imposed.
	
	
	I also bear in mind the maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of three years. Bearing in mind the objective seriousness of the offence and everything that I have referred to, I would regard an appropriate sentence in this case as being one of four and a half years imprisonment. However, Ms Munro has pleaded guilty at what is agreed to be the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore reduce that sentence by 25% and round it off to three years and four months imprisonment.
	
	
	Normally for a sentence of three years and four months imprisonment the non-parole period would be three-quarters of that time, or two years and six months imprisonment. Mr Coady argues that there are special circumstances in this case for reducing the non-parole period and increasing the parole period. She will need, he argues, an extended period of supervision in order to deal with her drug and alcohol issues. I think that submission is correct. She has already made enquiries about services that will be available to her when she is released and she has been undergoing some treatment or undergoing a program whilst in custody.    I propose to reduce the non-parole period from two years and six months to two years imprisonment.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am going to sentence you now Neesha Munro.


	
	I sentence you to three years and four months imprisonment. That will commence on 11 May 2015 and will expire on 10 September 2018. I specify a non-parole period of two years. That commenced on 11 May 2015 and will expire on 10 May 2017. The balance of one year and four months on parole will be from 11 May 17 to 10 September 18.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I am just going to ask Mr Coady and the Prosecutor to check the figures. Three years, four months, 11 May 15 to 10 September 18. Non-parole period two years, 11 May 15 to 10 May 17. Balance one year and four months from 11 May 17 to 10 September 18.

WASILEWICZ: Yes your Honour.

COADY: Yes I've got no problem.

HIS HONOUR: Correct. Ms Munro, the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release is less than two years from now. It will be on 10 May 2017. Whether you are released to parole or not depends upon the Parole Authority, but you are eligible from 10 May 2017 and your overall sentence will finish on 10 September 2018. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Good luck.

2767885,Nolan v Sims Group Australia Holdings Limited; Nolan v Delta Pty Limited [2015] NSWSC 1424,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	By a summons filed on 31 October 2014 naming Delta Pty Limited (“Delta”) as the defendant, Nicholas Nolan (“the prosecutor”) has brought proceedings alleging that on 1 November 2012 Delta was the loader of goods in a heavy vehicle that was driven on a road in breach of a dimension requirement, contrary to s. 55 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (“the RTG Act”). Delta has previously pleaded guilty to that offence.
	
	
	By an amended summons filed on 25 November 2015 naming Sims Group Australia Holdings Limited (“Sims”) as the defendant, the prosecutor has brought proceedings alleging that on 1 November 2012 Sims was the consignor of goods in a heavy vehicle that was driven on a road in breach of a dimension requirement, contrary to s. 53 of the RTG Act. Sims has previously pleaded guilty to that offence.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each offence is 250 penalty units, or $27,500.00.
	


THE FACTS


	
	With the consent of all parties, the two proceedings were heard together. An agreed statement of facts was tendered in each case. The majority of the facts are common to both defendants and may be summarised as follows.
	


The circumstances leading to the incident


	
	Sims is engaged in the business of metal recycling, resource recovery and industrial services throughout Australia. As part of its business, it purchases scrap steel from recyclers and engages operators of heavy vehicles to collect, transport and deliver it. One of the operators with whom Sims had a haulage agreement was Kreidies Management Group Pty Limited (“Kreidies”).
	
	
	Delta is in engaged in the business of excavation, landscaping, asbestos removal and recycling/waste management. Part of its business involves the sale of recyclable scrap steel materials.
	
	
	On 31 October 2012 Sims engaged Kreidies to collect a consignment of scrap steel from Delta’s premises at Alexandria and transport it its own premises at St Marys. The job was allocated to Mr Omar Kreidie (“Kreidie”) who was a driver employed by Kreidies. In order to carry out the job, Kreidies used a heavy vehicle combination comprising a prime mover and two trailers (“the combination”).
	
	
	On 1 November 2012, Kreidie drove the combination to Delta’s premises where it was loaded with the consignment by Mostafa Al Dhaybi (“Al Dhaybi”), an employee of a company to which Delta sub-contracted. Kreidie visually inspected the load, but he did not measure its height prior to departing Delta’s premises. The load was neither secured nor covered.
	


The collision


	
	The combination departed Delta’s premises at approximately 9:30am. At approximately 9:50am it was travelling in a westerly direction on the M5 east motorway towards the M5 east tunnel. For the purposes of indicating height restrictions in the tunnel, there were over-height warning lights and signs located along the M5 motorway and along feeder roads leading to the westbound entry to the M5 east tunnel. Those lights and signs were operational on the morning of 1 November 2012 and were activated by the combination at approximately 9.49 am. Kreidie denied seeing any such warning on his approach to the tunnel entrance.
	
	
	Over height sensors inside the tunnel are set at a height of 4.65m. Upon entering the tunnel, the load on the combination struck a steel beam which was set at a height of between 4.68 and 4.7 metres and positioned approximately 10 metres inside the entrance. The beam was dislodged as a consequence of being struck.
	
	
	Inspectors from the Roads and Maritime Services NSW (“RMS”) attended the scene. They observed that the load on the combination was compressed against the ceiling of the tunnel, resulting in the combination being stuck. The combination and its load were measured and found to be 4.97 metres high. In order to remove the combination from the tunnel, it was necessary to reduce the height of the load. This was done by cutting the scrap steel with oxy acetylene equipment.
	


The damage to infrastructure


	
	Significant damage was occasioned to the tunnel infrastructure. This included damage to:
	



	
	fire deluge piping;
	
	
	linear heat detection cabling;
	
	
	radio re-broadcast antennae cabling;
	
	
	the public address speaker system;
	
	
	tunnel message signs;
	
	
	usage signs;
	
	
	fibre optic cables to the CCTV cameras;
	
	
	fluorescent lights;
	
	
	wall panels; and
	
	
	the roof cavity.
	



	
	In addition, it was necessary to isolate and/or shut off a number of services for a period of time, including:
	



	
	power;
	
	
	water;
	
	
	fire systems;
	
	
	lighting; and
	
	
	ventilation.
	



	
	The tunnel and the streets surrounding the entrance were completely closed to traffic following the incident. NSW Police, Fire and Rescue NSW, electrical services and RMS crews were all enlisted to assist with traffic management. The combination could not be removed from the tunnel until approximately 10:35pm on 1 November 2012. In order to re-open the tunnel to traffic, it was necessary to remove a number of items, including damaged lights, cable trays, cable supports, the roof cavity, deluge pipes and the over height beam. That work took almost 12 hours to complete. The tunnel was re-opened to traffic at approximately 2:05am on 2 November 2012, more than 16 hours after the incident occurred.
	
	
	The damage to the M5 tunnel was caused by the load on the combination striking an over height steel beam in the manner previously described. The fact that the combination was over height was caused by a failure to properly compact and restrain the scrap metal before the combination departed Delta’s premises.
	


Specific facts alleged against Sims


	
	Sims was the consignor of the load, which was subject to a height limit of 4.3 metres. At the time of the offending, Sims had a two-tier induction program in place which was designed to ensure that workers and contractors were fully briefed in respect of all relevant issues prior to commencing any work. The program included induction as to site safety rules, operations and loading procedures, and required drivers to:
	



	
	visually inspect their truck and load prior to departing any site, so as to ensure that it was safe to travel on public roads;
	
	
	secure the load; and
	
	
	confirm that the weight of a truck did not exceed any applicable limit.
	



	
	The induction required any driver to contact a Sims representative if assistance was required in ensuring that no vehicle left Sims’ site which did not comply with these various requirements.
	
	
	Sims also had in place an online occupational health and safety induction program which involved six modules relating to general safety matters. Workers and contractors were required to complete competency questionnaires so as to ensure that they understood the induction material. Kreidie completed the Sims induction program on 19 April 2012, more than six months prior to the incident.
	
	
	The induction training outlined above, along with the requirement to visually inspect individual loads to ensure that they were secured, constituted the steps taken by Sims directed to ensuring that heavy vehicles delivering loads to its site did not breach any legislative obligations. In addition, any breach(es) of any obligation(s) could also be detected on an incoming weighbridge after transportation had occurred, and reported to the yard manager.
	
	
	At the time of the incident, a carriers agreement existed as between Sims and Kreidies pursuant to which (inter alia):
	



	
	Sims notified Kreidies of the haulage services it was required to undertake (“the haulage notice”);
	
	
	Kreidies was required to provide the services requested upon receipt of the haulage notice;
	
	
	Kreidies was required to ensure that any load collected from a scrap steep site was delivered and unloaded at Sims’ yard on the same day, failing which Kreidies was responsible for the load and was required to indemnify Sims against any cost incurred;
	
	
	Kreidies was under an obligation to obtain, and comply with, all relevant permits, licenses and approvals, as well as the requirements of any relevant authority;
	
	
	Kreidies was responsible for ensuring that:
	
	
	its employees and contractors successfully completed Sims’ induction programs;
	
	
	its employees complied with Sims’ OH&S policies and procedures, along with site rules and regulations;
	
	
	its employees complied with the directions and requirements of scrap metal operators; and
	
	
	all of its drivers were properly licensed, trained and able to carry out haulage services in a competent and professional manner.
	



	
	Although Sims’ representatives initially declined to participate in any interview with RMS investigators, on 21 November 2012, and again on 17 March 2014, Sims complied with statutory requests made on behalf of the RMS to provide documents and information.
	
	
	With respect to the nature of Sims’ breach, it was agreed that Sims:
	



	
	failed to have any, or any proper, procedures in place relating to the loading of heavy vehicles at other sites;
	
	
	failed to provide appropriate instructions, either to Delta or Kreidies, to adequately compact and/or restrain the load before the combination carrying it departed Delta’s premises; and
	
	
	did not include, in its haulage contracts with other parties, conditions providing that where default occurred, the haulier would not be remunerated.
	


Specific allegations against Delta


	
	Delta was the loader of the consignment. Its standard work practices in relation to loading required that:
	



	
	the scrap be loaded by its excavator operator;
	
	
	the scrap be compressed using the excavator bucket, so that the load was contained within the upper lip of the trailer (sometimes referred to as “the water line”); and
	
	
	the driver of the combination physically check and cover the load before departing.
	



	
	On this occasion, the scrap was loaded into the combination by Delta’s excavator driver, Al Dhaybi. He, in turn, relied upon Kreidie (as the driver of the combination) to inspect the load and direct him as to the quantity of scrap which could be loaded. In this regard:
	



	
	Al Dhaybi was aware of the applicable height limit of 4.3 metres;
	
	
	Al Dhaybi had been told that the height of the combination was approximately 4 metres (whereas the height of the combination was in fact 4.123 metres);
	
	
	Al Dhaybi was unable to see the top of the load in the combination from the excavator;
	
	
	Kreidie “spotted” the load (i.e., checked it visually for height compliance) by climbing on the side of the combination and watching Al Dhaybi load the scrap;
	
	
	when the trailers were loaded, Al Dhaybi, with Kreidie “spotting” for him, compressed the loads;
	
	
	the loads were neither secured vertically (e.g. with chains) nor covered (e.g. with a tarpaulin) before the combination left Delta’s yard.
	



	
	On 2 November 2012, RMS inspectors attended Delta’s yard at Alexandria. They were informed that there was no compliance gauge which could be applied to heavy vehicles before they were permitted to depart from the site.
	


THE DEFENDANTS’ EVIDENCE

Affidavit evidence relied upon by Sims


	
	Senior counsel for Sims read, without objection, an affidavit of Rod Bonnette of 7 September 2015. Mr Bonnette is employed by Sims as its General Manager for Operations in NSW. He commenced in that role in July 2013 although he has held managerial positions with Sims since 2006.
	
	
	Mr Bonnette expressed his extreme regret that the incident occurred and expressly accepted that Sims bore some degree of responsibility for it. He acknowledged the serious consequences of the incident, including the damage to, and temporary closure of, the M5 tunnel. He stated that as soon as he became aware of the matter, he took steps to ensure that Sims fully cooperated with the RMS and that it entered a plea of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity.
	
	
	Mr Bonnette accepted that Sims’ responsibility for the incident arose from the fact that it (inter alia):
	



	
	failed to have specific procedures in place relating to the loading of heavy vehicles at the sites of third parties such as Delta;
	
	
	provided little more than generic induction training to transport contractors;
	
	
	failed to (inter alia) ensure that loads did not sit outside the applicable limits;
	
	
	failed to provide appropriate instructions to Delta that the consignment was required to be adequately compacted and/or restrained before the combination departed Delta’s premises; and
	
	
	did not include load compliance assurance conditions in its haulage contracts with parties such as Kreidies, including a condition that where default occurred a carrier would not be remunerated.
	



	
	Mr Bonnette detailed, at some length, the various remedial steps which had been taken by Sims since the incident. He had (inter alia) organised a detailed review of relevant policies and procedures, as well as a review of the chain of responsibility arrangements in place between Sims and its transport contractors and suppliers. He explained that a risk assessment had been undertaken which resulted in the updating of relevant policies and training requirements. That risk assessment, a copy of which was annexed to Mr Bonnette’s affidavit, identified various hazards associated with the loading of vehicles. As a consequence of the assessment, updated policies have been introduced, implementing appropriate preventative/remedial action in respect of the identified hazards.
	
	
	In addition to undertaking a risk assessment, Sims also undertook a review of its arrangements with transport contractors so as to ensure:
	



	
	the implementation of appropriate work systems and practices during the completion of transportation and related tasks; and
	
	
	compliance, by Sims’ contractors, with relevant statutory provisions and regulations.
	



	
	Mr Bonnette expressed his intention to conduct periodic audits and reviews of those contractors who are regular suppliers of transport services to Sims. Any adverse audit results which might require Sims to implement any remedial action will lead to the contractor(s) in question being audited more frequently.
	
	
	Mr Bonnette has also devised a response plan to deal with emergencies arising from the carriage of hazardous waste and dangerous goods. Further, as part of Sims’ ongoing training program, “tool box talks” have been delivered to drivers addressing the need to:
	



	
	ensure that loads are not above the prescribed height;
	
	
	ensure that loads are secured; and
	
	
	remove excess scrap metal from above the bin rim.
	



	
	Between 25 and 35 such talks are now delivered each year. A training presentation has also been prepared at Mr Bonnette’s direction which he expects will be completed in the near future. Once implemented, Sims will provide ongoing training not only to its own employees, but also to those employed by its transport contractors.
	
	
	Finally, and at Mr Bonnette’s direction, all of Sims’ transport contractors have been advised that Sims will not pay any contractor for any work carried out which does not comply with relevant legislative requirements. The correspondence sent to Sims’ contractors in this regard, which was annexed to Mr Bonnette’s affidavit, invites any contractor to contact Sims in the event that they are required to undertake a task which will, or may, breach relevant transport regulations in relation to load dimension. In this way, Sims seeks to ensure that it is put on notice of any difficulties, thus allowing for remedial action to be taken in advance in an effort to eliminate the possibility of any breach.
	


Affidavit evidence relied upon by Delta


	
	Counsel for Delta read, without objection, two affidavits, namely:
	



	
	an affidavit of Con Petropoulos of 7 September 2015; and
	
	
	an affidavit Neville Williams of 8 September 2015.
	



	
	Mr Petropoulos is the sole director of Delta. He acknowledged that Delta had been responsible for “the breakdown of the chain of responsibility that led to the damage to the tunnel”. He also acknowledged that although Delta’s trucks were routinely measured for height compliance before leaving its yard, the trucks of third parties were not.
	
	
	Mr Petropoulos stated that the procedures which allowed the combination to leave Delta’s premises as it did have now been changed in an effort to ensure that this incident is not repeated. Mr Petropoulos described himself as being “horrified” by what occurred, and expressly acknowledged its serious consequences, including the damage to the tunnel, and the consequent closure of an important arterial road for an extended period.
	
	
	Mr Williams commenced employment with Delta on 3 February 2014 as the National Safety Quality and Environment Manager. Prior to his appointment there was no individual within Delta whose role was to ensure that it complied with the responsibilities imposed upon it in respect of its transport operations. Although, prior to Mr Williams commencing employment, there were “overlapping” systems in place directed towards ensuring such compliance, Mr Williams candidly acknowledged that those systems lacked cohesion, and that in order to be effective they required overall co-ordination and supervision by a single person or division. This, I infer, was what caused Mr Williams to develop what might be described as a “stand-alone” compliance division, whose role is to oversee the entirety of Delta’s transport operations, and whose responsibilities include an evaluation of all compliance issues.
	
	
	In addition to the creation of the compliance division, Mr Williams has overseen the implementation of a number of other changes since assuming his role. These have included:
	



	
	holding an annual conference for the purposes of discussing (inter alia) safety issues;
	
	
	implementing a registration system which records and identifies the ongoing need for staff training;
	
	
	introducing an internal transport audit directed to issues such as maintenance management and fatigue management;
	
	
	developing a memorandum of understanding for all transport contractors which addresses (inter alia) roles and responsibilities;
	
	
	introducing agreements with contractors which acknowledge that such contractors are required to do all things necessary to assist Delta in discharging its legal obligations; and
	
	
	establishing an advisory group to provide strategic advice to Delta’s management in relation to the operations of its transport division.
	



	
	Mr Williams also set out the specific action which had been taken immediately following the incident. He said that an Incident Report Form was completed, and that the recommended remedial action included steps being taken to ensure that drivers and sub-contractors were aware of their vehicle clearance height before leaving the yard. He confirmed that Al Dhaybi was required to undergo re-induction in relation to issues of work place safety following the incident.
	


THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS


	
	Section 53 of the RTG Act is in the following terms:
	


53 Liability of consignor

(cf model provisions, s 91)

(a) a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and

(b) the person is the consignor of any goods that are in or on the vehicle or combination concerned.

Maximum penalty: see Table to Division.

(2) A person is guilty an offence if:

(a) the weight of a freight container containing goods consigned for road transport exceeds the maximum gross weight as marked on the container or on the container’s safety approval plate, and

(b) the person is the consignor of any of the goods contained in the freight container.

Maximum penalty:

(a) first offence—50 penalty units (in the case of an individual) or 250 penalty units (in the case of a corporation), or

(b) subsequent offence—100 penalty units (in the case of an    individual) or 500 penalty units (in the case of a corporation).

(3) A person prosecuted for an offence under this section has the benefit of the reasonable steps defence for an offence under this section.


	
	Section 55 of the RTG Act is in the following terms:
	


55   Liability of loader

(cf model provisions, s 93)

(1)  A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a)  a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs, and

(2)  A person prosecuted for an offence under this section has the benefit of the reasonable steps defence for an offence under this section.


	
	Section 210 of the RTG Act gives the Court power to make an order for compensation for a person who is found guilty of an offence. Section 214 gives the Court a similar power to award costs.
	
	
	On 9 February 2014 the RTG Act was replaced by the Road Transport (Vehicle and Driver Management) Act 2005 (“the RTV Act”). Section 37(3) of the RTV Act is in the following terms:
	


37 Lower limits—height breaches (cf model provisions, s 74)

…

(3) Severe risk breach

The lower limit for a severe risk breach of a dimension requirement to which this section applies is 300 millimetres over the maximum permissible dimension limit.


	
	Section 60 of the RTV Act sets out matters to be taken into account on the assessment of penalty:
	


60 Matters to be taken into consideration by courts (cf model provisions, s 97)

(1) The purpose of this section is to bring to the attention of courts the general

implications and consequences of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements when determining the kinds and levels of sanctions to be imposed.

(2) In determining the sanctions (including the level of fine) that are to be imposed in respect of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements, a court is to take into consideration the classification of the breach under this Part and, having regard to that classification, the following matters:

(a) …

(b) …

(c) severe risk breaches involve one or more of the following:

(i) an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or the environment,

(ii) a serious risk of accelerated road wear,

(iii) a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure,

(iv) a serious risk of increased traffic congestion,

(v) a serious risk of diminished public amenity,

(vi) a serious risk of unfair commercial advantage.

(3) Nothing in this section affects any other matters that may or must be taken into consideration by a court.

(4) Nothing in this section authorises or requires a court to assign the breach to a different category of breach.

(5) Nothing in this section requires evidence to be adduced in relation to the matters that are to be taken into consideration by a court pursuant to this section.


	
	Finally, it is common ground between the parties that the provisions of ss. 3, along with some of the provisions of s. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”), apply to the proceedings against each defendant.
	


SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES

Submissions of the prosecutor – general matters


	
	Counsel for the prosecutor drew attention to the fact that for the purposes of s. 37(3) of the RTV Act, the maximum permissible dimension limit was 4.3m. It followed that any instance in which the combination exceeded 4.6m was a severe risk breach. In the present case, the height of the combination was measured at 4.97m, some 670mm in excess of the permissible dimension limit. It was submitted that in these circumstance the matters in s. 60(2)(c)(ii)-(v) of the RTV Act were particularly relevant: Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Fletcher International Exports Pty Limited [2008] NSWSC 936; (2008) 51 MVR 41 at [40]; Roads and Maritime Services v L&M Scott Haulage Pty Limited [2013] NSWCCA 107; (2013) 63 MVR 367 at [25]-[27].
	
	
	Counsel for the prosecutor also drew attention to the consequences which actually flowed from the commission of the offence in each case, namely:
	



	
	the damage to the tunnel infrastructure;
	
	
	the requirement to disconnect services to the tunnel;
	
	
	the extent of necessary repairs; and
	
	
	the closure of the tunnel for a lengthy period.
	



	
	All of these matters, it was submitted, were relevant to the assessment of penalty: Endycott (Roads and Martime Services) v Griffiths Garage Pty Limited [2012] NSWSC 1131 at [11]-[15]. It was further submitted that such matters aggravated the offending in terms of s. 21A(2)(g) of the Sentencing Act: Kemp v Doble; Kemp v Doble Express Transport Pty Limited [2014] NSWSC 785; (2014) 67 MVR 167 at [30].
	
	
	Counsel cited a number of circumstances which, it was submitted, bore upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in respect of each defendant. These included:
	



	
	the fact that prior to entering the tunnel, the combination travelled on one or more major arterial roads, including the M5 east motorway, within the Sydney metropolitan area;
	
	
	the fact that such roads were regularly used by large volumes of traffic at any hour of the day;
	
	
	the substantial damage occasioned to the M5 east tunnel as a consequence of the incident;
	
	
	the necessity to close the tunnel for approximately 14 hours; and
	
	
	the substantial disruption to traffic which occurred as a result.
	



	
	Counsel for the prosecutor also submitted that general deterrence was an important consideration on sentence: Kemp v Liquide Australia Pty Limited (supra) at [10]; [13]. However he did not suggest that specific deterrence was any real significance in the present case.
	
	
	Counsel acknowledged that each defendant had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity which was a relevant factor in light of ss. 21A(3)(k) and 22 of the Sentencing Act. He further acknowledged that in accordance with the principles set out in R v Thomson. R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 each defendant was entitled to a discount to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea. I did not understand counsel for the prosecutor to cavil with the proposition that a discount of 25% was appropriate in each case.
	
	
	Counsel for the prosecutor acknowledged the co-operation of each defendant. He also acknowledged the evidence of contrition and remorse in each case which, he accepted, was a mitigating factor pursuant to s. 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act. He also accepted, as I understood it, that the steps taken by each defendant since the incident supported a conclusion that neither defendant was likely to re-offend. Finally, he conceded that neither defendant had previously come under notice for an offence of this kind.
	


Submissions of the prosecutor - Sims


	
	Counsel for the prosecutor submitted that Sims was to be sentenced on the basis that it was the consignor of the load: Kemp v Air Liquide Australia Pty Limited [2014] NSWSC 1200. He submitted that there was no issue that Sims had failed to:
	



	
	put proper procedures in place relating to the loading of heavy vehicles at other sites, directed towards ensuring that load dimensions could not be exceeded;
	
	
	provide appropriate instructions, either to Delta or Kreidies, as to the necessity to compact and/or restrain the consignment before the combination departed from Delta’s premises;
	
	
	include compliance assurance conditions in its haulage contract with Kreidies.
	



	
	It was submitted that all of these preventative steps could have been taken by Sims without difficulty, and well in advance of the departure of the combination from Delta’s premises.
	
	
	It was submitted by counsel for the prosecutor that as the consignor, Sims has a responsibility to identify risks and actively introduce systems to manage them: Kemp v Air Liquide Australia Pty Limited (supra) at [72] per Garling J. Although counsel accepted that Sims had some preventative measures in place prior to the incident, he submitted that it could (and should) have:
	



	
	exercised appropriate control over others involved in activities leading to the breach;
	
	
	included compliance assurance conditions in relevant commercial arrangements with contractors;
	
	
	provided information, instruction, training and supervision to employees to enable compliance with relevant laws;
	
	
	maintained work systems to enable compliance with a relevant law.
	


Submissions of the Prosecutor - Delta


	
	Counsel for the prosecutor submitted that Delta was to be sentenced on the basis that it was the loader of the consignment.
	
	
	Counsel pointed out that Delta’s standard work practice was for an operator to load the trailer, and then compress the load with the use of the excavator bucket, so that the load was contained within the upper lip of the trailer, following which the driver would physically check the load. He emphasised that no steps were taken to measure the load, or to restrain it.
	
	
	It was submitted that Delta’s failure to ensure that the load was properly checked constituted a serious breach of its obligations. Whilst counsel acknowledged that Delta did have some relevant measures in place prior to the incident, he submitted, in particular, that its failure to use some type of measuring device to the combination before it left the site was a matter which significantly contributed to its culpability: Endycott (supra) at [20]. It was submitted that Delta had an obligation to identify risks and actively introduce systems to manage them.
	


Submissions on behalf of Sims


	
	Senior counsel for Sims submitted that its offending was towards the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness because:
	



	
	it had no actual knowledge that there had been a failure to properly compact and restrain the load before the combination departed Delta’s premises;
	
	
	the offence was not planned or pre-meditated;
	
	
	the offence was not committed for financial gain; and
	
	
	it did have some safety procedures in place at the time of the offence.
	



	
	It was submitted, in particular, that in light of the fact that Sims had not previously come under notice for any similar offending, and as it regularly engaged operators of heavy vehicles to collect, transport and deliver scrap metal, I could be satisfied that the systems that were in place prior to the incident were reasonably effective in addressing and managing risks, and ensuring compliance with legislative requirements.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Sims also pointed specifically to:
	



	
	the expressions of remorse contained in the affidavit of Mr Bonnette;
	
	
	the fact that a plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity; and
	
	
	Sims’ co-operation with the authorities.
	



	
	It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, I would conclude that Sims was unlikely to re-offend. It was further submitted that Sims’ had good prospects of rehabilitation in light of the matters set out in Mr Bonnette’s affidavit which, it was submitted, reflected the implementation of significant measures directed towards avoiding the commission of any further offence.
	


Submissions on behalf of Delta


	
	Counsel for Delta pointed to a number of mitigating factors including:
	



	
	its plea of guilty;
	
	
	its prior unblemished record;
	
	
	its co-operation with the RMS;
	
	
	its remorse, expressed through the affidavit of Mr Petropoulos;
	
	
	its acknowledgment, through Mr Petropoulos, of the damage which had been occasioned as a consequence of the incident;
	
	
	its agreement to pay a significant amount of compensation.
	



	
	It was submitted that Delta’s offending was “moderate” because it had an expectation that the driver would in fact check the load height before departing. Whilst counsel candidly acknowledged that checking by Delta’s own staff would have ensured height compliance, he submitted that there was, in place, an “inherent measuring device” by reference to the water line of the vehicle. He also emphasised that prior to the incident Delta had in place what he described as “significant induction and on-going training”.
	
	
	It was submitted that the process of identifying risks, and introducing systems to manage them, was an evolving process, and that Mr Williams’ affidavit demonstrated that a system of risk assessment had been implemented prior to this incident. Counsel submitted that the absence of any prior breaches on the part of Delta indicated that it took its obligations seriously, and that the measures it had put in place prior to the incident had gone a considerable way to addressing the relevant risks.
	
	
	Counsel for Delta acknowledged the importance of general deterrence. As to specific deterrence, he pointed out that Delta was a company involved in a “significant number of journeys” within the State as the recipient of major work projects. It was submitted that the absence of any prior convictions demonstrated the fact that the procedures which had been put in place by Delta prior to the incident had worked effectively for many years. It was further submitted that the efforts which had been made by Delta to address issues of safety since the accident, as set out in the affidavit of Mr Williams, supported the conclusion that specific deterrence was irrelevant in the present case.
	
	
	Counsel further submitted that in employing Mr Williams, Delta had undertaken a significant and costly compliance burden, and had previously engaged its lawyers to undertake an examination of the adequacy of its systems. It was submitted that these factors supported a conclusion that Delta took its obligations seriously and that it was unlikely to re-offend.
	


CONSIDERATION

General considerations as to penalty


	
	A number of considerations are common to the determination of penalty as against each defendant.
	
	
	Firstly, it is relevant to bear in mind the underlying purpose of the legislation under which the defendants have been charged. In Department of Transport Energy and Infrastructure v Neil [2009] SASC 285; (2009) 53 MVR 467 Sulan J, in reference to similar legislation operating in South Australia, made the following observation (at [22]):
	


“The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the safety of road users. A part of that is the requirement that roads and infrastructure be maintained. The scheme of penalties is such that more serious breaches will attract greater penalties. Parliament intended that penalties not only have a punitive effect on those who offend, but also act as a personal and general deterrent to drivers and owners who cart loads which are overweight”.


	
	Secondly, as noted at [45] above, I am obliged to have regard the matters set out in s. 60 of the RTV Act. In the context of the present case, I have had regard to the fact that the respective breaches by the defendants involved serious risk of:
	



	
	accelerated road wear;
	
	
	harm to road infrastructure;
	
	
	increased traffic congestion; and
	
	
	a diminished public amenity.
	



	
	However, it is also important to bear in mind that although the provisions of s. 60 reflect a policy objective that Courts be made aware of, and take into account, general implications and consequences of breaches when imposing penalties for offences, the factors set out in that section are not to be regarded as factors which aggravate the offending in the case of either defendant: L&M Scott Haulage (supra) at [25]-[27] per Latham J, (Button J and Grove AJ agreeing).
	
	
	Thirdly, nothing in s. 60 affects any other matter which is relevant to penalty, such as the provisions of ss. 3A and 21A of the Sentencing Act: Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Fletcher International Exports Pty Limited (supra) at [40].
	


Objective factors common to each defendant


	
	There are several objective factors which are relevant to the assessment of penalty against each defendant, and which I take into account.
	
	
	Firstly, the breach in each case was a severe risk breach. The height of the load was substantially in excess of the applicable limit. Prior to reaching the tunnel, the combination had travelled, over some distance, along major arterial roads with a load which was substantially in excess of dimensional limits.
	
	
	Secondly, although there is no specific evidence of it, the inescapable inference is that there was increased traffic congestion as a consequence of the closure of the tunnel, although I have regard to the fact that it was limited to what was, in relative terms, a short period.
	
	
	Thirdly, the damage to the tunnel was substantial. That is an aggravating factor pursuant to s. 21A(1)(g) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Finally, there is no issue that general deterrence is a relevant factor in assessing penalty. However, it is not suggested by the prosecutor that personal deterrence plays any part in that assessment in the case of either defendant.
	


Mitigating factors common to each defendant


	
	There are several mitigating factors upon which each defendant is entitled to rely, and which I take into account.
	
	
	Firstly, it is common ground that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity in each case. That is a mitigating factor in terms of ss. 21A(3)(k) and 22 of the Sentencing Act and entitles each defendant to a discount of 25%.
	
	
	Secondly, in circumstances where both defendants operate a substantial commercial enterprise, neither has previously come under notice for offending of this kind. That is a mitigating factor in terms of s. 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Thirdly, I am satisfied on the evidence that substantial measures have been put in place by each defendant which are specifically addressed to ensuring, as far as one can, that the offending is not repeated. I am satisfied in these circumstances that in each case, the defendant is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. These are mitigating factors in terms of ss. 21A(3)(g) and (h) respectively of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Fourthly, the offending was not, in the case of either defendant, part of a planned or organised criminal activity. That is a mitigating factor in terms of s. 21A(3)(n) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Fifthly, I am satisfied that each defendant has expressed its remorse in the manner contemplated by s. 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	Sixthly, whilst the plea of guilty in each case is a recognition of the fact that each defendant could reasonably have taken steps directed to ensuring that the load did not exceed the relevant dimensional requirements, neither defendant had, in the period leading up to the accident, totally abandoned its responsibilities by ignoring the need to implement safety procedures. On the contrary, and as I have pointed out, each defendant did have measures in place. Although such respective measures were obviously not sufficient to prevent this incident, the fact that they were put in place at all is a matter which each defendant is entitled to have taken into account. Given the fact that neither defendant had previously come under notice, it is clear that the measures taken by each of them prior to the accident were not insignificant.
	


Assessment of penalty - Sims


	
	As I have previously noted, Sims is to be sentenced as the consignor of the load.
	
	
	I am satisfied that in that position, Sims was one step removed from the act of loading the combination. In these circumstances, I accept the submission of senior counsel that Sims was not aware of the fact that the load exceeded the applicable dimensional requirements and did not, in any direct sense, have an opportunity of controlling it. These matters are clearly relevant to a determination of penalty: Kemp v Air Liquide (supra) at [64].
	
	
	That said, there were many steps that could have been implemented by Sims, directed towards ensuring that the load was compliant. The simplest of those steps (although not the only one which was available) was a direction or instruction to Delta as to the necessity to properly check the load prior to the combination leaving the site.
	
	
	I find that in all of the circumstances, the objective seriousness of Sims offending falls towards the lower end of the scale.
	
	
	Taking all relevant factors into account, a fine of $3,000.00 is appropriate.
	


Assessment of penalty - Delta


	
	Delta was responsible for the loading of the consignment.
	
	
	In that capacity, it had knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the loading of the combination. Even more importantly, it had the ability to exercise ultimate control over that loading. The measures in place for ensuing load compliance relied upon the driver climbing on the side of the trailer and undertaking a visual check of the load, by reference to the water line.
	
	
	Such a measure was, to say the least, unsophisticated. It fell substantially short of what was required. In these respects, the observations of Grove AJ in Endycott (supra at [20]) are apt:
	


“The final matter to which I refer in relation to culpability is the simple failure to provide the driver with an appropriate measuring device so that he could check at the site where he made the pick-up whether or not he was over height. He had neither a tape measure, measuring stick or anything else with which to make an accurate estimate. Evidence during the hearing shows that he relied simply upon an eyesight check and knowledge as to what the height of his prime mover cabin happened to be”.


	
	In my view, those observations serve to highlight the nature of Delta’s culpability in the present case. The provision of some measuring device was a simple step which could, and should have been taken by Delta to ensure compliance with the load.
	
	
	In these circumstances the culpability of Delta must necessarily be greater than that of Sims.
	
	
	Taking all relevant factors into account, a fine of $6,000.00 is appropriate.

	In proceedings 2014/321864:
	



	
	I convict the defendant Sims Group Australia Holdings Limited of an offence against s. 53 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005.

2767887,Clark v R [2015] NSWCCA 265,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant was convicted, in two separate trials, of a number of counts of sexual offences committed against juvenile complainants, child pornography offences and offences of acting with the intention to pervert the course of justice. His appeals against convictions were dismissed and he was subsequently unsuccessful in an application to reopen the first of those appeals pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C.

The applicant brought applications pursuant to r 50C to reopen the second of the appeals and the r 50C application relating to the first appeal. The applicant submitted that even if his contentions in respect of those decisions were not such as to attract the application of r 50C itself, it was open for the Court to proceed under r 50C(5), by which “any other power” of the Court to set aside or vary an order was preserved, including by creating a new precedent if necessary.

The applicant contended that he had been denied procedural fairness, and errors or miscarriages of justice had occurred, as a result of: the refusal of Garling J to recuse himself on the ground of apprehension of bias from sitting on the r 50C application relating to the first appeal; the failure of the Court to sit an enlarged bench to hear his appeals; and certain matters relating to the applicant’s access to his legal documents whilst in custody. The applicant also raised a number of complaints relating to his representation at trial.

In addition, the applicant challenged one of his convictions in respect of complainant SB, being a conviction of a sexual offence occurring in the aggravating circumstance that it occurred while SB was under the applicant’s authority. The applicant contended that that count could be proved to have been impossible having regard to the time in which SB was living with the applicant, and that it followed that his conviction was contrary to the authority of SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.

Per the Court

(1)   Rule 50C(5) does not provide a freestanding power of the Court to set aside an order. As the applicant did not point to “any other power” under which the Court might proceed it was not open for the Court to develop a new precedent to suit the particular situation. The case fell to be decided pursuant to the established principles governing r 50C itself. [11]-[12]

(2) Rule 50C provides a limited mechanism by which the Court may reconsider its orders if it proceeded according to a material misapprehension of fact or law which was not due to the applicant’s neglect or default where the Court failed to consider a ground of appeal. The rule is also available to correct a slip in a judgment or order. The rule must be understood against the background of principle of finality and its importance to the rule of law. [6]-[18]

Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152; Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218; Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431; Alramadan v DPP (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69; Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300; Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201; Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 236 A Crim R 427; Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 205

(3) There was no misapprehension of fact or law in the finding, in the r 50C application relating to the first appeal, that no question of apprehended bias was raised by the circumstance that Garling J had sat on one of the applicant’s previous matters. No other matter was raised with respect to the applicant’s bias claims such as would attract the operation of r 50C. [19]-[25]

Re J.R.L; Ex parte C.J.L [1986] HCA 39; 161 CLR 342

(4) The question of whether an enlarged bench should hear an appeal rests with the Chief Justice of New South Wales and is not amenable to review pursuant to r 50C. [26]

(5) The applicant’s contentions regarding his access to documents were fundamentally an attempt to reopen his appeal so as to remedy a perceived deficiency in material presented at the hearing. That approach is not permissible in r 50C applications. [27]-[34]

Alramadan v DPP (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69 

(6) The evidence on the question of when the complainant SB came to live with the applicant was disputed, and it was open to the jury to accept the Crown’s version of events rather than the applicant’s. None of the applicant’s claims in relation to this issue raised a misapprehension of fact or law such as to enliven r 50C. [35]-[46]

SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400

(7) The issue relating to adequacy of trial representation was extensively litigated in the applicant’s prior proceedings, in which the applicant had had the opportunity to cross-examine trial counsel. The applicant pointed to no specific misapprehension of fact or law on this basis, except that the Court did not accept that his convictions should be overturned. [47]-[50]

Alramadan v DPP (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: There are before the Court applications to reopen two judgments pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 50C, being PFC v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 241 (the first challenged judgment) and Clark v R [2014] NSWCCA 236 (the second challenged judgment).
	
	
	The applicant was convicted after a trial before Norrish DCJ and a jury of a total of 23 counts of sexual offences against a number of juvenile complainants, child pornography offences and offences of acting with the intention to pervert the course of justice. The applicant was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 8 months. An appeal against conviction was dismissed by a judgment of Giles JA, Hoeben and Hall JJ of 15 December 2011: PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275 (the Norrish DCJ appeal). An application to reopen that appeal pursuant to r 50C was dismissed by a judgment of Fullerton, R A Hulme and Garling JJ of 30 October 2014, being the first challenged judgment. The first application is therefore an application to reopen an application to reopen.
	
	
	The applicant was also convicted of a charge of perverting the course of justice, following a trial before Freeman DCJ and a jury. Freeman DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, to commence from the conclusion of the sentence already being served. An appeal against conviction was dismissed by a judgment of 30 October 2014 of Leeming JA, Price and McCallum JJ, being the second challenged judgment.
	
	
	The applications to reopen the first and second challenged judgments pursuant to r 50C were made on 11 November 2014 and 7 November 2014 respectively. Both applications being made within 14 days of entry of the orders sought to be varied, this Court’s power to entertain them was enlivened: r 50C(2).
	
	
	As the submissions relating to the two applications substantially overlap, it will be convenient to deal with them together.
	


Rule 50C


	
	Rule 50C provides as follows:
	


“50C   Power to set aside or vary order

(1)   The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order.

(2)   If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered.

(3)   Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered.

(4)   The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3).

(5)   Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to set aside or vary an order.”


	
	Rule 50C was introduced by the Criminal Appeal Rules (Amendment No 1) 2007, made on 30 August 2007 and gazetted on 7 September 2007. The background to the rule was explained by Hoeben CJ at CL in Bruce Edward Gall v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 152, at [17]:
	


“The genesis of the rule was the problem which arose in [Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218]. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Burrell had occasion to consider its power to re-visit a decision made on an erroneous view of the facts. The court held that in the circumstances of that case it did have such power, but the circumstances and authorities referred to made obvious the advantage of putting the matter beyond doubt by the creation of a Rule. In fact the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision as to the existence of such a power was overruled by the High Court in Burrell.”


	
	In Burrell, at [24], the High Court approved the description of the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal given by Dixon J in Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431 at 435, as follows:
	


“The jurisdiction is statutory, and the court has no further authority to set aside a conviction upon indictment than the statute confers. The Criminal Appeal Act of 1912 N.S.W. … does not give a general appellate power in criminal cases exercisable on grounds and by a procedure discoverable from independent sources.”


	
	The explanatory note to the Government Gazette in which r 50C was published read as follows:
	


“The object of these Rules is to amend the Criminal Appeal Rules so as to require orders under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to be entered, and to enable them to be set aside and varied, in ways similar to those for judgments and orders under the Civil Procedure Act 2005.”


	
	In Alramadan v DPP (NSW) (No 2) [2008] NSWCCA 69 at [3], the Court (Basten JA, Latham and Rothman JJ) declined, for the purposes of that case, to take the explanatory note into account. The Court held that the wide terms of the note had to be read in the context of the remark of Dixon J in Grierson at 436, that:
	


“The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from [the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)] are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.”


	
	In the hearing of this matter, the applicant’s central contention appeared to be that the Court ought to set aside or vary the challenged judgments on the basis of r 50C(5). In written submissions, he submitted that, even though his application did not fall under r 50C(2), “that did not absolve the [Court considering the first r 50C application] from creating or setting a NEW precedent or under Rule 50C par (5)”.
	
	
	This submission was misguided. Rule 50C(5) does not provide a free-standing power of the Court to set aside an order. Rather, its effect is that “any other power” of the Court to set aside or vary its orders remains following the enactment of r 50C. The applicant did not specify any other existing power upon which he relied and it goes without saying that the Court cannot create for itself a “new precedent” to suit the situation as the applicant sees it. It follows that this case falls to be determined pursuant to the decided principles relating to r 50C itself.
	
	
	The application and extent of r 50C was first considered in Alramadan (No 2). In that case, the Court held, at [4], that r 50C was to be understood according to the powers the Court had always had in relation to orders which have not been entered. The Court, at [6], went on to cite the statement of Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303 that, in order to enliven the jurisdiction to vacate orders made, it must appear:
	


“… that the Court has … proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to re-argue their cases.”

The Court held, at [7], that the same principle applied to applications made under r 50C.


	
	In Kauwenberghs v R [2009] NSWCCA 201, the Court (Beazley P, Hall and Fullerton JJ) held, at [10], that three questions needed to be answered affirmatively before the Court would be entitled to consider varying orders under r 50C. Those questions were:
	



	
	whether the Court proceeded (or apparently proceeded) according to some misapprehension of fact or law;
	
	
	whether that misapprehension was a material one; and
	
	
	whether the misapprehension was due to the applicant’s neglect or default.
	


These principles have since been applied in a number of cases: see the first challenged judgment at [31] and the cases cited therein.


	
	Underlying the narrow scope of r 50C is the central importance to the rule of law that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in limited circumstances. As was held by French CJ, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ in Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 236 A Crim R 427, at [16]:
	


“The principle of finality forms part of the common law background against which any statutory provision conferring power upon a court to re-open concluded proceedings is to be considered.”

See also Miller v R [2015] NSWCCA 205 at [25].


	
	In Miller, Adams J, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed, described the limited scope of r 50C as follows:
	


“40   After judgment has been entered, nothing of substance can be changed, though this still permits changes to orders or reasons where the language of either mistakenly does not reflect the order contemplated by the reasons or the sense of the reasons themselves. It must follow that no second appeal can be had on the merits, still less can a subsequent Court of Criminal Appeal hear such an appeal from an earlier decision of the Court. The mere contention that some error of law or misapprehension of fact has affected the decision is immaterial. If what is sought is, in effect, a rehearing on the merits of a decided appeal by this Court, the only recourse is by way of further appeal [to the High Court], if special leave is granted.

41   As a useful guide, any application before the orders are perfected which requires more than a summary consideration and determination of the impugned judgment or order is likely to be outside the scope of the rule.”


	
	In Gall (No 2), Hoeben CJ at CL (R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreeing), at [27], listed by way of illustration the situations in which r 50C has been applied:
	


“To correct a slip, being the omission of words to clarify an infelicitous or ambiguous expression. When doing so it was not altering the basis or rationale of the judgment as it was originally intended (R v Jones; R v Hili (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195; 79 NSWLR 143 at [49].

To overcome agreed difficulties where there was a gap of three months from the conclusion of the notional sentence on a count and the commencement of the notional sentence on the next count and it was appropriate to remedy that slip (R v AB (No 2) [[2011] NSWCCA 256]).

When the Court had not considered a ground of appeal (Baghdadi v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 77).

To effect the orders proposed in the reasons for judgment with the correct calculation of the aggregate head sentence (Akkawi, Mark v R; Akkawi, Paul v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 72).

To restructure sentences to achieve an aggregate non-parole period which reflected the Court’s intention (KW v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 84).

To correct some minor accidental slips which included the numbering of the orders and some minor changes of wording, neither of which altered the substance of the reasons or the orders made (R v Ly (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 91).”


	
	These illustrations may be contrasted with the situation in Alramadan (No 2), which the Crown contends is analogous to the present case. In Alramadan (No 2), an application pursuant to r 50C was made on the basis of the availability of two witness statements additional to those presented at trial. The Court held, at [8], that “the sole reason [the evidence was] not considered by the Court at the hearing of the appeal was that [the applicant] did not put it before the Court”. At [12], their Honours held:
	


“In substance, the applicant has sought to reopen the appeal so as to remedy a deficiency in the material presented at the hearing. That approach would appear to fall squarely within the impermissible purpose of seeking ‘by a backdoor method’ to reargue an unsuccessful appeal. It cannot be justified on the criteria explained by Mason CJ in Autodesk (No. 2).”

The applicant’s contentions

Bias claims


	
	The applicant claimed that the proceedings resulting in the first challenged judgment should not have been heard by Garling J. The applicant had, at the commencement of those proceedings, objected to Garling J sitting. He contended that an apprehension of bias (or perhaps actual bias) arose out of the circumstance that his Honour had previously sat on another of the applicant’s matters and additionally as a result of comments made by Garling J in the course of a case management hearing.
	
	
	It is convenient at this point to record that, at the commencement of the hearing of this matter, the applicant also made an application that Hall J not sit, on the basis that his Honour was on the bench that decided the Norrish DCJ appeal. Hall J declined to recuse himself.
	
	
	The principles relating to apprehension of bias on the basis of a judicial officer’s involvement in prior related proceedings were considered by Mason J in Re J.R.L; Ex parte C.J.L [1986] HCA 39; 161 CLR 342 at 351. His Honour considered that there had been an increase in the frequency of bias claims on that basis, and held that:
	


“It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party. There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties. But this does not mean either that he will approach the issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that expression is used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will approach the issues in this way. In cases of this kind, disqualification is only made out by showing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment and this must be ‘firmly established’ … Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done, it is equally important that judicial officers discharge their duty to sit and do not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of a judge, they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.” (citations omitted)


	
	The first challenged judgment dealt with the bias claim in some detail at [7]-[23]. At [11], their Honours noted that that aspect of the application which related to Garling J sitting on a previous matter had been abandoned in oral argument before them. The applicant now denies that that was the case. This denial cannot be sustained, having regard to following exchange recorded in transcript:
	


“FULLERTON J: So your concern about Garling J continuing or sitting as a member of this bench is that in the course of case management he referred to a decision of the High Court in a dialogue with the Crown and did not explain to you what this judgment meant or otherwise help you to understand it…

APPLICANT: That’s correct your Honour, yes.

FULLERTON J: Is that the only basis for your seeking to have Garling J removed - -

APPLICANT: That’s correct.”


	
	The applicant further contended that, as a result of a head injury, he omitted, in the hearing of the first challenged judgment, to mention or reinforce additional aspects of his bias claim, including that Garling J had threatened that his sentence might be increased if he persisted with his r 50C application. This allegation was not supported by any reference to transcript. It did not rise above a bare assertion and should be rejected. The applicant also contended that the court should have put a particular letter to him so as to assist his memory. This is not the role of the Court.
	
	
	In any case, having regard to the principles in Re J.R.L., it is clear that it was open and indeed proper for Garling J not to recuse himself from hearing the first r 50C proceeding. The same may be said about Hall J in relation to the present case.
	
	
	There was no misapprehension of law or fact in relation to the bias claim in the first challenged judgment such as would enliven r 50C.
	


Five judge bench application


	
	The applicant submitted that he was denied procedural fairness by the Court’s refusal of his application that a five judge bench be sat to hear the proceedings subject to the first challenged judgment. The power to sit a bench of more than three judges rests in the Chief Justice of New South Wales: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 3. His Honour’s decision not to sit an enlarged bench was not, and could not have been, in issue in the proceedings subject to the challenged judgments and it is not a decision amenable to review pursuant to r 50C.
	


Access to documents


	
	More substantially, the applicant contended that the conditions of his custody prevented him from being fully able to argue his case, and that this resulted in miscarriages of justice in the proceedings subject of both the first and second challenged judgments. This claim related, in particular, to access to documents which the applicant contended were in the custody of Corrective Services and had not been provided to him or returned to his son, with the result that he had no access to them at all. It was contended that those documents contained evidence favourable to the applicant which he was unable to put to the jury or to this Court on appeal or reopening. As was put in oral argument:
	


“BEAZLEY P: As I understand it, that’s virtually your central allegation, that … you were not able to prosecute your appeal properly because you did not have access to certain documents.

APPLICANT: That’s correct.”


	
	The applicant made a further and related submission that he had not been served, prior to the hearing that resulted in the first challenged judgment, with an affidavit of Superintendent Quarrie sworn on 21 October 2014. That affidavit related to the conditions of the applicant’s custody with respect to his access to computers and documents for the purposes of preparing for his legal matters.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the affidavit was in fact served. An affidavit of Anna Ilardo, solicitor in the employ of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was in evidence. In that affidavit, Ms Ilardo deposed to having organised on 21 October 2014 the service on the applicant of the affidavit of Superintendent Quarrie. She attached an acknowledgement of service appearing to be signed by the applicant and dated the following day.
	
	
	There is a further question about whether, once served, the applicant had access to the affidavit while in custody.
	
	
	The question of access to materials was dealt with in the first challenged judgment at [53], in which the Court held that:
	


“If such events [relating to access to materials for the preparation of the applicant’s case] occurred, about which we do not need to make any findings, then the proper course was to raise the position when the hearing of the appeal commenced, so that the first Court which was hearing the [Norrish DCJ] appeal could make the appropriate determination about whether, and if so how, it might proceed to hear the appeal. An examination of the transcript demonstrates that, with one exception, PFC made no complaint of the kind which he now seeks to adumbrate on this application.”

The “one exception” related to a specific issue in which access to documents was delayed on the second day of the trial: see at [54]. It is not relevant to the applicant’s current claims.


	
	At [69]-[71] in the first challenged judgment, the Court made the following comments:
	


“69   In short, [the applicant] wishes to complain that there has been a miscarriage of justice because he says, now, that he did not have adequate access to documents to enable him to adequately argue his case.

70   There is some reason to doubt that this is so, having regard to the fact that no such assertion was made to the Court at the time, and as the transcript clearly discloses, every opportunity was given to [the applicant] to cross-examine the witnesses which he wished to, and to put all submissions upon which he wished to rely. It is clear that he did not perceive at the time, and prior to the judgment being delivered, any difficulty with respect to the process which was being followed.

71   The second fundamental difficulty is a complaint which in substance amounts to a miscarriage of justice based upon the process that was followed, including [the applicant’s] ability to put all his arguments before the Court, does not fall within Rule 50C.”


	
	In submissions before this Court, the applicant contended that, contrary to the findings contained in the first challenged judgment at [53], he had raised these matters before the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal, as well in hearings of civil proceedings he brought against the State of New South Wales. This may be accepted. As the Crown submitted, however, no relevant complaints were made until after the relevant hearing.
	
	
	Further, it is not the role of this Court, on an application pursuant to r 50C, to determine whether the applicant might have been able to put on additional evidence had he been in different circumstances or whether such evidence might have affected the verdict or the outcome on appeal. Such arguments may in some circumstances be raised on appeal. The misapprehension of fact and law which the applicant contends has occurred is a failure of the Court of Appeal, in the proceedings in which this issue has been raised, to accept the applicant’s arguments. This contention fundamentally involved an attempt to “reopen the appeal so as to remedy a deficiency in the material presented at the hearing”: Alramadan (No 2) at [12]. As was pointed out in the first challenged judgment at [71], complaints of this type do not fall within the ambit of r 50C.
	


The claim relating to SB


	
	The applicant made the following claim in relation to count 12 on the indictment before Norrish DCJ:
	


“… the Crown’s very own trial evidence prove[d] categorically and beyond any doubt that SB count 12 was absolutely and physically impossible to have occurred in the time frame specified in the indictment.” (emphasis in original)


	
	The applicant contended that his conviction on this count amounted to a miscarriage of justice and resulted from a number of misapprehensions of law and fact.
	
	
	By count 12, the applicant was indicted as follows:
	


“Between 1 August 2003 and 30 November 2003 at [city] in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with SB, he being a person of the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that SB was under the authority of [the applicant].”


	
	The applicant contended that the offence the subject of count 12 could not have occurred because SB was not under his authority until 2004. In his written submissions, he reproduced count 12 in different terms, as follows:
	


“That between 1 August 2003 and 30 November 2003 at [suburb of city] NSW he did have homosexual intercourse with SB, over 14 years and under 16 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely SB was in his care through DOCS.” (emphasis in original)


	
	Were it an element of the offence charged that SB was in the applicant’s care through DOCS, the applicant might have been on slightly firmer ground. However, the applicant’s version of count 12 is not accurate.
	
	
	The Crown case was that, at the time relevant to count 12, SB was under the applicant’s authority not because he had been placed into his care by DOCS but because he had been residing with the applicant in an earlier period in 2003. At trial, the applicant contended, unsuccessfully, that this was not the case and that SB had first come to live with him in 2004. The issue was re-examined on appeal and again reconsidered in the first challenged judgment. The applicant now attempts to relitigate it for a fourth time.
	
	
	In the Norrish DCJ appeal, the Court held, at [201]-[202]:
	


“201   … SB initially had said he thought the offence the subject of count 12 was in October 2004 but in evidence said that he thought he was 12 years old and in year 9. SB's father gave evidence that SB initially moved in with the appellant in August 2003 for a short period, then moved back home, and then moved back in with the appellant in 2004. The Crown submission was that SB's initial reference to October 2004 should be taken as having been an intended reference to October 2003.

202   No misdirection was identified, and it was for the jury to be satisfied as to the facts. We do not consider there is any substance in the complaint.”


	
	The relevant finding in the first challenged judgment, at [125], was as follows:
	


“Insofar as Count 12 is concerned, [the applicant] submits that his conviction was erroneous because an essential element, namely that the complainant SB was under his authority in 2003 when he is alleged to have had sexual intercourse with him, was not proved because SB only came under his authority in 2004. The Court of Criminal Appeal specifically considered this issue. In [200] and [201] [of the Norrish DCJ appeal], it referred to the evidence, concisely, that was before the jury on this issue. It concluded that there was no misdirection of law about that evidence, and that the conviction was not unreasonable. We detect no misapprehension of fact or law in the first judgment on these issues. In so doing, we do not accede to the invitation of PFC to undertake this exercise by reference to the further material which he placed before this Court.”


	
	In his submissions, the applicant emphasised evidence before Norrish DCJ to the effect that SB did not live with him in 2003. The existence of this evidence is not sufficient to prove that the offence could not have occurred. As was noted in the first challenged judgment, it was clear from [200]-[201] and [359] of the Norrish DCJ appeal that the evidence on this issue was disputed. It was open for the jury to accept those aspects of the evidence which were consistent with SB being in the applicant’s care at the relevant time and to reject those which were not. There was no error in the finding to that effect in the Norrish DCJ appeal. More pertinently, as the Crown submitted, there was no identification of any material error of fact or law asserted to have arisen from first challenged judgment such as would enliven r 50C other than the fact that the Court did not accept the applicant’s contentions.
	
	
	The applicant made a related submission that his conviction, in particular in relation to count 12, was contrary to the authority of SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. The main contention appeared to be as follows:
	


“The dates of the offences were the ground put forward in SKA! My ground and the facts were the very same in my appeal, namely the dates of the offences, in particular to SB count 12. I repeat, my ground was the very same, namely the dates of the offence in particular to SB count 12 being an absolute impossibility to have occurred at any time in 2003!” (emphasis in original)


	
	The circumstance that a similar factual issue arose in the applicant’s case to a factual issue in SKA is not relevant to the application before the Court. The issue to be determined is whether the test from SKA was correctly applied to the different circumstances of the applicant’s case and, if not, whether the default amounted to a material misapprehension of law. The applicant has raised no argument such as to raise any question about the correctness of the application of SKA. Again, this question was fully dealt with in the first challenged judgment as follows:
	


“84   … ultimately, in the part of the first judgment to which I have referred, the [Court hearing the Norrish DCJ appeal] went through each of the offences and examined the evidence in respect to them and considered whether it was satisfied, that, in accordance with the test set forth in SKA, the appeal by [the applicant] on the basis of an unreasonable conviction, should be upheld. It is clear that in so doing, because the evidence had previously been extensively canvassed, it was only necessary for the first Court to express its conclusions concisely.

85   In [371] the first Court noted the extent of the evidence and said that it had had regard to the evidence as a whole. It concluded its review of the material and submissions with respect to this ground by saying this:

372   It was starkly a matter for the jury whether they found the complainants' evidence credible and reliable, to the point of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. They saw and heard the complainants give their evidence. In our opinion it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty on each of the counts on which he was found guilty.”


	
	The applicant has raised no issue with respect to the SB counts to which r 50C could apply.
	


Contention regarding trial representation


	
	The applicant made further submissions relating to complaints about his counsel and instructing solicitor at trial. He contended that counsel had acted contrary to his instructions in cross-examination of witnesses, that there had been a failure to raise alibi evidence in the trial before Norrish DCJ, and that his lawyers had failed to prepare a draft proof of evidence. The applicant’s major contention appears to be that further evidence relating to the SB counts should have been either adduced by his lawyers or extracted from witnesses in cross-examination by counsel in the trial before Norrish DCJ, although a contention was also made relating to incompetence of counsel with regard to the trial before Freeman DCJ.
	
	
	These issues, as they related to the Norrish DCJ trial, were dealt with in the appeal from those convictions at [62]-[82]. Both trial counsel and his instructing solicitor were called in that proceeding and cross-examined by the applicant.
	
	
	The issues regarding representation were then reconsidered in the first challenged judgment at, inter alia, [99]-[102]:
	


“99   The issue of whether, having regard to all of the circumstances, [the applicant] was properly represented at the trial, and to the extent, if any, that he was not, whether a miscarriage of justice thereby occurred, was one dealt with at very great length by the first Court during its hearing including by allowing lengthy cross-examination by [the applicant] of both his former solicitor and former counsel, and then in the first judgment.

100   There was no suggestion that [the applicant] did not have a fair opportunity to cross-examine each of the witnesses during his appeal, coming from [the applicant] during the course of the appeal. The transcript demonstrates that in fact he had an entirely satisfactory opportunity in this respect.

101   The arguments which are now contained within the Part A submissions, particularly with respect to the issue of the competence of solicitor and counsel, clearly represent an attempt by [the applicant] to reargue his appeal by reference to, not just the documents which were before the Court on that appeal, but by reference to other documents, the existence of which pre-dated the appeal, and copies of which [the applicant] had in his possession prior to the appeal, interspersed with additional evidence inserted into the submissions as though it were commentary.

102   This approach is entirely impermissible on an application under Rule 50C and cannot be used in an attempt to demonstrate that the first Court misapprehended the facts or the law.”


	
	It is difficult to distil from the applicant’s lengthy submissions on this topic any specific misapprehension of fact or law he contends were made in the challenged judgments, except that the Court did not accept that the applicant’s convictions should be overturned on this ground. Again, if the major strand of this complaint is that the actions of the applicant’s lawyers at trial resulted in deficiencies in the evidence presented in his cases, Alramadan (No 2) stands as authority that it is not open to him, on an application pursuant to r 50C, to attempt to remedy those deficiencies.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Court makes the following orders:
	


1.   Application to vary or set aside the orders entered by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 30 October 2014 in PFC v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 241 dismissed;

2.   Application to vary or set aside the orders entered by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 30 October 2014 in Clark v R [2014] NSWCCA 236 dismissed.

2767894,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) [2015] NSWSC 1472,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown sought an advance ruling under s.192A Evidence Act 1995, upon an application for leave to cross-examine at trial an intended Crown witness, A1, under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 with respect to a number of specific topics.
	


Factual Background


	
	A1 is the father of C1 and C2, the complainants with respect to charges, including charges of female genital mutilation, brought against A2 (A1’s wife), KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri.
	
	
	The charges and factual background to the charges, and an outline of the Crown case against the Accused persons, appears in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1221 at [7]ff. It is not necessary to repeat that material in this judgment.
	


The Present Application


	
	The Crown called A1 at a pretrial hearing on 3 September 2015. A1 did not object to giving evidence as a prosecution witness in criminal proceedings against his wife: s.18 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	A1 had been charged in 2012 with offences arising from the events in question. He was discharged at committal proceedings before the Local Court.
	
	
	The Crown considered that it was under a duty to call A1 as a witness at the trial, as his evidence was necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of all the events upon which the prosecution is based: Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 674. It is the case that A1 is involved in many covertly recorded conversations about these events on and after 29 August 2012, upon which the Crown relies.
	
	
	The s.38 application was based upon a number of contrasts between what A1 had said on 3 September 2015 and what he had said, at earlier times, in a recorded interview with police on 7 September 2012 and in a number of conversations which had been recorded under warrant by way of surveillance device or telephone interception warrant.
	
	
	A1 had received legal advice about his rights and obligations as a witness, before the pretrial hearing. A certificate under s.128 Evidence Act 1995 issued with respect to parts of his evidence on 3 September 2015.
	
	
	I was satisfied that it was appropriate, in this case, to give a ruling before the evidence of A1 is adduced in the trial. The ruling concerns the use of evidence proposed to be adduced from A1 and the operation of s.38 in relation to that evidence: s.192A(a), (b) Evidence Act 1995. The advance ruling procedure under s.192A is utilised, from time to time, where a s.38 application is made before trial: Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v McRae [2010] VSC 114.
	
	
	On 10 September 2015, I announced my ruling on the present application in the following terms (PT731.27-732.1):
	


“On the Crown application under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 for leave to cross examine A1, I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated that A1 has given evidence on the voir dire on 3 September 2015 which is either unfavourable to the Crown or inconsistent with prior statements made by him, or both, with respect to the following five topics identified by the Crown in its written submissions MFI 39, namely:

(a)    A1's understanding of Khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra community;

(b)    complaint about Khatna to A1 by C1 and C2;

(c)    what is described as the Africa story;

(d)    what is described as the checking story;

(e)    KM's role in the community.

Subject to any further submission which may be made in light of the answers given by A1 in his evidence in chief at the trial, I will grant leave to the Crown to cross examine him with respect to these five topics and as to credibility. The extent of cross examination under s 38 which will be allowed, will be the subject of further consideration, in particular by reference to factors in s 192(2)(a), (b) and (c) of the Evidence Act 1995.”


	
	I should record, as well, the additional observations which I made after giving that ruling (PT732.15-30):
	


“… Now, with respect to the s 38 aspect, if it requires any further explanation, the ruling is, of course, prospective; A1 is yet to give evidence in chief at the trial. Once that has happened, if there is anything that gives rise to any other submission, I would entertain it but on the assumption that what he says is along the same lines as given on the voir dire, there will be a grant of leave but it's not appropriate to crystallise that grant of leave, I think, until he's actually given the evidence at the trial in case there's something else that's said. That's why I have expressed it in that way.

With respect to the material, the expectation is that the Crown will fine tune the material which it will seek to rely upon in the event that the s 38 issue becomes a reality, with particular attention to confining the amount of time in the trial which will be needed for that purpose, minimising the risk of any prejudice to the accused persons and ensuring that the material is placed before the jury in a manner which can be comprehended relatively quickly.“


	
	The approach taken by me on 10 September 2015 was premised necessarily on the position being the same, when A1 is called to give evidence before the jury, as it was at the time of the pretrial hearing on 3 September 2015. It is assumed that A1 will adhere to the position taken by him on that occasion: Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96 at 102 [13]; R v Anyang [2011] VSC 31 at [8].
	
	
	This judgment contains my reasons for the ruling made on 10 September 2015.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 38 Evidence Act 1995 provides as follows:
	


“38   Unfavourable witnesses 

(1)    A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 

(a)    evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or 

(b)    a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 

(c)    whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement. 

(2)    Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39). 

(3)    The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness's credibility. 

Note: The rules about admissibility of evidence relevant only to credibility are set out in Part 3.7. 

(4)    Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs. 

(5)    If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs. 

(6)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account: 

(a)    whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and 

(b)    the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 

(7)    A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if: 

(a)    a proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person; and 

(b)    the party is a witness in the proceeding.” 


	
	Section 192 of that Act is in the following terms:
	


“192   Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 

(1)    If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 

(2)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 

(a)    the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 

(b)    the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 

(c)    the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 

(d)    the nature of the proceeding; and 

(e)    the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.”

Relevant Legal Principles


	
	In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005, I set out at [9]-[17] the principles to be applied where the Crown makes application for leave under s.38 Evidence Act 1995:
	


“9   Section 38 Evidence Act 1995 abrogates the common law rule relating to hostile witnesses: R v Lozano (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 June 1997, unreported, BC9702441, page 6). The intention of the Australian Law Reform Commission was to ensure (via s.38) that courts are not deprived of relevant testimony which had been excluded by operation of the hostile witness rule: R v Lozano at page 6. Subject to several discretionary considerations, s.38 permits a party, by leave, to cross-examine a witness who meets any of the criteria in s.38(1) of the Act. It is a section that needs to be applied with some care in criminal trials: R v Fowler [2000] NSWCCA 142 at [120]; R v Parkes (2003) 147 A Crim R 450 at 463 [73].

10   Section 38 is not confined to the situation where a party calling a witness is confronted unexpectedly by evidence that is unfavourable or inconsistent with prior statements or by a witness who unexpectedly appears not to be making a genuine attempt to give evidence: R v Fowler at [121]; R v Parkes at 462 [70].

11   The word ‘unfavourable’ in s.38 (1)(a) of the Act does not mean ‘adverse’; it means ‘not favourable’ to the party making the application: R v Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 at 715; R v Lozano at page 6; R v Fowler at [121]; R v Ronen [2004] NSWSC 1298 at [49]. 

12   Section 38 permits the applicant party to question ‘as though … cross-examining the witness’ but only ‘about’ the three subjects described in s.38(1)(a)-(c). As Heydon JA observed in R v Le [[2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474] at 486 [66]-[67], cross-examination ‘about’ the subject should not be narrowly confined:

‘One purpose of a s 38 examination must be to enable counsel calling the witness to demonstrate that the evidence in chief which led to the s 38 order is false. Another must be to enable counsel to demonstrate that any prior statement inconsistent with it is true. That latter purpose is assisted by s 60, which permits a prior inconsistent statement to be considered as evidence of what is represented, not merely as a matter affecting credibility. But s 60 by itself is not wholly effectual unless the questioner is able to interrogate with a view to demonstrating the truth of the prior inconsistent statement. There would be little point in permitting s 38 examinations otherwise and no point in the existence of s 38(3). The purposes described can be assisted by obtaining concessions from the witness about matters tending to indicate the falsity of the impugned evidence. One of these is the lateness with which the impugned story is advanced. Another is the inherent improbability of the impugned story. These purposes must also be capable of being assisted by the eliciting of evidence tending to show the truthfulness of prior statements inconsistent with the impugned evidence, such as the fact that they were made under conditions conducive to accurate recollection and expression and conducive to sincerity. 

In my opinion, on the true construction of s 38, leave may be granted under s 38 to conduct questioning not only if the questioning is specifically directed to one of the three subjects described in s 38(1), but also if it is directed to establishing the probability of the factual state of affairs in relation to those subjects contended for by the party conducting the questioning or the improbability of the witness’s evidence on those subjects. In establishing the probability or improbability of one or other state of affairs, the questioner is entitled to ask questions about matters going only to credibility with a view to shaking the witness’s credibility on the s 38(1) subjects.’

13   The further observations of Heydon JA in R v Le at 493 [90] are also pertinent to this question:

‘Section 38 permits the testing of the evidence in chief with a view to establishing the probability of the truth of the matters asserted in the prior inconsistent statement. Hence it permits examination of the witness on matters of credit with a view to the jury accepting the prior inconsistent statement and rejecting the later sworn evidence. It also permits an examination of the background at the time with which the statements are dealing, the background at the time when the prior inconsistent statement is made, and the background at the time when the witness moves to a version different from the prior inconsistent statement. It permits an inquiry into the possible reasons for the change, including the motives for the change. Judicial rulings which prevented these techniques being employed where application is made for leave to question under s 38 would not be giving full effect to the section.’

14   The interests of justice, the public interest and the administration of justice may be served by the testing of the evidence of a witness by way of a s.38 examination: R v Le at 487 [68]; R v Ronen at [71]. The grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to the jury than would have been the case had the Crown been refused leave to cross-examine. This is the very purpose underlying s.38: R v Parkes at 464 [81], [83].

15   The factors which bear upon the exercise of discretion where application is made under s.38 are not confined. There are express statutory factors referred to in s.38 (6) and s.192 Evidence Act 1995. In addition, in R v Le at 493 [90], Heydon JA observed that, in a s.38 application, the Court ought give consideration to s. 137 Evidence Act 1995, whether or not the parties make submissions with respect to that provision.

16   Section 192(2)(b) requires the court to consider whether a grant of leave would be unfair to a party (the Crown or the accused) or to a witness. With respect to any suggested unfairness to an accused, it is important to note that the defence can test the evidence led in a s.38 examination by defence cross-examination of the witness: s.38(4); Adam v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 96 at 107 [30]. To refuse a s.38 application, in some circumstances, may be unfair to the Crown: R v Ronen at [70].

17   It is necessary to keep in mind the risk that s.38 cross-examination may convert the focus of the trial from the guilt of the accused for the crime charged to whether the witness is lying to protect the accused: R v Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292 at [5], [76]; R v Le at 492-493 [89]; R v Ronen at [32], [72]. The Court should be alert to the risk of being sidetracked into collateral issues by way of grant of leave under s.38: R v Ronen at [32].”


	
	Subject to one qualification, I have kept these principles in mind in considering the present application.
	
	
	The qualification relates to the mention of s.137 Evidence Act 1995 in the final sentence of R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) at [15]. What was said about s.137 in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474 must now be considered in light of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645 at 649-653 [16]-[30]; Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217 at 233 [64]-[66] and Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 at [36]-[50].
	


The Topics in Relation to Which Leave is Sought by the Crown


	
	I will outline the basis for my ruling with respect to each of the nominated topics.
	


A1’s Understanding of Khatna in the Dawoodi Bohra Community


	
	The Crown pointed to evidence of A1 at the pretrial hearing on 3 September 2015 as follows (PT622-624):
	


“Q. What do you understand by the word ‘Khatana’?

WITNESS: For man I think it is straight forward, I can say that it's circumcision. For females, I have been made aware of this by my wife, and basically it means there's some sort of prayers that are done during a ceremony where a girl is - I'm not sure, it's around 6, 7, 8 years of age or onwards - it's a female ritual where they touch some sort of a metal object on the private parts and some prayers are done at the same time. 

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. When you say they touch some type of metal - is that what you said? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. - on the private parts, what do you understand is the type of metal that is used? 

A. I don't know. 

Q. And whereabouts on the private parts does the metal come into contact with the girl? 

A. I can't - I don't know exactly. 

Q. And what is the purpose of this ritual? 

A. I don't know. Just like in male, I don't know what is the purpose of a man's circumcision, medically I can't say. 

Q. Is any part of the girl cut when the metal touches her private parts? 

A. No.”


	
	The Crown referred, as well, to the later evidence of A1 (PT642):
	


“Q. Now you have told us about the procedure as you understand it, khatna, being explained to you by [A2] and it involved was it a metal instrument?

A. A metal object.

Q. Do you know what that metal object was?

A. Now I know it was a forceps.

Q. Who told you that? 

A. [A2].

Q. And did she tell you what they did with the forceps?

A. No.

Q. When did she tell you about the forceps being used?

A. I'm not sure it was before the JIRT [changed from jailed in transcript] interview or after, I'm not sure.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence set out above is unfavourable to the Crown case for the purpose of s.38(1)(a) as it is the Crown case that, in each case, C1 and C2’s clitoris was cut in the course of the Khatna procedure.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that this evidence of A1 was also inconsistent with the contents of some eight conversations recorded under either surveillance device warrant or telephone interception warrant.
	
	
	By way of example, the Crown refers to a recorded conversation on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 35), where A2 is having a conversation with A1 in which, on the Crown case, she is explaining the Khatna procedure. The Crown submitted that A1’s knowledge of Khatna, as described to him by A2, is inconsistent with the Khatna procedure explained by A1 in his evidence.
	
	
	The Crown points, as well, to a recorded conversation on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 34), where A1 expresses concern that they have a problem, but KM has a bigger problem than them, and that KM would be caught. The Crown submitted that this is inconsistent with a benign Khatna procedure occurring.
	
	
	As stated on 10 September 2015, I am satisfied sufficiently that unfavourability and inconsistency has been demonstrated with respect to this topic. As also indicated on 10 September 2015, the extent to which the Crown will be permitted to cross-examine A1, in particular in a manner which involves the playing of recorded conversations which would not otherwise be in evidence, will be the subject of further consideration before the final grant of leave is made.
	
	
	It is sufficient to record my ruling that the Crown has crossed the s.38 threshold with respect to this topic.
	


Complaint to A1 by C1 and C2 about Khatna


	
	The Crown pointed to evidence given by A1 on 3 September 2015 (PT631):
	


“Q. In terms of now, do you know what it was that happened to C2 on that occasion?

A. Yes. 

Q. What was that?

A. Khatna.

Q. Do you know now, with any detail what happened to C2 in the course of that khatna procedure?

A. It's the same like, same khatna procedure where some sort of metal was attached in her private parts and there was some prayers going on at the same time.”


	
	The Crown relied, as well, upon the following evidence of A1 (PT633):
	


“Q. Did C1 ever tell you anything about the procedure that occurred in Wollongong?

A. No.

Q. What about C2, did C2 ever tell you about the procedure?

A. No.

Q. Did she tell you possibly before that something was going to happen to her; I'm talking about C2? 

A. No.

Q. What about C1, did C1 mention anything to you about why she was going to Wollongong?

A. No.”


	
	Reliance was placed upon the following evidence of A1 (PT639):
	


“Q. Did C1 ever talk to you about something happening to her private parts with scissors?

A. No.”


	
	The Crown submitted that this evidence was unfavourable to the Crown case for the purpose of s.38(1)(a) because it is the Crown case that C1 did complain to A1 on 29 August 2012 during a covertly recorded conversation in a motor vehicle in which the following was said (Exhibit PTK, Tab 34):
	


“A1: What did you say?

C1: From here cut. I am not sure but she …cut.

A1: There can not [sic] be cut there. She asked you what is cut? Other people do cut. What she asked? There was no cut.

C1: She said….I am not sure….

A1: She said that you had cut? Others do the cut. Okay

C1: Yes I said that. I am not sure about the cut.

A1: She did ask what it is. So, you said you had cut. No, you have no cut. We do not do cut…….. No we do not cut, we can not cut [sic]….Nothing was cut of yours. We don’t do the cut, we can’t cut it here.

C1: Yes, once they asked for scissors…I saw scissors…they do something with scissors? She asked me don’t we do with scissors…. Do not we do with scissors with something….

A1: Not with scissors. They do forceps; forceps is used for cleaning purpose to check up.”


	
	The Crown pointed, as well, to C2’s statement in her recorded interview of 29 August 2012 that she had told her father about what had happened:
	


“Q252:   Did Mum say anything to you?

A: No.

Q253: No. Have you talked to anybody else [about the procedure]?

A: No, my Dad.

Q254: Your Dad. What did your Dad say?

A: It’s O.K.

Q255:    When did he say that?

A: I don’t know.”


	
	The Crown submitted further that part of the police interview with A1 on 7 September 2012 is pertinent (Exhibit PTK, Tab 3):
	


“Q160:   O.K. [C2] told us that she had told her Dad and he said, ‘It's O.K.’ What can you tell me about that?

A: Told her Dad what?

Q161: Told her Dad about the cut on her private part.

A I don’t remember.

Q162:   Do you ever recall having a conversation with [C2] about a cut on her private part?

A: Not at all.

Q163:   And do you ever recall a conversation that you had with [C1] about female genital mutilation and the cutting of her private part?

A: Me? No.”


	
	The Crown submitted, as well, that A1 had demonstrated unfavourability and inconsistency in the course of a recorded conversation on 31 August 2012 between A1 and Hussein Karimjee (Exhibit PTK, Tab 20). In that conversation, A1 said (page 13):
	


“… I have already just told that to [C1]. Yesterday, the other day, said, was it not so, that ‘Those people told me’, at that time, I said as this, ‘No, actually, in your case, only check-up had taken place.”


	
	A little later, A1 said to Mr Karimjee (page 14):
	


A1 - “Yes, I said, ‘No, we do not perform that procedure for you; we had just carried out [in a laughing tone] merely the check up.”

Mr Karimjee - “hmm, okay, that’s good.”


	
	I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated unfavourability and inconsistency with respect to this topic so as to prima facie warrant a grant of leave under s.38.
	
	
	It is not necessary to go further at this point.
	


The “Africa Story”


	
	The Crown relies upon the following evidence given by A1 on 3 September 2015 (PT638):
	


“Q. When C1 and C2 came back from Africa, did you have any concerns or fears that something might have happened to them there? 

A. No, not at all. 

Q. Were you suspicious that something might have happened to them there?

A. Does the certificate still stand?

HIS HONOUR

Q. It does?

A. Thank you. Can you ask the question again? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. Were you suspicious that something might have happened to C1 and C2 when they were in Africa?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever talk to A2 about concerns you might have had about something happening to C1 and C2 in Africa? 

A. No, I didn't have concerns.”


	
	The Crown refers, as well, to the further evidence of A1 (PT641):
	


“Q. Just going back to your daughters' trips, I think they have been to Africa more than once, is that correct? 

A. Yes.

Q. After your daughters returned from Africa in 2011 did you have any suspicions that your mother in law might have had a female genital mutilation type procedure conducted on either of your daughters? 

A. No.”


	
	The Crown submits that this evidence is inconsistent with assertions made by A1 on earlier occasions. Reliance is placed upon 12 telephone intercept transcripts, four surveillance device transcripts and parts of the police interview with A1 on 7 September 2012.
	
	
	A number of illustrations will suffice for present purposes.
	
	
	In the course of a recorded conversation between A1 and KM at 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 5), KM and A1 are discussing what C1 said had happened on the occasion relevant to this trial. In the course of that conversation, A1 said (pages 7-8):
	


A1 - “I will tell those people that I am totally against this and I, um, we had gone to Africa and India.”

KM - “Hmm!”

A1 - “In fact, I, we, for the purpose of checking that did not perform this.”

KM - “Hmm hmm!”

A1 - “I called you.”

KM - “Hmm hmm.”

A1 - “Ok?”

KM - “To check that it’s not done, isn’t it?”

A1 - “Yea.”

KM - “Yes. Ok, let’s get going.”

A1 - “And you or to you; if the worst case scenario, if someone comes to ask you, you say, ‘Yes, yes, as far as I can see, there is nothing being done?”

KM - “Ok, let’s get going.”

A1 - “OK?”

KM - “Hmm hmm.”

A1 - “And if it has been done, bad luck; had been performed in Africa.”

KM - Yes, that way. Ok.”

A1 - “Ok?”

KM - “All right, Yes.”

A1 - “Yes, yea.”

KM - “Ok then, thanks.”

A1 - “Yes, yea.”

KM - “For letting me know.”


	
	In the course of a recorded conversation between A1 and A2 on the afternoon of 29 August 2012, A1 says to A2 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 34):
	


“We can say that, yes we called this lady for check up to make sure that they haven’t had anything done. Say this way, that we called to check them if anything is being done, because they go to Africa and is being done there. We do to India and Africa and we also do up there.”


	
	Later in the same conversation, A1 said to A2:
	


“… if they ask you, have you done it? Then say yes I think I may have done. I don’t have idea, I don’t know. But I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened as our people do it.”


	
	A little later again, in the same conversation, A1 said to A2:
	


“I said … we had a talk with my wife … I do not know what they do in circumcision. Yes, I do concern. I had talk with my wife and she said that we will do check up. We will call a lady, [KM]. Because she is a registered nurse and she knows … she came and ya … my wife organised it and I said ya … do the check.”


	
	The Crown relied upon parts of the police interview with A1 on 7 September 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 3):
	


“Q47   Do you agree that due to the concerns that you had that they had been mutilated in Africa you had both of your daughters checked out by a person in Australia?

A   Yes.

Q48   O.K. And do you agree that, I think it's the case that you said [C1] was examined, or checked out, two years ago?

A   Yeah. I don’t exactly remember, but it was after a trip from Africa in 2008, 2009. 

Q49   O.K. 

DETECTIVE SERGEANT STEK

Q50    [10.38] That was [C1] or [C2]?

A   [C1].

Q51   [C1].

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE MCDONALD

Q52   And do you agree that during this conversation on Wednesday you had, you, you told us that you had [C2] checked out, or examined, in relation to female genital mutilation four to five months ago, this year, 2012?

A   Yeah. I'm not sure of the dates, but yes, I know it's this year some times.

Q53   O.K. And - - - 

A It might have been later I think.

Q54   And do you agree that you, you, you told us that the reason why you got them checked out is because there was, you were suspicious, you, yourself and your wife were suspicious that they may have been mutilated overseas in Africa?

A   Yeah. Yes.

Q55   And do you agree that you, you, you believe that your mother-in-law may have instigated this?

A   Yes.

......

Q91   Are you able to offer any explanation as to why she would come up with that?

A   Um, I can, the only thing I can think is that because of what was happening when she went to Africa and there was some conversation about this. I think [A2] might have explained to her that this is what happens to children here.

Q92   O.K. 

A   So she might have confused an examination and a procedure. But definitely I've got no - - - 

Q93   O.K. 

A   That's the only thing I can think. Otherwise, no, I think [A2] might have explained to her that this is what, might have happened to other kids there, but no.

…..

Q200   From our conversation last Wednesday and you told me that you believed [C1] and [C2] may have had a procedure done in Africa - - - 

A   I didn’t believe, we, we were suspicious.

Q201   Suspicious, sorry. You were suspicious that they had a procedure done in Africa. O.K. And I told you that I believed they had a procedure done in Australia.

A   Mmm.”


	
	The Crown submitted that evidence of A1 under this heading was unfavourable and was inconsistent with prior accounts given by him either in his police interview or in the covertly recorded conversations.
	
	
	I should observe that Mr Sutherland SC, for A2 and the Accused Vaziri, acknowledged that the “Africa story” was untrue and that there would be no issue at the trial in that respect.
	
	
	I am satisfied that relevant unfavourability and inconsistency is demonstrated by reference to material falling under this heading. I have taken into account the defence position concerning this material in reaching this conclusion.
	
	
	In support of this argument, the Crown sought to rely upon a significant number of other recorded conversations in addition to those to which reference is made in this judgment. In determining the extent of the grant of leave to be granted to the Crown under this heading, I will keep in mind the approach foreshadowed on 10 September 2015 (see [10]-[11] above) and the provisions of s.192 Evidence Act 1995.
	


The “Checking Story”


	
	The Crown referred to evidence given by A1 on 3 September 2015 (PT639):
	


“Q. Did you ever arrange to have either C1 or C2 checked to see if anything had happened to them?

A. That's after the interview with JIRT, yes. 

Q. What about before the interview with JIRT, did you ever arrange to have either C1 or C2 checked to see if anything had happened to their genital area?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever discuss such a topic with A2? 

A. No.

Q. Do you know if either of your daughters were examined in Australia for ensuring that nothing might have happened to them in Africa?

A. No.”


	
	The Crown referred, as well, to the following evidence of A1 (PT642):
	


“Q. Did you ever arrange for [KM] to examine either of your daughters? 

A. No.

Q. To your knowledge did your wife [A2] ever arrange for [KM] to examine either of your daughters? 

A. No.”


	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence of A1 set out above is inconsistent with material contained in 12 telephone intercept conversations, three surveillance device conversations and answers given by A1 during his police interview on 7 September 2012.
	
	
	Once again, it will be sufficient to provide illustrations of the suggested inconsistencies.
	
	
	The Crown points again to the recorded telephone conversation between KM and A1 at 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012 (referred to at [42] above).
	
	
	The Crown refers, as well, to the conversation between A1 and A2 recorded by way of surveillance device on 29 August 2012, extracts of which are set out earlier in this judgment (at [43]-[45]).
	
	
	The Crown relies upon the following parts of A1’s police interview of 7 September 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 3), which repeat some portions, relied upon concerning the “Africa story”:
	


“Q47   Do you agree that due to the concerns that you had that they had been mutilated in Africa you had both of your daughters checked out by a person in Australia?

A   Yes.

Q48   O.K. And do you agree that, I think it's the case that you said [C1] was examined, or checked out, two years ago?

A   Yeah. I don’t exactly remember, but it was after a trip from Africa in 2008, 2009. 

Q49   O.K. 

DETECTIVE SERGEANT STEK

Q50   [10.38] That was [C1] or [C2]?

A   [C1].

Q51   [C1].

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE MCDONALD

Q52   And do you agree that during this conversation on Wednesday you had, you, you told us that you had [C2] checked out, or examined, in relation to female genital mutilation four to five months ago, this year, 2012?

A   Yeah. I'm not sure of the dates, but yes, I know it's this year some times.

Q53   O.K. And - - - 

A   It might have been later I think.

Q54   And do you agree that you, you, you told us that the reason why you got them checked out is because there was, you were suspicious, you, yourself and your wife were suspicious that they may have been mutilated overseas in Africa?

A   Yeah. Yes.

Q55   And do you agree that you, you, you believe that your mother-in-law may have instigated this?

A   Yes.

Q56   O.K. Do you agree that the person that you nominated to, who checked out, or sorry, examined your daughters in Australia was a lady by the name of [KM]?

A   Yes.

Q57   And do you agree that you told me that she lives in Campbelltown?

A   Yes.

Q58   Do you agree that you told me that this lady by the name of [KM] is a registered nurse?

A   Yes, she is a midwife. Whether she is registered or not I am not sure really.

Q59   O.K. 

A   But I know she has been a nurse ..... and a midwife I think.

Q60   O.K. O.K. And do you agree that you told me that her husband owns a post office? 

A   Yes.

Q61   Or her and her husband own a post office. Do you agree that you told me that you said [A2] would have told you if they had been subjected to female genital mutilation?

A   After the, after the checking and examination, yes, she would definitely.

…..

Q69   Have you spoken to [A2], after the, after you saying the children have been examined, have you spoken to [A2] about female genital mutilation or in, in your words here ..... circumcision?

A   Yes. She told me that they were fine.

…..

Q96   O.K. I'll, I'll just make it clear 'cause I'm obviously not medically inclined - - - 

A   O.K. You - - - 

Q96   - - - but when I say procedure, I mean the actual cutting of her clitoris, or in her words, cutting her private part. When we say examination, that's, that's the words that you're telling before, checking a vagina. Is that correct?

A   Yeah, yeah.

Q97   O.K. Just so we're on the same page. Are we right with that?

A   Yep.

Q98   O.K. So [C1] said that the cutting of her private part occurred in Wollongong. What can you tell me about that?

A   Well, the examination happened in Wollongong, yes.

Q99   O.K. Do you know who was present when the examination happened?

A   Ah, obviously [KM] was there and ah, [A2] was there and my Aunt was there.

MR KARIMJEE

Can you, you're saying were there, do you mean in the actual residence or in the room that the examination took place? Can you clarify.

A   In the residence.

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE MCDONALD

Q100   O.K. 

A   Yeah.

MR KARIMJEE

So are you referring when you saying who was present, are you referring to actually in the room that witnessed the examination or was present in the - - - 

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE MCDONALD

Q101   Yes. Who, who witnessed the examination?

A   I wouldn’t know. 

Q102   O.K. 

A   I wasn’t there.

Q103   When you say your Aunt was there - - - 

A   Correct.

Q103   - - - in the residence, what, what's your Aunt's name?

A   Ah, [A3].

Q104   How do I spell that?

A   [A3].

Q105   O.K. Are you aware of anyone else that was in the residence apart from [A2], [A3] - - - 

MR KARIMJEE

[KM].

DETECTIVE SENIOR CONSTABLE MCDONALD

Q105   - - - and [KM]?

A   No. I'm not sure because I wasn't there and it's been a while ago so these are the ..... I can list.

Q106   O.K. From your understanding, do you know when this examination happened?

A   It must have, it happened after their holidays, so some times 2009, 'cause there, we went there in December, January, so it must have happened some times around that time after that.

…..

Q127   O.K. Again, just jumping back to [C1] interview, when we spoke to [C1] and when she brought up [C2]. O.K. She indicated that [C2], again I apologise, had her procedure at home, at your home at [xxx] Baulkham Hills. What can you tell me about that?

A   Yes, she had the examination done at my home.

Q128   Do you know who was there at the time?

A   Yes, I know.

Q129   O.K. 

A   [KM] was there. Um, in the residence [KM] was there, I think my girls were there at home because it was holiday. My Mum was there and my, yeah, that's it. I think my Mum; obviously [A2] was there, [KM], and the girls.

Q130    O.K. What's your mother's name?

A   [A5]..

Q131   How do you spell that?

A   [A5].

Q132   O.K. 

DETECTIVE SERGEANT STEK

Q133   Same last name as your .....

A   Yeah same last name.

Q134   And from your understanding, you, you just mentioned that they were in the residence, do you know if any of those persons witnessed the examination taking place?

A   Yes ..... [A2] was there and [KM], but I don’t know anybody else.

Q135   O.K. You just indicated that it occurred in the holiday - - - 

A   Yep.

Q135   - - - it was at a holiday time. Do you remember which holiday it was?

A   ..... it was school holiday ..... I don’t know whether it was the winter holidays or the Easter ones. I'm not sure.

…..

Q159   O.K. What can you tell me about that?

A   ..... I don’t, don’t know because I wasn’t there. I don’t even know where the examination took place.”


	
	The Crown submits that relevant inconsistency is demonstrated with respect to this topic in a manner related to the third topic, the “Africa story”.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC acknowledged that the “checking story” was not true and that no attempt would be made at trial to advance it as a true account.
	
	
	There is a considerable overlap between the third and fourth topics, the “Africa story” and the “checking story”. In the material relied upon, the two issues travel together. I am satisfied that relevant inconsistency has been demonstrated so as to cross the s.38 threshold. In reaching this view, I have had regard to the defence position concerning material on this topic.
	
	
	As with the third topic, the Crown pointed to a large number of recorded conversations which were said to demonstrate inconsistency. Once again, the approach to be taken at trial with respect to the extent of any grant of leave will be affected by considerations foreshadowed by me on 10 September 2015 (see [10]-[11] above) and the provisions of s.192 Evidence Act 1995.
	


KM’s Role in the Community


	
	The Crown referred to the following evidence of A1 given on 3 September 2015 (PT639):
	


“Q. Do you know, you've mentioned her name, KM?

A. (Witness nodded).

Q. How do you know her?

A. I know her as a member of the community. 

Q. To your knowledge, does she have a particular role in your community?

A. No.”


	
	The Crown submitted that this evidence is inconsistent with statements made by A1 in some 16 electronically recorded conversations. The Crown took the Court to a number of transcripts which were said to be examples.
	
	
	In the course of a conversations at 3.04 pm on 29 August 2012 between A1 and the Accused Vaziri (Exhibit PTK, Tab 4), the Crown submits that A1 is aware that KM was actively involved in the procedures under consideration so that A1 expresses an intention to speak to KM about the topic (pages 5, 9).
	
	
	In a conversation between A1 and KM at 3.20 pm on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 5), A1 calls KM and discusses with her the fact that C1 has told investigating officials what had happened. In the course of this conversation, the Crown contends that A1 outlines to KM the “Africa story” and the “checking story”, with KM accepting that such an account should be given.
	
	
	During a recorded conversation between A1 and Mr Karimjee at 10.25 am on 1 September 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 21), the following was said (page 2):
	


A1 - “It is very, very … as far as I do not know, [A2] explained to [KM]. When they spoke. She said that it just very very little part.”

Karimjee: “Yes, OK.”

A1 - “As far as [KM] was concerned, she was very confident. No … no … it can’t be seen or anything you see.”

Karimjee - “Oh, … OK. Then it’s OK.”

A1 - “So, that’s a bit promising.”


	
	The Crown submitted that inconsistency was demonstrated between the evidence of A1 at the pretrial hearing and earlier statements made by him in recorded conversations. In particular, the Crown submitted that A1 demonstrated, at an early point in his conversation with the Accused Vaziri, the fact that KM had been involved in these matters and that he considered she should be spoken to promptly in that respect. Thereafter, A1 rang KM and discussed the matter with her. The Crown pointed to later conversations as well which, it was submitted, pointed to A1 having some knowledge that KM performed a role in the community as a circumciser.
	
	
	Mr Bouveng, counsel for KM, submitted that the recorded conversations disclose, at the highest, the fact that KM had performed a role with C1 and C2, but not that she performed a role in the community, as a circumciser or otherwise.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated inconsistency under this heading. The discussions undertaken by A1, very soon after he and A2 had learned that C1 and C2 had spoken to investigating officials, involved an indication of his knowledge of the role of KM with respect to his daughters. An inference is available, at the least, that this knowledge was based upon A1’s pre-existing knowledge of a role played by KM in the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	It will, of course, be a matter for the jury to determine what findings should be made concerning KM, for the purpose of reaching verdicts. I am satisfied, however, that the s.38 threshold has been passed with respect to this topic.
	


Credibility


	
	The Crown seeks leave to cross-examine A1 under s.38(3) Evidence Act 1995 on matters relevant only to his credibility.
	
	
	In this respect, the Crown relied upon three recorded conversations involving A1. The Court was taken to one of these, by way of example.
	
	
	In a conversation at 4.05 pm on 29 August 2012 involving A1 and A1’s mother (Exhibit PTK, Tab 6), the following was allegedly said (page 2):
	


A1 - “… mummy we did khatanat.”

A1’s mother - “Ha …”

A1 -    “Problem has been caused because of that.”

A1’s mother - “To [C2].”

A1 - “Both.”

A1’s mother - “Ha …”

A1 - “We will talk later. First just recite something.”

A1’s mother - “Don’t worry. I will recite.”


	
	The extract in the preceding paragraph bears upon the first topic, as well as the issue of credibility.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the s.38 threshold has been crossed with respect to credibility. In this regard, I have had regard to the other topics referred to in this judgment, as well as the particular example relied upon by the Crown under this heading.
	


Conclusion


	
	As indicated on 10 September 2015, in the passages extracted at the commencement of this judgment (at [10]-[11]), and for the reasons provided in this judgment, I am satisfied that the Crown has crossed the s.38 threshold so as to prima facie warrant a grant of leave to cross-examine A1, with respect to the topics identified in this judgment.
	
	
	Before there is a formal grant of leave, however, the Court will have regard to the evidence given by A1 in examination-in-chief before the jury, together with identification by the Crown of the extent of any cross-examination to be undertaken (in particular by reference to transcripts of recorded conversations) if a grant of leave is actually made with respect to the nominated topics.

		17 November 2015",2015-10-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767901,R v James Ian Longworth (No 3) [2015] NSWDC 401,"Judgment


	
	I am presiding over a criminal trial. It is a jury trial. The accused faces two alternative charges. The charges arise from him punching a security guard at a bar in the city about two years ago. The security guard was knocked over by the punch and suffered a serious brain injury. The man has been charged primarily with the very serious offence of causing grievous bodily harm to the victim of the punch “with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.”
	
	
	When the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr J Pickering SC who appears as Crown Prosecutor, opened the case he told the jury about some CCTV footage. It is not at all unusual these days that CCTV footage can turn up in evidence depicting the very crime which is said to have been committed. In this case there is such footage from the bar. It became exhibit A in these proceedings and has been shown to the jury.
	
	
	I understand that the press has taken a keen interest in these proceedings. I understand that because I have received a number of applications for access to the CCTV footage from news media organisations, as they are referred to in the legislation. The interest is no doubt partly due to the fact that the alleged crime is an example of a one punch offence that has resulted in a very serious injury to its victim. Just whether the accused man intended to cause or recklessly caused that result is the question for the jury. One punch crimes have been the subject of appropriate and wide media attention in recent times and also of legislation.
	
	
	When Mr Pickering SC opened the case he said this about the CCTV footage:
	


“There could have actually been some other really serious injury that he intended to cause but he had to have intended to do that and it will be the Crown case that when you see this video that you will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only intent that he could have was to cause really serious bodily harm, really serious injury.”

In other words, at least one plank of the prosecution case against the accused man is that the CCTV footage itself will prove the intent that will be necessary for the Crown to satisfy the jury of beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that the footage is therefore an essential piece of evidence.


	
	I have viewed the footage. It is fair to describe it as graphic and violent. It is a clear, visual and moving illustration of a one punch crime. I am not saying that it amounts to either of the crimes that the man has been charged with. That is a question for the jury. But it is a one punch incident and Mr Dhanji SC, who appears for the accused, acknowledges that his client will plead guilty to some lesser offence regarding the incident.
	
	
	The media organisations who are interested are Channel 7, Channel 9 and Nationwide News. They are represented by Mr T Maltz of counsel who appeared before me this afternoon.
	
	
	I should add at this point that the time is now approaching 6.30pm. I have given priority to the continuation of the trial over the last day or two in the knowledge that the media wanted access to the footage. They have had to wait. It was convenient to list this separate application this afternoon and we commenced a little before 4 o’clock. The parties to the application are the news media organisations I have referred to, the accused, who is represented by Mr Dhanji SC on this application as well, and the accused’s mother, who is represented by Mr D Jordan SC.
	
	
	There are two collateral issues. One is the nature of the applications. It was not clear whether previous orders remained in force or not, but yesterday I made some interim orders. On one view, the news media organisations are applying to remove my interim order. On another view, Mr Dhanji and Mr Jordan’s clients are urging me to make an order. I do not want to spend time at this stage of the evening working that out. I do not think I need to. Secondly, I do not need to deal with the onus of proof.
	
	
	I should add that I have been significantly assisted by all counsel this afternoon in the submissions which they have made. These reasons will be relatively brief because of the hour of day.
	
	
	Mr Maltz commenced by reminding me of two important concepts. One is open justice and the other is necessity. He referred to open justice because s 6 of the relevant legislation - which is the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 - provides that when I am deciding whether to make a non-publication order I “must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice”. He emphasised necessity as the other concept because s 8 of the same Act provides that I “may make a non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds”; then each of the five specified grounds includes the adjective ""necessary”.
	
	
	The two relevant s 8 grounds in this case are in cl (a) - “the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice” and in cl (c) - “the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person”.
	
	
	The meaning of “necessary” in s 8 was canvassed in the Court of Appeal in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Limited v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 83 NSWLR 52. I have been directed by Mr Dhanji to passages [8] – [9] of the Chief Justice’s judgment and [45] and following of the judgment of Basten JA. I will not set out those passages but I have read them during the course of the day because Mr Dhanji made his written submissions available before today.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji says that the order is necessary on behalf of his client in order to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. Broadly speaking, one prejudice would be that the jury would be exposed to public and private comment on the CCTV were it to be released at this stage. The second prejudice is that his client’s mother may be prevented for related health reasons from being able to give evidence. He wants to call her.
	
	
	Mr Jordan’s case is that the order is necessary to protect the safety of his client, the accused’s mother. He focuses on her psychological health as well as her physical wellbeing. He relies on affidavit evidence from her of telephone threats as a result of publicity surrounding the arrest and charging of her son. The evidence suggests that the threats increase when the exposure of the issue in the press increases.
	
	
	Mr Maltz’s case is that the orders are not necessary to protect either of these interests. For reasons that will become apparent I am going to deal at this stage with Mr Dhanji’s issue about the prejudice to the proper administration of justice.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji points to the evidence of a psychologist whom his client’s mother saw. He said the very prospect this footage may be released provoked in her a reaction such that she attended him yesterday “in a regressed state, trembling, emotional and tearful having attended the second day of her son’s Court hearing.” On his examination - he is a clinical psychologist named Sam Borenstein - he found her “mood was severely depressed and she is extremely anxious.” He said -
	


“The prospect of CCTV footage of the incident involving her son becoming available to the media has added significantly to [her] psychological burden. In my opinion she is at risk of regressing into a Major Depressive Episode, which could require urgent psychiatric intervention, e.g. medication and possibly hospitalisation.”

Mr Dhanji’s important but simple point is that his client’s mother is to be a significant witness in his case. Were the publication of this material to render her incapacitated to give evidence then that would be a serious prejudice to his client and his client’s case and would therefore cause “prejudice to the proper administration of justice.”


	
	Mr Maltz pointed to the basis of the accused’s mother’s fear being speculation about the intent or intentions of those who made threatening telephone calls to her about her son. The fact of the telephone calls is not in dispute, but Mr Maltz argues the likelihood that real harm may result is no more than speculation.
	
	
	Moving to Mr Dhanji’s point about the impact on the jury, he supplemented his initial submissions by adopting an observation made by Mr Jordan. Mr Jordan - who has just come into the matter on this specific issue - told me he viewed the video for the first time last night. He described it as a remarkable and sensational video which, he submitted, would attract huge attention and be highly emotive. Mr Jordan contrasted the CCTV footage with other evidence produced by Mr Maltz on behalf of his clients showing that there is plenty of material on the internet identifying the accused. Mr Jordan says that there is nothing remotely close to the CCTV footage in that internet content. It is, he described it, unique. He submitted that a likely result is that it will further inflame those who were upset in the past by the report of the incident.
	
	
	Returning to Mr Dhanji, he picked up these observations of Mr Jordan and said that they brought a fresh perspective. He and I and the Crown Prosecutor have been involved in the trial for a few days and have viewed and talked about the video. Mr Dhanji adopted Mr Jordan’s observations that the video was short and repeatable and it is difficult to assess the level of attention it would receive. Indeed if it could be far greater attention than any other material in the case.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji’s point is that this case is unique. He returned to the Crown Prosecutor’s opening, pointing out the significance placed on the CCTV footage in proving his case. There is a sense in which, he argued, it is available to the Crown to suggest that the CCTV footage can be used to decide the whole case. He submitted that it will significantly increase the public discourse and argument on the nature of this kind of crime, on this very incident and especially on the alleged intent that is said by the prosecution to accompany the punch so graphically displayed on the footage. People from within jurors’ circle of friends and family will offer their views. There will be some discussion about it in the public arena. He says that the jury are already under enough pressure. That pressure would increase significantly if the media exposed the footage.
	
	
	There is another point which Mr Dhanji developed. Exposure of the CCTV footage, as I have said and I accept, will likely result in widespread public discussion and argument about this kind of crime, this incident and the intent said to accompany this incident. Those who know individual jurors, be they friends or family, may well know that the footage is said to illustrate itself the crime which the prosecution said was committed. As I observed, it may well be that jurors cannot avoid exposure to the footage being shown on the news and the discussion about it. The discussion may well involve those close to them offering their views about what the footage shows. Amongst those who offer views could well be people whose opinions individual jurors value highly. We cannot possibly know whether that will occur or not. Given that there are twelve jurors, and that I accept the prospect of widespread discussion, there is a very good chance at least some jurors will be exposed to the expression of those views and some of those views will come from respected sources.
	
	
	So not only will there be views and opinions other than those expressed in court being fed to jurors on a central piece of evidence said to incriminate the accused, but individual jurors might be apprehensive about the eventual publication of an acquittal, if indeed that is the decision which at the end of the day they reach. I have been emphasising to the jury the importance of deciding this case on what they see and hear within these four walls. I emphasised the evidence and only the evidence, the arguments from counsel and the directions from me, and that they are to ignore anything else. I have told them, as I usually do tell juries, that they are to tell their friends and families that they cannot discuss the case. This will be even harder if the CCTV footage is in the public domain. But, I repeat, there will be an added burden on any of those jurors who have received unsolicited opinions from respected sources. If they think that an acquittal is the appropriate verdict, then they will be quite apprehensive about facing those people again and that could influence their own contribution to the jury deliberations and even the verdict, in a prejudicial way.
	
	
	Mr Maltz correctly emphasised the importance of the principle of open justice. On the other hand, Mr Dhanji reminded me of what French CJ said in Hogan v Hinch (2011) 85 ALJR 398 at 406 [20] -
	


“An essential characteristic of courts is that they sit in public. That principle is a means to an end, and not an end in itself. Its rationale is the benefit that flows from subjecting court proceedings to public and professional scrutiny. It is also critical to the maintenance of public confidence in the courts.”

I have omitted references to authority. It is important to observe his Honour’s comment that it is a means to an end and not an end in itself. The legislation that I am dealing with, whilst elevating that principle, also qualifies it by the exceptions, an approach of which Mr Maltz reminded me. That is that the action I am being asked to take is an exception to the accepted principle. For the necessity test Mr Maltz argued, it is “not enough for it to be convenient, reasonable, sensible, serve some purpose, serve some purpose in the context of a balancing exercise. It actually has to be necessary….” It is, he said and I accept, not a “soft test”.


	
	Nevertheless, I am satisfied it is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice for me to make a non-publication order prohibiting the publication of exhibit A, until further order, for the following reasons.
	
	
	I am of the opinion Mr Dhanji has made out his case. That is, the health of his client’s mother and the unchallenged possibility that she may be rendered incapacitated as a result of the stress imposed by the prospect of publication, would interfere with his client’s case because he would not be able to call her to give evidence. That in turn would be prejudicial to the proper administration of justice in this case.
	
	
	The second reason is the likelihood, in my opinion, of the jury being exposed to public and private argument and discussion on a central issue in the trial. I regard that, for reasons that I have explained, as highly undesirable. There would be too many possible sources of influence on the jurors in this case on such a central issue. The sources would be both public and private. The fact that there are 12 individuals means that the potential exposure is even higher.
	
	
	In order for me to be sure that the potential of that public or private influence is not very significantly increased, I regard it as necessary to stop the publication of the CCTV footage in order to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice by the jurors being unduly influenced by public and private discussions.
	


HIS HONOUR: Gentlemen, I have formulated - I did just then during the reasons a moment ago - an order, and I just want to be sure that - well, two things. One is that the order will be effective so far as Mr Dhanji and Mr Jordan, your clients, are concerned; that I’ve identified the right thing. Secondly, I want, for Mr Maltz’s clients, to have some clarity about when this matter will be revisited and by that I have in mind we should revisit it soon after the verdict and I would hear you again, Mr Jordan, or whoever is available for your client and that we agitate it again.

DHANJI: Your Honour, if there’s a clear point at which it’s going to be re-agitated there ought not to be any difficulty with the form of the order. I’m looking at s 12(3). For abundant caution your Honour ought to just indicate that it’s to operate until such time as the jury returns its verdict and that would be a sufficient specified future event.

HIS HONOUR: I thought of that but then I thought, well, I suppose they still have to get access to it. I mean, what they don’t want is somebody else to have it somewhere and as soon as the verdict comes it’s published. I mean, we’re assuming that the only source is exhibit A, perhaps I’m right, perhaps it is the only source.

DHANJI: Perhaps there ought to be a period after the verdict to allow the further ventilation of the issues and so your Honour could perhaps--

HIS HONOUR: Two working days?

DHANJI: I was just saying to my friend, 48 hours after the verdict.

HIS HONOUR: If you get a verdict on a Friday - two working days?

DHANJI: Yes, two working days is far better. The other thing is, your Honour is required to indicate the place in which the order applies pursuant to s 11 and we would ask that the order apply throughout the Commonwealth because if it’s published on an Internet site in another place, it will be accessible.

DHANJI: Potentially.

HIS HONOUR: Throughout the Commonwealth, and two working days after the verdict. Anything else? And the order should just be regarding exhibit A?

DHANJI: Exhibit A, yes. I think we initially included the jury folder, exhibit B.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. My associate reminds me one of the applications specified stills images from the thing. Mr Maltz, I don’t know whether it was one of your clients or not but one of the applications indicated that.

DHANJI: We would include exhibit B, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, so order prohibiting publication of exhibit A and exhibit B for two working days throughout the Commonwealth. Mr Jordan, do you have anything to say about that?

JORDAN: No, not about that, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I’ll come back to you. Mr Maltz, the form of the order?

MALTZ: My only observation is that the order shouldn’t operate for 48 hours until after the verdict is returned. The justification for the order, which I don’t cavil with, is the jury. The order should persist until some much more modest period after the verdict is delivered, perhaps two hours. Once the verdict is delivered if somebody - this can be anticipated of course. If there’s a concern at that point and someone actually wants the order to continue, at that point an application can be made for an interim extension. It might be two days, it might be longer, it might be shorter. One doesn’t know.

HIS HONOUR: I can understand that your clients have a sense of urgency and deadlines that we don’t appreciate and that perhaps 48 hours or two working days is what judges in the commercial division might describe as a fairly relaxed timetable.

MALTZ: The people concerned know this is coming, they’re there, they can tell the Court whether they want an interim extension or whether--

HIS HONOUR: I’ll get back to Mr Jordan on that. Anything else? Throughout the Commonwealth?

MALTZ: I have nothing to say about that.

HIS HONOUR: And exhibits A and B.

MALTZ: We understand the images are stills.

HIS HONOUR: Have you seen exhibit B?

MALTZ: I haven’t seen exhibit B.

HIS HONOUR: Show exhibit B to Mr Maltz. Mr Jordan, Mr Maltz says two hours.

JORDAN: With respect to Mr Maltz, he’s putting that on a premise that everybody is involved in the trial and knows what’s going on and will be here in any event. It’s simply not the case. I have no involvement in the trial. I’ve come in for a specific purpose and a very limited purpose, and whether or not I am to be engaged to pursue it is a matter for my client. Whether it’s me or somebody else, it is not the case that there will be somebody sitting in court ready to go, and I don’t think it will be fair to my client that she be placed in a position where she needs to engage somebody. Maybe there’s room for some compromise there. Two hours is pretty unrealistic.

HIS HONOUR: So we’re looking at between two and 48, Mr Maltz. Were you going to say something then?

MALTZ: May I show exhibit B to my instructing solicitor?

HIS HONOUR: That’s okay with me. Is it with both of you? Yes, good, have a look at it. Mr Maltz, Mr Jordan says - I mean his client is under enough stress as it is - she shouldn’t have the added obligation of having to get hold of someone to represent her at two hours’ notice.

MALTZ: Yes, your Honour, but I have a very clear narrow point to make and that is the justification does not extend past the jury verdict, it does not. There is nothing in the judgment--

HIS HONOUR: At this stage which I have determined you are right, because I should have added in my reasons that I will formally do so now.


	
	I do not propose to determine Mr Jordan’s application based upon the safety of his client because determining Mr Dhanji’s application for the time being is sufficient. I make that observation because of the urgency of this matter and the time at which it is being determined.
	


JORDAN: That was why I rose earlier just to - that was my understanding that I wanted to confirm it and it is now clear.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, it’s now a part of the reasons.

MALTZ: So any attempts to extend it past the jury verdict.

HIS HONOUR: Compromising the principle.

MALTZ: Nothing has been decided today which propels the decision past the jury verdict. So this will be a completely fresh, independent, unrelated, unconnected application post the jury verdict, because it will be based on completely different grounds to that which propel the judgment to--

HIS HONOUR: You are right about all that but we’ve also got human beings involved in the case and Mr Jordan’s client is the mother of the accused and, yes, you’ve got on the other hand the interests in open justice, and I do take that seriously. But we’ve got to find a compromise somewhere. You are right as a matter of principle, there should be a minimal delay. I think two working days is too much. You see, they could bring in a verdict at 6 o'clock on a Friday night, that’s the problem, and your clients may well reasonably want to publish it that night or the next day.

MALTZ: On your Honour’s reasoning, there’s nothing in your Honour’s reasoning which denies that if somebody wants to bring a fresh application--

HIS HONOUR: Then they need to do it with some promptness.

MALTZ: --we don’t need to be there.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Jordan, I see the force of that. Mr Maltz says look my reasoning to make the order so far keeps you safe till the verdict, and really 48 hours is just not justified. You need to have something in place. His point is look, you by the sounds of it - and we know that because you’ve been here making the application so it’s not quite not agitated at all. It has been agitated this afternoon, so you’ve been here arguing it. But it is a fresh - it’s not a fresh application, I suppose. It’s an application which needs to be further agitated, but I think there needs to be more of a tightness in the time.

JORDAN: As I said or intimated earlier your Honour, I’m reasonably comfortable with the proposition that it need not be two working days.

HIS HONOUR: What is your submission?

JORDAN: It would be a reasonable balance struck if it was just the one working day and the difficulty is your Honour, if for example a verdict was brought in on a Friday--

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, I just interrupt you there, Mr Jordan, your client and Mr Dhanji’s client are related, even if we assume that your client is not in court at the verdict and that obviously would be extraordinary but she may well be incapacitated, we don’t know. Let’s assume that she’s not there to take it and is otherwise preoccupied. Your client is her son so that he would need to alert someone. He has solicitors and senior counsel acting for him so that it could well be that some arrangement could be made between the solicitors for some agency arrangement whereby the solicitors for Mr Dhanji’s client, Mr Gibson could--

JORDAN: Your Honour, to be fair they are the same solicitors.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you for reminding me.

JORDAN: No problem at all. Your Honour, I don’t really think I can say anything more about it. I’ve made the point and I’ve taken it as far as I can.

HIS HONOUR: The order which I make is an order prohibiting the publication of exhibits A and--

MALTZ: My instructions are that these are stills of the video, they don’t convey the dynamic concerns that were agitated today about--

HIS HONOUR: See your point, but I’m going to order non-publication of the stills of the incident. I will not make it blanket exhibit B, I will limit it to and I’d ask Mr Dhanji just to identify the photographs which show the action.

MALTZ: And they ask for a related order that the media is to be given access to the permitted the stills.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I’ll do that. There’s no reason I shouldn’t do that, Mr Dhanji?

DHANJI: I would submit your Honour, behind the first tab pp 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, behind the next tab pages - sorry, photographs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26.

HIS HONOUR: Do you want to be heard on that?

MALTZ: I’ll leave it in your Honour’s hands.

HIS HONOUR: I will give them access to all the exhibits so far. There is the police photograph marked 21 by Mr Sweeney, that was the bike, and photograph 20 marked by Mr Bocos.

HIS HONOUR: Let me make the orders and then if you take exception to them I will revise them.


	
	I make a non-publication order prohibiting the publication of exhibit A in these proceedings and prohibiting the publication of the following items in exhibit B: behind the first tab coloured yellow, photographs 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28; and behind the second tab coloured orange, photographs 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26. That order applies anywhere in the Commonwealth of Australia and it operates until two hours has elapsed from the delivery of verdicts in this trial.
	


HIS HONOUR: Everyone will have to be on their toes if there is a hung jury, but that is another thing and when I say, on their toes, just aware of what is happening. Do you want those numbers again? First tab 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and the second tab 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.


	
	I make an order granting access to any media organisations to the balance of exhibit B to exhibits C, D, 1 and 2 and exhibits E and F, which are the two interviews.
	


MALTZ: The one last thing is--

HIS HONOUR: My associate will type this order out, I’ll sign it and she’ll make it available to all of you.

MALTZ: One last order that would mean that there is no need for my side to come to court in the event that there’s no--

HIS HONOUR: What’s the form of the order?

MALTZ: The form of the order is that in the event that the non-publication order lapses, that the media be given access to exhibits A, B and 4.


	
	In the event the non-publication order lapses because two hours has expired since the delivery of verdicts without any further order, I grant access to any media organisation to exhibit A and to those items in exhibit B which were the subject of the non-publication order.
	


DHANJI: I apologise, can I just ask, assuming your Honour has so found, would your Honour indicate that your Honour regards it as necessary for achieving the purpose for which the order has been made, that it apply outside New South Wales s 11(3).

HIS HONOUR: I’ve looked at that and I add this to my reasons for judgment, not the order.


	
	I am satisfied by Mr Dhanji’s submission that I should make the order apply anywhere in the Commonwealth of Australia. The reason is that I accept his submission that if published in other parts of the Commonwealth it is likely to become available on the internet and therefore widely accessible within New South Wales. That would defeat the order. It is therefore necessary for achieving the purpose for which I made the order, for the prohibition to extend to anywhere in the Commonwealth.
	


DHANJI: Finally, if the record could show in respect to any of your Honour’s determinations and the matter in which your Honour has done and particular in determining Mr Jordan’s application to finality that it is now 7.15.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you very much you are quite right, it is now 7.15, in fact it is 7.18. One other question, my reasons.


	
	I direct that my reasons be transcribed and made available to me.
	


HIS HONOUR: Does anyone need them sooner rather than later? They’ll come to me in a week or so. I don’t know, it’s part of the trial, we’re getting a daily. So it will probably be emailed to me tomorrow when I’m interstate and I’ll revise them over the weekend and early part of next week.

MALTZ: I’m not instructed to press for anything else.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else?

DHANJI: No, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s an occupational hazard for my associate to some extent, as it is for the other court staff, but we had a Sheriff’s officer here for some time. The Court officer has been here for nearly three and a half hours beyond the time he would expect to be here. There is a monitor listening to these proceedings who is well beyond the time he or she expected to be on duty. I don’t know what inconvenience I have caused to those people. But it has been important to determine this issue so far as the administration of justice is concerned. I am very grateful for the fact they have remained without choice but on duty and enabled me to complete this task. I will now adjourn.

2767921,R v Archer [2015] NSWSC 1487,"Judgment


	
	On 21 September 2014 Anne Marie Pearson lost her life in a savage attack upon her by the offender, Wayne Edward Archer. On the same day, and in a related incident, Natasha Mason was seriously wounded by him.
	
	
	The offender entered pleas of guilty to each of those crimes, and to a related summary offence, and he appears before the Court to be sentenced
	
	
	The offence of murder is one contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900; it carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. A standard non-parole period (“NPP”) of 20 years imprisonment is specified by the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the CSPA”).
	
	
	Wounding with Intent to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. A standard NPP also applies to that offence, and is fixed at 7 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender additionally stands for sentence in relation to an offence of Contravening an Apprehended Violence Order, contrary to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. Such an offence, before this Court to be dealt with pursuant to s 167(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, carries a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment, or a monetary penalty represented by 50 penalty units, or both.
	
	
	The maximum penalties and the relevant standard NPPs operate as legislative guideposts that inform the exercise of the Court’s sentencing discretion: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The other features to which the Court must have regard when determining the sentences to be imposed are the objective gravity of the crimes, the personal circumstances of the offender, and the relevant principles of sentencing.
	
	
	The offences of which the offender has been convicted are very serious, but where on the continuum of gravity the individual offences may fall is dictated by the facts of the particular crime and the offender’s moral culpability.
	


Agreed Facts of the Offences


	
	Tendered to the Court as Exhibit A on sentence was a Statement of Agreed Facts, signed by both the Crown Prosecutor and the offender. I have found the facts of the offender’s crimes in accordance with that evidence, which I accept beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	During the course of 2010, Anne Marie Pearson was living at an address in Stevenson Street at Taree and working in the bar of the Exchange Hotel in the town.
	
	
	Ms Pearson was a close friend of Natasha Mason, who also lived in the Taree area. The two women had known each other for a number of years, and they had shared accommodation from time to time.
	
	
	The offender was also a resident of the Taree area. He was working in the abattoirs in Wingham at this time, employment he had had for some time.
	
	
	In 2010 a long term relationship in which the offender had been involved ended.
	
	
	The offender was a patron of the Exchange Hotel and he met Ms Pearson there. The two became friends and, after some time, a more intimate relationship developed. In the first couple of years of that relationship both appeared contented and happy to friends.
	
	
	In the middle of 2013 the offender left his job at the Wingham abattoirs and moved to Tamworth to work in the abattoir there. Ms Pearson initially accompanied the offender and lived with him in Tamworth, but returned to Taree after some months. She moved back to her Stevenson Street residence. Ms Mason shared the Stevenson Street house with her.
	
	
	Ms Pearson told her friend that she had missed her children when in Tamworth, and also that the offender had been secretly gambling his income there. She told Ms Mason that he had lied to her about his gambling, and also seemed to become jealous and controlling in his behavior towards her.
	
	
	The offender remained in Tamworth to work but he came to Taree each weekend to see Ms Pearson. The couple began to argue over the offender’s gambling. Each was drinking more. The offender was seen to become jealous and possessive of Ms Pearson, and physically aggressive towards her.
	
	
	Ms Pearson endeavored to deal with the offender’s behaviour herself. She did not involve the police.
	
	
	On 19 March 2014, while living in Tamworth, the offender engaged in an act of self-harm at a time when he had been drinking. He cut his chest with a knife when in a public park and was taken by ambulance to Tamworth Hospital where he was treated overnight for superficial injuries. Hospital Notes record the offender as saying that “it all got too much.” He was living in a hotel, gambling excessively, drinking alcohol, and not paying his rent. He was also concerned about his 19 year old son who had lost his apprenticeships and his employment.
	
	
	The offender was discharged from hospital the day after his admission. He was to see a psychiatrist a week later but did not attend the appointment. He declined a voluntary admission to the Banksia Mental Health Unit.
	
	
	On 4 April 2014 the offender made an apparent suicide attempt in Tamworth by trying to hang himself. He was reported to have lost consciousness and the attempt was regarded as near-lethal. He was left with strangulation marks around his neck that were noted on admission to hospital.
	
	
	Hospital notes record that the offender referred to having had an argument with his partner, and having gambled the whole of his fortnightly salary. He reported an ongoing depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, a lack of enjoyment of life, and poor sleep over some months.
	
	
	The offender was transferred from the emergency department at Tamworth Hospital to the Banksia Mental Health Unit, where he remained until he was discharged on 9 April 2014. He was visited by Ms Pearson and Ms Mason the day after the suicide attempt.
	
	
	The offender started on the anti-depressant Escitalopram (Lexapro) at a daily dosage of 10 milligrams. His principal diagnosis on presentation was recorded as mild to moderate depression, secondary to pathological gambling, alcohol abuse, financial, and relationship problems.
	
	
	In May 2014 the offender moved back to Taree from Tamworth, moving in with Ms Pearson and Ms Mason. He told a friend that he had lost his job in Tamworth after a run in with the manager. His friend observed that the offender, always a physically fit man, appeared to have lost weight.
	
	
	After a period looking for work the offender secured employment at the abattoir in Wingham, although in a different capacity to that of his previous employment there. He was drinking more than he previously had.
	
	
	Friends reported seeing arguments between the offender and Ms Pearson after the offender returned to Taree, and Ms Pearson’s neighbours heard arguments between them, which seemed to escalate in seriousness. The offender was warned by some about his behaviour towards Ms Pearson.
	
	
	Ms Pearson was concerned by the offender’s gambling, drinking, and his behaviour towards her when he was drinking. The relationship between the two deteriorated, and Ms Pearson ended it. The offender moved from their shared bedroom to the front bedroom of the Stevenson Street house. Ms Pearson did not force the offender to move out of the house altogether because she was worried that he would have nowhere to go.
	
	
	On 21 June 2014 the offender was charged by police after he assaulted both Ms Pearson and a man who came to her assistance.
	
	
	The offender and Ms Pearson had been together at the Manning River Hotel at Taree. Although the evidence of what happened there is scant, in a signed statement to police Ms Pearson said that the offender grabbed her and pushed her into a door. The incident was apparently recorded on security cameras operating in the hotel. An employee of the hotel who tried to help Ms Pearson was also assaulted by the offender. The offender left the hotel.
	
	
	Ms Pearson told police who attended the hotel that she had no fears of the offender when he was sober, but that he became aggressive and assaulted her if he was intoxicated, or losing heavily at gambling. She suggested that the offender was probably at her house and investigating police located him there that night. The arresting officer noted the offender’s high level of intoxication.
	
	
	In addition to the two counts of assault the offender was also charged with an offence of driving under the influence of alcohol.
	
	
	After being charged by police and released on bail, the offender returned to Ms Pearson’s house in the early hours of the following morning, but he was not allowed to enter.
	
	
	On 6 and 7 September 2014 there were further arguments between the offender and Ms Pearson and episodes of violence. The offender visited a friend that weekend. He was intoxicated. He told his friend about having assaulted Ms Pearson and a hotel employee in June at the Manning River Hotel. He said that he had hit Ms Pearson and a man who tried to assist her.
	
	
	The charges against the offender relevant to the June assaults were mentioned in the Taree Local Court on 12 September 2014. Final Orders were made that day subjecting the offender to an Apprehended Violence Order for two years for Ms Pearson’s protection. It contained the statutory orders mandated by s 36 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, together with an additional order prohibiting the offender from approaching Ms Pearson or her home within 12 hours of consuming alcohol.
	
	
	The three criminal charges were adjourned until 4 November 2014. The offender’s bail was continued, and he remained at conditional liberty.
	
	
	Some days later, on 18 September 2014, the offender was out jogging when a friend saw him and stopped to speak to him. The offender told his friend, ""I've just had enough.”
	
	
	On 20 September 2014 the offender and Ms Pearson attended a football grand final. After the match, they went on to the Royal Hotel at Kew. Staff of the hotel saw the pair at the hotel at around 5pm. Ms Pearson was noted to be moderately affected by alcohol. They bought a carton of beer and left the hotel at 5.45pm.
	
	
	The following day Ms Pearson and the offender went to the home of Wayne Whittaker for a barbeque. They arrived together there at about 10am.
	
	
	The offender was drinking during the two or so hours he and Ms Pearson spent at the barbeque.
	
	
	On leaving the lunch the offender and Ms Pearson went to the Laurieton Hotel with some other friends. Ms Mason was one of the party, as was Mr Whittaker and Ben Whittaker. The group spent about an hour at the Laurieton Hotel, before moving on to the Royal Hotel at Kew, where they spent about another hour.
	
	
	Both the offender and Ms Pearson were drinking beer during this time. The offender was placing bets through a TAB.
	
	
	Whilst at the Royal Hotel the offender telephoned his friend, Gay Finlayson. Ms Finlayson could tell that the offender had been drinking, and he himself told her that he was “pissed”.
	
	
	At around 2.30pm the group drove back to Mr Whittaker's house. There was some dispute between Ben Whittaker and the offender, with Mr. Whittaker unsuccessfully trying to provoke the offender to fight him.
	
	
	A neighbour spoke to Ms Pearson at around 4 o’clock that afternoon after her return home. Ms Pearson was speaking from the bedroom window of her house. They discussed the neighbour’s dogs briefly. Ms Pearson was observed to slur her words as if she had been drinking. She seemed cheerful and relaxed.
	
	
	The offender fell asleep at a table inside the Stevenson Street house. Ms Mason thought he was ""really drunk"". Ms Pearson suggested he go and lie down. The offender went into his bedroom.
	
	
	He could be heard apparently making telephone calls.
	
	
	Telephone records establish that the offender made a number of calls that afternoon and evening to Ms Finlayson. Seven calls were placed between 1.50pm and 6.45pm that day from the offender’s mobile telephone, as follows:
	


1:50 - 12 seconds;

1:50 - 39 seconds;

5:21 - 37 seconds;

6:27 - 172 seconds;

6:34 - 185 seconds;

6:41 - 20 seconds;

6:43 - unsuccessful attempt to call; and

6:45 - 328 seconds (and concluding at 6.51 that evening).


	
	In the evening calls, Ms Mason heard the offender saying things like, ""I love you, I miss you."" Ms Pearson asked him who he was calling and the offender responded with his son’s name.
	
	
	Ms Mason saw Ms Pearson go into the offender’s bedroom, returning soon afterwards to the lounge room with the offender’s mobile telephone. Ms Pearson put the handset on loudspeaker so that Ms Mason could hear the call and rang the last number called. The number was that of Ms Finlayson, and Ms Pearson spoke to her briefly. That was likely to be the call placed at 6.41pm.
	
	
	On the other end of the call, Ms Finlayson could hear the offender calling out in the background asking who Ms Pearson was ringing.
	
	
	Ms Mason heard Ms Pearson tell the offender, whilst still on the call to Ms Finlayson, ""Tell her what you're really like, tell her you stole money off me"". Ms Finlayson ended the call.
	
	
	Ms Pearson went into the offender’s bedroom. Ms Mason did not see what happened in the bedroom and there is no satisfactory evidence of what occurred there between the offender and Ms Pearson.
	
	
	Ms Pearson emerged soon after from the bedroom and sat down in a reclining chair in the lounge room. The chair was adjacent to the entrance to the kitchen.
	
	
	The offender also came out of the bedroom. He went directly to the kitchen and took up a white handled boning knife. He held it in his right hand.
	
	
	He approached Ms Pearson where she sat in the recliner. Ms Mason, who was also in the lounge room, saw him appear to punch Ms Pearson with his left hand to the right side of Ms Pearson’s chest. His hand thereafter remained in position, forcing the reclining chair backwards and keeping Ms Pearson in it.
	
	
	The offender next appeared to punch Ms Pearson with his right hand, directing the blow or blows into the left side of her chest.
	
	
	Ms Mason got up and tried to stop the offender. She then saw that he was holding a white handled knife. She moved to try to pull the offender away from Ms Pearson. Ms Mason saw blood and also noticed that the offender was naked from the waist downwards.
	
	
	The offender stabbed the knife at Ms Pearson’s chest and neck a number of times. She raised her hands above her head in an attempt to ward off the blows, receiving defensive injuries to her right hand.
	
	
	Ms Mason went out to the front of the house to get help from neighbours. She was trying to ring for help using her mobile telephone at the same time. The offender followed her, demanding to know whom she was calling. She told him no one, but he said she was lying.
	
	
	The offender struck out at Ms Mason with the knife in a backhanded motion, stabbing her in the upper abdomen on the left side of her body. This caused a laceration some eight centimetres in length which immediately began to bleed.
	
	
	Ms Mason fled across the road. The offender stood watching her briefly, before returning to the house. He went in and slammed the door.
	
	
	Ms Mason could not get into a neighbouring house for refuge so she rang Triple 0 from the verandah of the house. The call was logged at 6.52pm and lasted for 10 minutes and 52 seconds.
	
	
	As she spoke to the emergency operator Ms Mason heard the front door of her house open, followed by the sound of footsteps. She could hear the offender, who had emerged from the house, mumbling something like, ""Where is the fucking bitch?""
	
	
	Ms Mason hid on the verandah, whispering to the emergency operator. The offender went back to the house, again slamming the door behind him.
	
	
	At 6:56 that evening, telephone records establish that another call was placed by the offender to Ms Finlayson. It lasted for 91 seconds.
	
	
	Emergency authorities alerted by Ms Mason’s call for help arrived in the street soon after, by about 7pm. Ms Mason was conveyed by ambulance to Manning Base Hospital. She was found to have an eight centimetre oblique wound to the left upper quadrant of her abdomen which extended some five centimetres laterally. The wound was actively bleeding. She underwent surgery that evening where the wound was explored and cleaned. The wound had not penetrated into the peritoneum. There was blood loss of approximately 500ml in theatre. The wound was sutured following the evacuation of a large haematoma in the abdominal wall.
	
	
	Ms Mason was discharged on the 22nd of September 2014 in a satisfactory condition. Her physical injuries were described as “moderate”, the other choices available to the relevant doctor being “mild” and “severe”.
	
	
	In Stevenson Street, after Ms Mason was removed from the area, police officers forced the front door of Ms Pearson’s house and arrested the offender. He was recorded as saying, ""I fucked up, sorry.""
	
	
	The officers saw an obviously wounded Ms Pearson sitting in the recliner chair in the lounge room. The offender told them that she was dead. This was confirmed by an ambulance officer, who examined her.
	
	
	The police officer who arrested the offender saw a white handled knife tangled in Ms Pearson’s hair, across her left shoulder.
	
	
	This knife has been scientifically examined and the DNA of both Ms Pearson and Ms Mason was located on it. This establishes that, after initially stabbing Ms Pearson, and pursuing and stabbing Ms Mason, the offender returned to Ms Pearson. Whatever he did at that time, something not established on the evidence, left the knife entangled in her hair.
	
	
	A brief interview with the offender was conducted by police at the scene and recorded on a mobile telephone. He was told that he was under arrest for the assault on Ms Mason and in relation to the death of the woman in the house. He denied killing Ms Pearson.
	
	
	The offender was taken to the local police station where he was entered into custody at 7.53pm. He was given an opportunity to speak to a legal representative and did so.
	
	
	At about 2 o’clock the next morning the offender was interviewed. On the advice of his lawyer he refused to answer questions, although he denied that there had been an argument between he and Ms Pearson about a phone call to ""Gai.""
	
	
	He referred to his suicide attempt in April 2014, and noted that he had cut his throat and stabbed himself previously. He said that on the day of the offences he felt as he had when he had attempted suicide. He said that he felt like he wanted to hurt himself because he and the deceased were not going right.
	
	
	By reference to a scale of one to ten the offender estimated his level of intoxication at the time of the offences as “about a 5 out of 10”.
	
	
	On arrest and at the police station the offender was noted to have some facial injuries. There was swelling and a cut in the area of his right eye, some swelling to his right cheek, and what appeared to be blood around the bridge of his nose.
	
	
	In the interview the offender was asked about his injuries but he declined to say anything about them. Photographs of the injuries were taken by police and form part of the evidence before the Court on sentence.
	
	
	The body of Ms Pearson was removed from the Stevenson Street house.
	
	
	A post mortem examination was conducted on 24 September 2014. The forensic pathologist who examined Ms Pearson’s body, Dr Jane Vuletic, concluded that Ms Pearson had died from blood loss from a deep stab wound to the left side of the front of the chest. The wound had penetrated the chest wall, the lung, and the pericardial sac, and had transected part of the aorta. This injury was such that Ms Pearson could not have survived it, and death would have occurred within minutes of its infliction.
	
	
	Dr Vuletic observed other significant injuries during the post mortem.
	
	
	There were a number of incised wounds to the deceased’s right hand that were consistent with defence wounds.
	
	
	There was a severe injury on the right side of the scalp in the parietal area which extended over 14.5 centimetres in length to the right angle of the mouth, entering into subcutaneous fat and muscle. The wound was so severe that the right frontal bone was exposed. The wound continued on from the right angle of the mouth to the right side of the chin for a further 4.5 centimetres.
	
	
	An incised wound was present extending 12 centimetres from the base of the neck to the tip of the left shoulder.
	
	
	An L-shaped wound on the right upper front of the chest had penetrated the major muscle in that area. A smaller wound was noted in the middle of the front of the chest which entered through the chest wall and continued into the intercostal space near the sternum.
	
	
	Two less serious wounds were noted on the chest.
	
	
	There were some areas of bruising and abrasion to the right leg and foot.
	
	
	The wounds were both incised wounds and stab wounds, and were consistent with having been inflicted by the boning knife the offender had taken up in the kitchen.
	
	
	Toxicology results recorded a blood alcohol level in Ms Pearson’s blood of 0.232 g/100ml.
	
	
	The offender was charged on 22 September 2014. He entered pleas of guilty to the charges against him before the Taree Local Court on 16 June 2015 and was committed to this Court for sentence. He adhered to his pleas on 7 August 2015.
	
	
	At the time of her death Ms Pearson was aged 49 years. Ms Mason was 39 years old when the offender attacked her.
	


The Objective Gravity of the Offences


	
	In determining the sentences to be passed on the offender for his crimes the Court is obliged to make an assessment of the objective gravity of the offences. At [354] of R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 it was noted that,
	


“Each crime […] has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category.”


	
	The murder of Ms Pearson was a barbarously savage crime marked by the severity of the injuries inflicted upon her. The facial wound in particular is demonstrative of what must have been a ferocious and particularly violent attack.
	
	
	It is not possible to determine what led to the commission of this terrible crime.
	
	
	Plainly, there was a degree of disharmony between Ms Pearson and the offender that had its origins in the offender’s gambling and abuse of alcohol. That pervasive unhappiness between them seems to have been exacerbated immediately before the offender went into the kitchen to take up a knife by whatever occurred in the bedroom. What occurred in the bedroom is not established on the credible evidence.
	
	
	Ms Mason did not see or hear what occurred there. The offender in his interview with police denied that there had been an argument connected with Ms Finlayson but said nothing else about what had occurred. To Dr Olav Nielssen in April 2015 the offender asserted that Ms Pearson had grabbed his mobile telephone and “slammed” it in his face (p.3, Ex. 1). To a forensic psychologist, Anna Robilliard, the offender gave a slightly different account in July 2015, claiming that Ms Pearson “threw the phone at him” and it struck him in the face (p.8, Ex. 2).
	
	
	The objective evidence is that the offender had an injury to his face when arrested by police. He had not had that injury when he went into his bedroom to lie down after returning from the social events. There is no evidence that Ms Mason observed the injury at any stage, although it is possible that she simply failed to notice it because of the terrible events that unfolded after the offender followed Ms Pearson from the bedroom.
	
	
	It may be, as the offender asserts in his unsworn and untested statements to forensic practitioners, that Ms Pearson struck him with his mobile telephone, but the credible evidence does not establish that, even on the balance of probabilities. I am unable to accept the offender’s belated and self-serving hearsay assertion to a doctor as credible evidence.
	
	
	It is reasonable to conclude that there was an unpleasant exchange between Ms Pearson and the offender after Ms Pearson went into the offender’s bedroom to confront him about the telephone calls that he had been making. That she was upset and angry with the offender is readily suggested by her comment during the telephone call to Ms Finlayson about money having been stolen. I am unable to accept however that, as the offender submits, Ms Pearson assaulted him, and he was thus provoked by her conduct to the violence that followed.
	
	
	Even had I concluded that Ms Pearson had assaulted the offender in some way with a mobile phone, that act of relatively low level violence could never serve as some sort of answer for the barbarity that followed.
	
	
	Having rejected the offender’s hearsay account, I do accept that the offence was not planned, but occurred as a spontaneous eruption of vicious rage.
	
	
	After the angry exchange in the bedroom, Ms Pearson walked away from the offender and sat down in the lounge room with Ms Mason. The offender, who was probably intoxicated to at least some extent, and enraged, went to the kitchen and deliberately armed himself with a particularly lethal weapon, a boning knife. It is of some significance that he did not simply pursue Ms Pearson and strike her; he went first to the kitchen and selected a boning knife to take up and confront Ms Pearson with. This is purposeful behavior.
	
	
	Whilst the use of a weapon is a feature in many murders, it is not an inherent feature of such a crime, and aggravates the offence to some small degree.
	
	
	The use of the weapon is of greater significance however when considering the offender’s intention in attacking Ms Pearson as he did, and in assessing the degree of violence that the attack involved.
	
	
	The offender chose to take up a knife. What then followed was a particularly brutal attack with the offender striking repeatedly at Ms Pearson with the knife as she sat, in effect trapped, in the recliner chair. The level of violence used against Ms Pearson was considerable and the injuries inflicted terrible as well as fatal.
	
	
	The determination and force with which Ms Pearson was attacked, together with the repeated blows struck, dictate a finding that the offender acted with an intention to kill. Killing with that intention is ordinarily, although not definitively, regarded as more serious than killing without such an intention: Tran, Hoai Vinh v R [2011] NSWCCA 116 at [39]; Aytugrul v R [2015] NSWCCA 139 at [23]. In this matter, the intention to kill operates in the ordinary way, and makes the crime more serious.
	
	
	The offender’s vicious assault was made against a woman who was particularly vulnerable at the time. Ms Pearson’s level of intoxication, which the offender must have been aware of, would have compromised her ability to effectively respond to the attack upon her. She was seated in a chair at a lower level than that of the offender when he attacked, and was trapped by him in the chair without means of retreat. She was physically of lesser strength and stature than the offender, who was a large and physically fit man. Although not relevant in the context of a feature of aggravation as provided by the CSPA, these are factual matters which heighten the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The defensive injuries that Ms Pearson sustained indicate that she struggled against the offender’s onslaught upon her to the extent that she could. She must have known that she was fighting for her life and been terrified. Her last moments were spent in fear and pain.
	
	
	All of this occurred in Ms Pearson’s home, a place where she was entitled to be safe, and at the hands of someone she loved and should have been able to trust.
	
	
	The breach of trust is absolute.
	
	
	A final feature of the offence that heightens its gravity is the fact that the offender murdered Ms Pearson when he was subject to conditional liberty, being on bail for the earlier assault upon her together with the related offences, and when subject to a court order which restrained his conduct towards Ms Pearson. This is a matter of serious aggravation: Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145; Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81.
	
	
	The murder of Ms Pearson was a very grave example of such a crime.
	
	
	The breach of the apprehended violence order – the breach being the offender’s presence in the house with Ms Pearson a short time after having drunk alcohol to intoxication - is also a very grave example of a crime of this nature.
	
	
	Orders such as this are made by courts to regulate the conduct of persons who pose a risk to others. If the orders of a court are ignored, the court’s authority is undermined and the rule of law is compromised. Those intended to be protected are left without that protection.
	
	
	Whilst the breach here is made out by the offender’s presence in Ms Pearson’s home in an intoxicated state, rather than by the violence that led to her death, it is nevertheless very serious. That is so because of the flagrant disregard of the court’s order, and because of the breach of the precise condition crafted by the court to provide protection to Ms Pearson in the most particularly dangerous of times, that is, when the offender was drinking.
	
	
	Ms Pearson herself had expressed tragically prophetic fear of what the offender may do when he was drunk or gambling in June 2015. Had the offender obeyed the court’s order, her fears would not have been realized in this terrible way.
	
	
	The wounding of Ms Mason is also a serious offence.
	
	
	It too was largely spontaneous, although the offender pursued Ms Mason, and attacked her in the context of his recognition that she was telephoning for help. This also was purposeful conduct rather than a product of a lack of control. The only threat posed by Ms Mason to the offender was that she would secure help for Ms Pearson by the intervention of the authorities. He acted to counteract that threat. This heightens the objective gravity of the crime in my view.
	
	
	The wound inflicted by the offender, in the course of endeavoring to prevent Ms Mason from summonsing help, was a very serious one, particularly in the context of what is required for proof of that element of the offence.
	
	
	A wound is established upon proof of a breach of the sub-cutaneous or interior layer of the skin: R v Smith (1837) 8 Carrington & Payne 173. A laceration of no great severity is a “wound” for the purposes of a s 33 offence. In R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 351 for example, it was held that a “split lip” from a punch to the mouth is a wound, albeit one of a technical nature. See Osborne v R [2015] NSWCCA 257.
	
	
	Fortunately, although serious, the physical injury Ms Mason sustained in this terrifying episode was readily capable of surgical repair and there is no evidence of ongoing or permanent disability.
	
	
	The consequences of the offender’s crimes are grave.
	
	
	Murder is regarded as such a serious offence because of the loss of the life of a member of the community.
	
	
	The Court heard and read victim impact statements from Ms Pearson’s sister, and from her daughter and son (Ex. F). Each provides direct and very personal and moving evidence of the harm done to the community when one of its members is murdered. This harm is the reason that the offence of murder is regarded with such abhorrence by the community. Children have lost a parent; grandchildren a grandparent; siblings have lost a sister; parents have lost a child; friends have lost a friend. We, as a community, have all lost something precious.
	
	
	Ms Mason also provided the Court with a victim impact statement, which was read by her close friend. It too is a deeply moving account of the pain and grief that the offender’s crimes have caused.
	
	
	Ms Mason experienced the horror of seeing her friend fatally attacked, and the fear and pain of the offender’s assault upon her.
	
	
	I am sure that those who have most directly suffered from these terrible offences understand that no sentence that this Court can impose can make good the loss of a loved one and the injury of another. The process of sentencing is not intended, and nor can it be, the measure of the value of a life, or of the depth of suffering. It can, and I hope does, recognise the loss and harm consistent with principles of sentencing.
	
	
	The offender’s moral culpability for the murder must also be assessed as part of the consideration of the overall gravity of the crime: McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29]; Ngati v R [2014] NSWCCA 125 at [40] - [46].
	
	
	The offender relies upon the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard in submitting that his moral culpability should be regarded as diminished by his particular psychological make-up, with his resort to alcohol to deal with depression being an inherent part of his impaired functioning.
	
	
	He relies on the same evidence in submitting that there was a degree of provocation leading to the commission of the crimes which should also mitigate his moral culpability somewhat.
	
	
	I have already indicated that I do not regard the credible evidence as capable of establishing that Ms Pearson provoked the offender. I am not prepared to give weight to the offender’s assertions to Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard in circumstances where the offender did not give evidence of the matters raised with the authors of Exhibits 1 and 2 (the forensic reports), and was not subjected to cross-examination.
	
	
	Evidence of an offender’s hearsay assertions to others should be treated with considerable circumspection, particularly in the absence of independent evidence which might provide some support for those assertions: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369.
	
	
	The offender’s account of the events surrounding the stabbing may be accepted where it corresponds with the account of Ms Mason and Ms Finlayson, or where it is supported by telephone records.
	
	
	There is evidence that, at some point after arriving home on 21 September 2014 and prior to his arrest later that day, the offender received an injury to his face that is consistent with the application of blunt force trauma. How that injury was received I cannot determine.
	
	
	Some aspects of the offender’s account to others have an air of unreality that must lead to a degree of circumspection about his claims. His purported memory of inflicting no more than one stab wound upon Ms Pearson (p.3, Ex. 1), for example, seems unlikely given the multiplicity of blows. The difference in the offender’s claims to Dr Nielssen as to his level of intoxication and those made contemporaneously to the events to police points to unreliability.
	
	
	There is independent evidence of the depression from which the offender suffered in the months leading up to the offences.
	
	
	He had made at least one serious attempt at taking his life, and had self-harmed on another occasion. He had been hospitalized for his condition, and prescribed appropriate medication. Friends had noticed the offender’s deteriorating mental state.
	
	
	I accept that the offender’s depressed state led him to take a bleak view of events and to feel pessimistic about his life and circumstances. I do not, however, regard the evidence as to his depressive state as being capable of significantly mitigating the offender’s moral culpability.
	
	
	Depression is a relatively common illness. The offender, in common with many other Australians, suffered and continues to suffer from it. It cannot however, in the circumstances of this case, provide some answer for the offender’s crimes. It provides context, but can do little to mitigate these offences.
	
	
	The offender had been diagnosed with depression at least by March or April 2014. He had been offered treatment and had chosen not to accept the treatment offered. He had been placed on an appropriate regime of medication, which he did not comply with. Instead, he chose to self-medicate with alcohol.
	
	
	I am not able to accept that the offender’s self-induced intoxication at the time of the commission of these crimes should be regarded as a feature of his depressive state and capable in that way of mitigating his crimes.
	
	
	The offender had at least one prior warning of the dangers inherent in his intoxication; he had previously in June 2014 assaulted Ms Pearson and another person – significantly, a person who tried to assist Ms Pearson, as Ms Mason did months later. He committed those crimes in the context of alcohol consumption. That experience should have alerted the offender to the dangers of alcohol consumption for him. He ignored that warning and chose to drink alcohol to some level of intoxication on the day of the offences.
	
	
	I note the operation of s 21A(5AA) of the CSPA which provides that a court is not to take an offender’s self-induced intoxication into account as a mitigating factor. Nor can it mitigate the offender’s moral culpability to any extent in my view.
	
	
	These were offences borne of intoxication and sparked by an explosion of anger, together with, in relation to Ms Mason, a realization that she was calling for help and a not irrational intention of preventing her from doing so.
	
	
	Nothing in the offender’s circumstances can diminish his moral culpability for his crimes to any real extent.
	
	
	I regard these as very serious crimes that call for the imposition of a heavy penalty.
	


The Offender’s Subjective Case


	
	The offender is aged 54 years, having been born on 28 February 1961. He was 53 years of age at the time of the offences.
	
	
	His health is generally good.
	
	
	The offender tendered and relied upon the reports of Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard already referred to, together with the hospital notes and discharge summary from his admission following the April 2014 suicide attempt (Ex. 3).
	
	
	The offender is the only child to his parents, although he has half-siblings from his parents’ previous relationships.
	
	
	He was brought up in the Armidale area and his childhood was a happy one. He completed his high school studies at Guyra High School and de La Salle College at Armidale and, after leaving school, took up apprenticeships in painting and later boilermaking.
	
	
	He left his second apprenticeship to work in the abattoir at Wingham, where he held steady employment for almost a quarter of a century. He worked on the abattoir floor and later as a supervisor and, following that, at Tamworth, as a trainer.
	
	
	The offender had one other significant long term relationship other than his relationship with Ms Pearson, and he has an adult son as a result of his former relationship. His son was close to Ms Pearson and her death has affected the offender’s relationship with his son. This loss of contact and closeness has greatly saddened the offender.
	
	
	The offender has been actively involved in sport for much of his life as both player and referee, principally in rugby league, but also cricket.
	
	
	His employment history bespeaks an individual who is capable of a constructive and positive contribution to the community, as does his involvement in team sport at a local community level.
	
	
	The offender’s criminal record (Ex. B) is not extensive and, other than the assaults of June 2014, it can be largely set aside.
	
	
	The offender was regarded by Dr Nielssen as falling within the normal range of intelligence, whilst Ms Robilliard concluded that the offender fell within the “lower end of the below average range” for intelligence, with 96% of his age cohort functioning at a level above him (p.12, Ex. 2).
	
	
	Although Ms Robilliard’s conclusions use a more graded approach to the assessment of the offender’s intellectual function, both assessments place him in the below average to normal range of function; with Ms Robilliard’s assessment falling at the bottom of that scale.
	
	
	That is consistent with the evidence concerning the offender’s capacity to function in the community. It is noted that the offender has been employed in a supervisory capacity, and as an educator, training other abattoir employees. Employment of that nature, and recreational activity as a referee in community sporting matches, would generally indicate an individual functioning at an ordinary level.
	
	
	The offender reported drinking alcohol since about the age of 16 years although he denied that this was problematic until recent years when his consumption level was such that he was occasionally amnesiac after drinking. He has never abused drugs.
	
	
	Gambling has also been a problem for the offender and caused him to descend into debt in 2014, as well as leading to tensions in his relationship with Ms Pearson.
	
	
	Since his incarceration on 21 September 2014 the offender has worked when possible, and currently works as a wing sweeper. He continues to pursue activities directed to maintaining his physical fitness.
	
	
	The offender has been appropriately medicated for his depression since incarceration and Dr Nielssen considered him in remission.
	
	
	The offender has expressed remorse for the murder of Ms Pearson, telling Ms Robilliard that he intended to “do the time and show remorse”, to pay a price for what he had done. Although his expressions of remorse are untested in evidence, they are consistent with his early entry of a plea of guilty, and I accept that the offender is remorseful for the murder of a woman he still professes to love.
	
	
	His attitude to his offence against Ms Mason is less straightforward. The offender expressed a degree of resentment against her to both Dr Nielssen and Ms Robilliard, appearing to blame her for coming between he and Ms Pearson. Indeed, he told Ms Robilliard (p.9, Ex. 2) that Ms Mason was responsible for a lot of the trouble between he and Ms Pearson, and claimed that her presence on 21 September 2014 inflamed the situation. That is an ironic claim to make against a woman who endeavoured to save her friend.
	
	
	The blame that the offender lays at Ms Mason’s feet for problems between he and Ms Pearson is not consistent with true remorse, although I accept that he has by his plea of guilty acknowledged responsibility for what he did to her.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard concluded that the offender has symptoms consistent with a Borderline Personality Disorder, although I note that Ms Robilliard is not qualified to render any diagnosis in this regard.
	
	
	Although it is almost impossible to make any meaningful prediction of the offender’s future prospects, given the lengthy period he must spend in prison, there is some reason for optimism, given his solid employment history and limited criminal history prior to 2014. His rehabilitation, particularly in relation to his abuse of alcohol and associated resort to violence, is likely to be in his own hands.
	
	
	The offender raised the issue of special circumstances in submission. I do not find that the offender’s circumstances require any variation in the ordinary ratio of sentence. The usual proportion of sentence will result in a lengthy parole period, simply because the overall sentence must be a lengthy one. That parole period will be adequate to assist the offender in his reintegration to the community.
	
	
	Whilst the offender suffers from depression, the evidence does not establish that his condition will cause his time in prison to be more onerous for him than it is for other prisoners. Indeed, it appears that the offender has adjusted relatively well to the custodial environment and, in taking his medication and abstaining from alcohol abuse, his health has improved.
	
	
	I do, however, propose to make a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the CSPA, insofar as it is necessary to adjust the statutory ratio of individual sentences to attain an overall sentencing outcome which, in broad, complies with the usual regime. There will be some slight adjustment to the usual overall ratio, which is a considered and intended adjustment, necessary to ensure that the NPP properly reflects the criminality of the offences.
	


Other Features Relevant to Sentence


	
	Section 3A of the CSPA sets out the purposes for which sentence is imposed on an offender. I have had regard to each of the seven purposes there specified for criminal punishment.
	
	
	An important feature of the sentences to be imposed upon the offender is that of general deterrence.
	
	
	Sadly, it is rare that a week goes by in Australia without a woman somewhere in the country being murdered by her spouse or partner. Violent and non-fatal attacks by persons known to the victim are also common. That is something of which we as a community should be ashamed, and which the courts must seek to address when sentencing offenders such as Mr Archer.
	
	
	It is incumbent upon this Court to clearly signal the community’s intolerance of domestic violence. The High Court has recently given powerful expression to the need for the courts to denounce domestic violence at [55] in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38,
	


“A just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of the victim of domestic violence and the legitimate interest of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of a brutal, alcohol-fuelled destruction of a woman by her partner. A failure on the part of the state to mete out a just punishment of violent offending may be seen as a failure by the state to vindicate the human dignity of the victim; and to impose a lesser punishment by reason of the identity of the victim is to create a group of second-class citizens, a state of affairs entirely at odds with the fundamental idea of equality before the law.” (per French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ)


	
	This court must be guided by that principle.
	
	
	There is clearly also a need for specific deterrence to figure in the sentences to be imposed, particularly having regard to the earlier assault upon Ms Pearson by the offender, and the clear warnings from others about his conduct towards her that the offender ignored.
	
	
	The principle of totality must also be considered. The sentences here must be significant. That, in turn, dictates a level of concurrency of sentence, to observe the requirements of the totality principle.
	
	
	I have considered the degree to which the criminality of one offence may be reflected by sentence imposed for another of the offences consistent with the principles espoused in R v Cayhadi (2007) 168 A Crim R 41. Whilst that commonality is not great, it will be reflected by some concurrency of sentence.
	
	
	By operation of s 45(1) of the CSPA the court is obliged to fix a NPP for both indictable offences.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty to the offences on indictment at an early stage, and he also entered a plea of guilty to the summary offence before this Court. There is considerable utilitarian value in the offender’s pleas and that value attracts a discount of 25% on the sentences that would otherwise have been imposed: R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.
	
	
	Counsel very helpfully directed the Court to earlier cases dealt with in this Court or which came before the Court of Criminal Appeal, both for assistance with principle, and as to a range of sentences imposed in other matters. I have considered those authorities and taken into account matters discussed in them, but note that each case turns on its own facts and particular circumstances. No other case is truly like this case, nor could it be.
	


Sentence


	
	Wayne Edward Archer, having been convicted of the offences of murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and contravening an apprehended violence order, you are sentenced to imprisonment as follows.
	



	
	For the offence of the contravention of an apprehended violence order I sentence you to a term of 21 months imprisonment commencing on 21 September 2014. That sentence will expire on 20 June 2016. In view of the sentences to follow there is no practical utility in specifying a NPP and I do not do so.
	
	
	For the offence of wounding Natasha Mason with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to her, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of eight years to date from 21 January 2016. I specify a NPP of six years which will expire on 20 January 2022. The overall sentence will expire on 20 January 2024.
	
	
	For the offence of the murder of Anne Marie Pearson I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 24 years. That sentence will commence on 21 January 2017. I specify a NPP of 18 years which will expire on 20 January 2035.
	



	
	The overall sentence expires on 20 January 2041. The overall effective sentence with respect to the three crimes consists of a NPP of 20 years and four months commencing on 21 September 2014 and a head sentence of 26 years and four months. The earliest date upon which the offender will become eligible for release to parole is 20 January 2035.

		09 October 2015",2015-10-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767922,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) [2015] NSWSC 1491,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Crown has made application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 for leave to cross-examine the Crown witness, A5, with respect to a number of topics.
	


Applicable Principles


	
	The principles to be applied on a s.38 application were referred to in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) [2015] NSWSC 1472 (“R v A2 (No. 8)”) at [16]. The terms of ss.38 and 192 Evidence Act 1995 must be considered.
	
	
	In addition to the principles referred to in R v A2 (No. 8) concerning s.38, the following additional proposition should be noted.
	
	
	The Crown does not warrant the truthfulness of its witnesses, and it is not obliged to embrace and accept whatever the witnesses say: Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 at [80]. Where the Crown proposes to invite the jury to disbelieve part of the evidence of a Crown witness, the mechanism available under s.38 may be utilised appropriately: Kanaan v R at [80]-[85].
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind, as well, the cautionary statements made in a number of cases, including R v Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292 at [5] and [76] and R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 54 NSWLR 474 at 492-493 [89]. As I noted in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005 at [17]:
	


“The Court should be alert to the risk of being sidetracked into collateral issues by way of grant of leave under s.38.”


	
	I bear in mind, as well, what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Parkes [2003] NSWCCA 12; 147 A Crim R 450 at 462-463 [72]-[75]. I note, as well, the statement in that case by Ipp JA at 464 [81]-[83], that a grant of leave may permit a truer picture of the situation to be presented to a jury than would be the case if the Crown had been refused leave to cross-examine. His Honour noted that this is the very purpose underlying s.38.
	
	
	Submissions have been made by Mr Bouveng by reference to s.137 Evidence Act 1995. In approaching those submissions, I will keep in mind what I said in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 3) [2015] NSWSC 1264 at [80]-[82].
	
	
	I bear in mind, as well, in the context of s.38, what was said by Bathurst CJ (Price and Campbell JJ agreeing) in Doyle v R [2014] NSWCCA 4 at [293], that “the use of the word ‘about’ in the chapeau to s 38(1) makes it clear that leave may be granted to not only conduct cross-examination specifically directed to one of the subjects referred to in s 38(1), but also to the probability of establishing a factual state of affairs in relation to the matters contended for by the party conducting the cross-examination”.
	


Issues in Dispute at Trial


	
	It is appropriate to note the relatively narrow issues in dispute in this trial.
	
	
	In R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 7) [2015] NSWSC 1427, after a reference to the opening addresses by counsel for the Accused persons, I said at [21]-[22]:
	


“21   There is no dispute that at places and times alleged in the indictment the Accused, [KM], used a metal instrument to come into physical contact with the genital area of each of [C1] and [C2]. On each occasion the Accused, [A2], was present and she had requested the Accused, [KM], to so act. Each girl was lying on a bed naked from the waist down during the event. 

22   The issues in dispute may be summarised as follows. The Crown says that, on each occasion, what was happening was a form of FGM where some injury was caused to the clitoris of each child. The defence says that this was a form of religious or cultural ceremony, where metal is laid upon the child's genital area, but that it was not a form of FGM, and that no injury was caused to either child.”


	
	It is clear, in my view, that the issues in the trial are not only what physical acts occurred in the rooms in question with respect to each girl, but why things were being done on each occasion to each girl. An answer to the latter question will inform a response to the former question.
	


Notice to Accused Persons


	
	Section 38 requires the Court to consider, by reference to s.38(6)(a), whether the party, in this case the Crown, gave notice at the earliest opportunity of its intention to seek leave.
	
	
	I note that the Crown, in a letter dated 12 May 2015, notified the legal representatives for the Accused persons of an intention to make an application under s.38, in the context of the evidence of A5, by reference to two recorded conversations to which further reference will be made.
	
	
	I note, as well, that the term ""checkup"" was used by the witness yesterday, for the first time. The witness gave evidence at a pretrial hearing in August 2015 when that term was not used by her. I take into account that recent event in the context of the notice requirement under the Act.
	
	
	I am satisfied, for the purpose of the Act, that the Accused persons have appropriate notice of this application. I observe, in any event, that the application was articulated by the Crown yesterday afternoon and there has been an opportunity for it to be further considered by the parties overnight.
	


Significance of Evidence of A5


	
	A5 is an important witness in this trial. Her evidence so far before the jury indicates that she was present in the relevant bedroom on the occasion when C1 (her granddaughter) was lying on a bed in A3's house at Wollongong, where A2 and KM were also present (as was at times, according to the evidence given yesterday, A3). The witness also gave evidence that she was present when C2 (another granddaughter) was lying on a bed in her parents' house at Baulkham Hills, when the Accused persons, A2 and KM, were also present.
	
	
	A5 says that she was reading a prayer on each occasion, and did not see what was happening with the child on the bed. She said that the term ""checkup"" was used to describe what had happened to the children, although she said she had no further knowledge as to what was being done to either child. It was her evidence yesterday that she understood the word ""khatna"" to be circumcision involving boys, and only boys.
	


The Crown Application


	
	The Crown relies on s.38(1)(a),(b) and (c). It is submitted that A5 has given evidence which is unfavourable to the Crown. In this respect, the Crown points to her evidence concerning what was happening in the room on each occasion, and what she said was her own limited knowledge of that and her own understanding of the word ""khatna"". The Crown says that other aspects of the evidence are unfavourable as well.
	
	
	I have noted in R v A2 (No. 8) at [16], the relatively low threshold for unfavourability.
	
	
	The Crown relies, as well, on s.38(1)(b), namely, that it seeks to cross-examine her about a matter which she may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge about, and about which it appears to the Court that she is not, in examination-in-chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence. Reliance in this respect is placed upon the witness' account of what she observed happening in the bedrooms on each occasion, and what she understood was happening. The Crown is to submit to the jury that the evidence of A5 given yesterday on these topics ought not be accepted as a full and truthful account of what was happening to her knowledge.
	
	
	The third aspect relied upon is under s.38(1)(c), namely, that there are prior inconsistent statements made by the witness.
	
	
	I will return to these three topics in a moment.
	
	
	The oral submissions made this morning have indicated areas where there was a level of acceptance by counsel for the Accused persons that some of these threshold issues are met in this case. It may be said that the argument flowed more directly to discretionary considerations.
	


Determination


	
	Firstly, I should record my satisfaction that there is a prior inconsistent statement as between the evidence given by the witness on the pretrial hearing (PT284), and as to what was said yesterday when the term ""checkup"" was used for the first time.
	
	
	Next, I have formed the view that the Crown has demonstrated unfavourability, in a number of ways, and in an associated fashion has demonstrated that s.38(1)(b) is made out. In determining whether it may reasonably be supposed that the witness has knowledge, so that she is not making a genuine attempt to give evidence on certain topics, I take into account, as well, what the witness is recorded as saying in intercepted conversations which took place on 29 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 6) and 30 August 2012 (Exhibit PTK, Tab 15).
	
	
	I have already mentioned that the witness said yesterday that the word ""khatna"" related to circumcision in males. The witness was asked (T912):
	


“Q. Have you ever heard of the word either 'khatna' or 'khatanat' in the context of female circumcision?

A. No.”


	
	I note, as well, the evidence of the witness yesterday when she was asked about her knowledge of KM. She was asked (T875-876):
	


“Q. Do you know if [KM] has a particular role within the Dawoodi Bohra community.

A. No, I don't know.

Q. Do you know what her occupation was before she retired?

A. I'm told - I knew she was a midwife.”


	
	I turn to Exhibit PTK, Tab 6. This is a short telephone conversation at 4.05 pm on 29 August 2012, soon after C1 and C2 had been interviewed by investigating officials, and after that fact had been brought to the attention of their parents. In this telephone call, A1 is speaking to A5, his mother. In the course of that conversation, A1 is recorded as saying, “Mummy, we did khatanat” and “Problem has been caused because of that”. A5 immediately says:
	


“To [C2]?”

With A1 replying:

“Both.”


	
	In my view, this transcript gives rise to a foundation for a grant of leave by reference to s.38(1)(a), (b) and (c). Unfavourability and inconsistency with evidence given yesterday is demonstrated. The immediate response of the witness, where she refers to C2 in a conversation about “khatanat”, is itself a foundation for a grant of leave under s.38(1)(a), (b) and (c).
	
	
	The second transcript (Exhibit PTK, Tab 15) is a longer one. At 9.38 am the next day, 30 August 2012, there is a further conversation by telephone between A1 and A5. The conversation involves A1 informing A5 that police went to the school and interviewed C1 and C2, with the response by A5, “But why did they pick up only those two?”.
	
	
	The conversation continues as to what had been said by and to C1, and with A5 engaging in a conversation on that topic. A1 informed A5 what A1 and his wife, the Accused A2, had told the authorities - that “we are both against it” (inferentially “khatna” in the sense of female genital mutilation). There is then further discussion (at page 3) in which A5 said she received “Aunt's phone call”. The witness then said, “Aunty said to me that [A2] said to them that it had done in Africa” and “[KM] Aunty just checked, …That's what she, [A2], said to Aunty”.
	
	
	These statements, attributed to A5, were made the day after the conversation where ""khatna"" was referred to. The word ""checked"" is relied on by the Crown, in the context of the witness' evidence yesterday, where the word ""checkup"" was used.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely, as well, on what is said (at pages 6 and 7 of Exhibit PTK, Tab 15) in which there is a discussion, the Crown says, about “khatna” in the sense of female circumcision. The transcript contains the following:
	


A1: “We haven't done anything forbidden HARAM. This is SHARIA work. God KHUDA will save us. MAULA will save us”.

A5: “Do not worry. Look, MUSLIMS do, normally most MUSLIMS do”.

…

A5: “Yes, ARAB, AFRICA, most MUSLIMS community do”.

A1: “But it is illegal in AFRICA”.

A5: “Yes, AFRICA and everywhere it is illegal. Medically it is illegal”.

A1: “According to SHARIAT, legal”.

A5: “It happens everywhere privately”.

A1: “Anyway, let us see. Here it is very bad. Very strict law against it”.

A5: “Yes, okay”.

A1: “Okay Mummy”.

A5: “There may be a good way out. All would fail. Okay”.


	
	The Crown seeks to rely on parts of that conversation as shedding light upon the knowledge of A5 concerning KM's role. Thus, it is said to be inconsistent with the evidence to which I have already made mention. It is also said that the contents of this transcript relates to A5’s knowledge of ""khatna"", in the sense of a procedure involving female circumcision.
	
	
	The term ""khatna"", and its meaning, are of considerable significance in this trial. It is a term that has been used in evidence already before the jury in recorded conversations. No doubt submissions will be made as to why the Accused persons and others would be having conversations about “khatna”, in the context of events concerning C1 and C2. Thus, the word is a significant one in this trial.
	
	
	In that respect, an issue may arise as to whether there is a difference between ""khatna"" and ""khatanat"". For present purposes, I do not see any significant distinction for the purpose of this ruling.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the Crown has demonstrated a threshold so as to have leave under s.38 which, prima facie, would involve use of these recorded conversations.
	
	
	Submissions were made with respect to discretionary considerations which arise under ss.38 and 192 and also s.137.
	
	
	It was submitted strongly by Mr Sutherland SC that these are conversations between, effectively, third parties to the proceedings, with no Accused person being a party to either conversation. The conversations are between A1, the husband of one of the Accused persons, and A1’s mother.
	
	
	I accept that care must be taken before a decision is made allowing the use of material of this type in a criminal trial. The Court must consider carefully whether its use may convert the focus of the trial, in some inappropriate way, and give rise to collateral issues by way of sidetrack.
	
	
	I have already said that A5 is an important witness. She was in the room on each occasion when events under consideration in this trial occurred. She was present and, on her evidence, was praying. She was clearly invited to be there.
	
	
	The question of the use of the term ""khatna"" by her, or an acceptance by her of that term as having something to do with what happened to C1 and C2 is, in my view, an issue of direct relevance in this trial. It is not a sidetrack, nor a collateral issue.
	
	
	The first conversation (Exhibit PTK, Tab 6), is clearly appropriate for a grant of leave subject to the s.137 objection, to which I will return.
	
	
	The longer conversation (Exhibit PTK, Tab 15) involves a number of topics. The uses which the Crown seeks to make of it are less direct than Exhibit PTK, Tab 6.
	
	
	The conversation in Exhibit PTK, Tab 15 takes place less than 24 hours after the first conversation. It involves the same speakers. It covers territory which sheds light upon the true knowledge and understanding of A5, an important Crown witness, who was present on both the occasions when the alleged offences occurred. In addition to areas of suggested inconsistency, Exhibit PTK, Tab 15 is capable of being used in the trial for proper reasons.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC submitted that what was happening here was a deliberate attempt to manipulate the trial process. That submission was based upon some statements made in R v Parkes (see [6] above). The Court will always be careful to guard against the occurrence of matters which could be so characterised. I am not persuaded that that is what is happening in this case.
	
	
	Section 38 Evidence Act 1995 has been recognised, in a multitude of judgments, as making some fundamental changes to the way in which criminal trials proceed. The application is being made here while evidence-in-chief is still underway. Any cross-examination by leave will occur before counsel for the Accused persons are called upon themselves to cross-examine. That itself is relevant to any suggested unfairness.
	
	
	I am satisfied, for the purpose of s.192(2)(a), that the use of this material will not involve undue lengthening of the trial.
	
	
	At this point, I turn to the submission by Mr Bouveng by reference to s.137, which picks up suggested unfairness to the Accused persons, an issue also relevant under s.192(2)(b). I am not persuaded that the use which may be made of these transcripts, with respect to the present witness, will involve any real prospect of misuse by the jury of this material. The focus of this material will be upon what this important Crown witness is truly able to say about the events which are facts in issue in this trial. For the purpose of s.137, I record my finding that the probative value of this evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused persons.
	
	
	I should make it clear that this ruling is made by reference to the material relied upon and the purposes identified by the Crown. The question of what will occur with respect to future witnesses will, in turn, be decided by reference to material relevant to any such application.
	
	
	I grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine A5 with respect to the following topics:
	



	
	what events occurred in the bedroom on the occasions that A5 has described when C1 and C2 were lying on beds;
	
	
	the knowledge of the witness of the term ""khatna"" or ""khatanat"" and its use concerning girls, including C1 and C2;
	
	
	evidence (said to be inconsistent) concerning the use of the term ""checkup"" and the role of KM.
	



	
	In identifying these topics and in making this ruling, I have taken into account the fact that the Crown may cross-examine “about” those matters and, in accordance with the passage from Doyle v R (mentioned at [8] above) to which I have made mention, that is a relatively broad concept. I do not propose, at this stage, to grant leave separately to cross-examine as to credibility, given the breadth of the grant of leave which I have made.

2767923,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 10) [2015] NSWSC 1540,"Judgment (On defence application for a limiting order - T943)


	
	JOHNSON J: Following the judgment which I have recently delivered with respect to the Crown’s application under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 concerning A5 (R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) [2015] NSWSC 1491), counsel for the Accused persons have made further submissions on a consequential topic.
	
	
	Mr Sutherland SC has raised for consideration the provisions in ss.43 and 44 Evidence Act 1995 concerning prior inconsistent statements and previous representations.
	
	
	I do not think that these provisions bear upon the present situation, in that leave has been granted to the Crown under s.38 on all three bases under s.38(1)(a), (b) and (c). The matter is not confined to prior inconsistent statements.
	
	
	A further submission was made by Mr Bouveng, supported by Mr Sutherland SC, that there ought be, in effect, a limiting order made concerning the use of the material in Exhibit PTK, Tab 6 and Exhibit PTK, Tab 15, the transcripts of the telephone conversations. It is submitted that the Court should limit the use of this material to the purpose of drawing inconsistencies to the attention of A5, and not as evidence of the truth of what A5 or A1 said in the conversations.
	
	
	The Crown submits that, having reached this point, the material should go in for all purposes.
	
	
	The two parties to these conversations are Crown witnesses. The present witness, of course, is A5. The other party, A1, will be called in the Crown case next week. Given the preliminary ruling made as contained in R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) [2015] NSWSC 1472, the present issue will inevitably arise again with A1.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the conversations and the transcripts should go in for all purposes. I do not think a restriction of the type sought by Mr Bouveng is appropriate, nor do I think that it is entirely consistent with the purpose of s.38, to which I have already made reference.
	
	
	Accordingly, the disks and, in particular, the transcripts will go in for all purposes.

		17 November 2015",2015-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767937,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 13) [2015] NSWSC 1543,"Judgment (on application by crown for leave to cross-examine a1 - t1181)


	
	JOHNSON J: On 7 October 2015, I published my reasons with respect to a preliminary application by the Crown for leave to cross-examine, under s.38 Evidence Act 1995, the witness A1: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) [2015] NSWSC 1472. As R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) makes clear, it was a provisional ruling based upon certain matters.
	
	
	The Crown has now sought leave to cross-examine A1 on a more refined range of topics.
	
	
	The principles which I am applying in this judgment are those set out in my judgments R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 8) and R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9) [2015] NSWSC 1491, which do not need to be repeated.
	
	
	Discretionary considerations arise both under ss.38 and 192 and indeed, although the section has not been mentioned specifically, s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	In a sense, A1 does not give primary evidence on factual matters, certainly not in the way that A5 or A3 have done. My judgments with respect to the s.38 applications concerning those witnesses identify their evidentiary importance in the trial.
	
	
	However, A1 has a role in the case which is a little unusual. He is, of course, the husband of one of the Accused persons (A2), and the father of the two children who are the subject of the charges. Because of a range of electronic evidence available to the Crown, there are a variety of conversations involving A1, each of the three Accused persons and, indeed, other persons which touch upon issues in this trial.
	
	
	I will confine these reasons, as far as possible, having regard to the fact that the jury is awaiting this determination.
	
	
	By reference to the Crown’s revised schedule (MFI58), I indicate that I propose to grant leave with respect to Items 1, 2 and 3, which involve leave to cross-examine A1 by reference to three recordings which are in evidence. For the purpose of accelerating the process, in the first instance the Crown should seek to utilise the transcripts without requiring the playing of any recordings.
	
	
	I make the same ruling with respect to Item 7 - a further item in evidence, Exhibit AU.
	
	
	With respect to the specific items addressed by the Crown orally this morning, I propose to allow the Crown to cross-examine upon the basis of either inconsistency or unfavourability, or both, by reference to evidence given by the witness (at T1139.13) with respect to scissors and (at T1139.30) with respect to the suggested role of KM.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence of the witness yesterday as to his state of mind, and his actions at the time he was interviewed by police on 7 September 2012, I propose to allow the Crown to cross-examine, upon the basis of inconsistency, with respect to the ERISP Questions and Answers 246 to 248, but not beyond those.
	
	
	With respect to the question of whether forceps were placed ""in genitalia"" or ""in a genital area"", the grant of leave which the Crown has with respect to the term ""khatna"" (which will apply to the recorded conversations), will allow the Crown to cross-examine on that topic as well.
	
	
	The points at which the witness gave evidence yesterday, as to his understanding of the term ""khatna"" at different times, will itself be part of the grant of leave to cross-examine with respect to ""khatna"". Cross-examination may extend to answers given yesterday on those topics, which are interrelated with the recordings and transcripts (Exhibits AF and AH).
	
	
	With respect to the Crown application concerning any practice in India, I note the Crown proposes to ask a question again to clarify the position and I make no ruling in that respect.
	
	
	I turn then to the series of items in MFI58, Numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Each of these involves conversations between the present witness and other persons, principally Mr Karimjee, a solicitor, but also other persons in Items 5 and 11. The Crown has confined to particular parts the portions which they seek to utilise if leave is granted. Those parts touch upon the term ""khatna"" and the role of KM in the Dawoodi Bohra community.
	
	
	I have allowed the Crown, in the context of the s.38 application with respect to A5, to cross-examine by reference to conversations between A5 and A1 (Exhibits AS and AU): R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 9); R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 10) [2015] NSWSC 1540.
	
	
	Both of those persons are witnesses in the Crown case.
	
	
	The items in relation to which the Crown presently seeks leave involve one witness in the Crown case, namely the present witness, and other persons who are not.
	
	
	There is, on the basis of the material pointed to by the Crown, sufficient inconsistency between the things said by A1 in those conversations, and evidence given yesterday with respect to the role of KM within the Dawoodi Bohra community. The Crown opened its case upon the basis that it was its contention that KM was effectively the circumciser for that community, and that proposition has been put to other witnesses. It is the case (this part being undisputed), that on the occasions involving C1 and C2, it was KM who was the actor utilising such implement as was used.
	
	
	Submissions have been made that it would be highly prejudicial to KM to seek to introduce this material, which would involve what is said to be knowledge of A1 (acquired in some way) of KM’s role in this community. It is the case, as I understand it, that KM has raised character in the trial already. The role of KM in the Dawoodi Bohra community is not a new issue. It is an issue which the Crown has sought to raise with various witnesses so far. Whatever evidence emerges from A1 on that topic remains to be seen.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the probative value of this material is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Given the mechanism which I propose to hold the Crown to in using this material, I am satisfied that there will not be undue use of trial time in dealing with these issues.
	
	
	I propose to grant the Crown leave under s.38 to cross-examine A1 with respect to Items 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in MFI58. The mechanism to be used will be confined to an identification to the witness of the transcript and the conversation he is meant to have had with a particular person, at a particular date and time. The witness is to be taken to the particular part which the Crown seeks to rely upon. The recording will not be tendered as an exhibit in the trial, and the jury should not be provided with copies of these transcripts. The relevant transcripts can be marked for identification.
	
	
	In my view, this measure will minimise the risk of any misuse of this material by the jury. It will allow the Crown to undertake what I regard as a proper exercise in the trial, but not in a manner that operates in any unduly prejudicial fashion to the Accused persons. It will keep this material in a proper perspective.
	
	
	In reaching these conclusions, I have had regard to the requirements of s.38 and 192 and I have also taken into account s.137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I propose to give the jury a direction, at an appropriate time, that the portions of these transcripts which are used in cross-examination of A1 in this way, may be used for the purpose of understanding and assessing his evidence on these topics. Anything stated by the other person in the conversation, unless adopted by A1, should not be treated as evidence of the truth of the facts contained in the statement of the other person.

2767938,DPP v Ridley [2015] NSWSC 1478,"Judgment


	
	On 30 January 2015, in the Local Court at West Wyalong, Magistrate Dare dismissed a charge of an offence contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) at the conclusion of the voir dire. On 13 February 2013 his Honour extended time within which to institute an appeal to 22 May 2015.
	
	
	By summons filed on 22 May 2015 the plaintiff appealed pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against his Honour’s dismissal of the charge on the following grounds:
	


(i)   Failing to conduct the proceedings in accordance with the requirements of s 202(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

(ii)   Excluding evidence from the proceedings without identifying the evidence excluded or the basis for the exclusion.

(iii)   Failing to provide adequate reasons for excluding the evidence or for dismissing the proceedings.

(iv)   Excluding evidence from the proceedings and dismissing the proceedings.

The facts


	
	The following narrative is derived from the evidence relied on by the police prosecutor in the Local Court, which comprised the statements of Senior Constable Katherine Carey and Senior Constable Steven Holmes.
	
	
	At about 1.40am on 10 May 2014, Senior Constable Carey and Senior Constable Holmes saw the defendant’s car drive over a gutter on the way out of the car park of the West Wyalong Sports and Citizens Club. They followed the car, which drifted across the centre line of the road and returned to the correct side a number of times. They stopped the car to conduct a random breath test. The defendant returned a positive reading of 0.160g/210L of breath.
	
	
	Senior Constable Carey noticed that the defendant’s speech was slow; his words were slurred and he smelled of alcohol. Her evidence of her conversation with the defendant at the roadside was as follows:
	


“I said, ‘Hi. You’ve been stopped for the purpose of a random breath test. Have you had any alcohol to drink?’

The accused replied, ‘Yeah, I’m gone.’

I said. ‘How long ago was your last drink?’

The accused replied, ‘I’m gone.’

I said, ‘Can you remember how long ago since you had your last alcoholic drink?’

The accused replied, ‘At the club’

I said, ‘Ok, can you remember what time you had your last drink?’

The accused said, ‘I’m gone, you’ve got me.’

…

I said to the accused, ‘Ok as I said you’ve been stopped for the purpose of a random breath test. I now require you to undergo a breath test for the purpose of indicating the concentration of alcohol present in your blood. I now direct you to blow air from your lungs into this device until I tell you to stop. Failure to comply with this direction is an offence.’

[The breath test was then administered and the defendant produced his licence]

I said to the accused, ‘James. You’ve returned a positive roadside reading. You are under arrest and will be taken to West Wyalong Police Station for a breath analysis’.”


	
	When the defendant got out of the car he was unable to stand unsupported. Senior Constable Holmes described him as being “very unsteady on his feet”. He, too, noticed that the defendant smelled of alcohol.
	
	
	The officers, both of whom considered the defendant to be affected by alcohol, took him to the West Wyalong Police Station for breath analysis. Senior Constable Holmes administered a formal caution. When he asked the defendant whether he suffered from any illnesses or injuries, the defendant responded “Asperger’s”. The defendant refused to nominate a next of kin.
	
	
	Senior Constable Holmes read a form of demand which referred to a requirement that the defendant provide a sample pursuant to the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act 1999 (NSW) (the 1999 Act). At the time of the demand, the 1999 Act had been repealed and replaced by the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) (the 2013 Act).
	
	
	None of the defendant’s three attempts to submit a sample of his breath was successful: the first was analysed as “blowing too softly”; the second as “insufficient sample”; and the third as “alcohol in mouth”. The defendant was told that he had either refused or failed to submit a breath analysis in accordance with Senior Constable Holmes’ direction. He responded, “What did I do wrong though, I’m not real good at practising this sort of stuff”. He refused to have a doctor examine him to take blood samples. He asked for someone to come to collect him from the police station. He was informed that he would receive a Court Attendance Notice (CAN) and was released.
	
	
	In the CAN, it was alleged that, contrary to s 112(1)(a) of the 2013 Act, between 1.45am and 3.05am on 10 May 2014 at West Wyalong the defendant did drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.
	


The relevant legislative provisions

The 2013 Act


	
	Section 112 of the 2013 Act relevantly provides:
	


“Use or attempted use of a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any other drug

(1) A person must not, while under the influence of alcohol or any other drug:

(a) drive a vehicle, . . .”


	
	Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act relevantly provides:
	


“3 Power to conduct random breath testing

(1) A police officer may require a person to submit to a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that:

(a) the person is or was driving a motor vehicle on a road, or

(b) the person is or was occupying the driving seat of a motor vehicle on a road and attempting to put the motor vehicle in motion, or

(c) the person (being the holder of an applicable driver licence) is or was occupying the seat in a motor vehicle next to a learner driver while the driver is or was driving the vehicle on a road.

(2) Before requiring a person to submit to a breath test under subclause (1), and for the purpose of determining whether to conduct such a test, a police officer may conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if alcohol is present in the person’s breath by requiring the person to talk into a device that indicates the presence of alcohol.

(3) Without limiting any other power or authority, a police officer may, for the purposes of this clause, request or signal the driver of a motor vehicle to stop the vehicle.

(4) A person must comply with any request or signal made or given to the person by a police officer under subclause (3).

. . .

4 Arrest following failed breath test

(1) A police officer may exercise the powers referred to in subclause (2) in respect of a person if:

. . .

(c) it appears to the officer from a breath test carried out under clause 3 (1) by the officer that the device by means of which the test was carried out indicates that there may be present in the person’s breath or blood a concentration of alcohol of not less than 0.05 grams in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

(d) the person refused to submit to a breath test required by a police officer under clause 3 (1) or fails to submit to that test in accordance with the directions of the officer.

(2) A police officer may:

(a) arrest a person referred to in subclause (1) without warrant, and

(b) take the person (or cause the person to be taken) with such force as may be necessary to a police station or such other place as the officer considers desirable, and

(c) detain the person, or cause the person to be detained, at that police station or other place for the purposes of submitting to a breath analysis in accordance with this Division, and

. . .

5 Breath analysis following arrest

(1) A police officer may require a person who has been arrested under clause 4 to submit to a breath analysis in accordance with the directions of the officer.

(2) A breath analysis must be carried out by a police officer authorised to do so by the Commissioner of Police at or near a police station or such other place as that officer considers desirable.

(3) As soon as practicable after a person has submitted to a breath analysis, the police officer operating the breath analysing instrument must deliver a written statement to that person signed by that officer specifying the following:

(a) the concentration of alcohol determined by the analysis to be present in that person’s breath or blood and expressed in grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood,

(b) the day on and time of the day at which the breath analysis was completed.

. . .

31 Evidence of alcohol concentration in proceedings for offences against section 110

(1) This clause applies to any proceedings for an offence against section 110 (Presence of prescribed concentration of alcohol in person’s breath or blood).

(2) Evidence may be given in proceedings to which this clause applies of the concentration of alcohol present in the breath or blood of the person charged as determined by:

(a) a breath analysis carried out by a police officer authorised to do so by the Commissioner of Police, or

(b) an analysis of the person’s blood under this Schedule.

(3) In any such proceedings, the concentration of alcohol so determined is taken to be the concentration of alcohol in the person’s breath or blood at the time of the occurrence of the relevant event referred to in clause 3 (1) (a), (b) or (c) if the breath analysis was made, or blood sample taken, within 2 hours after the event unless the defendant proves that the concentration of alcohol in the defendant’s breath or blood at the time concerned was:

. . .

(c) in the case of an offence against section 110 (3)—less than 0.05 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath or 100 millilitres of blood, or

. . .

 

40 Double jeopardy in relation to alcohol and other drug offences

(1) A person is not liable to be convicted of both an offence against section 112 (1) and a related alcohol or drug offence if the offences arose directly or indirectly out of the same circumstances.

(2) A person who:

(a) is required by a police officer to submit to a breath test by reason of the occurrence of an event referred to in clause 3 (1) (a), (b) or (c) and, as a consequence, to submit to a breath analysis or to provide a sample of the person’s blood under Division 2 of Part 2, and

Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002

Part 9 of LEPRA


	
	Part 9 of LEPRA is entitled “Investigations and Questioning” and relevantly contains ss 111, 112 and 113. Section 111 of LEPRA relevantly provides:
	


“Persons to whom Part applies

(1) This Part applies to a person, including a person under the age of 18 years, who is under arrest by a police officer for an offence. It is immaterial whether the offence concerned was committed before or after the commencement of this Part or within or outside the State.”


	
	Section 112 of LEPRA relevantly provides:
	


“Modification of application of Part to certain persons

(1) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the modification of the application of this Part to:

. . .

(d) persons who have a disability (whether physical, intellectual or otherwise).”


	
	Section 113 of LEPRA relevantly provides:
	


“Effect of Part on other powers and duties

(1) Existing powers relating to arrest and other mattersThis Part does not:

. . .

(b) prevent a police officer from asking or causing a person to do a particular thing that the police officer is authorised by law to ask or cause the person to do (for example, the power to require a person to submit to a breath analysis under Division 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Road Transport Act 2013), or

 

…”

 

Part 15 of LEPRA


	
	Section 201 of LEPRA is contained in Part 15, which is entitled “Safeguards relating to powers”. Section 201(1) of LEPRA (as in force at the relevant time) imposed various obligations on police officers to provide his or her name, place of duty and the reason for the exercise of power to the person who is the subject of the exercise of power, including when exercising the power to arrest a person: s 201(3). Section 201(6) expressly excluded the section from the exercise of a power conferred by an Act or regulation specified in Sch 1. The 2013 Act was specified. Accordingly, s 201 did not apply where the arrest was for the purposes of the person submitting to a breath analysis pursuant to cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act.
	


The power of arrest under s 99 of LEPRA


	
	The power of arrest conferred by cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act is to be distinguished from the power conferred by s 99 of LEPRA (which is contained in Part 8) which relevantly provides:
	


“Power of police officers to arrest without warrant

(1) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:

(a) the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person is committing or has committed an offence, and

(b) the police officer is satisfied that the arrest is reasonably necessary for any one or more of the following reasons:

(i) to stop the person committing or repeating the offence or committing another offence,

(ii) to stop the person fleeing from a police officer or from the location of the offence,

(iii) to enable inquiries to be made to establish the person’s identity if it cannot be readily established or if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that identity information provided is false,

(iv) to ensure that the person appears before a court in relation to the offence,

(v) to obtain property in the possession of the person that is connected with the offence,

(vi) to preserve evidence of the offence or prevent the fabrication of evidence,

(vii) to prevent the harassment of, or interference with, any person who may give evidence in relation to the offence,

(viii) to protect the safety or welfare of any person (including the person arrested),

(ix) because of the nature and seriousness of the offence.

. . .

(3) A police officer who arrests a person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.

(4) A person who has been lawfully arrested under this section may be detained by any police officer under Part 9 for the purpose of investigating whether the person committed the offence for which the person has been arrested and for any other purpose authorised by that Part.

. . .”

 

Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Regulation 2005 (NSW) (LEPRR)


	
	Regulation 24(1)(b) of LEPRR relevantly defines vulnerable persons as persons who have impaired intellectual functioning. Clause 24(2) provides:
	


“Pursuant to section 112 (1) of the Act, the application of Part 9 of the Act to vulnerable persons is modified by this Division.”


	
	Division 3 of the LEPRR includes various provisions for support persons to be present where police are taking particular steps in relation to vulnerable persons, as defined in cl 24(1).
	


Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)


	
	Section 38 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides:
	


“Hearing procedures to be as for Supreme Court

In any proceedings for an offence (other than in the Supreme Court for an indictable offence), the procedures and practice for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, and the right to address the court on the case in reply or otherwise, are, as far as practicable, to be conducted in accordance with Supreme Court procedure for the trial of an indictable offence.”


	
	Section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Act relevantly provides:
	


“202 Determination by court

(1) The court must determine summary proceedings after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with this Act.

(2) The court may determine the matter by convicting the accused person or making an order as to the accused person, or by dismissing the matter.

. . .”

 

Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)


	
	Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


“Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”

 


	
	Section 138(1) of the Evidence Act provides:
	


“Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1) Evidence that was obtained:

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.”

 

 

The Local Court hearing


	
	The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. At the commencement of the hearing at the Local Court at West Wyalong on 30 January 2015 Mr Hutchings, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, informed the Court that it had been agreed that the Police brief would be tendered on the voir dire; admissibility of certain portions of evidence would be the subject of argument; rulings would then be made; and argument would then proceed on the basis of evidence admitted.
	
	
	The police prosecutor tendered on the voir dire the statements of Senior Constable Carey (to which was annexed the custody management record) and Senior Constable Holmes (to which the records of unsuccessful attempts at breath analysis were annexed). The statements included descriptions of the officers’ observations of the defendant’s driving, his demeanour at the roadside and his conversations with them set out above.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant then made submissions to the Magistrate, including the following:
	



	
	Part 9 of LEPRA was applicable as the defendant was under arrest;
	
	
	The defendant suffered from Asperger’s and was, accordingly, a vulnerable person within the meaning of cl 24 of LEPRR;
	
	
	He was not provided with a support person as required by Part 9 of LEPRA, as modified by Division 3 of the LEPRR;
	
	
	The 1999 Act had been repealed at the time of the alleged offence; and accordingly the demand made of him at the police station to provide a sample was not in accordance with the 2013 Act in that it referred to a repealed Act;
	



	
	Mr Hutchings contended that:
	



	
	the roadside breath analysis was inadmissible without further testing or record and that it ought, in any event, be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant;
	
	
	as a vulnerable person, the defendant was entitled at all times to have a support person present while he was required to provide a breath sample;
	
	
	the failure to comply with cl 24 of the LEPRR (and, in particular, the failure to provide a support person) ought result in the evidence of what occurred at the police station when the defendant attempted to provide a sample being excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act as being improperly obtained; and
	
	
	the alcometer testing carried out at the police station ought accordingly be rejected.
	



	
	Mr Hutchings submitted that, if his contentions were accepted, the police evidence would comprise “some subjective descriptions of the manner in which [the defendant] drove his motor vehicle and some observations of him after he ceased driving his motor vehicle”. The Magistrate responded: “that is what it usually comes down to in a driving under the influence charge, isn’t it?” Mr Hutchings agreed but contended that, because of the defendant’s “overwhelming condition”, which is “debilitating in its effect on him”, the Magistrate would not be able to draw the inference that he was driving while intoxicated.
	
	
	The police prosecutor submitted on the voir dire:
	



	
	The police had given the defendant an approved breath test;
	
	
	The defendant was arrested for the purposes of breath analysis and not for an offence and therefore the custody requirements of LEPRA did not apply;
	
	
	The defendant was told, correctly, that he would be taken back to West Wyalong police station for a breath analysis;
	
	
	Even if the custody requirements did apply, they did not apply until the defendant arrived at the police station;
	
	
	The defendant did not disclose that he had Asperger’s until he was asked various questions about his health at the police station and therefore there was no basis for suggesting that he was known to be a vulnerable person prior to that time;
	
	
	Although the form of demand read to the defendant at the police station referred to the 1999 Act, it was substantially the same as the wording provided for in the 2013 Act, which, in any event, was not mandated by the 2013 Act;
	
	
	The offence of driving under the influence, with which the defendant was charged, was based on observations at the scene; the custody manager’s observations; and the defendant’s responses to questions about his alcohol consumption.
	



	
	The police prosecutor also submitted that the police officers’ observations were not based on anything to do with a reading and that there was a “case to answer in relation to the s 138 argument” on the basis of “the probative value versus the prejudicial effect of the custody versus vulnerability”. The police prosecutor contended that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.
	
	
	In response counsel for the defendant submitted that, as soon as the defendant had informed the officers that he suffered from Asperger’s, police were obliged to arrange for a support person to be present and to consider the effects of his condition on their interaction. In support of this submission, Mr Hutchings tendered some medical reports which became Exhibit 2 on the voir dire. The reports indicated that, as a result of Asperger’s, the defendant had difficulties not only in communicating but also in processing information from others. The reports also contained an indication that he might have had difficulty following instructions at the police station.
	
	
	His Honour then canvassed, with counsel for the defence, what the police ought to have done when they became aware that the defendant was a vulnerable person and whether the defendant’s demeanour could also be attributed to alcohol. Mr Hutchings accepted that “objectively” there was a degree of intoxication. His Honour responded that “it comes down to that narrow provision” in LEPRA, which he described as a “troublesome piece of legislation in many respects, for both sides”.
	
	
	The police prosecutor, in reply, reiterated his earlier submission that the defendant was not in custody for an offence; rather that he had been arrested for the purposes of a breath analysis. The prosecutor referred to s 113 of LEPRA in support of a submission that the police were entitled to do what they did, since Part 9 related to a person in custody who had been arrested for an offence, rather than, as in the present case, a person who had been brought back to the police station to undertake breath analysis pursuant to cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act. The prosecutor submitted that the evident purpose of s 113 was to ensure that compliance with Part 9 did not delay the obtaining of a sample for the purposes of analysis within two hours of the defendant driving the vehicle (which I take to be a reference to the deeming provision in cl 31 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act, set out above).
	
	
	His Honour observed that a person who is arrested and taken to the station for the purposes of submitting to a breath analysis “will be charged with something”. The prosecutor accepted that proposition but repeated his contention that “he’s not under arrest for that purpose”. His Honour responded by describing the argument as “a very fine distinction” and a “nice try on”.
	
	
	The police prosecutor reminded the Magistrate that the case was based on what happened and the observations of the police of the defendant. He submitted that the only relevance of Part 9 of LEPRA was to the “double jeopardy clause” (which I take to be a reference to cl 40, Sch 3 of the 2013 Act).
	
	
	Magistrate Dare invited a response from defence counsel, who submitted that cl 24 of LEPRR modified the whole of Part 9 of LEPRA in relation to custody. The police prosecutor then contended that what occurred at the station was not relevant (except as to double jeopardy) as the charge was driving under the influence of alcohol rather than fail or refuse breath analysis.
	
	
	Magistrate Dare responded as follows:
	


“I accept that. It is a technical argument that is raised by the defence, it is a technical defence that is raised by the defence but that does not deprive it of its legitimacy. Factually I accept all that I have heard and I hear and understand your submissions. It is a technical point that has been technically taken but it is not to be criticised simply for that. That is what so many of these arguments in the law are all about.”


	
	His Honour then purported to deliver reasons and make a final order as follows:
	


“I think s 24 [sic, cl 24] of the regulations specifically provides – it refers specifically to its applicability to s 99 [sic, Part 9], so your s 99 [sic, Part 9] is validly made but for s 24 [sic, cl 24] of the regs point. I do not think it is necessary to go into – I have got the benefit of all the things here, I would be inclined in the exercise of my discretion to exclude the evidence because of that very narrow – I mean, I have my own feelings about it. If I was looking strictly at the facts of it – and no doubt what common sense cries out to be done, but the point is validly taken and validly made and I accept your submissions. Not without some misgivings I find the defendant not guilty.

Don’t drink and drive again, Mr Ridley, will you?”

 

The appeal


	
	It is common ground that the appeal ought be allowed and the matter remitted for determination according to law. Because there is a degree of overlap between particular grounds I propose to address the errors of law which I consider were made by the Magistrate.
	
	
	The starting point is s 38 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which requires proceedings for an offence, which include summary proceedings in the Local Court, to be conducted in accordance with the procedure in this Court for the trial of an indictable offence. Section 201 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as set out above, is also relevant and provides for a right to be heard as well as for the determination of the matter.
	


The voir dire


	
	The Magistrate was asked by the parties to determine the admissibility of the police brief, which was constituted by the statements of Senior Constables Carey and Holmes, on the voir dire. In order to fulfill this task, his Honour was obliged to:
	



	
	invite defendant’s counsel to identify, in respect to each part of the evidence objected to, the basis for the objection;
	
	
	obtain, where relevant, information from the prosecutor as to the purpose of the tender;
	
	
	hear submissions from both parties as to each objection;
	
	
	if s 137 of the Evidence Act applied, identify the probative value and the prejudicial effect, weigh them and decide whether the probative value is outweighed by the prejudicial effect thereby leading to the exclusion of the evidence; or whether it is not, thereby leading to the admission of the evidence and give sufficient reasons to explain the ruling: R v Harker [2004] NSWCCA 427 at [47] per Howie J, Santow JA and Bell J agreeing; see also R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 at [19]- [20] per Sheller JA;
	
	
	if s 138 of the Evidence Act applied, address the alleged illegality or lack of propriety as referred to in s 138(1) and s 138(2); take into account the matters referred to in s 138(3) and undertake an “evaluative and balancing exercise” (Beckett v R [2014] NSWCCA 305 at [68] per Beazley P, R A Hulme and Bellew JJ agreeing; see also Varty v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 304 at [37]- [38] per Adamson J) before making a ruling and giving reasons for such ruling;
	
	
	make a ruling on the admissibility of evidence objected to, either by admitting it, rejecting it, or admitting it for limited purposes; and
	
	
	give reasons for each ruling in sufficient detail to deal with the objection.
	



	
	In the present case his Honour failed to require defence counsel to identify with particularity the parts of the evidence objected to and failed to make any ruling on those parts of the evidence. His Honour’s reasons included an omnibus ruling which did not differentiate between parts of the evidence or the different bases on which objection was taken. His Honour also failed to give reasons for the ruling. His Honour omitted all the steps referred to above as being required in a voir dire, other than to make a decision to exclude the (unspecified) evidence. The reasons his Honour gave were both insufficient and incomprehensible. The hearing was not one that was conducted as required by law.
	
	
	Having regard to the submissions of the parties in the Local Court, his Honour was obliged to do the following on the voir dire.
	


The defendant’s objection to the road side breath test


	
	The Magistrate was obliged to ascertain on what basis the evidence of the road side breath test was tendered. There were potentially two bases on which it was relevant:
	



	
	to establish, by reference to the results of the test (a positive reading of 0.160g/210L of breath), that the defendant was intoxicated while he was driving the vehicle; and
	
	
	to establish that the defendant’s arrest and conveyance to the police station for the purposes of breath analysis was lawful under cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act.
	



	
	The relevance of basis (1) to proof of the offence charged is plain. The only relevance of basis (2) was to establish that cl 40 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act did not prevent the defendant’s being charged for an offence against s 112 of the 2013 Act. While s 137 of the Evidence Act would be engaged if the evidence were tendered on basis (1), it would not be if the evidence were tendered on basis (2). The argument that the roadside breath test ought be excluded on the ground that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect depended on the results of the test being relied on to establish intoxication, rather than as part of the narrative which led to the breath analysis at the police station to establish that cl 40(2) did not prevent the charge being laid.
	
	
	It appears from the transcript that the prosecutor was relying on the road side breath test as an “indicator” and then submitted that it led to the defendant’s being arrested for the purposes of breath analysis (at the police station). Accordingly, it would seem (although it is not entirely clear) that the prosecutor was relying on the road side breath test only on basis (2).
	
	
	The Magistrate erred in law in failing to confirm the basis on which the evidence was tendered and in failing to address the objection following that confirmation. If s 137 applied (because basis (1) was relied upon), his Honour erred in failing to identify the probative value of such evidence and its prejudicial effect and in failing to give reasons for considering that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. If the evidence was tendered solely on basis (2), his Honour could have admitted the evidence but confined its use to proof of what occurred at the police station for the purposes of cl 40 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act.
	


The defendant’s objection to evidence of what occurred at the police station


	
	The Magistrate was obliged to ascertain the purpose of the tender of evidence of what occurred at the police station. There were potentially two purposes:
	



	
	To show that the defendant was intoxicated at the police station and, accordingly, that he had been intoxicated while driving, since he had not consumed alcohol in the interim; or
	
	
	As part of the narrative to show that cl 40 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act did not prevent the defendant’s being charged for an offence against s 112(1)(a) of the 2013 Act.
	



	
	The police prosecutor confirmed on a number of occasions in the course of the hearing that the only purpose of the tender of evidence relating to what occurred at the police station was related to “double jeopardy”; in other words, to whether the defendant could be charged with the offence against s 112(1)(a) of driving while under the influence. Absent a concession by the defendant (and no such concession is evident from the transcript), it was necessary for the police prosecutor to establish that the defendant could lawfully be charged with an offence against s 112(1) because he did not fall within the prohibition in cl 40(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act. This involved proving, in the present case, that, although the defendant had been required to submit to a breath test, and, as a consequence, to submit to a breath analysis (cl 40(2)(a) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act), he did not submit to the breath analysis in accordance with the directions of a police officer (cl 40(2)(b) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act). Indeed, in the present case, there was no breath analysis at all.
	
	
	I reject Mr Hutchings’ submission in this Court that “the only relevant evidence” was what occurred at the road side, since this submission fails to take account of the need for the prosecutor to prove the matter set out above (that the defendant could be charged with an offence against s 112(1)(a)), absent a concession.
	
	
	In these circumstances, his Honour failed to appreciate that, even if Part 9 of LEPRA otherwise applied, the alleged failure to comply with Part 9 was irrelevant in light of the limited purpose for which the evidence was tendered. There was, accordingly, no need to consider the exercise of the discretion to exclude improperly obtained evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act.
	


The defendant’s objection to evidence of the demand made of the defendant at the police station that he provide a sample of breath for analysis


	
	There was evidence that the demand made of the defendant at the police station referred to the 1999 Act, rather than the 2013 Act. In order to deal with the defendant’s submissions that evidence ought be excluded on that basis, it was necessary for the Magistrate to ascertain the purpose of the tender of evidence of the demand and the effect of the repealed legislation being identified. Since no samples were obtained following the demand, there was no basis for a submission that any samples had been unlawfully obtained and ought therefore be excluded in the exercise of the discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act. I have been unable to identify any other relevant basis for the tender of the evidence, apart from the purpose of establishing the narrative of what occurred at the police station for the purposes of cl 40 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act.
	
	
	I have been unable to identify what ruling, if any, the Magistrate made concerning the demand for the sample and what effect it had on his Honour’s decision.
	


The obligations of counsel on a voir dire


	
	The obligations of counsel with respect to the admissibility of evidence were summarised in the following passage (footnotes omitted) from Cross on Evidence at [1645], (cited with approval in Adamson v Ede [2009] NSWCA 379 at [97] per Campbell JA, Giles and Hodgson JJA agreeing):
	


“It is common for most evidence in a trial to be tendered without objection and without debate about its admissibility. If a doubt arises, counsel should make it clear that a tender or question is pressed. Hence, not infrequently, when a question is asked by one party's counsel and the other says ‘I object’, the first says either ‘I press it’ or ‘I withdraw it’. If the tender or question is pressed, its legitimacy may then be considered. In short, it is necessary that a party's counsel protect the party's interests in relation to an appeal by ‘formally’ tendering the evidence and obtaining a judicial ruling on it. When inadmissible evidence is tendered, or a question is asked which may elicit inadmissible evidence, it is the duty of counsel who opposes its reception to object at once. . . . The objection should be made with precision, both as to what is objected to and (if the court requires it) what the specific grounds of objection are. The tendering party should be equally specific. ‘It is for a party tendering evidence to make clear to the trial judge the purpose for which the evidence is tendered and how it becomes relevant and admissible’.”


	
	The obligations on counsel correspond, in large measure, with the correlative duties of the judicial officer to identify the purpose of the tender of evidence; the basis of the objection (and whether the objection is confined to its use for a particular purpose); and any relevant discretion.
	
	
	In the present case, the scope and basis for the objections were not, in my view, made sufficiently clear to the Magistrate by counsel for the defendant. Although the prosecutor on a number of occasions properly identified the relevance of the evidence and the purpose of its tender (particularly in relation to cl 40 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act), the gravamen of the prosecutor’s statements does not appear to have been appreciated by the Magistrate, or taken into account by counsel for the defendant. These matters do not lessen the gravity of the errors of law made by the Magistrate on the voir dire. Nonetheless they illustrate the importance of counsel discharging the duties set out above for the purposes of assisting the Court to perform its functions.
	
	
	I do not, however, suggest that counsel was in any way implicated in the Magistrate’s decision to roll up the voir dire with the hearing of the proceedings and skip over the various steps set out below that were required to be taken to hear and determine the proceedings according to law.
	


The hearing of the proceedings


	
	Upon completion of the voir dire his Honour was obliged, having ascertained that the defendant did not plead guilty to the offence charged, to hear and determine the matter: s 194 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This required the Magistrate to comply with s 195 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the way in which evidence is to be taken, and s 202 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the determination of the matter.
	
	
	The hearing and determination of the matter required the Magistrate to take the following steps:
	



	
	inviting the police prosecutor to adduce in the proceedings such of the evidence as had been admitted following the voir dire (including tender of documents and examination and cross-examination of witnesses, as required by s 195 of the Criminal Procedure Act);
	
	
	inquiring whether there was any further evidence on which the prosecution relied and dealing with any such further evidence;
	
	
	confirming that the prosecution had closed its case (Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald [2004] NSWSC 182 at [23] per Sully J);
	
	
	asking the defence counsel whether he submitted that there was no case to answer: Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald at [24] per Sully J;
	
	
	if so, determining whether there was a prima facie case on the basis of the principles in May v O’Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658;
	
	
	if a finding was made that there was a prima facie case (or if there is no submission that there is no case to answer), inviting defendant’s counsel to tender any evidence in the defendant’s case: Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald at [26]- [27] per Sully J;
	
	
	inquiring whether there was any prosecution evidence in reply and, if so, hearing that evidence;
	
	
	hearing closing submissions;
	
	
	making a decision, on the basis of the evidence that had been admitted, whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and, accordingly, whether to convict the person or to dismiss the charge (s 202 of the Criminal Procedure Act);
	
	
	giving sufficient, comprehensible reasons for the decision and making orders accordingly; and
	
	
	complying with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act relating to making a record of conviction or issuing a certificate of an order for dismissal.
	



	
	The Magistrate wholly failed to undertake any of steps (1) – (8). His Honour purported to undertake step (9) by excluding all the evidence (including that to which no objection had been taken) and dismissing the charge. As to step (10) his Honour’s reasons were manifestly inadequate to explain what his Honour had done, or why he had done it. The fundamental errors of law included a failure to accord procedural fairness to the prosecution since the Magistrate dismissed the charge without hearing from the prosecutor.
	
	
	Ms Davidson, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, submitted that one possibility was that the Magistrate ought be regarded as having dismissed the charge on the basis that his Honour found that there was no case to answer. She referred to Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Wililo [2012] NSWSC 713, in which Johnson J construed the decision appealed from as a decision to dismiss the charge on the basis that there was no prima facie case. I do not consider that it is possible to construe the Magistrate’s decision in the present case in that way. Indeed, I do not understand Mr Hutchings to have made a no case submission in the Local Court. He appears to have accepted that there would be evidence (to which no objection was taken) of the officers’ observations of the defendant’s demeanour and his manner of driving the car before he was stopped and required to undertake the breath test. There was no submission that this evidence, taken at its highest, was incapable of establishing every element of the offence charged. Indeed, the time for making such a submission had not arrived since the whole of the proceedings concerned the voir dire.
	
	
	Even if this was, contrary to my view, what the Magistrate thought he was doing, he was in error in failing to make specific rulings on the evidence objected to; in failing to take into account the evidence to which no objection had been made, as well as the evidence that had been allowed; in failing to hear from the parties on the question; and in failing to set out in his reasons what he was doing or the basis for his decision.
	


The individual grounds of appeal


	
	For reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the order made by the Magistrate must be set aside and the matter remitted to be determined according to law. It is, however, necessary for me to address the individual grounds of appeal, which I propose to do largely by reference to the reasons I have already given.
	


Ground 1: failure to comply with s 202(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act


	
	For the reasons given above, this ground has been made out.
	


Ground 2: excluding evidence without identifying which evidence was excluded or the basis for the exclusion


	
	For the reasons given above, this ground has been made out.
	


Ground 3: failing to provide adequate reasons for excluding the evidence or for dismissing the proceedings


	
	For the reasons given above, this ground has been made out in both respects. While the application of s 138 of the Evidence Act was not fully argued in the Local Court, counsel for the defendant referred to the exclusion of evidence that was said to be “improperly obtained” on the bases: first, of alleged failure to comply with Part 9 of LEPRA as modified by reason of the defendant’s status as a vulnerable person under cl 24 of LEPRR; and, secondly, by reason of the circumstance that the 1999 Act was referred to. The Magistrate referred several times to a “technical point” having been made by reference to cl 24, which indicated that his Honour considered that some of the evidence relied on by the prosecution was obtained improperly or in contravention of LEPRA. If some of the evidence objected to was excluded on the basis of s 138 of the Evidence Act, his Honour failed to comply with the section (which included a failure to address the mandatory relevant considerations in s 138(3)) and failed to give adequate reasons for his decision (including failing to identify the evidence excluded on that basis).
	
	
	His Honour also failed to give sufficient reasons for dismissing the proceedings and therefore the second aspect of ground 3 has been made out. However, in the circumstances of the present case, no reasons, however detailed, could have justified the dismissal of the proceedings before the Magistrate had undertaken the steps set out above. His Honour had neither identified what evidence had been excluded (much less what remained), nor enquired of Mr Hutchings whether he accepted that there was a case to answer.
	


Ground 4: excluding evidence from the proceedings and dismissing the proceedings


	
	For the reasons given above, this ground has been made out in so far as it alleges that the Magistrate erred in excluding evidence from the proceedings. It has also, for reasons already given, been made out in so far as it alleges that the Magistrate dismissed the proceedings. His Honour, as set out above, failed to accord procedural fairness to the prosecutor, and failed to undertake the steps set out above.
	
	
	Moreover, the Magistrate’s reasons failed to address in any way the evidence of the police officers to which no objection was taken. There was no consideration of whether this evidence amounted to a case to answer (even if it were contended that it did not) or whether it was sufficient to discharge the onus.
	
	
	Even if all evidence of observations of the defendant by the officers at the police station had been excluded, the balance of the evidence of both Senior Constable Carey and Senior Constable Holmes was not objected to. This evidence comprised their observations of: the defendant’s erratic driving of his vehicle, including across centre lines; the smell of liquor when close to the defendant; the defendant’s slurred words and difficulty balancing; and Senior Constable Carey’s evidence of her conversation with the defendant at the time of conducting the random breath test. Not only their observations but also their impressions that the defendant was intoxicated were admissible: R v Whitby (1957) 74 WN (NSW) 441. Counsel for the defence accepted that the observations made by the police officers were not in dispute, and acknowledged there was no dispute that the defendant was driving the vehicle, as well as that there was “a degree of intoxication”. There was, accordingly, evidence capable of making out the elements of the offence, which could not reasonably be regarded as “inherently incredible” (see Haw Tua Tua v Public Prosecutor [1982] 1 AC 136 at 151). If this evidence was accepted the defendant could have been lawfully convicted of the offence charged.
	
	
	Therefore, even if (contrary to the view I have expressed above) his Honour is to be understood as having determined that there was no case to answer, his Honour was in error in so finding and erred in dismissing the proceedings.
	


Additional question: whether Part 9 of LEPRA applied


	
	The question whether Part 9 of LEPRA applied to the defendant was relevant to the appropriate costs order in these proceedings, as set out below.
	
	
	Mr Hutchings submitted in the Local Court that Part 9 of LEPRA applied in its modified form because the defendant was a “vulnerable person”. He contended that the police were in breach of Part 9 because they did not provide a support person for the defendant at the police station (if not earlier) before requiring that he submit a sample for breath analysis. In the Local Court, the prosecutor submitted that Part 9 of LEPRA did not apply because the defendant was arrested by police under the power conferred by cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act. The Magistrate appears to have accepted Mr Hutchings’ submissions.
	
	
	In this Court Mr Hutchings accepted that the defendant was lawfully arrested pursuant to cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act. However, he contended that the real reason for the defendant’s arrest may have been “for an offence” and that he was therefore entitled to the protections afforded by Part 9 of LEPRA to “vulnerable persons”. He accepted that he had not put the argument in that way before the Local Court and contended that the time for the determination of that question had not arisen since the police officers had not yet been called to give evidence and he had not yet had an opportunity to cross-examine them about the purpose of the arrest.
	
	
	Ms Davidson contended that there was no evidence before the Magistrate that the defendant was under arrest for an offence. She submitted that the construction of cl 4(2) of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act, cl 24 and Part 9 of LEPRA (as modified in Division 3 of LEPRR) for which Mr Hutchings contended in this Court would be at odds with the plain meaning of the statutory words and, in particular, s 113(1)(b) of LEPRA. She also submitted that such a construction would tend to defeat the purpose of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act, and thwart the operation of the deeming provisions (in cl 31 of Sch 3 of the 2013 Act). Ms Davidson further contended that, in any event, no provision of Part 9 would apply to the road side breath test or to any part of the evidence prior to the arrival of the defendant at the police station.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff sought an order for costs on the following three bases:
	



	
	The ordinary principle that costs ought follow the event;
	
	
	The defendant’s counsel contributed to the Magistrate’s errors by propounding an interpretation of LEPRA which was erroneous; and
	
	
	The timing of the concession that the appeal ought be allowed (which was made only a few days before the hearing date).
	



	
	The defendant resisted the costs order and submitted that the construction of LEPRA for which he contended was arguable and its correctness ought not be determined in the present appeal because it was not argued below. Mr Hutchings also submitted that, as the defendant has Asperger’s, the delay in making the concession could be seen to arise, at least in part, from the difficulties encountered in obtaining instructions.
	
	
	I do not propose to express a view on whether Mr Hutchings’ contention concerning Part 9 of LEPRA is arguable since the point was not raised before the Magistrate and I consider that, irrespective of the merits of this point, the defendant ought pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings.
	
	
	On 1 October 2015, the defendant filed detailed written submissions in which Mr Hutchings sought to defend the Magistrate’s decision and contended that none of the appeal grounds was made out. In the written submissions Mr Hutchings contended that the Magistrate had “plainly excluded all of the police brief” and that his Honour was entitled to do so. This submission was made, notwithstanding that, in the Court below, he had not objected to the police statements in so far as they related to road side events and had conceded that the defendant had been driving and that there was some degree of intoxication. Mr Hutchings also submitted in writing that: “It is plain that that evidence [the evidence of the officers] was not capable of sustaining a verdict of guilty” even though he must have appreciated that the proceedings had only reached the voir dire stage at the time the Magistrate purported to dismiss the proceedings. Moreover, it is difficult to see how it could be said that the evidence of the police officers, if accepted, was not capable of proving the charge.
	
	
	Whatever the difficulties in obtaining instructions from the defendant might have been, his legal representatives were prepared to make detailed written submissions defending the Magistrate’s decision, which have largely been abandoned.
	
	
	The defendant’s concession that the appeal ought be allowed was communicated to my Associate the day before the hearing date and only a few days earlier to the plaintiff.
	
	
	I am persuaded that it is appropriate to order that the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs, having regard to the lateness of the concession and the ordinary principle that costs ought follow the event.
	


Whether there should be a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 (NSW)


	
	For the reasons given above, I do not propose to determine the argument about whether Part 9 of LEPRA can apply in circumstances such as the present, notwithstanding express statutory wording that it be excluded. However, I consider that the defendant’s objections to evidence ought to have been formulated with greater precision in the Court below. I do not, however, regard the defendant’s conduct of the proceedings as contributing in any significant way to the Magistrate’s errors since neither party could have foreseen that the Magistrate would do other than make rulings on the evidence at the conclusion of the voir dire before proceeding to the next stage of the hearing.
	
	
	In these circumstances I am persuaded that it is appropriate to grant an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal to this Court pursuant to s 6(1)(a) of the Suitors’ Fund Act. I note that the plaintiff does not oppose the grant of the certificate.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Set aside the order of Magistrate Dare made on 30 January 2015 at the West Wyalong Local Court dismissing the charge against the defendant for the offence of drive vehicle under the influence of alcohol (first offence) contrary to s 112(1)(a) Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW).
	
	
	Remit the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.
	
	
	Order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings in this Court.
	
	
	Grant an indemnity certificate to the defendant in respect of the appeal to this Court pursuant to s 6(1)(a) of the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 (NSW).

2767948,Cornwell v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 269,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: At the hearing of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court made orders resentencing the applicant in the manner explained by Hall J, but reserved its reasons.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing, submissions focused on three issues, namely (a) whether evidence of the diagnosis of Huntington’s disease, made after the applicant was sentenced, could and should be admitted on the appeal; (b) whether the evidence demonstrated reduced moral culpability at the time of the offending and, (c) whether the evidence justified a reduction in sentence because of the harsher conditions of imprisonment as a result of the new diagnosis.
	
	
	The further evidence was duly admitted at the hearing of the application for leave to appeal. I gratefully adopt Hall J’s reasons for taking that course.
	
	
	With respect to the conditions of imprisonment, the evidence also demonstrated a deterioration, post sentence, in the applicant’s physical and psychological health. Those circumstances would not of themselves justify interference with the sentence; however, in the present case the deterioration was shown to derive from a condition which existed at the time of sentencing and which, had the new evidence been presented to the sentencing judge, would have provided a basis for a reduction in the sentence imposed. Again, I adopt Hall J’s reasons as reflecting the basis of the order made.
	
	
	The second issue raised on appeal was whether the diagnosis of Huntington’s disease would, if provided at the hearing on sentence, have demonstrated a reduced level of moral culpability, thus diminishing the weight to be given to both personal deterrence and general deterrence.
	
	
	A psychological assessment report of Ms Helen Gibson, which was before the sentencing judge, identified a degree of cognitive impairment, with a possible explanation being Huntington’s disease. Ms Gibson had noted that Huntington’s disease is a neurologically degenerative disease which can lead to impairment in reasoning ability and to impulsive behaviour. Counsel appearing for the offender had described the offences as “stupid” and the manner of their execution as “ham-fisted”. However, without a diagnosis and a medical explanation of the effects of the disease, he had been unable to demonstrate more than a speculative connection between the offender’s behaviour and his possible mental condition.
	
	
	Before this Court, the prosecutor submitted that the connection remained tenuous. There were a number of difficulties facing the applicant in seeking to rely on his condition as diminishing his moral culpability. First, his record suggested that the offences were far from being an isolated or impulsive act. Secondly, the offences were carried out with others who presumably had no similar explanation for their behaviour. Thirdly, the nature of the offending, inept as it was, was not uncommon. Fourthly, while the characteristics described in the medical evidence may be accepted as features of the specific condition, their causative connection with the offending remained somewhat vague.
	
	
	Accordingly, although I accept that the diagnosis would, on the balance of probabilities, have warranted some reduction in the weight given to personal deterrence, the more powerful factors favouring intervention in the present case concerned the effect of his conditions of imprisonment. I therefore agree with the reasons of Hall J.
	
	
	HALL J: The applicant applied for leave to appeal against a sentence which was imposed by his Honour Judge Blackmore SC in the District Court at East Maitland on 24 October 2013.
	
	
	A Notice of Intention for Leave to Appeal was filed within the required time but the Notice lapsed in December 2014. The application for an extension of time to appeal is made pursuant to s 10(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	The application seeking leave to extend time was not opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing of the application before this Court on 14 September 2015, orders were made with reasons to follow on a later date. The orders were as follows:
	



	
	Extend time within which the applicant may seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court;
	
	
	Admit the evidence not before the sentencing judge as to the applicant’s current medical condition;
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Set aside the sentence imposed on the applicant in the District Court;
	
	
	Sentence the applicant to an aggregate sentence of four years and six months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years and six months to date from 24 October 2013. The non-parole period will therefore expire on 23 April 2016.
	



	
	The relevant matters concerning the application and the reasons for the above orders are set out below.
	


The Sentence


	
	The applicant was sentenced in relation to the following offences:
	



	
	One offence of steal motor vehicle pursuant to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	Two offences of aggravated break and enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely, larceny, pursuant to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
	



	
	The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 5 years 3 months imprisonment to date from 24 October 2013 with a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 23 October 2016.
	
	
	The offence of steal motor vehicle carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The offence of aggravated break and enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years.
	


Fresh Evidence


	
	At the hearing on 14 September 2015, Mr H White of Counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant, applied for leave to rely upon the following affidavits:
	


Affidavit of Jason Cornwell, applicant, affirmed 5 August 2015.

Affidavit of Jason Cornwell, applicant, affirmed 7 September 2015.

Affidavit of Alan Cornwell, brother of the applicant, affirmed 4 August 2015.

Affidavit of Tammy Maree Hilditch, partner of Alan Cornwell, affirmed 4 August 2015.

Affidavit of John Pearson, solicitor, affirmed 28 may 2015.

Affidavit of John Pearson affirmed 10 August 2015.

Affidavit of John Pearson affirmed 11 August 2015.

Affidavit of John Pearson affirmed 8 September 2015.


	
	In addition, the applicant relied upon the report of Dr Williams (neurologist) which was annexed to Mr Pearson’s affidavit sworn 10 August 2015.
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon the report of Dr Colebatch (neurologist) dated 11 February 2015, a copy of which was Annexure B to the affidavit of Mr Pearson sworn 28 May 2015.
	
	
	The Crown objected to the affidavit evidence sought to be read at the hearing: (T 2).
	
	
	In the Crown’s written submissions, at [6]-[11], reference was made to established principles by which the admissibility of fresh or new evidence is to be determined. The Crown submitted that before such evidence will be admitted it must be shown that the sentencing process, in the absence of such evidence, has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Reference was made in that respect to observations made in Fordham v R (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 per Howie AJ (Hunt CJ at CL and Smart J agreeing). Reference was also made to the principle that where evidence was available to the applicant at the time of sentencing a miscarriage of justice would rarely result even if the evidence may possibly have had an impact upon the sentence passed. The question as to availability of evidence as to the diagnosis of the applicant’s medical condition, namely, Huntington’s disease, as at the date of sentencing is discussed below.
	
	
	The Crown referred to an exception to the principles governing the admissibility of fresh evidence in cases where an applicant seeks to rely on a medical condition. In that respect, evidence of particular facts or circumstances, as they existed at the time of sentencing, even if not known, or imperfectly understood, at that time, has been admitted where the interests of justice have so dictated: Khoury v R (2011) 209 A Crim R 509 at [113] per Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing).
	
	
	In the present application, however, the Crown submitted that application of relevant principles does not support the admissibility of the new or fresh evidence which the applicant sought to rely upon. It was observed that the decision to admit fresh evidence remained a discretionary one and that the reasons for the evidence not having been tendered in the sentence hearing will be relevant: Khoury v R, supra, at [121].
	
	
	The submissions for the Crown will be further detailed below.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	Two Grounds of Appeal were relied upon in support of the application. They were in the following terms:
	


Ground 1: The sentence proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances resulting in an unjust sentence being imposed.

Ground 2: The aggregate sentence which was imposed in relation to all of the offences was manifestly excessive.


	
	It was noted in the written submissions for the applicant that although, at the time of sentence, there had existed symptomatology of Huntington’s disease referred to in the report of a Ms Gibson, Psychologist, which was tendered at the sentencing hearing, there was no evidence before the sentencing judge that established that the applicant at that time in fact suffered from Huntington’s disease. The applicant had, for reasons discussed below, been reluctant to be tested for the disease.
	
	
	In his written submissions on behalf of the applicant, Mr White stated that the applicant did not assert error on the part of the sentencing judge in relation to the sentencing process. He did, however, assert that the sentencing proceeded upon an erroneous view of the factual circumstances. In that respect reliance was placed upon the fact that, at the time he was sentenced, the applicant was suffering from Huntington’s disease but that the disease had not been taken into account on sentence, in the circumstances to which I have referred, namely the absence of evidence concerning the same, the applicant having decided against undergoing testing that would establish the diagnosis.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon his Outline of Submissions filed 28 May 2015 and an Outline of Further Submissions filed 25 August 2015. The Crown relied upon its submissions filed on 7 September 2015. Both parties’ written submissions were supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing on 14 September 2015.
	


Sentencing Proceedings


	
	The sentence hearing took place on 24 October 2013 and the applicant was sentenced on that date. As noted above, the report of Ms Helen Gibson, Psychologist, was tendered on the applicant’s behalf on that occasion by his then counsel, Mr Booth. The report recorded the following observations at p 2:
	


“…It was notable at interview that Mr Cornwell displayed intermittent bodily twitches consistently. This twitching was perplexing in isolation, however during discussions at interview it was revealed that Mr Cornwell’s mother died from Huntington’s Disease and, additionally, Mr Cornwell’s older brother has also developed the disease. Huntington’s disease is a genetically transmitted disease which inevitably proves fatal within 10-20 years of onset, and for which there is currently no effective treatment.”


	
	Ms Gibson outlined further some characteristics of the disease before recording at p 3:
	


“Mr Cornwell stated that he has not been screened for the disease as he would prefer not to face the possibility of a positive diagnosis. Mr Cornwell added that the reason he has not fathered any children is because of the likelihood of passing on the gene as there is apparently an approximate 50% chance of the gene transmitting to any children of gene carriers.

Given that Mr Cornwell exhibited marked physical twitching during interview, I am of the opinion that it may be useful to request that Mr Cornwell be further evaluated with respect to the possibility of cognitive impairment/decline. This may be undertaken either by way of assessment by a Psychiatrist and/or other medical investigations as may be deemed appropriate by the Court in order to clarify whether Mr Cornwell’s offending behaviours may be attributable either wholly or in part to the presence/progression of Huntington’s disease.”


	
	During the sentence hearing the possibility that the applicant may be suffering from Huntington’s disease was raised by Mr Booth on the basis of Ms Gibson’s observations. In making submissions on his behalf, Mr Booth stated that the applicant had:
	


“…instructed us not to entertain any further investigation of the possibility of Huntington’s disease being within his genetic make up. That’s explained in the report, and perhaps is quite understandable…” (T 24 October 2013 at p 3).


	
	Mr Booth later stated:
	


“He’s aware that he’s going to spend a considerable period in custody. Notwithstanding that, he did not wish to ride on the coat tails of this illness that seems to genetically afflict his family. He does not want to know, and no amount of telling him that it may assist him would change his mind.”


	
	In these circumstances, the sentencing judge was correct not to take the disease into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Because no error is alleged on the part of the sentencing judge, I do not consider it to be necessary to detail further his Remarks on Sentence. 
	


Leave to Adduce Fresh Evidence


	
	In Turkmani v R [2014] NSWCCA 186, this Court considered a ground of appeal in respect to which the applicant sought leave to adduce fresh evidence as to his health and what was contended to be inadequate medical treatment in custody for a pre-existing leg injury.
	
	
	The Court referred (at [65]) to the following statement by King CJ in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588:
	


“While the evidence sought to be admitted on this appeal in a sense establishes the occurrence of events occurring after the passing of sentence, it does so for the purpose of explaining the full extent and implications of the appellant’s condition of health which existed at the time of sentence. I think that the authorities show that it is permissible to have regard to events occurring after sentence for the purpose of showing the true significance of facts which were in existence at the time of sentence.”


	
	The Court in Turkmani went on to state at [66]:
	


“Three examples of the application of this principle are as follows. Firstly where the offender was only diagnosed as suffering from a disease or condition after sentence but was infected or affected at the time of sentence (e.g. HIV/AIDS as in Bailey v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 458 at 462). Secondly where, although symptoms of a particular condition may have been present, their significance was not appreciated at the time of sentencing (Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 (“Iglesias”); see Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13 at [3] per McClellan CJ at CL) (“Springer”). Thirdly where a person was sentenced on the expectation that they would receive a particular level of medical care and attention in custody but they did not (R v Keir [2004] NSWCCA 106; Springer id).”


	
	After detailing the fresh evidence in the case before them, the Court in Turkmani at [81]-[82] observed:
	


“The criteria for the admission of such evidence is not entirely clear. In R v Ashton [2002] NSWCCA 498; 137 A Crim R 73 at 76 Howie J stated that the Court receives evidence concerning events subsequent to sentencing which concern ""the physical or mental condition of the applicant where the existence or effect of that condition was unknown or not fully appreciated at the time sentence was passed"". However his Honour also noted (at 77) that the admission of such material was conditioned by the need for the circumstances to be ""special and unusual"" (citing R v Ehrenburgh (Supreme Court (NSW), 14 December 1990, unrep); see also R v Kertebani; Kertebani v R [2010] NSWCCA 221 at [37] to [39]).

In Iglesias at [12] such evidence was admitted without the Court specifically adverting to whether it was ""special"" or ""unusual"". McClellan CJ at CL dealt with the material as follows:

""[12]   I am satisfied in the present case that the circumstances justify this Court in receiving the fresh evidence. Although the applicant had complained of symptoms which were clearly related to his carcinoma, his condition had not been diagnosed at the time of sentence. It was only a matter of weeks before the correct diagnosis was made which revealed a significantly adverse medical situation. However, whether, having regard to the facts which are now known, this Court should intervene raises different considerations.

[13]   Critical to that question is whether or not, by reason of the medical condition of the applicant as it is now understood, his period of incarceration will be more onerous than was appreciated when he was sentenced, justifying any reduction in his non-parole period. This requires consideration of his physical condition, the availability of medical facilities and whether he can be adequately treated within the prison system."" (emphasis added)


	
	The present case falls within either the first or second category of case identified by this Court in Turkmani (at [28]) in that the applicant’s condition was unknown, it not having been formally diagnosed as at the date of the sentencing hearing, despite the applicant being symptomatic (according to the report of Ms Gibson) and there being indications that he may have then suffered from Huntington’s disease.
	
	
	In the present appeal, both parties acknowledged the general principle that parties will not normally be able to produce fresh or new evidence on appeal and the importance of the principle of finality. It was also acknowledged by the applicant and the Crown that evidence as to a medical condition may form the basis for an exception to the general principle of receiving evidence on appeal and that this has been confirmed by Turkmani, Khoury and the earlier cases of Iglesias and Springer as well as the decision of Dudgeon v R [2014] NSWCCA 301, a case where the applicant was terminally ill with cancer in which Fullerton J (Beazley P and Hidden J agreeing) stated at [23]:
	


“I am also satisfied, that the jurisdiction of this Court is properly invoked and it was appropriate to receive the full complement of the applicant's medical records as fresh evidence on the appeal (including the materials furnished after the hearing of the appeal) and to reopen the question of an appropriate sentence in light of that evidence, including evidence bearing upon the circumstances which will make the applicant's continued incarceration more burdensome than would be the case were he in good health (see Iglesias v R … at [1]-[13]). Were I not persuaded that the applicant's terminal illness predated the date of sentencing, this Court would have no jurisdiction to receive fresh evidence bearing on his medical condition or to move to re-sentence on the basis of that evidence. Where a terminal illness is diagnosed after sentence and cannot be shown on the available medical evidence to have been extant at the date of sentence, the custodial conditions a prisoner in that situation may have to endure is a matter for the executive (see R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186; 216 A Crim R 152 at [124]-[126]).”


	
	In the abovementioned circumstances, the Court granted leave to the applicant to rely upon fresh evidence in support of the application for leave to appeal.
	


The Fresh Evidence


	
	Dr Williams, neurologist, had before him when preparing his report certain documents including a report of Dr James Colebatch dated 11 February 2015, a previous report of Dr Colebatch dated 28 July 2014, Justice Health Notes and a draft version of the applicant’s Affidavit.
	
	
	The critical medical evidence in relation to the applicant is to be found in the reports of Dr Colebatch and Dr Williams. Dr Williams also gave oral evidence at the hearing on 14 September 2015.
	


Dr Colebatch


	
	Dr Colebatch is a consultant neurologist who diagnosed the applicant with Huntington’s disease following DNA testing for the Huntington’s gene abnormality. That diagnosis is one of the post-sentencing events relied upon by the applicant. Dr Colebatch made a number of observations about the disease at p 2 of his report dated 11 February 2015 as follows:
	



	
	Huntington’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder affecting movement as well as cognitive and psychiatric function.
	
	
	Prognosis is for a shorter life expectancy and a figure of 10‑25 years has been suggested following diagnosis.
	
	
	Death is most commonly the result of aspiration pneumonia or complications of immobility.
	
	
	Patients are typically cared for at a specialised clinic at Westmead Hospital.
	
	
	The onset of the disease may involve psychiatric or behavioural disturbances, or neurological symptoms, or both. Symptoms in the former category may include lack of inhibition leading to socially inappropriate behavior, disorganisation, apathy, depression and paranoia.
	
	
	Dr Williams 
	



	
	Dr Williams provided his written opinion on 10 August 2015 following a request by the applicant’s legal representatives. In relation to the general characteristics and symptoms of the disease, he gave similar information to Dr Colebatch. His report contained the following general observations:
	



	
	The most obvious manifestation of Huntington’s disease is chorea, an involuntary movement which interferes with the sufferer’s voluntary movements (p 1).
	
	
	The cognitive disturbances and symptoms suffered are more variable than the involuntary movements, which can be stereotyped. The psychiatric manifestations are “protean” (p 1). Cognitive and psychiatric manifestations of Huntington’s disease vary according to the upbringing of the patient and particularly the behavior of symptomatic parents (p 2).
	



	
	Dr Williams also made specific findings in relation to the applicant’s medical condition. He considered that the applicant is likely to have been symptomatic from at least his early 20s, that is, for more than seven years prior to Dr Williams’ report. The applicant was exhibiting the “movement” symptoms of the disease by 2010 ‘at the latest’ (pp 3-4).
	
	
	Dr Williams gave an opinion as to whether the presence of Huntington’s disease could be considered to be a mitigating factor vis-a-vis the applicant’s criminality as he understood it to be. In this context he noted that in sufferers of Huntington’s disease “…the control of thinking, and insight into the consequences of contemplated actions, are progressively compromised” (p 4). Dr Williams stated that an adult who cannot “control their thinking” in the expected way:
	


“may fail to take into account pertinent aspects of the situation, fail to identify all possible actions, fail to imagine likely consequences of those actions, or fail to heed recognised social constraints…Mr Cornwall (sic) shows evidence of this cognitive dysfunction in his psychological assessment” (pp 4-5).


	
	Dr Williams considered that in the applicant’s case the consequences of his cognitive decline would be compounded by the fact that his cognitive function was well below average independent of the disease (p 5). After further detailing aspects of the applicant’s condition which, in his opinion, amounted to mitigating factors, Dr Williams concluded at p 7:
	


“The degree to which these mitigating factors can or should be taken into account is for the court to decide. However, if appropriate supervision of Mr Cornwell’s neurodegenerative condition can be provided outside of the penal system, I would regard that as the most appropriate management for a man with a recognised neurological disease, and poor long-term prognosis.”


	
	In his oral evidence, Dr Williams stated that the fact that a car was stolen by the applicant at the time of the offending the subject of the sentence “may represent repetitive behavior or inability to inhibit behavior which is one of the hallmarks of cognitive dysfunction in Huntington’s disease”: T 4:30-35. The attempt by the applicant to steal a cigarette machine indicated, in Dr Williams’ opinion, a “lack of judgment or a lack of planning…”: T 4:35-40.
	


Other Evidence


	
	The affidavit of Tammy Maree Hilditch, the partner of the applicant’s brother, included evidence as to the applicant’s family situation and particularly his mother’s condition and her incapacity as a result of suffering Huntington’s disease: Affidavit of Tammy Hilditch at [3]. Ms Hilditch also gave evidence in her affidavit at [7] as to the applicant’s condition as she perceived it and particularly his ability to talk which she stated has “gotten much worse” since he has been imprisoned and the fact that he walks in a manner which she views as “quite odd”’ The Affidavit of Alan Cornwell, the applicant’s brother, addressed similar issues.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 5 August 2015, the applicant gave evidence as to his mother’s condition and death. The evidence indicated that his mother had suffered from Huntington’s disease. At paragraphs [4]-[9] of his affidavit the applicant also provided evidence as to his symptoms and condition in custody. He said he has problems standing and walking and that he finds it difficult getting up and down stairs which he cannot avoid, as access to his cell requires the use of stairs. He stated that he trips over a lot, cannot write because of his twitching, experiences dizziness and has trouble swallowing. At [9] of his affidavit he stated that the gaol is a “work-based gaol” and that he had been put on light duties because of his illness. He stated that he cannot climb ladders or use power tools. He also stated that he was going to be moved at one stage to a lower security prison but that he was “not allowed to go there” because there were no medical staff to treat him at the alternative facility.
	
	
	In his second affidavit, dated 7 September 2015, the applicant stated that he had been “removed from work” until he was approved to work by medical staff. As such, he cannot earn any income in custody.
	
	
	A letter prepared by a social worker, John Conaghan, was annexed to the affidavit of John Pearson dated 11 August 2015. Mr Conaghan set out the applicant’s family history of Huntington’s disease as well as health and support services that the applicant could access for treatment as a sufferer of the disease.
	


Crown’s Case on Fresh Evidence


	
	The Crown relied upon two affidavits of Catherine Anne Williams dated 26 August 2015 and 8 September 2015. The first affidavit annexed a report from Senior Assistant Superintendent CP MacGregor dated 24 August 2015 which was endorsed by the Acting General Manager of the Cessnock Correctional Centre, Simon Raper. This report confirmed that the applicant had applied for consideration to be moved to a lower security correctional centre but that this did not eventuate because of the lack of medical support in the alternative facility. The report also confirmed that the applicant is unemployed as a result of his condition. In written submissions, the Crown relied upon the statement in the report that a soft food diet is available to the applicant, as is a cell on the ground floor of the gaol.
	
	
	Ms Williams’ second affidavit annexed a report of Dr Katerina Lagios of Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network dated 8 September 2015. In that report, Dr Lagios stated that the applicant had been referred to the Huntington’s Clinic at Westmead Hospital, where he has an appointment in October 2015. It was stated that the clinic would be involved in the long term management of his care. This would require that the applicant be transferred to a metropolitan centre where he would have better access to medical specialists.
	
	
	As noted above, the Crown in its written submissions relied upon the fact that the decision to admit fresh or new evidence is a discretionary one which, it argued, should not be exercised in this case given that:
	



	
	No error had been made by the sentencing judge and that the present application was not the appropriate avenue for addressing the issue concerning the applicant’s medical condition. The Crown submitted that the appropriate course was for it to be determined by the Executive, as the body responsible for his care requirements or his release to parole under s 160(1) Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.
	
	
	The applicant is bound by the actions of his counsel at the sentencing and his own instructions to not seek diagnosis.
	


Conclusion as to Admitting Fresh Evidence


	
	The Crown did not contend that the applicant had not suffered from Huntington’s disease at the time of the sentencing. As such, the comments of Fullerton J in Dudgeon referred to at [39] above are apposite.
	
	
	It is clear from the authorities discussed above that this Court has the power to admit the fresh evidence and that the intervention of the Executive is not the sole avenue available to him.
	
	
	I consider that the evidence establishes that the pre‑sentence instructions given by the applicant to his legal representatives, to the effect that he did not wish to undergo testing for Huntington’s disease, were justified by psychological factors and particularly the applicant’s stated fear of a positive diagnosis following his family’s experiences of living with the deteriorating condition. I accept the applicant’s statement to the psychologist, Ms Gibson, that he “has not been screened for the disease as he would prefer not to face the possibility of a positive diagnosis”. In these circumstances the applicant’s decision not to seek testing should not operate to his disadvantage in the determination of the present application.
	
	
	The authorities establish that fresh evidence and particularly fresh evidence as to medical conditions should be admitted where it is in the interests of justice to do so. The Court at the hearing on 14 September 2015 determined that the discretion should be exercised in this case in light of the unique psychological factors leading to the applicant’s decision to refuse testing for the disease prior to sentencing. Also taken into account was the fact that the applicant was clearly suffering from the disease at the time of sentencing, and that custody is likely to be more burdensome for him having regard to his particular circumstances.
	


Consideration – Re-Sentencing


	
	The applicant submitted that there were two ways in which his suffering from the disease, had it been known to the sentencing judge, may possibly have been relevant, namely:
	



	
	The effect of the disease on his rationality and understanding of his actions and in turn the objective seriousness of the offences committed.
	
	
	The likelihood of imprisonment being particularly onerous or burdensome on him and the possibility of him suffering increasing hardship as his condition deteriorates.
	



	
	Dr Williams’ report addressed the first issue, that is, whether the disease could be taken into account as a mitigating factor against the applicant’s criminality. Given the applicant’s lengthy criminal history and the young age at which he started offending, doubt exists as to whether the sentencing judge, had the medical evidence been available, would have considered it to have a bearing on the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	The ground that determined this Court’s intervention and re-sentencing of the applicant was the second issue. It has been necessary to undertake an assessment as to the extent to which the applicant’s condition has and will continue to make his time in custody more burdensome than it would be if he did not suffer from Huntington’s disease. The matters addressed in the affidavit evidence relied upon by the Crown did not provide a sufficient basis upon which the hardship could be adequately addressed.
	
	
	The applicant’s physical condition, in particular his symptoms established by the evidence, suggest that there has been some progressive deterioration in his mobility. This has caused him to trip and fall on occasion and has resulted in his inability to climb stairs and ladders. The latter effect has meant that the applicant cannot work which, on the evidence, can be considered as adversely impacting on his psychological welfare.
	
	
	One psychological effect of Huntington’s disease identified by both Dr Colebatch and Dr Williams as common to those who suffer from the disease is depression. The likelihood that the applicant will continue to experience both physical and psychological disabilities is of significance. The evidence supports the conclusion that such disabilities will make his imprisonment more burdensome.
	
	
	It is apparent from the evidence that steps have now been taken to ensure treatment is available to the applicant through the Westmead specialist clinic. Whilst this is undoubtedly beneficial in terms of the applicant’s ongoing imprisonment, it would require his transfer to Sydney which would result in his relocation away from his family who are currently able to visit him regularly.
	
	
	Whilst no error is alleged in the sentence imposed, the fresh evidence as to the applicant’s subsequent diagnosis, his deteriorating physical condition, his limited life expectancy and the adverse psychological impact of the diagnosis upon the applicant, supported the need for this Court’s intervention.
	
	
	For the purpose of re-sentencing the applicant in respect of the three offences for which he was charged, as to which see [14] above, it was determined that the aggregate sentence stated in [12(5)] above should be substituted for the aggregate sentence imposed by the District Court. In accordance with the provisions of s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, it is noted that had separate sentences been imposed instead of the aggregate sentence which this Court did impose on 14 September 2015, such sentences would, there being no need to specify non-parole periods, (after taking into account the relevant matters under Part 3 of that Act) have been as follows:
	



	
	The offence of steal motor vehicle pursuant to s 154(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, a term of imprisonment of 1 year 3 months.
	
	
	In respect of each of the two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal pursuant to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, a term of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months.
	



	
	This Court in determining the aggregate sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, made allowance for an appropriate degree of concurrency in respect of the above indicative sentences.
	
	
	The effect of the re-sentencing order made by the Court on 14 September 2015 accordingly is that the aggregate sentence was reduced by 9 months to an aggregate sentence of 4 years and 6 months and the non-parole period was reduced by 6 months to a period of 2 years and 6 months. The non-parole period will expire on 23 April 2016 upon which date the applicant will be eligible for parole.
	
	
	WILSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Basten JA, and that of Hall J, providing reasons for the orders made by the Court on the date of the hearing of the appeal.
	
	
	I regard the evidence of the applicant's medical condition, present at the time of sentence (if not undiagnosed) as having an impact upon both the applicant's moral culpability for these offences and, more significantly, upon the conditions under which the remainder of his sentence will be served.
	
	
	I therefore agree with the reasons of Basten JA and Hall J, and with the orders the Court made.

2767949,"Bailey v Director-General, Department of Natural Resources NSW [2015] NSWCA 318","HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Bruce Clyde Bailey co-owned with his sister (“the appellants”) a rural property near Boomi in Northern New South Wales. In 2000 and 2002, Mr Bailey cleared some 84 hectares of land on the property (“the clearing”). In July 2002 the Director-General, Department of Land and Water Conservation (now the Director-General, Department of Natural Resources) issued a summons in the Land and Environment Court alleging that the clearing was done in breach of s 21(2) of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW) (“the Native Vegetation Act”), since repealed. Mr Bailey defended the proceedings, arguing that the clearing was exempted from the operation of the Native Vegetation Act: (i) under s 12(f) of the Act as a designated development (ie, an “artificial waterbody” pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) and Environmental Planning And Assessment Regulation 1994 (“EP&A Regulation”)); and (ii) as a “farm structure” under the State Environmental Planning Policy No 46 – Protection and Management of Native Vegetation (‘SEPP 46’). In July 2003, the trial judge, Talbot J, found that both exemptions applied and dismissed the charges. On the request of the Director-General, the judge stated the questions as to the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which upheld the trial judge’s approach.

In October 2006 the appellants commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division against the Director-General and the State of New South Wales (the respondents) seeking damages for (relevantly) malicious prosecution. On 25 July 2014, Fullerton J dismissed the proceedings. In a subsequent judgment, her Honour awarded (in favour of the respondents) costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis from the date of an offer of compromise.

The appellants appealed the trial judge’s findings with respect to malicious prosecution and, in the event the substantive challenge failed, the costs order.

The Court had to determine whether:

(i)   it was reasonably open to the Director-General to take the view that the exemptions in s 12(f) of the Native Vegetation Act applied only to developments which were otherwise lawful;

(ii)   it was reasonably open to the Director-General to take the view that the proposed SEPP 46, Sch 3 did not apply to the proposed reservoir; and

(iii)   the Director-General lacked a belief in the guilt of Mr Bailey as evidenced by: (a) in the light of legal advice provided to him by the appellants, his failure to obtain a legal advice, and (b) his failure to give evidence.

Further with respect to the costs judgment the Court had to decide whether:

(iv)   the offer of compromise made by the respondents complied with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rule 2005, r 20.26; and

(v)   where the case was decided on the basis of no liability the respondents were entitled to costs related to the question of damages.

The Court (per Basten JA, Gleeson and Leeming JJA agreeing) held, dismissing the appeal.

In relation to (i)

1.   Arguably the purpose of s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act was to disapply the Act in situations where clearing of the native vegetation was authorised under other relevant legislation. Thus, upon the reading of the legislative scheme as a whole, it was reasonably open for the Director-General to treat the exemption in s 12(f) of the Native Vegetation Act as applying only to designated developments which were otherwise lawful. Such an approach was warranted by the broader legislative planning context within which the Native Vegetation Act operated: [36]-[38].

In relation to (ii)

2.   It was reasonably open for the Director-General to treat the exemption provided in SEPP 46, Sch 3 as not applying to the clearing of native vegetation because: (a) Sch 3 exempted “minimal clearing” of native vegetation for construction of “farm structures” (including “farm dams”), which on its ordinary meaning, excluded large scale structures, and consequently would not encompass a large water storage unit covering approximately 90 ha proposed by the appellant; (b) as was the case of s 12(f), this exemption could reasonably be read as referring to developments for lawful purposes and not to developments otherwise requiring approval but not approved; and (c) the EP&A Regulation defining designated development having been enacted only a year before the SEPP, it was most unlikely that such an exemption would include designated development and, if it did, that such activity would be allowed without the need to obtain the appropriate environmental assessment: [41]-[43].

In relation to (iii):

3.   It was clear from the departmental memorandum recommending the prosecution that the Director-General considered Allens’ advice and found it unpersuasive. Such course was open considering that the advice (obtained prior to the clearing and not addressing the question of the charges laid) was not conclusive against the reasonableness of the prosecution: [75], [77].

4.   Whether or not the Director-General obtained legal advice prior to instituting the proceedings was speculative and in any case it is doubtful how it could assist the appellant where the Director-General did not claim to have relied on any legal advice before laying the charges: [83], [84].

5.   The appellant’s failure to establish that there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution could not be cured by an inference drawn from the fact that the Director-General did not give evidence: [90]. Consequently, the trial judge correctly found that the rule in Jones v Dunkel had no basis upon which to operate: [91], [95].

Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298; Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd (2011) 243 CLR 361; [2011] HCA 11 referred to.

In relation to (iv):

6.   The respondents’ offer of compromise reflected UCPR, r 20.26(2) (as applicable at the relevant time); the appellants’ submission to the contrary was untenable as it relied on the reading of authority taken out of context: [110]-[112].

Dean v Stockland Property Management Pty Ltd (No 2) [2010] NSWCA 141 referred to.

7.   The term “genuine offer” is apt to mislead. What the statutory language requires is an “offer of compromise”: an offer by a defendant to forgo costs when significant costs had already been incurred involved an element of compromise: [116].

8.   The fact that the trial decided there was no liability did not disentitle the respondents from recovering costs of the undetermined issues: [118]

Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission (1988) 76 LGRA 381 applied.

Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: The appellants are the owners of a rural property, “Hazeldene”, situated near Boomi in northern New South Wales. Between February and July 2000, the first appellant, Bruce Clyde Bailey, arranged for contractors to clear 64 hectares of native vegetation on part of the land known as “the Strip”. That activity left an area of 20.4 hectares as an island in the middle of the cleared expanse. In April 2002 Mr Bailey arranged for the clearing of the remaining island.
	
	
	On 18 July 2002 the Director-General, Department of Land and Water Conservation, issued a summons in the Land and Environment Court in respect of each action involving the clearing of native vegetation, alleging a breach of s 21(2)(a) of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW) (“the Native Vegetation Act”), since repealed. The sole defendant was Mr Bailey. The charges were heard by Talbot J exercising the criminal jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court. Mr Bailey defended the proceedings on the basis that the clearing was undertaken for the purpose of constructing a “farm dam” on the land, a purpose permitting the clearing of native vegetation without development consent.
	
	
	On 17 December 2003, the charges were dismissed.
	
	
	In October 2006 the appellants commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division against the respondents, seeking damages for four causes of action, namely (a) malicious prosecution, (b) negligent misrepresentation, (c) breach of duty and (d) misfeasance in public office. The trial was conducted over 21 days before Fullerton J in the second half of 2013. By a judgment delivered on 25 July 2014, the trial judge dismissed the proceedings. [1]  A subsequent judgment awarded costs in favour of the defendants, to be assessed on an indemnity basis from the date of an offer of compromise. [2] 
	
	
	The civil proceedings originally asserted four causes of action, but the only one pursued on appeal was that for malicious prosecution. (Indeed, it constituted the bulk of the judgment below.) As only Mr Bailey was prosecuted, he appeared to be the only person with a real interest in the appeal. Although his sister and co-owner is an appellant, it is doubtful that she has any interest in the proceeding, except in relation to the costs order. Hereafter it will be sufficient to refer to “the appellant”, meaning Mr Bailey, except when dealing with the challenge to the costs order.
	
	
	To succeed at trial with respect to malicious prosecution the appellant needed to establish three fundamental propositions, namely that:
	


(a)   the prosecutor did not honestly and reasonably believe that –

(i)   clearing native vegetation for a purpose requiring consent, but for which no consent had been given, was unlawful; and

(ii)   the purpose, being the construction of levees 1.4 kms and 1.8 kms long to create a water storage unit did not constitute a “farm dam” for which no approval was required, and

(b)   the prosecutions were instituted and maintained for a purpose other than that of enforcing the law with respect to clearing native vegetation.


	
	At trial, the appellant failed to establish all of these elements. On appeal, for reasons explained below, he failed to establish error on the part of the trial judge in relation to any of these matters.
	
	
	The challenge to the order for the costs of the trial was an independent issue, which only arose if the appeal against the substantive orders failed. No question was raised as to whether the appellants needed leave. Assuming that they did not, there was no basis established for interfering with the judgment of the trial judge in that respect. Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
	


Malicious prosecution – elements of tort


	
	The tort of malicious prosecution is a common law cause of action relevantly unaffected by statute. The elements are succinctly stated by Balkin and Davis, Law of Torts, in the following terms: [3] 
	


“In order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant had instigated the proceedings; (2) that those proceedings terminated in the plaintiff’s favour …; (3) that the defendant’s conduct was without reasonable and probable cause; (4) that the defendant was also actuated by malice; and (5) that the plaintiff has suffered one of three relevant kinds of damage.”


	
	The first element was uncontroversial, the Director-General (being the first defendant in the proceedings below) was the State’s officer in whose name the criminal proceedings were commenced. To the extent other government officers may also have been responsible, the State was properly joined. The second element was also uncontroversial, Mr Bailey having been acquitted. It is not necessary to consider the fifth element, relating to damage.
	
	
	With respect to the third and fourth requirements, the appellant accepted the statement in Fleming [4]  in the following terms:
	


“Malicious prosecution postulates two fault requirements: the proceedings complained of must have been instituted without reasonable and probable cause and for an improper purpose. Both must be satisfied because the prosecution of persons reasonably and honestly suspected of crime is considered of greater social importance than disapproval of unworthy motives.”


	
	The absence of reasonable and probable cause includes both objective and subjective elements; the latter being the absence of a belief by the prosecutor that the person charged “was probably guilty of the crime imputed.” [5]  The canonical statement, from the judgment of Hawkins J in Hicks v Faulkner, [6]  defined reasonable and probable cause to be “an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed.”
	
	
	In short, the prosecutor must have an honest belief that the defendant was probably guilty and that belief must be based upon grounds which a reasonable person would accept as supporting the belief. However, as explained by the High Court in A v New South Wales, [7]  it is sufficient to demonstrate that the prosecutor did not believe the accused was probably guilty of the offence. That is, reference to “honest” belief adds nothing to that which must be disproved.
	
	
	As was revealed by the extensive examination of authorities in A v New South Wales, the manner in which the elements of the tort are expressed will often depend upon forensic elements of a particular case. [8]  Thus, a different analysis will apply where the prosecutor is a public officer with no personal knowledge of the facts, as compared with a prosecutor who is a private individual with actual knowledge of the conduct the subject of the charge.
	
	
	The proper formulation of the principle may also depend upon institutional circumstances, due to the anomalous rule [9]  that where proceedings are brought before a judge and jury the existence of reasonable and probable cause is for the judge and not the jury. This circumstance may lead to legitimate differences between principles developed in jurisdictions where juries are (or were) available in civil trials, [10]  in contrast to those where trials are by judge alone, as now in New South Wales.
	
	
	This caution is particularly apposite in the present case where the prosecution was based upon agreed facts and the only issue in dispute was the availability of a statutory exemption. One way to approach the present matter is to ask whether the prosecutor in fact believed that the construction of the statute upon which he relied was probably correct and then ask whether a reasonably competent lawyer would have reached a similar conclusion. However, there is no legal requirement that the matter be approached in this way: it need not be a question asked in two sequential stages. Rather, the approach to one limb of the requirement may affect the answer to the other. For example, if the court were satisfied that the construction adopted by the prosecutor was, as a matter of law, reasonably open, it might be difficult for the plaintiff to establish on the balance of probability that the prosecutor did not believe in the probability of success, absent direct evidence supportive of that conclusion. On the other hand, if the plaintiff could establish that a reasonable lawyer would not adopt that view, the plaintiff might more readily establish that the prosecutor did not have such a belief, although that might still be a difficult forensic task.
	
	
	Similar practical considerations may affect the order in which the court approaches the elements of the tort. Where malice is a question for the jury, it is usual to deal with reasonable and probable cause first, lest an adverse conclusion about malice “could, in effect, swamp the other issues.” [11]  Such a concern is less valid with a trial by judge alone, but it remains conventional to approach the issues in this order.
	
	
	It has also been noted, as a practical forensic issue, that it may be easier to prove that a private prosecutor has acted for a purpose other than carrying the law into effect, than in the case of a public prosecutor whose decision is subject to layers of scrutiny and to potential review and who is more likely to act with professional detachment. [12] 
	
	
	The fourth element is that of malice. The term is somewhat archaic and, as the High Court noted in A v New South Wales, quoting Fleming, it “has proved a slippery word in the law of torts”. [13]  The Court adopted the language of Fleming in the following passage: [14] 
	


“At the root of it is the notion that the only proper purpose for the institution of criminal proceedings is to bring an offender to justice and thereby aid in the enforcement of the law, and that a prosecutor who is primarily animated by a different aim steps outside the pale, if the proceedings also happen to be destitute of reasonable cause.”


	
	As the High Court further noted, the elements of malice and honest belief in the guilt of the defendant may overlap but are not coterminous. A prosecutor who has an honest and reasonable belief in the guilt of the accused may nevertheless seek to pursue a prosecution out of spite or ill-will. That circumstance alone would not base an action for malicious prosecution. Prosecution of criminal charges motivated by disgust at the conduct of a person believed to have indulged in criminal activity, with the intention that he or she should be punished, might be thought to constitute malice in a colloquial sense, but it would not constitute an extraneous purpose for the tort of malicious prosecution. On the other hand, if it can be shown that the prosecutor had no actual belief in the guilt of the accused, it might more readily be inferred that he or she acted for an improper motive. Nevertheless, the two subjective elements must remain separate and be addressed separately.
	


Relevant planning controls

(a)   the issue before this court


	
	It is convenient to deal first with the objective element of reasonable and probable cause for laying the charges. In order to explain the basis on which charges were laid against the appellant, it is necessary to identify the statutory controls in place with respect to clearing native vegetation, as they operated between February 2000 and July 2002. The appellant was acquitted on both charges, on the basis of findings as to the meaning of several statutory provisions dealt with in the judgment of the Land and Environment Court. The critical findings were the subject of a case stated on two questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The judgments of those courts are not subject to review in these proceedings. The issue with respect to malicious prosecution is whether the prosecutor had reasonable and probable cause to adopt, before those judgments, a construction which differed from those adopted in those judgments.
	
	
	The approach to statutory construction adopted in the following reasons appears not to have been that presented to the Land and Environment Court or to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Nor are the legal materials referred to here identical with those considered by those courts. These factors may explain a difference in approach and in the outcome of the analysis.
	
	
	Claims for malicious prosecution are by no means common and can arise in a variety of circumstances. A case in which the prosecution ultimately turned solely on beliefs of the prosecutor as to the proper construction of statutory provisions is rare: indeed, this Court was not referred to any case where that had arisen. When a court, whose job it is to determine the law, is required to consider whether a particular view of the law was reasonably open at the time the prosecution was commenced, the fact that a court considering the criminal charges took a particular view of the law should be disregarded. The issue in this Court, somewhat unusually, is not to state the law governing a particular set of facts, but to decide whether a particular view of the law was reasonably open at the time charges were laid, so as to provide reasonable and probable cause for pursuing a prosecution. To go further would be to undermine the basis of the acquittals.
	
	
	A similar difficulty can arise with respect to the more usual case of alleged malicious prosecution, which turns on issues of fact. However, in that situation there is a different standard of proof to be applied. Thus, so far as the objective circumstances are relevant, the plaintiff (being the accused in the criminal proceeding) bears the burden of establishing that there was no reasonable basis for the prosecutor to conclude that a prosecution would probably result in a guilty verdict. The differing burdens and standards of proof can readily accommodate the rejection of a claim of malicious prosecution without undermining the acquittal on the criminal charge. However, a similar reconciliation is not so easy with respect to questions of law. Indeed, the potential to undermine an acquittal which depends purely on an understanding of the law is sufficient to raise a doubt as to whether the tort of malicious prosecution, based purely on a wrong view of the law can properly coexist (except in extreme cases) with the strong principle of finality embraced in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid. [15]  However, as that was not an issue raised in the present proceedings, it must be put to one side.
	
	
	The conclusion reached below is that a construction of the law sufficient to support a conviction was reasonably available to the prosecutor. The finding of the Court need go no further and should not be understood as going further. Nevertheless, the reasons for reaching that conclusion cannot all be stated with such express reservations. For example, to explain what the Court considers to be the proper approach to statutory construction as a view which is merely “reasonably open” would be more than awkward and artificial; it would be positively misleading. All that can be said is that the analysis which follows must be understood in the context of the limited issue to be determined by this Court.
	


(b)   protection of native vegetation


	
	The two charges laid against the appellant alleged breaches of s 21(2) of the Native Vegetation Act. Section 21 provided at the time of the offences:
	


21   Clearing native vegetation on land not subject to plan

(1)   This section does not apply to:

(a)   any land to which a regional vegetation management plan applies, or

(b)   State protected land.

(2)   A person must not clear native vegetation on any land except in accordance with:

(a)   a development consent that is in force, or

(b)   a native vegetation code of practice.

Note. See also clauses 3 and 5 of Schedule 4 which provide that certain exemptions under SEPP 46 and the Western Lands Act 1901 that existed before the commencement of this Act will be continued on a transitional basis. [16] 


	
	Unsurprisingly given the agreed facts, the Land and Environment Court (Talbot J) was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the clearing the subject of each charge had occurred within the periods particularised. [17]  There was no dispute that s 21 applied to the land, that there was no development consent in force and that the clearing was not undertaken in accordance with a native vegetation code of practice. There were, nevertheless, two exemptions relied upon, one being that referred to in the note to s 21(2) and the other arising under s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act. It was these exemptions which determined whether or not the prosecution could succeed.
	


(c)   designated development


	
	Section 12 of the Native Vegetation Act stated that the Act did not apply to certain types of clearing, specified in paragraphs (a)-(p). Each paragraph dealt with a form of statutory authority, six referring to clearing “authorised under” a specified statute or statutes (or in one case a licence granted under a specified statute), while a further six referred to clearing “carried out in accordance with” a permission granted under a statute. There were two exceptions to this linguistic scheme. One referred to clearing “that involves the removal or lopping of any tree or other vegetation in accordance with” a provision of the Roads Act, [18]  being in effect a combination of the language used in the other paragraphs. The other exception was that relied upon in the present case, namely par (f), which was in the following terms:
	


12   Clearing excluded from operation of Act

This Act does not apply to the following types of clearing:

…

(f)   any clearing that is, or that is part of, designated development within the meaning of the EPA Act….


	
	The term “designated development” is defined in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (the “EP&A Act”) as development declared to be designated development by an environmental planning instrument or the regulations. Relevantly for present purposes, cl 53C of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 1994 (NSW) (“EP&A Regulation”), as then in force, declared development described in Sch 3 to be designated development for the purposes of the EP&A Act. Sch 3 included “artificial waterbodies”, a term which included a dam, pond or lake “with a maximum aggregate surface area of water of more than 20 hectares or a maximum total water volume of more than 800 megalitres”. [19]  It was common ground that the proposed water retention area for which the clearing was carried out was well in excess of these criteria, having a proposed capacity of 3,500-4,000 megalitres, and an area of some 90 hectares (being the figures used by the appellant in his application for a licence under Pt 8 of the Water Act 1912 (NSW)).
	
	
	The exemption in s 12(f) thus raised a question as to the inter-relationship of the Native Vegetation Act and the EP&A Act. The relationship was addressed by a number of provisions of the Native Vegetation Act:
	


15   Granting of development consent

(1)   If development consent is, because of this Part, required to clear native vegetation or any protected land, that development consent may be obtained by the Minister making a determination, in accordance with Part 4 of the EPA Act, to grant development consent.

(2)   For the avoidance of doubt, Part 4 of the EPA Act applies to and in respect of that development consent in the same way as it applies to and in respect of development consent that may be required by an environmental planning instrument.

…

16   Relationship with Part 5 of EPA Act

Part 5 of the EPA Act does not apply to any clearing carried out in accordance with this Part, and any such clearing is not an activity for the purposes of Part 5 of the EPA Act.

17   Offence of contravening this Part

(1)   A person who contravenes this Part is guilty of an offence under this Act.

(2)   Section 126(1) of the EPA Act (Penalties) applies to any such offence in the same way as it applies to an offence against that Act.


	
	Further, the provisions in Pt 2 Div 3 of the Native Vegetation Act, which applied to land not subject to regional vegetation management plans, also contained the following provision:
	


23   Clearing not affected by other instruments or Acts

(1)   If native vegetation or State protected land is, or is about to be, cleared in accordance with development consent as required by this Division, that clearing cannot be prohibited, restricted or otherwise affected by an environmental planning instrument or by the provisions of any Act (other than this Act or the EPA Act) to the extent to which that instrument, or those provisions, prohibit, restrict or otherwise affect that clearing.

(2)   However, subjection (1) does not operate to exclude any requirement for:

(a)   consent under section 90 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, or

(b)   a licence under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997,

that might arise in relation to any such clearing.

(3)   Subsection (1) does not apply to any clearing that is lawfully carried out under this Act otherwise than in accordance with development consent as required by this Division.

Note. For example, in any case where clearing is carried out in accordance with a native vegetation code of practice, the clearing may still require development consent because of an environmental planning instrument.


	
	It is apparent that the role of the Native Vegetation Act within the scheme of State planning legislation was given express consideration in drafting the Act. The effect of a development consent under the Native Vegetation Act, permitting clearing of native vegetation, where such consent was required, was to override any prohibition or constraint imposed by an environmental planning instrument or another Act, other than the Native Vegetation Act itself or the EP&A Act. This reflected an expectation that there should be a coherent scheme created for the inter-relationship of the Native Vegetation Act and the EP&A Act.
	
	
	Mr Bailey did not have a consent under the EP&A Act for carrying out designated development. If such a consent were required and if the clearing of the native vegetation constituted part of that designated development, there would have been a contravention of the EP&A Act. (Section 23(1) would not have been engaged because he did not have a consent under the Native Vegetation Act.) Of course, if Mr Bailey had been prosecuted under the wrong legislation, he would have been entitled to an acquittal. There was, however, a large question in the proceedings as to whether the disapplication of the Native Vegetation Act, pursuant to s 12(f), was engaged. At his criminal trial Mr Bailey asserted that s 12(f) was engaged because the clearing was part of the construction of the proposed artificial water body which was designated development; the fact that he did not have consent to carry out such activity was irrelevant for the purposes of s 12(f). That was because the language of par (f), in contrast to the other paragraphs in the section did not refer to clearing “carried out in accordance with” a consent granted under the EP&A Act.
	
	
	The significance of designated development under the EP&A Act is that a development application (if permitted and required) in respect of such activity must be accompanied by an environmental impact statement. [20]  The application must be placed on public exhibition and notification given in accordance with s 79. That process was presumably deemed to be sufficient to ensure that issues which would otherwise arise on an application under the Native Vegetation Act would be properly addressed.
	
	
	Designated development may be “prohibited development” for the purposes of the EP&A Act; alternatively, carrying out such development may be unlawful because consent has been sought and refused. If the activity, although designated development, did not require consent under Pt 4 of the EP&A Act, Pt 5 of the EP&A Act would be engaged. [21]  Under Pt 5, an environmental assessment would have been required, which may involve an environmental impact statement. [22]  On the basis that the Native Vegetation Act is disapplied by s 12(f), the clearing would not be carried out in accordance with Pt 2 of that Act and, accordingly, Pt 5 of the EP&A Act would apply to such an activity. [23] 
	
	
	It would, on one view, be perverse to read s 12(f) as if it disapplied the Native Vegetation Act in circumstances where the activity, which included clearing native vegetation, was in fact unlawful under the EP&A Act. Indeed, s 23(1) acknowledged the possibility that clearing for which consent had been given under the Native Vegetation Act might be affected or prohibited under the EP&A Act, in which case the consent would not override the statutory affectation or prohibition by the EP&A Act. Arguably, the purpose and structure of s 12 was to disapply the Native Vegetation Act in circumstances where clearing of native vegetation was authorised under other legislation. On that basis, it was self-evidently not intended that development as significant as “designated development” could allow the destruction of native vegetation even if it were prohibited development or carried out without consent.
	
	
	In the course of argument, it was suggested that this was not a reasonably available construction of s 12(f) because it required the reading in of words which were not there and, significantly, did appear in every other paragraph of the provision. However, the exercise of statutory interpretation often involves the explication of general or succinct statements in other terms. Where the words in question are ordinary English words, that may not be an appropriate course; in the present case, the scheme of regulation involved legal concepts in respect of which some explication may be necessary and appropriate. Just as the argument relied on by the appellant sought, appropriately, to read par (f) in the context of s 12, taken as a whole, so it was arguably necessary to read s 12 in the context of related statutory provisions. At the very least, that conclusion, however reasoned and articulated, could not be said to be unreasonable. Indeed, it appears to have been the approach accepted by the appellant’s legal advisers prior to the commencement of the proceedings.
	
	
	There is a further basis upon which it might reasonably be accepted that s 12 disapplied the Native Vegetation Act only in respect of lawful activities. The accepted purpose of the clearing, namely the creation of a water storage unit, required the construction of levees on a floodplain. Because that was the core activity which would result in a designated development for the purposes of s 12(f), it was open to the prosecutor to conclude that the activity could not be lawfully carried out absent an approval under Pt 8 of the Water Act. Section 12(p) of the Native Vegetation Act disapplied its provisions in circumstances where the clearing was carried out in accordance with an approval under the Water Act. That provision was not relied upon in defence of the prosecution, because no such approval had been obtained. Nevertheless, it was open to the prosecutor to conclude that the purpose by which the activity became designated development rendered the activity unlawful and unauthorised, either by reason of the operation of the EP&A Act, or by reason of the absence of authority required under the Water Act. It was reasonable to conclude that the exemption only applied to activity which was otherwise lawful.
	


(d)   exemption for farm structures


	
	The second exemption relied upon by the appellant was to be found in Sch 3 of SEPP 46. SEPP 46 was repealed by the Native Vegetation Act, s 70. However, a savings provision, contained in Sch 4 was in the following terms:
	


3   Existing development consents and exemptions under SEPP 46

…

(2)   Subject to the regulations, the clearing of native vegetation for a purpose or extent described in Schedule 3 to SEPP 46 continues, after the repeal of SEPP 46 by this Act, to be clearing that is exempt from any requirement under Part 2 of this Act for the development consent.


	
	The relevant exemption thus preserved was in the following terms:
	


Clearing of native vegetation for the purpose of the following:

…

(e)   Rural Structures. The clearing to a minimum extent of native vegetation if it is necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of farm structures (such as farm dams, tracks, bores, windmills, fences, fence lines, stockyards, loading ramps, sheds and the like).


	
	The issue of construction concerned the significance of the examples given in parentheses and the extent to which they might constrain an understanding of the term “farm structures”. One approach to understanding the concept of a farm structure by reference to the examples, was to exclude large scale structures bearing no reasonable relationship to the examples given in the exemption. In its ordinary meaning, a farm dam would be understood to refer to the multitude of small dams which dot the countryside in much of New South Wales. It is most unlikely that a person seeing a water storage unit approximately 90 ha would identify it as a farm dam. On its ordinary meaning, a “farm dam” would arguably not include the water storage unit constructed with levees 1.4 kms and 1.8 kms proposed by the appellant. Accordingly, a “farm structure” for the purposes of the exemption, could reasonably be read as not including such a large water storage facility. Consistently with that approach, in a short letter seeking advice from Ms Wild at Allen, Allen and Hemsley, solicitors, [24]  the appellant referred on three occasions to his intention to construct a “reservoir”.
	
	
	A second approach, in keeping with the approach proposed above with respect to s 12, would limit the exemption to lawful activities. The reference to “purpose” in the chapeau to SEPP 46, Sch 3 could reasonably have been read as referring to lawful purposes, and not to purposes which were unauthorised or prohibited. Thus, even if a large water storage facility could fall within the concept of a “farm structure”, clearing was neither necessary nor permissible while construction, which required approval, remained unauthorised.
	
	
	A third approach would require that SEPP 46 be considered in its statutory context. For that purpose, despite its repeal, Sch 3 could not be properly construed without reference to the text of the SEPP as a whole. That text included numerous references to other legislation, including the EP&A Act. Schedule 3 itself made reference to clearing authorised under the Rural Fires Act 1997 (NSW). [25]  More broadly, Sch 3 was intended to permit the clearing of native vegetation for quite limited purposes, including “minimal clearing” of up to 2 hectares per annum; minimal tree cutting, of no more than seven trees per hectare in a period of one year for on-farm uses, the lopping of vegetation for stock fodder, but only in a period of declared drought and where the continued health of the vegetation would not be affected. Given the nature of these specific exemptions, and given the assumption that the drafter would have been conscious of the provisions with respect to designated development contained in the EP&A Regulation, promulgated the year before the SEPP, it is most unlikely that the exemptions were intended to include activity which might be designated development. If they did include such activity, it is most unlikely that they included such activity in the absence of an appropriate environmental assessment.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the prosecutor’s understanding of the exemption was that it was restricted to “small dams”. That approach was castigated as “absurd”. Where the ordinary meaning of a statutory provision leads to a result which, having regard to the intended purpose of the instrument read as a whole and in its context, is “absurd”, it may be appropriate to prefer a different meaning. [26]  However, that is not the exercise proposed. The complaint is that a term (farm dams) cannot rationally be read down by reference to its context to exclude large reservoirs. To describe that exercise as “absurd” is mere rhetoric. Though perhaps necessary to establish a relevant element of the tort of malicious prosecution, such language is unhelpful in identifying reasonably available interpretations. The approach articulated above was at least reasonably available to the prosecutor: the only answer provided was a semantic assertion that the word “small” did not appear before the phrase “farm dams”. So much may be conceded; however, it manifestly fails to demonstrate that the approach articulated above was not reasonable.
	


Consequences of available interpretations of exemptions


	
	The only two bases relied upon as demonstrating a lack of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecutions were the availability of the exemptions discussed above. If the prosecutor adopted a reasonably available belief as to the operation of these exemptions, as a matter of law, the claim for malicious prosecution must have failed. The construction of each provision set out above may not have been the only one reasonably available, but it was necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that either those views were not reasonably available, or, failing that, they were not held by the prosecutor, or those responsible for the prosecution.
	
	
	Both before the trial judge and in this Court, reference was made to judgments given in the Land and Environment Court, dealing with the present case and a similar case decided some four months earlier (although nine months after the charges had been laid), namely Director-General Department of Land and Water Conservation v Jackson. [27]  Reference was also made to the analysis undertaken by the Court of Criminal Appeal, to which Talbot J had stated a case following the trial of the appellant. [28] 
	
	
	It was noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal took a different view from that set out above with respect to the construction of both s 12(f) of the Native Vegetation Act and the farm structures exemption in SEPP 46, Sch 3(e). Factually, that was so. However, those facts did not advance the appellant’s case significantly. It is a separate and necessary element of the tort of malicious prosecution that a criminal prosecution has failed; in other words, that a court has held that the prosecutor’s assessment of the fact or law involved was erroneous. That does not mean that another view was not reasonably open when the charge was laid or the prosecution maintained.
	
	
	This case was unusual, perhaps unique, because there was no factual issue in dispute. Assuming, as indicated above, that a construction of each exemption consistent with the guilt of the appellant was reasonably open, the appellant’s case must depend upon demonstration that such an opinion was not in fact held by the prosecutor.
	


Belief of prosecutor


	
	The appellant’s case in this respect focused on a particular feature of the pre-prosecution circumstances, namely that the appellant had obtained legal advice from Allen, Allen and Hemsley, solicitors, (“Allens’ advice”) a copy of which had been provided to officers in the Director-General’s Department. According to the appellant, this document not merely provided a reasonable basis for him to clear the land, but demonstrated that there was no reasonable basis upon which to prosecute him for so doing. With due respect to the strenuous submissions in support of these propositions, neither conclusion was warranted. To understand why that is so, it is necessary to start with the text of Allens’ advice, which must be understood in the context of the appellant’s instructions and the question to which attention was directed.
	


(a)   Allens’ advice


	
	The letter, dated 20 April 2000 and signed by Ms Wild, was in the following terms:
	


“Advice on Clearing Native Vegetation

You have asked us to advise as to whether you are required to obtain a development consent under the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW) (the NVC Act) for the clearing of native vegetation from your land for the construction of a dam.

For the purposes of this advice we have made the following assumptions:-

●   that a Regional Vegetation Management Plan (RVMP) does not apply to the land that you propose to clear. Your consultant, Mr Rob McCosker, has informed us that a RVMP covering your land is being drafted, but is not yet finalised;

●   that the vegetation you propose to clear from the land is in fact native vegetation within the meaning of the NVC Act.

Clearing of Land under the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW)

The NVCA provides that a development consent is required to clear native vegetation from land to which no RVMP applies. However, there are certain exemptions under the NVCA from the requirement to obtain a development consent. A development consent is not required for the clearing of native vegetation in the following circumstances:

(a)   the clearing of up to 2 hectares per annum for any contiguous land holding in the same ownership; and

(b)   the clearing, to a minimum extent, of native vegetation if it is necessary for the construction, operation and maintenance of farm structures (such as farm dams, tracks, bores, windmills, fences, fence lines, stockyards, load ramps, shed and the like).

Therefore, you will not require development consent to clear native vegetation from your land if:

●   no more than 2 hectares of native vegetation needs to be cleared to construct the proposed dam; or

●   you clear only enough native vegetation to enable the construction of the dam to occur.

Any clearing of native vegetation in excess of the minimum amount required to construct the dam would be in breach of the NVCA.

Water Act 1912 (NSW)

Mr McCosker has informed us that you are required under Part 8 of the Water Act 1912 (NSW) to obtain the approval of the Water Administration Ministerial Corporation (the WAMC) to construct any levies [sic] for the proposed dam. Therefore, despite the fact that clearing of native vegetation can take place in the circumstances described above, an application must still be lodged with the WAMC for approval to construct any levies [sic] for the proposed dam.

Conclusion

You will not be required to obtain development consent to clear native vegetation from your land for the purpose of constructing a dam in the circumstances outlined above.

However, you will need to make an application to the WAMC for an approval to construct the levies [sic] for the proposed dam.”


	
	A number of points may be made about this advice. First, it was given before any clearing had taken place; it did not advise in relation to the charges later laid.
	
	
	Secondly, the advice was that the appellant would “not be required to obtain development consent to clear native vegetation … for the purpose of constructing a dam in the circumstances outlined above.” The advice was directed specifically to the operation of Sch 3(e) of SEPP 46. There was no reference to a possible exemption under s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act. However, it need not be inferred that the solicitor was not aware of other possible exemptions. Shortly after the charges were laid, on 5 September 2002, the State Crown Solicitor’s Officer, acting for the prosecutor, wrote to Ms Wild, who was still acting for the appellant, but was then employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal, seeking admission of numerous matters which might have given rise to a defence. Admissions were sought in respect of each paragraph in s 12 of the Native Vegetation Act, including s 12(f), in the following terms:
	


“(f)   The subject clearing was not clearing that was, or that was part of, designated development within the meaning of the [EP&A Act], as provided in s 12(f) of the [Native Vegetation Act].”


	
	The response from PricewaterhouseCoopers, dated 23 September 2002, was as follows:
	


“(f)   We are instructed that the clearing was not the subject of an application for designated development under the [EP&A Act].”


	
	When the appellant’s lawyers decided to rely upon the exemption under s 12(f) is not clear. The charges were heard in the Land and Environment Court on three days in mid-June 2003. The judgment, delivered on 1 July 2003, noted that senior counsel appearing for the appellant in that proceeding had relied upon s 12(f). [29]  The evidence indicated that, even after explicit reference had been made to s 12(f) in the letter from the Crown Solicitor, after the charges were laid, neither party considered there was a defence available under that provision. It may be inferred that reliance on s 12(f) resulted from advice given by counsel in preparing the matter in 2003. So far as appears from the evidence, the appellant gave notice of intended reliance on s 12(f) only on the Friday afternoon before the Monday on which the trial was to proceed. The appellant must now demonstrate that what had been a common approach up until that time was not reasonably available.
	
	
	Thirdly, Allens’ advice assumed that the purpose was “the construction of a dam”. The advice was provided in the circumstances outlined, namely that a consent would not be required if the clearing was to be no more than 2 hectares, or to a minimum extent necessary to construct the dam. The possibility that the 2 hectare exemption might apply indicated that the author of the letter either had no information as to the size of the proposed dam, or did not address her mind to that issue.
	
	
	Fourthly, the letter noted advice given by Mr McCosker, a consultant to the appellant, that approval would be required under Pt 8 of the Water Act to construct the levees for the proposed dam. The letter continued, noting that, despite the lack of a requirement for consent for clearing, if the circumstances identified were met, there was still a need to lodge an application for approval under the Water Act to construct the levees. In other words, the advice expressly contemplated that the purpose of the clearing, namely to construct a dam, was itself a purpose for which authorisation was required. Although the connection between the two issues was not identified with precision, the available inference was that approval to construct the levees was a necessary element of the lawful construction of the dam and therefore a precondition to the exemption for clearing native vegetation for that purpose.
	
	
	At the very least, there was no suggestion as to when the obtaining of consent and the clearing could take place; the temporal issue was not addressed. That was understandable given the subject matter of the advice, namely whether a separate development consent was required in order to clear vegetation.
	
	
	Thus, there was nothing inconsistent with Allens’ advice in the analysis of the legislative scheme set out above. The advice did not consider the question (which had not arisen) as to whether the clearing of native vegetation, absent a consent to construct a dam, would be a lawful activity. It was, however, inherently implausible that the SEPP permitted the clearing of native vegetation for a purpose which was not, at the time of the clearing, lawful. The inference that the advice contemplated such a result should be rejected.
	
	
	If the foregoing reading of the letter were accepted, it provided no support for the application of the exemption with respect to a farm dam in circumstances where the necessary consent under the Water Act had not been obtained. Nor did it envisage an available exemption under s 12(f).
	
	
	The opening words of SEPP 46, Sch 3, “Clearing of native vegetation for the purpose of the following”, might be seen to be ambiguous. On one construction, they exempted from any requirement under Pt 2 of the Native Vegetation Act clearing for a specified purpose, permitted by law. The alternative construction, which is arguably incoherent in terms of the policy of the Act, permitted clearing of native vegetation if the landowner had a purpose in mind (a subjective intention), even though the purpose was unlawful or prohibited. A reasonable reading of the terms of the exemption, in the context of the Native Vegetation Act, should require the adoption of the former construction. That was consistent with the views presented, perhaps imprecisely, in Allens’ advice. The clearing which later took place did not satisfy that condition (no authorisation having been obtained) and, therefore, as advised by Allens, was unlawful.
	
	
	There were, accordingly, reasonable grounds for a belief in the appellant’s guilt.
	


Lack of belief in merit of prosecution: basis of challenge

(a)   general approach


	
	Both parties (on the appeal) accepted that the prosecutor was the Director- General of the Department. His was the relevant state of mind; it could only be inferred from the available documentary material as he did not give evidence.
	
	
	Little can be gleaned from the authorities in relation to a case where the facts are all agreed and the guilt or innocence of the defendant turned on questions of law and points of statutory construction. In that circumstance, the applicant placed weight on three propositions, namely:
	


(a)   having received a copy of Allens’ advice, the Director-General could not have established the necessary belief as to probable guilt on objectively established grounds;

(b)   in the alternative, the Director-General could not have held such a belief without obtaining his or her own legal advice which contradicted Allens’ advice; and

(c)   no such legal advice was proffered in support of the respondents’ case.


	
	The first limb of this approach cannot be accepted. Allens’ advice was given prior to the clearing taking place; it envisaged that consent would not be necessary under the Native Vegetation Act, for the purpose of clearing native vegetation in order to construct a dam, but that consent would be necessary to construct the levees for the dam. Even if the reading of the advice set out above were not to be accepted, the advice failed to address the two critical questions of law relevant to the outcome of the prosecutions.
	
	
	So far as the second and third limbs of the argument were concerned, the amended statement of claim made no such allegations. As particulars of malice, it identified various alleged improper purposes, including spite and/or pique and a lack of “any genuine belief in the guilt of the [appellant]”. [30]  As particulars of absence of reasonable or probable cause, sub-par (a) merely repeated the heading. Sub-paragraph (b) alleged a lack of “evidence … to support essential elements of the offence”, a point which was without substance in the circumstances of the trial, the outcome of which did not turn on lack of evidence. Sub-paragraph (c) stated that the prosecution “ignored established precedent in favour of the [appellant’s] innocence and the agreed facts of the case”, although no “established precedent” was identified in this Court. Sub-paragraph (d) merely described the maintenance of the prosecutions and “the appeal” as “manifestly risky” in circumstances where there were “no sufficient grounds to convict”.
	
	
	The amended defence did not assert reliance on legal advice in response to paragraph 18 of the amended statement of claim. The amended reply, filed by the appellant on 4 July 2013, did not take the matter any further.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider the evidence proffered in support of the proposition that the Director-General lacked the necessary belief in the probable guilt of the appellant.
	
	
	A critical document discovered by the respondents, which was tendered by the appellant at the trial, was a memorandum prepared by Ms Paget-Cooke in the Legal and Compliance branch of the Department of Land and Water Conservation (referred to by the parties as “the prosecution memorandum”), recommending that the appellant be prosecuted for the clearing of native vegetation. After setting out the background, section 3 of the document, headed “Comment”, included the following propositions:
	


“2.9   Full details of the offences and relevant considerations are included in the Recommendation received from the Region, which is in the form of a Memo addressed to Legal and Compliance dated 28 May 2002. (Attachment 1)

…

3.1   No development consent has been issued in respect of the clearing. The clearing is not excluded from the operation of the [Native Vegetation] Act under sections 9, 10 or 12 of the [Native Vegetation] Act.

3.2   No approval has been issued under Part 8 of the Water Act.

3.3   A total of 4 hectares of the clearing would be permitted under the Minimal Clearing exemption.

3.4   Mr Bailey claims that the clearing was permitted under the Rural Structures exemption. The Department’s position is that this exemption was intended to permit the construction and maintenance of every day farm structures, which would include small scale farm dams, but that it does not permit the construction of a large reservoir intended to facilitate the establishment of a new agricultural enterprise.

3.5   Mr Bailey says that he based his decision to undertake the clearing on independent legal advice. The Department has seen this advice and does not find it persuasive.

…

3.7   The Barwon Region has requested that Mr Bailey be prosecuted as the person who authorised the clearing.

3.8   An assessment of the offences according to the DPP Prosecution Policy and Guidelines confirms that the circumstances warrant prosecution.

…

3.10   In view of the large area cleared and the legal question relating to the interpretation of the Rural Structures exemption, it would be appropriate for this prosecution to be brought in the Land and Environment Court rather than in the Local Court.”


	
	The attachment to the prosecution memorandum (referred to at 2.9), was not produced but probably requested prosecution, as indicated at 3.7. The recommendation to commence a prosecution was approved by the General Manager, Legal and Compliance, on 26 June 2002. The matter then went to the Director-General, who sought a discussion with the General Manager, Legal and Compliance. The Director-General then wrote and signed the following direction dated 1 July 2002:
	


“Following discussion on 1/7/02 agreement to proceed with prosecution as recommended.”


	
	The prosecution memorandum also went to the Deputy Director-General. A comment over the initials of the Deputy Director-General was redacted. There was a dispute with respect to that redaction (and others), for which client legal privilege was claimed under ss 118 and 119 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). A challenge to the claim for privilege was taken on an interlocutory basis to the Supreme Court. The judge hearing the application, James J, identified five classes of documents for which client legal privilege was claimed, namely:
	


“1.   File notes by legal officers of the Department;

2.   Communications between a Departmental legal officer and a solicitor in the Crown Solicitor’s Office;

3.   Communications between a Departmental legal officer and a Departmental regional officer for the purpose of acquiring evidence;

4.   Communications between the barrister briefed by the Crown Solicitor and either a solicitor in the Crown Solicitor’s Office or a Departmental legal officer; and

5.   Communications between a Departmental legal officer and a witness or potential witness or a person who might provide information for the purpose of the proceedings.” [31] 


	
	The judgment of James J, upholding the claim for privilege, was appealed by the present appellant to this Court. The appeal was dismissed, but towards the end of a lengthy judgment, Tobias JA noted that “as the proceedings at present stand, the Director-General does not seek to make a case in defence to the appellants’ malicious prosecution claim that he acted upon legal advice.” [32]  Tobias JA continued:
	


“If at any time he does, then it would be open to the appellants to seek access to that legal advice and a real question as to waiver would then arise that could have particular repercussions with respect to the costs of the proceedings before the primary judge and this Court with respect to the respondents’ present claim for client legal privilege.”


	
	The issue of waiver was raised again at trial and in this Court, reliance being placed on certain answers given to interrogatories with respect to the document which had been attachment 1 to the prosecution memorandum and had itself been the subject of a claim for privilege. On the interlocutory appeal, this Court upheld the respondents’ submission that there had been no waiver at that time. The argument was revisited before the trial judge, on the supposedly different basis that the answers to interrogatories did not constitute “an implied waiver”, but a concession that the respondents “did rely on legal advice before approving the prosecution.” [33]  The submission appears to have been an impermissible attempt to reagitate precisely the issue which had been raised unsuccessfully on the interlocutory appeal. In any event, the trial judge rejected it.
	
	
	In this Court, the appellant changed tack, accepting that the Director-General had not relied upon legal advice in pursuing the prosecution. However, noting that the facts were not contentious, the submission continued: [34] 
	


“Thus what stood between the guilt or innocence of the appellant was understood to be a question of law and the question for the first respondent was how that question would be likely to be decided by the Court.”


	
	In his written submissions, the appellant contended for a finding that the Director-General did obtain legal advice and treated it as authoritative. [35]  Next, he submitted that competent advice would have been “adverse to the bringing of a prosecution” and hence the Court should be satisfied that there was a lack of reasonable and probable cause, which the Director-General, having available such advice, must have understood.
	
	
	The basis for this last conclusion appeared to lie in the earlier propositions that (a) there was “no reason to doubt the correctness of the Allens’ advice”; (b) the view that a rural structure such as a “farm dam” should be read down as limited to “little dams” was “absurd” and (c) the exclusion from the category of “farm structures” of a water storage unit of the kind proposed by the appellant was also “absurd”.
	
	
	For reasons already explained, this line of argument fails at the first step. That is, Allens’ advice was not conclusive against the reasonableness of a prosecution, indeed rather the contrary. Further, to read it as conclusive against the reasonableness of a prosecution did not render any alternative view absurd. The view that a prosecution was based on a reasonable and self-evidently arguable construction of the legislative instruments should be accepted, for the reasons set out above. Accordingly, even accepting that the Director-General had available to him legal advice and took it into account, it did not follow he did not believe there was reasonable and probable cause for a finding of guilt. The appellant’s reasoning in this regard should be rejected.
	
	
	In oral argument, senior counsel for the appellant was more guarded about the significance of Allens’ advice, submitting that he could “most certainly” succeed even if Allens’ advice had never been provided to the Department. [36]  However, the prosecution memorandum accepted by the Director-General described having seen the advice and found it not persuasive. [37] 
	


(b)   evidence of Ms Paget-Cooke


	
	Although the Director-General did not give evidence, Ms Paget-Cooke did. Indeed, her evidence covered some 169 pages of the transcript. In the course of cross-examination, counsel for the appellant elicited the following evidence: [38] 
	


“Q. But you acknowledge, don’t you, that you were instrumental in bringing the prosecution against Mr Bailey?

A. Yes.

Q. You had an active role, not only in collecting the information to which I have referred but also preparing the evidence and being involved in the administration of the actual case in court?

A. Yes, up to the point when I stopped being involved in the matter.

HER HONOUR:

Q. Did you instruct counsel?

A. No, we instructed Crown Solicitors who instructed counsel.

KING [counsel for the appellant]:

Q. You acknowledge that you also prepared the decision memorandum that went to the Director General?

A. Yes.

Q. Recommending the commencement of a prosecution?

A. Yes.”


	
	In this Court, senior counsel for the appellant described the “state of mind of Ms Paget-Cooke” as a “false issue at the trial”. [39]  As counsel later acknowledged, that was quite inconsistent with the case run for the appellant at trial. The trial judge had noted that it was not in dispute that the Director-General was properly named as a prosecutor in Mr Bailey’s claim. [40]  The trial judge said:
	


“In closing submissions Mr King sought to persuade me that it was also open on the evidence for me to find that each of Mr O'Brien, Mr Gardner, Mr Dines, Mr Cameron and Ms Paget-Cooke were also prosecutors, thereby exposing the third defendant to liability because of what was said to be the active role they each played in setting the prosecution of Mr Bailey in motion maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause.”


	
	The judge continued: [41] 
	


“Mr King submitted that a finding that each of the named individuals was liable as a prosecutor was crucial to Mr Bailey's claim for damages for malicious prosecution. This, it was said, would avoid the consequence of it being successfully put against him that because the first defendant relied upon information from others (and from Ms Paget-Cooke in particular) without having any personal knowledge of Mr Bailey or the circumstances in which he was alleged to have illegally cleared native vegetation, it could not be shown that he acted without reasonable and probable cause, in the sense that it could not be shown that he did not honestly believe in Mr Bailey's guilt.”


	
	Ultimately the trial judge accepted that Mr Bailey could make out a case based on Ms Paget-Cooke’s role in supporting the recommendation to prosecute, if he could establish that she acted maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. [42]  However, she rejected that approach with respect to the other named individuals, a finding not challenged on appeal. [43] 
	
	
	In oral argument, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge “fastens on the position of Ms Paget-Cooke in a way that really doesn’t answer any question involving the [Director-General].” [44]  Adopting that approach (but ignoring the implicit criticism of the trial judge which is unsustainable given the way the trial was run), all that follows is that the appellant has abandoned a possible basis for inferring a lack of belief in the merit of the prosecution (and malice) on the part of the prosecutor. However, the fact is that the trial judge rejected the allegation of malice against Ms Paget-Cooke: nor was her finding shown on appeal to have been wrong. It follows that a finding of lack of belief in the probability of guilt must be established on a different basis.
	


(c)   prosecutor’s failure to obtain legal advice


	
	Whether or not the Director-General obtained his own legal advice prior to commencing the prosecution is a matter of speculation. If he did, there is no reason to suppose that it would have been along the same lines as Allens’ advice: it is possible and even probable, that it would have addressed the two key questions not addressed by Allens. That inference would not assist the appellant. In that circumstance, if the Director-General did obtain legal advice, the appellant can be no better (nor worse) off than on the case accepted by the respondents, namely that the Director-General did not rely upon legal advice in deciding to commence the prosecution.
	
	
	The alternative hypothesis is that the Director-General did not obtain legal advice before reaching his decision to charge the appellant. How far that can assist the appellant is doubtful. That is so for a number of reasons. First, it was not pleaded as a reason for supposing that the Director-General did not have an actual belief in the probability of the charges being upheld. Secondly, it was not argued that if the Director-General had the relevant belief and there were in fact reasonable grounds to support it, the absence of legal advice providing such grounds satisfied this element of the tort. Thirdly, despite the appellant asserting that he could succeed even if the Allens’ advice had not been provided to the Director-General, this element of the appellant’s case was squarely founded on the dual propositions that the Allens’ advice was inconsistent with the guilt of the appellant and that the Director-General, knowing of that advice, could not have held a belief in the probable guilt of the appellant, if he did not obtain and rely upon his own advice to the contrary. Once the premise based on the Allens’ advice is rejected, the rest of the reasoning falls away.
	
	
	The respondent had an additional objection to this submission, namely that it depended not upon inference but on conjecture and speculation. Adopting the reasoning of Spigelman CJ in Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness, [45]  the respondent noted that the party bearing the burden of proof may only rely upon an inference where the inferred fact is reasonably probable, based on other facts which have also been established as reasonably probable. As the Chief Justice noted, “inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation”, the latter being that which is within the range from “the barely possible to the quite possible.” The negative inference required in the present case was that the Director-General did not have a belief when directing that charges be laid in the probable guilt of the appellant. As the respondent correctly submitted, there was no basis in the facts established to draw such an inference.
	


(d)   failure of Director-General to give evidence


	
	There remains a question as to what inference can be drawn from the failure of the Director-General to give evidence. The complaint raised by the appellant was that the trial judge declined to draw from his absence from the witness box an inference that he lacked an honest belief in the propriety of the prosecution. In substance the challenge depended upon a rejection of the judge’s conclusion that, objectively viewed, the material placed before him was not insufficient to support an honest belief in the appellant’s guilt.
	
	
	The submission was put with slightly different emphasis at different times. On occasion, it appeared to reflect the principle in Blatch v Archer [46]  that “evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted.” At points, the emphasis reflected the rule in Jones v Dunkel, [47]  which, like the present case, was one where the defendant failed to give evidence in his defence. Where two vehicles had collided, the plaintiff had established that the vehicle driven by her deceased husband had probably been on the correct side of the road and the defendant’s vehicle had probably crossed the centre line. The principle (which ought to have been explained to the jury but was not) was, succinctly, that the absence of the defendant from the witness box “cannot be used to make up any deficiency of evidence”, but that the inference available from the plaintiff’s evidence “can be accepted the more readily if the defendant fails to give evidence”. [48] 
	
	
	The inference which can be drawn from the failure by a party to give evidence is a matter which must be addressed with some care. The availability of such an inference was recently explained in Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd: [49] 
	


“[63]   The rule in Jones v Dunkel is that the unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may in appropriate circumstances support an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the party's case. That is particularly so where it is the party which is the uncalled witness. The failure to call a witness may also permit the court to draw, with greater confidence, any inference unfavourable to the party that failed to call the witness, if that uncalled witness appears to be in a position to cast light on whether the inference should be drawn. …

[64]   The rule in Jones v Dunkel permits an inference, not that evidence not called by a party would have been adverse to the party, but that it would not have assisted the party.”


	
	Section 9(1) of the Evidence Act states that the Act “does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence … except so far as this Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment.” There is nothing in the Evidence Act inconsistent with the principles expressed in Blatch v Archer and Jones v Dunkel. (A similar view has been taken in relation to the somewhat different wording in s 9 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). [50] )
	
	
	On the basis of the case described above, the appellant failed to establish that there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. He also failed to establish any relevant motive on the part of the Director-General for commencing the prosecution, other than an intention, in good faith, to enforce the relevant laws protective of native vegetation. The only “fact” on which the appellant could rely to establish a lack of belief in the probability of the appellant’s guilt was the dependence of the case on questions of law and the conceded absence of reliance by the Director-General on legal advice.
	
	
	There are three reasons why the principles relied upon do not assist the appellant. First, while there are often circumstances in which the line between an available inference and mere speculation (as described by Spigelman CJ) is not readily drawn, this was a relatively clear case of a deficiency in the evidence presented by the plaintiff at trial. In short, he had not established a reasonably available inference which called for a response.
	
	
	Secondly, the nature of the inference sought to be drawn will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. Where the inference concerns the state of mind of a state minister, or the head of a government department, as the relevant decision-maker, the inference may be quite weak, on the basis that he or she can be expected to have little recollection of the mental processes which accompanied a decision made some years earlier. Where a decision is made on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a departmental officer, it is common for the memorandum to be provided as a record of the reasons for the decision, which was made by accepting a positive recommendation. In the present case, the recommendation had been tendered by the appellant as part of his case at trial.
	
	
	That is not to say that the inference may not be available that his evidence would not have assisted his case, but rather that more was required for the appellant to make good his claim. The failure to call the Director-General did not demonstrate a belief that his evidence would harm his case. As explained in Kuhl, [51]  the rule in Jones v Dunkel “permits an inference, not that evidence not called by a party would have been adverse to the party, but that it would not have assisted the party.” It was not suggested that the failure to give evidence in the present case constituted an admission against interest; nor would such a finding have been open. [52] 
	
	
	Thirdly, the inference sought to be drawn by the appellant failed to recognise the circumstances in which the particular decision was made. When the charges were laid, the sole issue was not an issue of statutory interpretation. The prosecution depended upon establishing particular facts, the relevance and full extent of which was not to be agreed for some months. Further, although the appellant contended that definitive legal advice in favour of his innocence had been provided to the prosecution team, the officer responsible for the recommendation to lay charges considered the advice unpersuasive and, for reasons explained above, it did not address the critical legal issues. Thus, given the matters in play at the time the decision to prosecute was taken, the Director-General’s concession that he did not, in a relevant sense, rely upon legal advice was understandable and the failure to give oral evidence carried with it little (if any) weight in relation to the present assertion, namely that the prosecution was malicious because his understanding of the law necessary for a successful prosecution was unsustainable.
	
	
	The trial judge concluded that the material considered by the Director-General “does not provide a factual basis from which to infer he had no honest belief in Mr Bailey’s guilt,” with the result, when taken together with the absence of a reasonable basis for concluding, objectively, that the grounds were probably insufficient, that it left “nothing upon which the principle in Jones v Dunkel can operate.” [53]  No error has been established in reaching this conclusion.
	


Maintenance of proceedings after failure in LEC


	
	There was said to be a second stage, temporally, in the appellant’s case. That is, the circumstances were said to have changed following the judgment in the Land and Environment Court.
	
	
	A reading of the amended statement of claim suggests that the request to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal (inaccurately referred to as “the appeal”) was simply a further step in the prosecution of the original charges. The change in circumstances from the date on which the charges were laid, relied on by the appellant, was that a judge in the Land and Environment Court had rejected the prosecution case on two questions of law.
	
	
	If the appellant failed to establish malice with respect to the laying of the charges, how the statement of a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal was said to involve the malicious maintenance of the prosecution was unclear. One factor that had changed since the charges were laid was that the conduct of the proceedings had been taken over by the Crown Solicitor’s Office, which had briefed counsel to appear for the Director-General. Having commenced the prosecution, and lost in the Land and Environment Court, it was entirely consistent with proper purposes of law enforcement for the Director-General to request the judge to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal under s  5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	Further, by the time the matter involving the appellant was heard by Talbot J in the Land and Environment Court, judgment had been given by Bignold J in the related matter of Jackson. With respect to the farm structure exemption under SEPP 46, Talbot J largely adopted the reasoning of Bignold J in Jackson. With respect to the s 12(f) argument based on there being a designated development, Bignold J had come to a different conclusion, namely that it did not provide a basis for exemption where no consent to carry out the designated development had been obtained.
	
	
	As argued in this Court, the new element of malicious prosecution arose from the fact that the Director-General proceeded with the stated case in relation to the appellant, but abandoned a similar case in Jackson which, it was said, involved “an acceptance in the much larger clearing case of Jackson, of innocence of the matter, by reason of the SEPP 46 provisions.” [54] 
	
	
	On the basis that the two matters each involved testing the legal controls over the clearing of native vegetation, why a decision to proceed with one case, but not the other, demonstrated an improper purpose is quite obscure. What is known, however, is that on 23 May 2002, albeit before the decision in Jackson, officers within the Department had noted:
	


“A major issue in [the Jackson case] is whether the Part 8 approval ‘authorised’ the clearing, or whether NVC Act consent was also necessary.”


	
	When Jackson came before the Land and Environment Court, the statement of agreed facts, specific to that matter, noted that the proposed water storage facility required approval under Pt 8 of the Water Act and that “[t]he parties disagree whether such an approval has been given.” It is true that that issue was not reached in Jackson. Indeed the bulk of the reasoning of Bignold J (namely [36]-[106]) addressed the question of law concerning the availability of an exception with respect to designated development under s 12(f). On that point, the prosecution was successful. The question of exemption under SEPP 46 was addressed in eleven short paragraphs, the prosecution construction being rejected.
	
	
	The decision to proceed with the appellant’s matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal was readily explicable on rational grounds. At the very least, it provided no evidence to support a view that the prosecution was being maintained without reasonable and probable cause, or for an improper purpose.
	


Conclusions as to liability


	
	For the foregoing reasons, the appeal against the judgment of Fullerton J with respect to the tort of malicious prosecution must be dismissed. The first appellant, Mr Bailey, being the only party interested in the claim based on malicious prosecution, must pay the respondents’ costs of the liability appeal.
	


Costs


	
	Following dismissal of the claims by the appellants, the respondents sought an order for indemnity costs based on an offer of compromise, stated to be in accordance with r 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and dated 13 May 2011. The judge ordered that the plaintiffs pay the defendants’ costs on the ordinary basis from the commencement of the proceedings on 10 November 2006 up to 13 May 2011 and thereafter as assessed on the indemnity basis. The order was stated to include “all reserved costs and costs ordered to be costs in the cause” but noted that the “costs orders made on 21 April 2011, 1 August 2011 and 17 May 2013 be undisturbed.” [55] 
	
	
	At trial, the defendants relied on an affidavit of Ms Graham, a solicitor employed in the Crown Solicitor’s Office, who averred (without contradiction) that the defendants had, as at 13 May 2011, accrued costs of approximately $500,000. The trial commenced on 15 July 2013 and ran for 21 days. It is inevitable that the costs of preparation in the two years from May 2011 to the commencement of the trial, and the costs of the trial itself, will be a substantial sum. It may also be accepted that the difference between costs assessed on a party and party basis and on an indemnity basis for that period will also be a substantial sum. Given that a costs order favourable to the defendants was in issue in any event on the appeal, leave, if required, would have been granted.
	
	
	The trial judge noted that the application for costs on an indemnity basis was resisted on three grounds, namely that:
	



	
	the offer referred to costs and therefore did not comply with the requirements of r 20.26;
	
	
	the offer was a “token offer” and not a “genuine” offer of compromise; and
	
	
	the costs concerning the issue of damages should be excluded because the defendants raised a defence of illegality on 4 May 2011, which was not determined in the course of the trial. [56] 
	



	
	Each of these matters was reagitated on appeal and may be dealt with in order.
	


(a)   non-compliant offer


	
	The submissions on appeal did not condescend to read the relevant rule, but rather extracted a sentence from a judgment of this Court, taken out of context. The sentence was:  [57] 
	


“On a natural reading, the requirement that an offer for compromise be exclusive of costs means that it may not involve costs at all.”


	
	When construing a statute or other instrument, it is helpful to start with the statutory language. Rule 20.26, as in force in May 2011, relevantly stated:
	


(2)   An offer must be exclusive of costs, except where it states that it is a verdict for the defendant and that the parties are to bear their own costs.

…

(12)   A notice of offer that purports to exclude, modify or restrict the operation of rule 42.14 or 42.15 is of no effect for the purposes of this Division.

The form of the offer by the defendants reflected the terms of subr (2). A submission to the contrary was untenable. The underlying principle, reflected in subr (2), was articulated in subr (12).


	
	The decision in Dean v Stockland Property did not qualify the operation of the rule with respect to the exception. Rather, it was concerned with an offer by an appellant who had been the unsuccessful plaintiff at trial. The Court stated: [58] 
	


“The governing reasoning is inconsistency between an offer of compromise and the provisions of the rules with respect to costs. An offer of compromise involving costs will not necessarily be of no effect by force of r 20.26(12), because the costs will not necessarily be inconsistent with a plaintiff’s (or defendant’s) entitlement to an order for costs. But even in cases not involving payment of a money sum, such as the present case, there will be the inconsistency. And the language of the rule does not confine exclusivity to only some kinds of offers of compromise. The phrase ‘exclusive of’ means ‘excluding, not compromising of’; ‘that excludes’; or ‘so as to exclude’ …. On a natural reading, the requirement that an offer of compromise be exclusive of costs means that it may not involve costs at all.”


	
	Once it is appreciated that Dean had nothing to say about a defendant’s offer, within the exception in subr (2), the primary argument for the appellant must be rejected.
	
	
	The appellants raised a secondary argument which depended on the terms of the covering letter which accompanied the offer of compromise. It stated:
	


“For avoidance of doubt the offer does not affect costs orders expressed in unqualified terms, that is under which costs have been awarded to any of the parties in respect of any interlocutory application or other step in the proceedings to date.”


	
	No doubt there are circumstances in which a covering letter may be expressed in a manner which is intended to qualify the terms of an offer. The language set out above is not in those terms. The challenge could only succeed if the exception under subr (2) referred to an offer which had the effect of undoing a costs order already made (and perhaps paid). No basis was articulated for reading the subrule in this way. The purpose of an offer of compromise is to resolve matters in dispute without litigation; it would be inconsistent with that purpose if the offer were required to be in a form which reopened matters already resolved. The rule (which is no longer in force) should not be read in that way.
	
	
	As the respondents submitted, the construction proposed by the appellants would effectively undermine the principle of finality reflected in r 36.11, providing for the effect of entry of a court order, taken together with the limited circumstances in which an entered order may be set aside or varied. [59] 
	


(b)   whether genuine offer of compromise


	
	The appellants’ submissions characterised the offer as “not a genuine offer of compromise but rather a demand for capitulation.” While there is authority in this Court which uses the language of “genuine offer of compromise,” [60]  such language, which appears to introduce a test as to the subjective motivation of the offeror, is apt to mislead. [61]  The rule contains no such test: what it requires is the characterisation of the offer, in the circumstances in which it was made, as constituting an “offer of compromise”. To adopt the appellants’ rhetoric, if the offer required the other party to capitulate (that is abandon its claim entirely) with no benefit foregone by the offeror, it might not constitute an offer within the terms of the rule. However, as rejection of a claim would normally involve payment of the defendant’s costs, an offer to forego substantial costs in circumstances where it may reasonably be expected by the offeror that costs would follow the event, will generally involve an element of compromise: it did so in the present context, as the trial judge correctly held.
	
	
	This reasoning, which has been articulated by the Court on prior occasions not referred to by the appellants, requires that their arguments be rejected.
	


(c)   costs of assessing damages


	
	The appellants repeated their complaint at trial that the indemnity costs should not extend to the costs of assessing damages. If it mattered, they asserted that some 35% of their costs related to damages. It was presumably to be inferred that a similar percentage of costs of the defendants related to damages. Ultimately, having dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims at the liability stage, it was not necessary for the trial judge to address the question of damages. However, neither that fact, nor the fact that certain aspects of the assessment were agreed (thus reducing the potential costs), affect the entitlement to recover costs. Nor is there anything in the rules to suggest that an order for indemnity costs under Pt 42, r 15A should properly be refused in relation to the costs of undetermined issues. Again, such an approach would be disruptive of the underlying purpose of the rule. As explained by Burchett J in Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry Commission, [62]  a defendant is entitled to raise its earthworks at more than one point and if successful at the first point, is not to be deprived of its costs with respect to other defences which turned out not to be required. (No doubt the defences must each be reasonable in their own terms, but there was no suggestion to the contrary in this case.)
	
	
	It follows that the challenge to the costs order must be rejected. Both appellants must bear the costs of that aspect of the appeal in this Court.
	


Orders


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	


(1)   Dismiss the appeal with respect to the dismissal of the first appellant’s claim for damages for malicious prosecution.

(2)   Order that the first appellant pay the respondents’ costs of the appeal on liability.

(3)   Dismiss the appellants’ appeal from the orders made by the trial judge as to the costs of the trial.

(4)   Order that the appellants pay the respondents’ costs of the appeal with respect to the costs of the trial.


	
	GLEESON JA: I agree with Basten JA.
	
	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Basten JA.

2767952,Nguyen v R [2015] NSWCCA 268,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J.
	
	
	PRICE J: Duc Thai Nguyen, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by King SC DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on 6 June 2014.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty in the Central Local Court to one count of supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (44.305 kilograms of cannabis leaf) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He adhered to his plea in the District Court. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 25(2) is 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced by the judge to a term of imprisonment of 4 years consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 1 year. The earliest date that the applicant will be eligible to be released to parole is 24 July 2016. His Honour had allowed a 25 per cent discount on sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The notice of appeal identifies three grounds:
	


a) “The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the Applicant’s involvement in the supply of the prohibited drug was higher than that of [sic] courier.

b) The Sentencing Judge erred by failing to take into account evidence relevant to a finding of special circumstances, and then failed to make a finding of special circumstances.

c) The sentencing for the offence of supply prohibited drug was [sic] excessive.”

Proceedings on Sentence


	
	In view of the issues raised in the first ground of appeal, it is necessary to refer to the proceedings on sentence before the judge, which commenced on 2 May 2014 and continued on 26 May 2014.
	
	
	On 2 May 2014, the Crown tendered a bundle of documents that included an agreed statement of facts and the transcript of a record of interview between the police and the applicant.
	
	
	The agreed facts may be summarised as follows:
	
	
	On 25 July 2013 at 10:00pm, police attached to Hurstville Highway Patrol were conducting mobile patrols in the Penshurst area. While police were driving, the Automated Number Plate Recognition system (ANPR) sounded to signal that vehicle BG03KS (NSW), a black Hyundai, was unregistered.
	
	
	Police followed the applicant, who was driving the Hyundai, in an attempt to pull him over. The applicant turned left on to Cambridge Street in Penshurst and parked his vehicle in a designated parking spot not far from the intersection of Forest Road. The applicant got out of the vehicle and began to walk west across Cambridge Street, attempting to cross the road.
	
	
	Police stopped the applicant and had a conversation with him. The applicant denied any knowledge of the vehicle and stated, “I’m waiting for a friend to pick me up.” Police continued to question the applicant who then admitted to driving the vehicle.
	
	
	Police subjected the applicant to a search, during which they located the keys to the vehicle. When the police began to search the vehicle the applicant fled the scene on foot. The police chased the applicant but lost sight of him when he ran into a unit block. The police called for further assistance in searching for the applicant.
	
	
	At about 10:30pm, the applicant walked out of a driveway in Arcadia Street, Penshurst, turned left, and began to walk south along the eastern footpath. Plain clothes police approached the applicant and said, “Excuse me buddy.” The applicant turned around and ran north along the eastern footpath. He then turned right to the rear of the unit block where police finally caught him. The applicant was cautioned and arrested with the formalities of LEPRA complied with.
	
	
	The applicant was escorted to Hurstville Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview. During the interview he stated that he was asked to drive some bags from Rockdale to Hurstville, where he would receive $20,000. He told police that he recognised that the bags contained marijuana by the smell, and he was doing the delivery to pay for his studies.
	
	
	The vehicle was thoroughly searched whereupon five bags of cannabis were seized. The cannabis weighed a total of 44.305 kilograms.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact that the applicant’s role was that of a courier.
	
	
	Photographs were also tendered which showed that the five bags were large black plastic bags.
	
	
	During the sentencing proceedings, the judge noted that the facts asserted that the applicant’s role was that of a courier. His Honour said (T4 20-24, 2/5/14):
	


“It’s a matter for the Court to assess the role of the offender, not for it to be the subject of some agreement between the parties and I can see nothing in the facts that I’ve read so far that would, in fact, indicate that Mr Nguyen was simply a courier.”


	
	The judge observed that the applicant had been discovered running from an unregistered car which had 45 kilograms of marijuana in the back. The applicant gave no identification of any person other than the “mysterious Rob” who was ‘apparently’ known as Tony for the purposes of a phone number being supplied to him. The applicant could not identify where Rob or Tony could be located. The judge said that the applicant gave an entirely implausible account of his relationship with that person and how he came to be performing the task of delivery to an unknown person for $20,000 cash. The judge remarked that the applicant claimed to have been given a sim card but had conveniently run from the motor vehicle taking with him either one or two mobile phones that he suggested he had destroyed or lost during the course of his evading police.
	
	
	The Crown put to the judge that he “would be required to sentence in accordance with the facts before your Honour, which stipulate the role of the offender in no uncertain terms.” (T5 15-20 2/5/14).
	
	
	The judge said that in the absence of further information which indicated that the applicant was a “mere courier”, he did not propose to accept his plea on that agreed basis.
	
	
	His Honour had earlier opined that the facts were deficient in that they did not provide information concerning the quality or value of the prohibited drug.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel then sought an adjournment which his Honour granted. The proceedings were adjourned to 26 May 2014.
	
	
	On 26 May 2014, two statements of Detective Senior Constable Kennis were tendered. Detective Kennis had reviewed the Analyst’s certificate which stated that the number of resealable plastic bags totalled 99 with a combined weight of 44.305 kilograms equating to 97.471 pounds. Detective Kennis opined that a realistic wholesale price per pound was in excess of $3,100, although significantly higher amounts could be obtained if sold in reduced quantities. Using a conservative price of one pound at the wholesale value of $2,800 per pound, Detective Kennis stated that a total value of $271,600 could be achieved if the 97 pounds were sold in one pound amounts, but a realistic wholesale value would be in excess of $300,700.
	
	
	The applicant did not give or call evidence during the proceedings on sentence. However, a report of Mr David Green, a psychologist, was tendered together with letters from the applicant’s mother and brother, some medical records from Bach Mai hospital and some business and academic records.
	
	
	After hearing submissions from the Crown and applicant’s counsel, the judge set the matter down for sentence on 6 June 2014.
	


Some findings by the judge


	
	His Honour sentenced the applicant on 6 June 2014. In his remarks on sentence, he gave detailed reasons for not accepting that the applicant was a courier.
	
	
	The judge found that it was impossible to accept that the applicant was being honest in the Record of Interview, and in his story of how he came into possession of the cannabis. His Honour remarked (ROS 10):
	


“It was a matter for the offender to demonstrate to the Court, at least on the balance of probabilities, that he was a courier rather than someone more significantly concerned in the offence. He did not give evidence, and in the light of his entirely unbelievable story, I reject the asserted “Agreed Fact” that he was a courier. ”


	
	The judge said (ROS 10):
	


“[The applicant] was a 24 year old driving a motor vehicle, in possession of a substantial quantity of pre-packaged cannabis leaf, who in the circumstances was likely to have realised that the marked police vehicle that he drove past, then travelling in the opposite direction, had performed a U-turn to follow him; that thereafter he decided to turn off Forest Road at the earliest convenient point and desert the vehicle in the hope that he would go undetected - and when that failed, to flee from the police and destroy incriminating material, or potentially incriminating material by disposing of his mobile phone or phones, both to protect himself and others. When interviewed, he invented an entirely implausible account for his conduct.

In the circumstances, I will sentence him on the basis that he is a person found to have been in possession of approximately 99 pounds of cannabis leaf, possessed by him for the purposes of sale.” (Italics added)


	
	His Honour observed that the applicant had approximately 44 per cent of a large commercial quantity of cannabis leaf. He found that “The offence [was] clearly a serious incidence of supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug.” (ROS 10 -11).
	
	
	The judge said as Mr Green, the psychologist, had been provided by the applicant with the implausible story that he had been a ‘courier’, it was impossible to accept that the psychologist’s findings and opinion were based on fact, with the exception of some personal matters in respect of the applicant’s family and past history. The judge considered that there was nothing to indicate that the applicant, as he said in his record of interview, had committed the offence in order to finance his study in Australia because of outstanding debts. His Honour noted that no invoices had been provided to the court in relation to any debts owed by the applicant, whereas invoices had been provided in relation to the outstanding fees of his younger brother.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant was involved in trafficking to a substantial degree. He was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was in possession of approximately 99 pounds of pre-packaged cannabis leaf for the purpose of sale. He was unable to accept there was any evidence of remorse or contrition evidenced by the plea which was, in the circumstances, in the face of an overwhelming Crown case.
	
	
	In his Honour’s view, both general and specific deterrence were important in his considerations.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	The judge summarised the applicant’s subjective circumstances from the report of the psychologist. He recounted that the applicant was born in Vietnam on 14 February 1990 and came to Australia when he was 16 years of age. The applicant’s family were close, supportive and stable. At the direction of his parents he came to Australia to study in order to advance his prospects.
	
	
	The judge said that the applicant had initially studied in Melbourne, and then at the Holmes Secondary College where he achieved the Higher School Certificate in 2008. His Honour referred to a number of certificates tendered, which outlined that the applicant had passed the Carrick Institute of Education Diploma of Business course and an intensive English language course at the Western English Language School.
	
	
	His Honour observed that the applicant was 24 years of age, with no previous criminal history and that this was his first time in custody. He said that, in his view, the applicant’s relative youth and the fact that it was his first time in custody did not amount to special circumstances so as to vary the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term.
	


Ground 1: The Sentencing Judge erred in finding that the Applicant’s involvement in the supply of the prohibited drug was higher than that of [sic] courier.

Argument


	
	The applicant complained that the judge erred in finding that his involvement in the supply of the prohibited drug was higher than that of a courier.
	
	
	He referred to the five bags of cannabis that were seized and submitted that they could be described as black opaque garbage bags. He pointed to the photographs of the cannabis seized by police (ex 1) and argued that they were not considered and should have been considered by the judge. The applicant noted that there was no concession in the agreed facts that he had any knowledge other than that cannabis was in those bags.
	
	
	The applicant contended that the judge considered the pre-packaged state of the prohibited drug was relevant to a determination of his role and that it was an aggravating circumstance. It was submitted that his Honour must have imparted knowledge upon the applicant, specifically that the applicant knew of the pre-packaged state of the prohibited drug which was not established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the applicant argued that the judge made his decision to attribute to the applicant a much higher level than that of a courier, which was part of the agreed facts. The applicant argued that his Honour did so in such a way that it was inextricably linked to evidence that there were 99 one pound bags referred to as “deals”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was for the judge alone to decide on the sentence to be imposed and, for that purpose, the judge must find the relevant facts. Further, that while there can be an understanding between the prosecution and the defence, this does not bind the judge except in the practical sense that the judge’s capacity to find facts will be affected by the evidence and the admissions.
	
	
	The Crown observed that apart from rejecting that the applicant was a “mere courier”, the judge did not make any other finding as to the applicant’s role in the supply of the drug. The Crown contended that while the judge rejected the mitigating factor that the applicant was a “mere courier”, this did not amount to an adverse finding to aggravate the offence. Furthermore, as the judge had rejected the agreed fact that the applicant was a courier, the applicant then bore the onus of establishing that, on the balance of probabilities, his role was that of a courier.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that nowhere in the remarks did the judge attribute knowledge of the pre-packaged state of the prohibited drug to the applicant.
	


Decision


	
	The applicant accepted that it was open to the judge to reject the agreed fact that he was a courier. The applicant’s complaint is that his Honour failed to make a proper assessment of the applicant’s role, ascribing to him knowledge of the pre-packaged state of the cannabis.
	
	
	It is well established that a sentencing judge is not bound to accept agreed facts that are presented to him by the Crown and the defence. A judge’s sentencing discretion must be exercised in the public interest. A judge is not obliged to refrain from questioning facts even though they may be agreed: Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 per Kirby at [606]; R v Uzabeaga [2000] NSWCCA 381 per Bell J at [34].
	
	
	When a sentencing judge considers that an offender has a higher degree of culpability than detailed in the agreed facts, the judge, as a matter of procedural fairness, must give the parties an opportunity to address the judge’s view: Uzabeaga at [35]-[38].
	
	
	In the present appeal, the judge informed the parties of his intention not to accept the agreed fact that the applicant was a courier. He gave his reasons for such a finding and appropriately gave the applicant an adjournment so that his view could be addressed.
	
	
	When the sentencing hearing resumed, the judge heard evidence that the five black plastic bags found in the vehicle contained 99 resealable bags with a combined weight of 44.305 kilograms of cannabis. A finding that the applicant knew that the resealable bags were inside the black plastic bags required proof beyond reasonable doubt: R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. The difficulty of attributing such knowledge to the applicant is evidenced by the lack of an admission and the opaqueness of the five black plastic bags.
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint that the judge ascribed such knowledge to the applicant is entirely without foundation. Nowhere in the sentencing remarks did his Honour refer to the applicant having knowledge of the resealable bags. The judge focused on the applicant’s actions when he fled from the vehicle and his implausible account for his conduct. The judge confined his finding on the applicant’s role to being “a person found to have been in possession of approximately 99 pounds of cannabis leaf, possessed by him for the purposes of sale.”
	
	
	The findings made by his Honour were open on the material before him and no error is revealed. This ground of appeal has not been established.
	


Ground 2: The Sentencing Judge erred by failing to take into account evidence relevant to a finding of special circumstances, and then failed to make a finding of special circumstance.

Argument


	
	The applicant submitted that the judge failed to take into account matters relevant to the assessment of whether special circumstances apply, specifically:
	



	
	The isolation the applicant was likely to suffer as a foreign national in an Australian prison with no prospect of a visit from his parents; and
	
	
	In determining the non–parole period, the applicant’s rehabilitative prospects.
	



	
	In oral submissions, the applicant argued that the judge did not refer to the applicant’s rehabilitative prospects and if he had, it would have impacted upon the assessment of special circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown contended that this Court has, on a number of occasions, rejected the proposition that the fixing of a non-parole period is a matter that is to be determined solely or primarily by reason of considerations of rehabilitation. The Crown submitted that the judge did not accept what the applicant told the psychologist, so there was nothing upon which the judge had to base any assessment of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	A further argument was that the judge took into account the absence of the applicant’s family in mitigation of the sentence. The Crown argued that to take this into account as a special circumstance would amount to double counting.
	


Decision


	
	A finding of special circumstances so as to adjust the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term is a “discretionary finding of fact” in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Allen v R [2015] NSWCCA 113 at [33]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [27].
	
	
	It is appropriate to mention that the fixing of a non-parole period solely, or primarily, by reason of considerations of rehabilitation has been long rejected: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [57], Allen at [37].
	
	
	During the proceedings on sentence the applicant’s counsel submitted that the judge could make a finding of special circumstances based on the fact that it would be the applicant’s first custodial sentence and that custody would more likely be more onerous for the applicant as he was a foreign national whose family support was located overseas.
	
	
	In his sentencing remarks, the judge took into account: “that the circumstances of [the applicant’s] custody in Australia would in those circumstances be more onerous than it might be for a person who had a greater number of family available to assist them during their period of custody.” (ROS 15). Having taken this matter into account as a mitigating factor, the judge correctly did not regard it as a special circumstance.
	
	
	His Honour went on to find that the applicant’s “relative youth” and “first time in custody” did not amount to special circumstances. These findings were open to the judge in the exercise of his discretion.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel did not specifically submit to the judge that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation constituted special circumstances. The applicant’s counsel did submit that the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation appeared to be favourable and the judge could easily find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. He submitted that the impact of this finding would result in less weight being placed on specific deterrence. Furthermore, the expression of remorse and no subsequent misconduct supported a finding that rehabilitation was complete.
	
	
	However, the judge rejected the psychologist’s opinions which included a low overall risk of re-offending. His Honour said that in light of his finding that the applicant’s story to police was entirely implausible, and in the absence of the applicant giving evidence, he was unable to accept there was any evidence of remorse or contrition.
	
	
	Accordingly, there was no material before the judge that would support a positive finding as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. A decision to find special circumstances is one of fact. The judge was not obliged in the applicant’s case to decide that his rehabilitative prospects constituted special circumstances so as to reduce the non-parole period.
	
	
	I would not uphold this Ground of Appeal.
	


Ground 3: The sentencing for the offence of supply prohibited drug was [sic] excessive.

Argument


	
	The applicant contended that the failure by the judge to make a proper assessment of his role in the commission of the offence resulted in an excessive sentence. The applicant submitted that the following factors should have resulted in a lesser sentence:
	


a)   He was 24 years of age at the time of sentence;

b)   He had no prior convictions;

c)   He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court;

d)   There was no evidence that he knew the drugs had been pre-packaged into 99 one-pound “deals”; and

e)   There ought to have been a finding that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.


	
	In particular, the applicant referred to R v Girard and Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170, in which a husband and wife were found to be heavily involved in a large scale supply of cannabis. They received a head sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months. The applicant also cited R v Canino [2002] NSWCCA 76, which was a Crown appeal. This Court allowed the appeal in relation to the supply of 17.3 kilograms of cannabis. The sentence was increased from a 2 year suspended sentence to a total term of 2 years with a non-parole period of 9 months.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentence was not excessive, that the judge did not impute knowledge to the applicant, that the judge had appropriately taken into account the applicant’s relative youth and lack of prior convictions and had not accepted the psychologist’s findings. The Crown pointed out that each of the cases relied upon by the applicant were wholly distinguishable as none of those cases involved the same offence as the present case.
	


Decision


	
	In order to succeed in this ground of appeal, the applicant must show that his sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Intervention by this Court is not warranted simply because it might have exercised the sentencing discretion in a manner different to the judge: Markarian at [28]; Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [57].
	
	
	As I have previously stated, the judge neither failed to make a proper assessment of the applicant’s role nor did he find that the applicant knew that the cannabis was in a pre-packaged state. His Honour was not obliged to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. The judge referred to the applicant’s age and lack of prior convictions and plainly took these matters into account. He allowed a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty which appropriately reflected that the plea had been entered at the earliest opportunity.
	
	
	The applicant was in possession of 44.305 kilograms of cannabis leaf with a realistic wholesale value of $300,700. As his Honour recognised, both specific and general deterrence are important in drug offences, such as this. This Court has emphasised that the principles of specific and general deterrence in drug supply matters should not merely be paid lip service but given real effect: Radi v R [2013] NSWCCA 278 at [28]. Other than the applicant’s lack of prior offending, there was little that mitigated the objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The authorities referred to by the applicant were of little assistance as the offences concerned in each case were founded upon s 25 of the Drugs, Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which had a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, whereas the present offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. Moreover, Canino was a Crown appeal and the sentence imposed on resentence was the least sentence that could have been imposed in the court below.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. I would not uphold this Ground of Appeal.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	


a)   Leave to appeal granted.

b)   Appeal dismissed.


	
	BUTTON J: I agree with Price J.

2767956,R v Hall; Hall v R [2015] NSWDC 359,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a young man who is still only 20 years old, but who has committed two serious offences. The second is more serious than the first. In addition, he was sentenced by a magistrate to some gaol terms and he has appealed against those sentences. Finally he breached a good behaviour bond and I am dealing with him for that as well.
	
	
	In sentencing him I take into account not only what he did and his prior criminal record, but also things which are personal to him, including his background and what happened to him in his formative years.
	
	
	It is always important to start with formally noting of the crimes that I am dealing with. The young man’s name is Corey Hall. As I said, he is still only 20 years old. He has pleaded guilty and adhered to the pleas to two offences of aggravated break, enter and steal. They were both committed on 26 April 2015. Both of them are offences against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section sets a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that crime. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment to that crime. They are the two crimes that I am sentencing him for. When I am sentencing him for the more serious of the two aggravated break, enter and steal offences, Corey Hall has asked me to take into account another crime which he committed at the same time of stealing a motor car. I will take that into account and I have signed a form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) certifying that I will take that into account.
	
	
	Turning to the formalities of the appeal, Corey Hall was charged with two offences arising out of some disorderly conduct on 15 March 2015, about five weeks before the two break enter and steal offences. One is intimidation which is offence against s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). That offence carries a maximum of five years imprisonment, although the magistrate was limited to a maximum of two years imprisonment. When he came before the Local Court magistrate on 25 August 2015 at Tamworth Local Court, his Honour imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment. That commenced on 29 April 2015 when Corey Hall was arrested. His Honour fixed a non-parole period for that sentence of six months. That sentence started on 29 April 2015 and is due to expire on 28 April next year. The non-parole period fixed by his Honour started on the same day and is due to expire later this month on 28 October.
	
	
	His Honour also sentenced Corey Hall for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm which occurred on the same occasion. That is an offence against s 59(1) of the Crimes Act. His Honour imposed a sentence of 12 months with a non-parole period of six months to be served over exactly the same period of time as the intimidation offence. I should say that the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm carries a maximum of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	The last matter which the Local Court magistrate sentenced Corey Hall on was for contravening an apprehended violence order. That occurred, it seems, in the early hours of 26 April 2015. It occurred in other words after the two break enter and steal offences. His Honour fixed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for that with a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	I should add that Corey Hall pleaded guilty to all three offences before the magistrate and all three offences received exactly the same sentence. In that way, the magistrate’s sentence could be regarded as lenient because there were three different offences involving three different victims or interested persons.
	
	
	Finally I have to deal with Corey Hall because he breached a good behaviour bond. He got himself into yet another brawl last year on 25 October 2014. His partner, Alana Purcell, tried to calm him down but when she did this, Corey Hall pushed her to the chest and she became unbalanced and stumbled backwards. Because he was drunk at the time - a problem that he has and that I will come back to - the police, despite the fact that Alana Purcell did not complain, issued a apprehended violence order. One of the terms of the orders was that Corey Hall was not to be with Alana Purcell after he had been drinking. He had to wait for about 12 hours. After he had committed the two break, enter and steal offences he returned to the house of his partner Alana Purcell. But he had been drinking and was fairly intoxicated, so in returning to spend the night at her place he had breached that apprehended violence order.
	
	
	I need to correct what I have said. When Corey Hall was in a brawl on 25 October 2014 he came to be sentenced by the magistrate. The sentence he received was imposed on 6 February 2015. Corey Hall received a good behaviour bond. But then when he got himself into the brawl the following month on 14 March 2015 where he intimidated someone and assaulted somebody else, he breached that good behaviour bond. I have to deal with that breach of the good behaviour bond. It is probably convenient to deal with that straight away.
	
	
	The magistrate in February this year gave Corey Hall a benefit in giving him a good behaviour bond. But he has acknowledged that he breached the bond. The options which I have are set out in s 98 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 98(2) provides that if I am satisfied that an offender has failed to comply with a condition of a good behaviour bond I may decide to take no action with respect to that failure or I may vary the conditions of the bond or impose further conditions, or I may revoke the bond.
	
	
	Because of the various other matters which I am dealing with, including the appeals and two serious break, enter and steal matters, the breach of the good behaviour bond that occurred when he got himself into the brawl on 14 March 2015 fades away in significance.
	
	
	So the first order which I make is this. I am satisfied that Corey Hall failed to comply with a condition of the good behaviour bond imposed on 6 February 2015 and under s 98(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I decide to take no action with respect to that failure to comply.
	
	
	I turn next to the appeals. As I said, there are appeals from three concurrent sentences imposed by the magistrate on 25 August this year arising out of three offences: intimidation, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravening an apprehended violence order.
	
	
	I should say what happened to give rise to the intimidation and assault charges. As I said, they occurred because Corey Hall got himself into a brawl. Again, it seems that he was drunk. It was about 9 o'clock at night on Saturday 14 March this year. He turned up at someone’s house, walked onto the front lawn and said to one of the occupants “Your kids aren’t here, let’s have a dig.” He was told by one of the occupants to “just clear off”, but Corey Hall continued to bait that man into fighting him. He said “Come out, I’ll jump all over your head.” He removed his shirt and threw it at someone else. Finally the man he was threatening or intimidating went and called the police. There was another man who had been watching this exchange, who told him to “just get in the car and fuck off”. Corey Hall returned the abuse. The first man’s abuse was justified; Corey Hall’s was not. The man continued to tell him to leave, but instead of leaving, Corey Hall grabbed the man’s singlet with both of his hands. He then punched the man to his face and head using both fists. The man obviously felt immediate pain and discomfort and did not get a punch away. Corey Hall only stopped when the man’s partner intervened. The man, according to the facts of the offence contained in exhibit E “sustained a very swollen left cheek and black left eye. He also sustained a split to his left ear.” The injuries caused him pain and discomfort. Arising from that behaviour Corey Hall was charged with the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
	
	
	The third matter that Corey Hall is appealing from is the offence of contravening an apprehended violence order. That arose in these circumstances. As I said, there was an apprehended violence order in favour of his partner issued by the police. It prevented him from being with her after he had been drinking. As we know, he committed two break enter and steal offences on 26 April this year. What he did after the second was to go home to his partner’s place. He had been drinking, hence he breached the apprehended violence order.
	
	
	Breaching an apprehended violence order is regarded as a serious offence. It is dealt with under s 14 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of two years imprisonment to the offence. Parliament has gone on to say in s 14(4) that unless I otherwise order, a “person who is convicted of an offence against subsection (1) must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment if the act constituting the offence was an act of violence against a person.” It is relevant to observe that this breach of the apprehended violence order involved no violence to anyone, although it was clearly a breach. Corey Hall put himself in the presence of his partner despite the fact that he had been drinking. It is the fact that when he drinks it causes a lot of problems in his life including why he is now in gaol. Despite that prohibition he put himself, but more significantly his partner, at risk. His only risk was being caught. His partner’s risk was greater because he cannot be trusted after he has been drinking. Again, that offence is not as serious as some examples are. Some breaches of apprehended violence order themselves involve further violence to the same victim. Again, the offence must be seen in its context. I am sentencing him for far more serious offences. What I propose to do - given that there is no suggestion of any personal violence and some efforts on Corey Hall’s part in due course to do some rehabilitation - is to simply record a conviction in respect of that offence.
	
	
	So the second formal order which I make is this. In respect of the appeal against the sentence for the contravene apprehended violence order I determine under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine that appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of that sentence, under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I convict Corey Hall and dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty.
	
	
	I now turn to Corey Hall’s appeals from his sentences for the intimidation and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm that he committed whilst in the brawl on 14 March this year. The intimidation offence was not a serious example of that kind of offence, but it was a significant breach of the peace. His action persisted as well. I, myself, would not have imposed a 12 month sentence, but I would have imposed a sentence of four months imprisonment. In due course I will do that.
	
	
	The assault occasioning actual bodily harm was a more significant offence in this case. Taking into account the injuries which the victim sustained, I would impose a fixed sentence of six months imprisonment for that offence.
	
	
	Hence, I will make a further order in disposing of those appeals. In respect of the appeals from the sentences for intimidation and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine those appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences.
	
	
	For the offence of intimidation I fix a sentence of four months imprisonment to commence on 29 April 2015 and to expire on 28 August 2015. In other words, that sentence has expired.
	
	
	In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm I impose of six months imprisonment to commence on 29 April 2015 and to expire on 28 October 2015.
	
	
	I turn now to the serious crimes that Corey Hall has committed. As I said, there were two aggravated break, enter and steal offences. Both of them were aggravated because on each occasion Corey Hall was in company with a co-offender.
	
	
	Things started harmlessly enough with a group of friends playing two-up on Anzac Day this year. They went home and then Corey Hall and another man, his co-accused called Dylan Lake, turned up. The four of them left late that evening. Before they left, one of his friends left his two-up winnings on the table. There was about $280. All four of them went off to a hotel in Tamworth. What happened there though was that Corey Hall and Dylan Lake were refused entry. What they did after they were refused entry was to go back to the house where their friends or acquaintances lived and broke in. When they broke in they stole the cash and some other coins. When they broke in they tried breaking into the front door but it wouldn’t give way, so they went around the back and broke in through a fly screen. They lifted the window by pushing it in. They were looking for alcohol. It seems that Corey Hall didn’t know anything about the $280 and that Dylan Lake had likely stolen that but, of course, they were both co-offenders in the break enter and steal. They even tried to get into a safe, but they could not open it.
	
	
	Then they found some car keys belonging to one of the occupants of the house. They talked about stealing the car and doing a job. Corey Hall said that they went back looking for some clothes to cover their identity and some socks to put on their hands. Then they took the keys and stole the car. That is the offence that I take into account when I will be sentencing Corey Hall on the more serious of the two aggravated break, enter and steal crimes.
	
	
	What they then did with the car was to drive to a business called Country Auctions in Armidale Road, Nemingha. They stopped over the road, put their hooded jumpers on and then reversed into the front window of Country Auctions. Corey Hall went in first; he grabbed a till drawer and they left and drove off. They counted the money and divided it up. Corey Hall said he got $250 and he thought that his co-offender, Dylan Lake, also got $250. But in fact the business said that $1,500 in cash was stolen.
	
	
	They disposed of the clothing that was used to try to camouflage them and then Corey Hall turned up at Alana Purcell’s place. She dropped Dylan Lake home and Corey Hall stayed there despite the fact that he had been drinking and would be in breach of one of conditions of the apprehended violence order. That second offence, as one can see, was a serious example of this kind of offence and one considered by the courts in the category of ram raid crimes.
	
	
	Corey Hall is still a young man, but despite this he has a criminal record. He was dealt with in the Children’s Court for offences such as stealing from the person, goods in custody, break, enter and steal, malicious damage, assaulting school staff and stealing a car. In the Local Court when he became an adult he was dealt with for receiving and common assault. He gets no leniency from his criminal record. It does not, in a case such as this, aggravate the sentence, but he loses any leniency that a person might get for not having any criminal record at all.
	
	
	In addition, when he committed these two crimes he was on his good behaviour bond, in fact more than one, from 6 February 2015. But he was also on bail after being charged with the offences to do with brawling earlier on. What that means is that the magistrates had taken a considered decision not to send him into custody, but instead to sentence him to a good behaviour bond or to grant him bail whilst other offences are dealt with, and to release him into the community for his own betterment and not to expose him to prison. Despite that opportunity, Corey Hall committed these two further serious offences. The fact that he committed those serious offences whilst he was on what we call conditional liberty is an aggravating factor in sentencing him.
	
	
	Ms W McAuliffe appeared for Corey Hall in Tamworth and called her client to give evidence. He confirmed that his partner is still Alana Purcell. She has a daughter and together they have a son who is aged 14 months. He referred to a letter which he wrote to me as the sentencing judge and said that he told the truth in that letter. The letter contained information about his background. He never had a relationship with his father. Indeed, he said when his mother was pregnant with him (Corey Hall) his father wanted her to have an abortion and did not want anything to do with Corey Hall. His father left and his mother formed a relationship with another man. There were other children and he lived in a household of six children altogether. With the other man that his mother lived with in Corey Hall’s household there were alcohol, drugs and domestic violence. He said his mother and sisters faced most of the domestic violence. It was from his step-father. Then finally his mother’s parents stepped in and took responsibility for the six of them.
	
	
	Despite the fact that his grandparents had six of their own children, they took in Corey Hall and his siblings. He got into a fight with one of his uncles and got into trouble at school and was finally expelled when he was 16. His grandparents insisted on him working and he got a job for a couple of days a week, but he was not earning enough money so his grandparents asked him to leave home when he was 16. He became effectively homeless, sleeping on friends’ couches. He started to drink; in fact he started to binge drink. He started to commit more serious crimes. This was so he could afford the alcohol.
	
	
	Then Corey Hall met Alana Purcell. He changed. He stopped drinking for a while, he got himself a job working five days a week. But the pressure built up and they would have fights every now and again. The pressure was increased by them having their little boy. He started going out and drinking. She told him to stop. He acknowledged that his preference was to go out drinking so they split up. He said all of the offences he has committed and that I am dealing with him for were related to alcohol. He has had problems with alcohol since he was 16, except for the time when things were good between him and Alana Purcell. He had no serious help with his alcohol problem.
	
	
	Corey Hall has said that he is prepared to give evidence against his co-offender. I say that in this context because he is presently in custody bail refused, or under sentence from the magistrate, and is in protective custody. Asked by Ms McAuliffe what that meant, he said the hours are the same but he is stuck in a cage away from other inmates. He has received some threats from the relatives of Dylan Lake or people he knows. He confirmed that he is prepared to give evidence against Dylan Lake who is apparently pleading not guilty.
	


L MCAULIFFE: Your Honour if I may interject. I have received email from our Tamworth solicitors who said that Mr Dylan Lake has considered entering pleas of guilty to the offence. I do apologise, but I don’t have a confirmation of the change of pleas.

W MCAULIFFE: I have a recollection of seeing Mr Lake on Tuesday where he entered pleas of guilty your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks, I do not think that will make a lot of difference.


	
	Corey Hall is hoping that his former employer will offer him a job, but that is no guarantee. He acknowledged the impact of breaking into his own friends’ home would have on them in losing trust. He has not had an opportunity to apologise in person.
	
	
	He was cross-examined by Ms G Wasilewicz who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions at Tamworth. She had asked whether he had done any courses whilst in custody. He said there had been only one AA meeting for the last few months and no courses. He was on remand. He said that he broke into places during the week so that he could drink at weekends. It was feeding his alcohol habit. He broke up with his partner at the end of last year. He acknowledged that his anger was a problem as well and that it had caused the breakup in his relationship.
	
	
	In the letter to me which became exhibit 1 Corey Hall confirmed that part of the troubles he faced as a child meant that he became isolated and that his academic record suffered along with his life at home. That is hardly surprising. He had no one to guide him and felt that he needed to steal money so that he could buy alcohol. He said that he is “ready to deal with the problems”. He acknowledges that alcohol leads to further problems rather than to solving them.
	
	
	I have some further information about Corey Hall because he was assessed by someone from the Community Corrections Service at Corrective Services and they prepared a pre-sentence report. It was dated 15 September 2015, so is fairly up to date, and the author said that Corey Hall has “a history of offending related to alcohol abuse. He acknowledged, and his partner and mother confirm, that he is unable to drink alcohol at a ‘social’ level. He related that he is ‘unable to stop’ and usually drinks to excess when he consumes alcohol. He reports illogical and unusual behaviour during these periods and frequently with limited recall.” It notes his successful attempts at getting some control over his alcohol last year. The author said that Corey Hall “readily admitted his guilt and did not dispute the police allegations. He stated that his abuse of alcohol was the cause. He accepted responsibility for his actions and did not attempt to apportion blame to his co-offender.” The author of the report thought that he would benefit from supervision.
	
	
	One other piece of evidence I did not mention is in relation to the ram raid offence. The damage caused to the business that they drove the car into amounts to some $18,000. Exhibit D shows that.
	
	
	I have been assisted by written submissions from Ms W McAuliffe which became MFI 1 and oral submissions from both Ms W McAuliffe and Ms Wasilewicz. I agree with Ms W McAuliffe that the fact that the offences were committed in company is not an additional aggravating factor, it is a part of the crime. One of the offences was committed in the home of the victims. As she pointed out, they were not home at the time, but that might have made the offence worse. They came home to find that their house had been broken into and things stolen. That to my mind is still an aggravating feature. As she fairly acknowledged, the offences were committed whilst her client was on conditional liberty.
	
	
	It was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. In both cases there was some planning, less for the first crime, but the second crime involved some more planning. They needed to get themselves some camouflage or disguise and they needed to get the car, select a victim’s business and then commit the crime. But it was not planning that lasted over hours or days, but probably over half an hour or so. I agree with her that the financial gain involved is part of the definition of the crime.
	
	
	Ms W McAuliffe argued that her client has good prospects of rehabilitation. I hope that his prospects of rehabilitation are good, but realistically I cannot find that. It has not really been tested. He is doing well in prison because he is staying off the alcohol. We do not know how he will go once he is released. I agree with her that he is remorseful and I will find that to his benefit.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty at what Ms Wasilewicz agrees is the earliest available opportunity and in due course will receive a 25% discount from his sentences. He will in fact receive more than that because there is the additional factor of him being prepared to give evidence against his co-offender. Ms W McAuliffe listed the various factors that I can take into account and I heard argument from her and Ms Wasilewicz that this is not a combined 50% discount case. I think her submission of it being around 40% is right, and in due course I will discount the sentences that I would otherwise impose on Corey Hall by 40% because of that combination of his plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity and the fact that he was prepared to give evidence against his co-offender. (That is no longer necessary it seems from what I have been told from the bar table.)
	
	
	The non-parole period of five years is a factor which I take into account. It is strictly not applicable because of the plea of guilty, but as Ms W McAuliffe points out, it remains as a signpost to a yardstick which I assess in light of other considerations.
	
	
	Ms W McAuliffe pointed to personal factors for her client. Of real significance to me is the fact that he is so young. He is still aged 20. He identifies as an Aboriginal. He has the support of his family and of his partner and is the father of a young child. He was employed when he was arrested and, significantly, was raised in a home involving alcohol abuse and violence. He had to be put into care, he was expelled from home and became homeless when he was 16. Ms McAuliffe reminds me of what the High Court said in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571. In a joint judgment at [40] their Honours said -
	


“The circumstance that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.”

That is a general consideration relevant to any sentencing and I take that into account. It is a factor which is also relevant when sentencing some Aboriginal offenders as the Court noted in the same paragraph. In any event, it applies in this case.


	
	Normally when a judge imposes a sentence involving imprisonment, the judge fixes a non-parole period which is 75% of the overall sentence. Where there are special circumstances a judge can reduce that non-parole period. Ms W McAuliffe argued that there are special circumstances in this case. Her client needs time out in the community to deal with his alcohol abuse problem. It is Corey Hall’s first time in adult custody and he is a very young offender. The factor of general deterrence is relevant of both offences, Ms W McAuliffe concedes. She urges me to bear in mind the principle of totality in that both break, enter and steal offences were committed in the same continuing course of conduct. She suggests that the sentences could be totally concurrent. I do not agree with that, but there will be a significant concurrence.
	
	
	Ms W McAuliffe argues that the breaking and entering into the house falls within the lower level of objective seriousness. She acknowledges that it is towards the higher end of that range. I agree with her about that submission. She agrees realistically and correctly that the ram raid break enter and steal falls within the middle of the range of seriousness. I think she is right there. She argues that it would be at the lower end of that range.
	
	
	There is another factor which is relevant in fixing the sentences, and that is that in pointing out to the police when he was arrested that he was not alone, that somebody else was with him. He not only indicated that he was prepared to assist the authorities with that offender, but by his own account made the two crimes that he committed more serious. It meant that instead of being charged with straight break, enter and steal he was able to be charged with aggravated break, enter and steal which is a more serious offence. I will take that into account in fixing the overall sentence as well.
	
	
	Ms W McAuliffe acknowledges, realistically, that her client must receive a custodial sentence, there is no alternative.
	
	
	Ms Wasilewicz pointed to the fact that there was some planning involved in dealing with the ram raid offence. I have made my findings regarding that. She acknowledged that the amount of damage, being just under $20,000, was not as serious as other ram raid offences, pointing to one example in McGeown v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 314 where the damage was nearly $50,000.
	
	
	Ms Wasilewicz too submitted and I accept that the prospects of rehabilitation could not be described as good. She acknowledged though that they could be described as fair. She agreed on the plea at the earliest available opportunity and agreed that there were special circumstances for making adjustments to the non-parole period.
	
	
	I come now to indicate what I regard as appropriate sentences for these two serious aggravated break, enter and steal offences. For the ram raid offence I regard an appropriate sentence - bearing in mind how objectively serious it was, where it lies in that range, and the various personal factors that I have referred to – as one of five years. For the break and enter of the home and steal in company I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	However, Corey Hall must receive the benefit of his early plea and the indication that he would assist. I would therefore reduce those sentences by 40% in each case. That means that instead of the five year sentence for the ram raid he will receive a sentence of three years imprisonment. It means that instead of the sentence of three years for the break and enter of the home, he will receive a sentence of one year and three months imprisonment.
	
	
	I propose to aggregate those two sentences. In fixing the two sentences, one of three years and one of one year and three months, I would have accumulated them by three months. In other words, what I would have done if I had been fixing two individual sentences, would be to fix them so that there was a three month overlap so that he would serve a total of three years and six months imprisonment. That means he serves some time for each of the offences individually. I would not have commenced them at the same time as the prison sentences fixed by the magistrate and re-fixed by me. The magistrate fixed his two sentences started on 29 April 2015. I will fix the aggregate sentence to commence three months later, on 29 July 2015. The aggregate sentence will be three years and six months. It will commence on 29 July 2015 and will expire three years and 6 months later, on 28 January 2019.
	
	
	The overall effect of the sentences, both the magistrate’s which I have adjusted and mine which I have just fixed, is a sentence which will commence on 29 April 2015 and will ultimately expire on 28 January 2019. That is some three years and nine months. So overall Corey Hall will receive an effective sentence of three years and nine months.
	
	
	Normally a non-parole period for such a sentence would be two years and nine months. That is 75% of three years and nine months. But because of the special circumstances that Ms W McAuliffe has referred to and Ms Wasilewicz acknowledges, I am going to reduce that non-parole period from two years and nine months to two years. So his non-parole period is two years. It commenced on 29 April 2015 and will expire on 28 April 2017. After that he will have to serve the balance of his term of one year and one month from 29 April 2017 to 28 January 2019.
	


HIS HONOUR:   I will sentence you formally now, officially, Corey Hall. Just listen to what I say. I will explain it more in a moment.


	
	I convict you of the two offences of aggravated break enter and steal. I fix an aggregate sentence of three years and six months. That will commence on 29 July 2015 and will expire on 28 January 2019. I fix a non-parole period for that sentence of one year and nine months commencing 29 July 2015 and expiring on 28 April 2017.
	


HIS HONOUR: You do the sums, make sure I’ve got it right and my associate will be doing the same.

W MCAULIFFE: Sorry your Honour, I managed to confuse myself slightly.

HIS HONOUR: We’ll explain to you clearly, Corey Hall, shortly.

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

W MCAULIFFE: An aggregate sentence of three years and six months to commence on 29 July?

HIS HONOUR: Correct.

W MCAULIFFE: A non-parole period - and that’s where I wasn’t sure if your Honour said two years or one year and nine months.

HIS HONOUR: You’re right. I said both, and that’s because I realised that I really have to fix a separate non-parole period for the sentence. I’m not aggregating the appeal sentences, I’m just aggregating the sentences for the break enter and steal. However in fixing a non-parole period I have to take into account the overall affective sentence. So I look at when it commenced on 29 April and when it finally finishes on 28 January 19, and I fix an effective non-parole period of two years. That is really notional, because really what I have to do is fix a non-parole period for the aggregated three year and six month sentence of one year and nine months. The effect should be an overall sentence - and this is what I want you to check - of three years and nine months, to commence 29 April 15, expire 28 January 19, an effective non-parole period of two years 29 April 15 expire 28 April 17. So just satisfy yourselves that I’ve got it right.


	
	One of the other special circumstances I might acknowledge is the accumulation of the sentences for the break, enter and steal on sentences I have fixed on appeal. That is a special circumstance.
	


HIS HONOUR: Take your time.

W MCAULIFFE: Using my fingers your Honour, it seems that those dates seem right to me. I’m relying on my fingers your Honour, so--

HIS HONOUR: Take your time Mr McAuliffe, and we’ll see how my associate - whether she thinks the same. I’ve got two out of three nods.

L MCAULIFFE: Yes your Honour my calculation is correct as well.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Corey Hall, I’ve had to deal with your appeals, so I’ve reduced your sentences on the two appeals, one of them is six months, one of them is four months. They both start at the same time so they run together, and you’re lucky there because the magistrate fixed them. So your six month sentence that I fixed started when you went into gaol on 29 April. That will expire later this month, in a couple of weeks’ time on 28 October. The other sentence has already expired. It started 29 April, expired on 28 August. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Then I’ve had to fix the sentence for your two break and enters, for the breaking into the house, pinching the stuff there, stealing the car which I have taken into account, not separately sentenced you for, but mainly for the ram raid. Instead of fixing two sentences, I’ve fixed one sentence to cover both of those, and that sentence is three and a half years. I’ve kicked that off, not at the same time as the magistrate’s sentence, but three months later, so that commenced on 29 July 15. So you’ve been serving some of that for a few months, but you’ve got to serve some time for that magistrate’s sentence, so you’re serving at least three months for that. Then the current sentence which I’ve imposed kicks in and it will expire on 28 January 19. So your overall sentence expires on 28 January 19 when your sentence will finish.

I have to fix a non-parole period and I’ve taken into account all of the gaol term there and overall you’re going to be in gaol for three years and nine months when you count the magistrate’s. Normally for a gaol sentence of three years and nine months Parliament thinks that you should get about 75% non-parole period. Of that three years and nine months you should spend two years and nine months in gaol. I’ve brought that down from two years and nine months to two years and that’s significantly lower than Parliament envisaged. I’ve done that because you’re a young man, because you need your rehab and it’s your first time in adult prison as a young man, and also because I had to make some adjustment for the fact that I’ve dealt with the magistrate as well.

So the important date for you is 28 April 17, 28 April 17. On that day you become eligible for parole. Do you understand that? That’s about a year and a half away, eligible for parole. Whether you get it not is up to the Parole Authority and I’m sure what they take into account is how you’re going in prison and your behaviour and things like that. So the important date for you is 28 April 17 and if you’re let out on parole, you’re still under sentence but on parole in the community, until it finally ends in 28 January 19. Do you understand that as much as you can?

OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Mcauliffe, Mr McAuliffe, anything I need to add or do?

W MCAULIFFE: Compensation order your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Tell me about that, who’s asking for what?

L MCAULIFFE: Your Honour I’d be asking for that. I have the legislation to hand up to you. I believe it’s in relation to exhibit D, the letter from the insurance company and they’re seeking a compensation order for $18,656..

HIS HONOUR: The legislation you’ve helpfully given me, where--

L MCAULIFFE: I believe it starts from p 38 s 96 and then s 97.


	
	Under s 97 of the Victims (Crime and Support) Act 2001 (NSW) I direct that $18,656 be paid out of the property of Corey Hall to the insurer.
	


W MCAULIFFE: Yes, I think Ms Wasilewicz said that the repairs have been undertaken and completed with the insurance company so the compensation order should be to hopefully--

HIS HONOUR: Sustain loss, okay. To? I don’t have the insurer, something called Crawford, it’s obviously an agent I expect. AIG, looks like AIG.

L MCAULIFFE: Yes, your Honour I believe, and given the difficulty sometimes with insurance, sometimes the debts are sold on to agents and at other times agents represent the insurer company. I believe that it’s exhibit D here, it confirms that it’s Crawford & Company whom are owed the money, I believe acting on behalf of AIG.


	
	I make the order that the figure of $18,656 be paid out of the property of Corey Hall to Crawford & Company (Australia) Pty Ltd.
	


L MCAULIFFE: Your Honour I do apologise but I believe there is one more matter to be dealt with.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, there’s a related offence, is that right?

L MCAULIFFE: Yes your Honour, the 16 section certificate offences.

HIS HONOUR: One of them was a Form 1?

L MCAULIFFE: Yes, and then the other one is the drive motor vehicle.

HIS HONOUR: Drive whilst suspended, what do I do with that?

L MCAULIFFE: We ask for a conviction in relation to that offence.

HIS HONOUR: Just to be recorded?

L MCAULIFFE: To be recorded, just for the disqualification period...


	
	In respect of the related offence of driving the motor vehicle whilst licence suspended I record a conviction under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

		10 February 2016",2015-10-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2767958,Environment Protection Authority v Tomingley Gold Operations Pty Ltd [2015] NSWLC 21,"Judgment

The Charges and the plea


	
	Tomingley Gold Operations Pty Ltd (“the defendant”) pleaded guilty to two offences contrary to section 120(1), Protection of Environment and Operations Act 1997 (“POEO Act”) in that it polluted waters at Tomingley NSW on 7 March 2014 (count 1) and between 24 March and 28 March 2014 (count 2).
	
	
	The plea was entered on the first available opportunity and I allow the full discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea: see R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].
	


Agreed Facts


	
	A statement of agreed facts was tendered with a folder of supporting documentation annexed, together with written submissions from both parties and several decisions of the Land and Environment Court. Further written submissions were invited and provided. A supplementary statement of agreed facts was tendered. The sheer volume of material to be considered necessitated an adjournment.
	
	
	It is necessary to briefly outline the facts. The polluted waters include a “clean water” drainage channel (the Caloma Central Drain) which runs through the mine property, flowing into a table drain on one side of the Newell Highway and through a culvert to a table drain on the other side of that road, then into a drainage line and series of three dams. The first dam is within the mine property and 500 metres from the Caloma Central Drain discharge point. The second and third dams are on private property (McNivens), 800 metres and 1100 metres from the discharge point. The purpose of the Caloma Central Drain is to assist surface water flow through the mine property into the McNiven dams at “pre-mine water quality”.
	
	
	The defendant holds an Environment Protection Licence regulating the activity of the mine. Major Project Approval was granted in July 2012 by the Department of Planning and Infrastructure. Pursuant to Schedule 3, Condition 32 of the Planning Approval, the defendant was required to prepare and implement a Water Management Plan (“WMP”), which was to include clean water diversion systems, erosion and sediment controls and water storages. The WMP was provided in support of the application for Licence.
	
	
	The defendant was granted a Scheduled Development Work Licence and subsequently applied for a variation to transfer it to a Scheduled Activity – Premise Based Licence so that it could commence mining operations, which commenced in January 2014.
	
	
	At the time of the offences, the Caloma Central Drain had been constructed though not to completion. The defendant had not completed or implemented aspects of the surface water infrastructure and sediment erosion controls.
	
	
	Count 1: On 6 March 2014, 24.9mm rainfall was received at the mine. The Company reported to the EPA that sediment-laden water had been discharged from the Caloma Central Drain to the Newell Highway Road Reserve. EPA inspectors travelled to the site. They noted that sediment laden water flowed from the Caloma Central Drain along the drainage route previously described, including from dam 1 to dams 2 and 3 as each dam overflowed, and into a paddock downstream from the third dam.
	
	
	Count 2: On 24 March 2014, 17.6mm rainfall led to the further discharge of sediment laden water. This was reported by the defendant. With minor rainfall the next day, 27.2 mm on 26 March, and 20.6mm on 27 March 2014, the polluted water flowed as far as the second dam. The Caloma Central Drain was substantially eroded.
	
	
	The discharged sediment left a visual layer of sediment on the McNiven property. Sediment water was milky brown in colour. Sediment was also deposited on 20 metres either side of the Newell Highway close to the culvert. The Licence issued to the defendant authorised a limit of Total Suspended Solids (“TSS”) to the surrounding environment to 50mg/L. In relation to the first offence, the concentration of TSS was estimated at 13,268mg/L, and 9 to 17 times higher than concentrations in dams unaffected by the discharge. In relation to the second offence, the TSS concentration levels were 7 to 11 times higher than in dams unaffected by the discharge.
	


Maximum Penalty


	
	The maximum penalty that can be imposed by the Local Court for each offence is $110,000 as set out in s 215 POEO Act. Had the matter been prosecuted in the Land and Environment Court using the same agreed facts for the same offences, the maximum penalty for each count is $1,000,000 with further penalty of up to $120,000 per day for each day that the offence continues: see s 123(a) POEO Act.
	
	
	“The statutory provision imposing a ceiling on the maximum sentence that may be imposed by the Local Court is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. The Local Court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the statutory jurisdictional limit”: BJ Preston (Hon Justice) “Principled Sentencing for Environmental Offences” (paper presented to the 4th International IUCN Academy of Environmental Law Colloquium, New York), October 2006, citing R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 at [35]. See also H Donnelly, Z Baghizadeh, P Poletti, “Environmental Planning and Protection Offences Prosecuted in the NSW Local Court”, Sentencing Trends Number 43, November 2014, Judicial Commission of NSW at p 4, citing R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30].
	
	
	“The jurisdictional maximum…..in the Local Court should not affect the actual level of sentence imposed. Magistrates must not regard the jurisdictional limit as some form of maximum sentence reserved for a worst case” : Re Attorney General’s Application under s. 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 2) [2002] NSWCCA 515 at [27], following Doan (at [34]). See also Veen v R No. 2 (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478.
	


Assessment of Criminality – Objective Seriousness


	
	“The nature of the offences is informed by the statutory scheme. The objects of the POEO Act include the protection and enhancement of the environment of New South Wales and prevention of degradation of the environment by the use of pollution prevention and cleaner production”: Environment Protection Authority v Big Island Mining Pty Ltd [2014] NSWLEC 131.
	
	
	Section 241 POEO Act provides as follows:
	


241 Matters to be considered in imposing penalty

(1)   In imposing a penalty for an offence against this Act or the regulations, the court is to take into consideration the following (so far as they are relevant):

(a)   the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,

(b)   the practical measures that may be taken to prevent, control, abate or mitigate that harm,

(c)   the extent to which the person who committed the offence could reasonably have foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence,

(d)   the extent to which the person who committed the offence had control over the causes that gave rise to the offence,

(e)   whether, in committing the offence, the person was complying with orders from an employer or supervising employee.

(2)   The court may take into consideration other matters that it considers relevant.


	
	Harm to the environment is defined in the Dictionary to the POEO Act, and includes “any direct or indirect alteration of the environment that has the effect of degrading the environment and, without limiting the generality of the above, includes any act or omission that results in pollution.” It includes water pollution, which has an extended definition.
	
	
	Actual harm and the potential or risk of harm must be taken into account: see Bentley v BGP Properties Pty Ltd [2006] NSWLEC 34 at [175] citing Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 366. Bentley at [176]:
	


The culpability of the defendant depends in part on the seriousness of the environmental harm. In Camilleri’s Stock Feeds Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 32 NSWLR 683 at 701, Kirby P, said:

In environmental matters the court has previously exercised its discretion in relation to penalty on the principle that the more serious the lasting environmental harm involved the more serious the offence and, ordinarily, the higher the penalty.


	
	The actual harm includes the visual effect of the discharges, elevated levels of total suspended solids and turbidity. Simply because there is no evidence of actual environmental harm in the form of dead aquatic organisms from either incident does not mean that actual harm has not occurred. It was not until the defendant company had finally installed measures to prevent discharges that the EPA issued a Clean-Up Notice in September 2014 to remove discharge sediments 20 metres either side of the Newell Highway. This is further evidence of actual harm to the environment. The prosecutor cites Environment Protection Authority v Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation [2006] NSWLEC 419 at [147] per Preston CJ:
	


Harm can be direct or indirect, individual or cumulative. Activities that contribute incrementally to the gradual degradation of the environment, even when they cause no discernible direct harm to human interest, should also be treated seriously.


	
	There was potential harm to aquatic plants and animals living in the dams by reason of the sediment laden water reducing light penetration. There was a potential of the cumulative effect of the second offence upon the first offence by increasing the duration of the reduced light penetration caused by increased turbidity and total suspended solids.    
	
	
	It is therefore somewhat surprising that the agreed facts state that the duration of the actual and potential harm was at least one day for the first offence and three to four days for the second offence. If the duration was truly that short, why would there be a need for a Clean-Up Notice nearly six months later? The statement of agreed facts refers to the sediment the subject of the Clean-Up Notice and the fact that a visual layer of sediment was left on the McNiven property. The defence submissions concede at [44] that the presence of sediment on the ground of the paddock and the road reserve constitute harm.
	
	
	The defence submit at [35] that “there was no evidence of actual environmental harm flowing from the incidents”, quoting from [73] of the agreed facts. The quotation is selective and incomplete. The facts at [73] are, “there is no evidence of actual environmental harm in the form of dead aquatic organisms from the incidents”. The defence further submit at [38] that “there was no, or negligible, potential environmental harm as a result of the two discharges.” The defence point out that the operational farm dams are of no ecological significance (at [34]), and that the sediment in the water in the dams did not breach livestock drinking guidelines (at [36]).
	
	
	The defence claim (at [10] - second submissions), “the SOAF states (my emphasis) that no actual environmental harm arose from the first or second discharge, including any actual environmental harm arising from any visual impacts as a result of the discharge of sediment.” I am unable to find such a statement in the agreed facts. Great care should be taken by practitioners in ensuring that submissions put forward on behalf of their clients have a legal or factual basis. I reject the submission that there was no environmental harm and no potential environmental harm. Reliance is placed upon the agreed facts: see Khanwaiz v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 at [94] and [96] per Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	In regard to section 241(1)(b) (at [15] above), the defendant company was required to construct surface water management infrastructure and implement soil and erosion control measures as part of its development consent and Environment Protection Licence. It should be noted that the defendant is not being prosecuted for a breach of its EPL. The defendant accepts, as it must, that practical measures could have been taken to prevent the incident occurring, such as by affecting a more timely completion of the water management plan. Not only could such measures have been taken, they should have been taken. Apart from the obligations under the development consent and EPL, there is the overriding obligation pursuant to s 120(1) POEO Act not to pollute waters.
	
	
	It is of some concern that the company applied for a licence variation to commence mining operations without having completed its obligations under the development consent. It is also of some concern that the EPA did not appear to have a system of adequate checks and balances to ensure that the required measures were in fact completed prior to giving approval for the mining operations.
	
	
	The company submitted a Licence Variation Application (see annexure 6) to change the Licence from construction to mining. At 5.2.1 the company noted activities which still need to be completed, but failed to disclose to the EPA that the water management plan and related requirements had not been completed.
	
	
	In “Principled Sentencing for Environmental Offences”, reference is made of the steps to be undertaken to uphold the integrity of the regulatory system – of which the third step is “complying with the terms and conditions of the approval in undertaking the conduct”. Clearly this was not done. “Offences which undermine the integrity of the regulatory system are objectively serious” (at p 13 where a number of cases are cited).
	
	
	Regarding s 241(1)(c) (at [15] above), the defendant was well positioned to have reasonably foreseen the harm caused or likely to be caused by each offence. After all, the company conducted its own assessment as to what was required under the development consent, developed a water management plan and erosion and sediment control plan with the intention of preventing these types of offences from occurring.
	
	
	Regarding s 241(1)(d) (at [15] above), the cause of the first offence involved the failure by the company to implement measures discussed previously, coupled with rainfall described in the factual summary. The cause of the second offence involved the continuing failure by the company to implement the said measures, further rainfall, and the inadequacy of emergency temporary stabilisation works (see [12] and [13] supplementary facts) frustrated by wet ground conditions. There had been extended drought conditions prior to the heavy rainfall which affected the seeding of the Caloma Drain – however the Caloma Drain was merely one component of the required works to have been completed in the development phase
	
	
	Looking at the Environment Protection Licence (annexure 2), under the heading Operating Conditions O4, “A stormwater management scheme must be prepared for all aspects of the construction phase of the development and must be implemented. Implementation of the scheme must mitigate the impacts of stormwater runoff from and within the premises during the construction.”
	
	
	In annexure 4, the Tomingley Gold Project Erosion & Sediment Control Plans, General Notes, note 3: “Erosion and sediment controls are to be installed prior to each nominated stage of construction.”
	
	
	The company’s Water Management Plan at 5.1 (annexure 3) states, “The mine site plan will be reviewed upon completion of construction and be amended to be suitable for mining operations.”
	
	
	Whilst the company is not being prosecuted for a breach of the Environment Protection Licence, it had control over the causes that gave rise to the offences. The company concedes this point in the outline of submissions at [50] and [51]: “TGO accepts that it had control over the causes which gave rise to the commission of the offences. As the operator of the mine, TGO had control over the timing of the implementation of the WMP. The late implementation of the WMP meant that the existing facilities were not fully capable of withstanding run-off from a heavy rainfall event such as those encountered on 7 March 2014 and between 24-27 March 2014.” It should be noted that it was not a “late implementation”– it had not been implemented as required.
	
	
	In R v Carroll [2008] NSWCCA 218 at [39], it was said that “the objective seriousness of the offence has two principal components: the precise acts or omissions of the offender and the consequences of those acts or omissions.” Notwithstanding that the actual harm and potential for harm are at the lower or towards the lower end of matters of this type, the fact that the harm was foreseeable and under the control of the company, places the objective seriousness at an approximate midpoint of upper-low to lower-mid level.
	


No prior convictions


	
	The defendant has no prior convictions for any environmental offence.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	The defendant company self-reported the water pollution events and co-operated with the EPA investigation. It was submitted that this is a mitigating factor under both s 21A(3)(m) and s 23, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, it is noted under POEO Act Part 5.7 and under the EPL, there is a duty to notify the EPA of pollution incidents that cause or threaten material harm to the environment. Since that actual and potential harm in the current case was not assessed until well after the event, it is unclear, but on the balance of probabilities more likely that the company was merely complying with legislation and EPA Licence condition R2 (annexure 2, p 20) on the basis that the unassessed harm could have been material harm, rather than reporting the matter for some other reason.
	
	
	Similarly, there appears to be a positive or statutory obligation under Chapter 7 POEO Act for information and records etc to be provided to the EPA and for a level of co-operation to be afforded.
	
	
	Section 21A(3)(m) requires that “assistance by the offender to law enforcement authorities (as provided by section 23)”  be taken into account as a mitigating factor. It forms part of the overall instinctive synthesis of the sentencing process, whereas section 23 contemplates a separate and distinct additional discount for assistance to law enforcement authorities.
	
	
	Care must be taken not to double count the effect on sentence of this mitigating factor. Assessment must also be made of the weight to be given to assistance in circumstances where there was a legal obligation upon the company to provide that assistance. It is noted that the Land and Environment Court has taken into account assistance to authorities as a mitigating factor even where that assistance was provided pursuant to statutory obligations (see Prosecution supplementary submissions at [26] and cases cited).
	
	
	In the present case, there was a level of co-operation identified at [77] of the facts which will be taken into account in weighing up the appropriate sentence, but no separate discount will be applied. There is no basis to justify such a discount, and to give a separate discount in this case would result in a penalty unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: see s 23(3), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The true nature and meaning of assistance to authorities is discussed in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19 and should be considered essential reading for EPA matters. Some examples of Land and Environment Court decisions applying remarkably significant discounts are Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 65 (30%); Environment Protection Authority v Big Island Mining Pty Ltd [2014] NSWLEC 131 (35%); Environment Protection Authority v Ravensworth Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 222 (37.5%); Environment Protection Authority v Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation [2006] NSWLEC 419 (40%); Gittany Constructions Pty Ltd v Sutherland Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 242 (35%).
	
	
	Without listing all of the mitigating features, there is demonstrated remorse; the company has taken action to implement the measures that should have been in place earlier; the company has complied with other requests of the EPA including a clean-up order; the company has agreed to pay the prosecutor’s costs. It should be noted that failure to implement the measures and/or comply with the clean-up notice would have exposed the company to further legal process- though it does establish that rehabilitation has occurred. No adverse finding is made as to the company’s ‘state of mind’. It is accepted that it is unlikely that the company will re-offend.
	


Even-Handedness


	
	The principle of even-handedness requires the court to have regard to the general pattern of sentencing of offences of the kind under consideration, i.e. consistency in sentencing. In that regard, the prosecutor provided a schedule of 6 cases (annexure B, first submissions): Environment Protection Authority v Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 65; Environment Protection Authority v Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 134; Environment Protection Authority v Ravensworth Operations Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 222; Environment Protection Authority v MA Roche Group Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 191; and Environment Protection Authority v Peak Gold Mines Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 158.
	
	
	As noted in Moolarben at [99]:
	


…care must be taken in essaying the task, as the wide divergence of facts and circumstances leading to the imposition of penalties in a given case for water pollution render guidance from other cases to be of limited utility.


	
	Of the decisions referred to, those of Big Island and Moolarben have greater factual closeness to the present case. The defendant did not respond or offer alternative cases to those submitted by the prosecutor.
	
	
	Instead, the defendant annexed (appendix 2, first submissions) NSW Local Court Sentencing Statistics for s 120(1) POEO Act offences from October 2010 to September 2014. Such statistics are of no utility. In the first table, there are only eight cases, of which one received no conviction pursuant to s 10, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the remaining seven received a fine. The factual circumstances of those eight cases are not known. In any event, the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court was increased effective 6 February 2012 from $22,000 to $110,000. The penalties set out in the second table have no similarity to penalties in any other case referred to in these proceedings or in this judgment. That table reveals seven offences with the highest fine imposed of $5,000. There is no indication as to when it was imposed- i.e. pre- or post-change of jurisdictional limit.
	
	
	The decisions of the Land and Environment Court have greater ability to inform appropriate penalty considerations- it is a superior court with specialised jurisdiction which “deals with the more serious environmental crimes which often require the reception of complex expert evidence, lengthy conviction and sentence proceedings, a familiarity with LEC decisions, and an in-depth understanding of sentencing principles as the relate to environmental offences”: see “Environmental Planning and Protection Offences Prosecuted in the NSW Local Court” (above, p 3)
	


General deterrence


	
	“The necessity for those engaged in mining activities to ensure that water pollution does not occur, by undertaking appropriate erosion and sediment control measures in advance of work, is a message that needs to be given by the imposition of an appropriate penalty. A means by which such a message is given is the imposition of a penalty for beach that includes an appropriate component for general deterrence”: (Mooralben at [95]).
	
	
	“It is the duty of the court to see that the sentence that is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who might otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed”: B J Preston above), p 4 (citing R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 94 at 597-598).
	
	
	“Sentences imposed for environmental offences must embrace powerful considerations of general deterrence”: see Axer Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (1993) 113 LGERA 357 at 367 per Badgery-Parker J.
	


Specific deterrence


	
	Specific deterrence does not cease to be a relevant sentencing consideration merely because the offending company has taken steps to minimise or prevent the risk of future environmental harm. Taking such steps post-offence when there was a pre-existing obligation to have done so pre-offence, is quite frankly little more than finally complying with its legal obligations, though it may diminish the significance of specific deterrence as a component of penalty.
	
	
	It has been said that specific deterrence has relevance where a defendant continues in the same area of operation in which an incident has occurred- see Environment Protection Authority v MA Roche Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 191 at [44]. In relation to specific deterrence, “the message conveyed by the sentence is not only to refrain from committing the offence, but also to take such steps as are necessary to guard organisationally against repetition”: B J Preston (above), p 5.
	
	
	Given the circumstances in which the offence occurred, but taking into account the subsequent steps taken by the defendant company, specific deterrence still has relevance to these proceedings. This is particularly so given the company’s failure to disclose to the EPA in its licence variation to commence mining operations that it had not completed the water management plan or erosion and sediment controls.
	


Totality


	
	The totality principle has application in the present case. The two offences arise from similar facts, circumstances and conduct and occurred 17 days apart. The defendant took some stabilisation steps following the first offence and prior to the second offence. Those steps were wholly inadequate to prevent the second offence. Further steps were in place by 1 April 2014: see agreed facts at [54]. However, wet ground conditions prevented the company from being able to undertake more substantive mitigation works prior to the second offence: see agreed supplementary facts at [11] and [12]. The penalty for the second offence will be less than the first offence.
	


Publication Order


	
	Having considered the submissions by both parties in relation the issue of whether a Publication Order should be made pursuant to s 250(1)(a) POEO Act, as well as various cases referred to in this judgment, the court is firmly of the view that it is entirely appropriate to make such an Order.
	
	
	The question then arises as to whether the publication should be confined to a local newspaper, such as the Narromine News- a local paper in the Tomingley area, as first suggested by the defendant (if such an Order were to be made at all)- or whether publication should be to a wider area.
	
	
	A publication order “improves the effectiveness of sentences as a deterrent, particularly in the case of corporate offenders”: see Environment Protection Authority v Waste Recycling and Processing Corporation [2006] NSWLEC 419 at [242]. As indicated previously, there is a ‘powerful need’ for general deterrence. Publication Orders are often used in sentencing for environmental offences.
	
	
	It is entirely artificial to suggest that the only persons affected by the pollution offences are persons living locally to the mine. There is significant public interest in the compliance, or otherwise, by mining companies with the obligations cast upon them. Such public interest extends well beyond the local area. Mining is an activity undertaken not only in Tomingley. It is widespread in NSW, and indeed throughout Australia.
	
	
	The defendant’s resistance to a Publication Order could be seen as being contrary to or in defiance of the purposes of sentencing as set out in section 3A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including general deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the offender, recognising the harm done to the community and making the offender accountable for their actions. On one hand the company submits a document indicating remorse, but on the other hand wants to keep it reported locally, or not at all.
	
	
	The Publication Order as set out in Annexure A of the prosecutor’s first submissions is suitable. It should include the date of judgment and the total fine.
	
	
	I direct that publication shall occur in the Sydney Morning Herald, Daily Liberal Dubbo and Australian Mining Magazine.
	


Conclusion on Penalty


	
	Taking into account all of the circumstances, the penalty for count 1 will be $100,000 and for count 2, $50,000. Doan’s case (above) applies. Applying a 25% discount, the fines reduce to $75,000 and $37,500 respectively. Consistent with Environment Protection Authority v Hardt [2007] NSWLEC 284 at [66], the total penalty imposed should take into account an order for the defendant to pay the prosecutor’s costs, which in this case are agreed at $15,000 with investigation costs of $1,797: s 248(1) POEO Act. In accordance with the principles of totality, the fine for count 1 will be reduced to $60,000. Count 2 will be $35,000. I am satisfied that those amounts are just and appropriate and reflect the total criminality involved.
	


Orders


	
	The defendant company is convicted of both offences against s 120, POEO Act as charged.
	



	
	On count 1, the defendant is fined $60,000.
	
	
	On count 2, the defendant is fined $35,000.
	
	
	Pursuant to section 250(1)(a) of the POEO Act, the defendant is to place a notice in the first five pages of the following publications within 21 days, at a quarter of a page in size and in the form annexed to the prosecutor’s initial submissions with date and fine amounts added:
	



	
	Sydney Morning Herald
	
	
	Daily Liberal Dubbo
	
	
	Australian Mining Magazine
	



	
	Within 35 days of the date of these Orders, the defendant is to provide to the prosecutor a complete copy of the page of the publications in which the notice appears.
	



	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s legal costs in the sum of $15,000 inclusive of GST and the prosecutor’s investigation costs in the sum of $1,797.

		16 February 2016",2015-10-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2767961,State of New South Wales v Anderson [2015] NSWSC 1515,"Judgment


	
	By summons filed 6 October 2015, the State of New South Wales seeks orders pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	
	
	First, it seeks an order under s 7(4) that qualified psychiatrists be appointed to conduct psychiatric examinations on the defendant and to furnish reports to the Court along with a direction that the defendant attends those examinations. Secondly, it seeks an interim detention order under s 18A commencing on 17 October 2015 for a period of 28 days. There is an associated order pursuant to s 20 seeking the issue of a warrant for that purpose. In the alternative to the interim detention order, the plaintiff seeks an interim supervision order pursuant to s 10A of the Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the defendant, who is operating under a distinct forensic disadvantage as a result of matters to which I will presently turn, has made a number of significant concessions. As a result of those concessions the dispute between the parties (at this stage) is relatively confined. In essence, the defendant acknowledges that he is a “detained sex offender” as that expression is defined s 13B. It is also conceded that the application for the interim detention order or the interim supervision order has been brought within the time limits provided for by the Act. Further, and importantly, the defendant concedes that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation tendered by the plaintiff would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order.
	
	
	As a consequence of those concessions, the defendant does not dispute that the order appointing psychiatrists should (or must) be made and does not, at least on an interim basis, resist the application for an interim supervision order. However, the defendant opposes the making of an interim detention order. Accordingly, the dispute between the parties comes down to the question of whether the Court’s discretion should be exercised in favour of ordering the defendant’s continued detention until the final hearing or whether the defendant should be subject to an interim supervision order until that time.
	
	
	The case was heard on Monday, 12 October 2015 in circumstances where the defendant is due to be released from a total effective 13 year prison sentence on Saturday, 17 October 2015. These reasons have been prepared over the course of 2-3 days as a consequence of the urgency inherent in that timetable.
	


Delay in bringing the application


	
	At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the defendant raised an objection to the extensive affidavit material which was tendered by the plaintiff in support of the summons. The basis of that objection was that there was a denial of procedural fairness in circumstances where the application was brought by the State at such a late stage and supported by an enormous bundle of factual and evidentiary material.
	
	
	As I indicated at the time, there was real substance in the objection and also in the complaints articulated by counsel. Notwithstanding the validity of those complaints, I felt constrained to allow the evidentiary material in view of the urgency of the application and the objectives of the Act. The primary objective of the Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continued detention of high risk offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community: s 3(1). To have excluded the plaintiff’s evidence would be anathema to that primary objective. It would have left the State with no case and the summons would inevitably have been dismissed. The result would have been that the defendant would be released this weekend without any supervision, his sentence being due to expire on Saturday.
	
	
	While counsel for the plaintiff apologised at the commencement of the hearing, no meaningful explanation has been provided for the delay in bringing this application. Nor has there been any explanation for the failure to notify the defendant and his legal advisers of the fact of the application and the evidence upon which it is based.
	
	
	A great deal of the evidence that has been placed before me is historical and has been in the possession of the State for many months or years. One of the most significant documents relied on by the plaintiff is the report of the psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst. That document, a dense psychiatric report of 30 pages, is dated 3 August 2015. It makes reference to a number of documents within the 5 volumes of material upon which the State now relies. Not only does it refer to that material, it refers to the tab numbers within the 5 volumes. This makes it clear that the State was aware in July 2015 of the likelihood that this application would be made and was also substantially aware of the material upon which it would rely.
	
	
	Because of the terms of the legislation, an application of this kind cannot be brought until the final 6 months of an offender’s sentence: s 13B(3). Section 15 of the Act provides that the offender must be served with the application within 2 days of the filing of the application and that the Supreme Court must conduct a preliminary hearing with 28 days. These provisions are in need of reform. In my opinion, given the voluminous nature of the material that generally accompanies such applications, the significant impact of the application on the human rights of the offender and the pressure on the Court to list and properly determine the applications, Parliament should consider increasing the period in s 13B(3) to 12 months and should require the application to be brought at least one month before the expiration of the offender’s sentence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, even based on the time limits in the Act as it stands, I can see no justification for the State to bring such an application before the Court in the final week of an offender’s sentence. Even allowing for the possibility that there will be urgent and compelling circumstances, there is no justification for failing to place an offender on notice that an application will be made (or is likely to be made) and allowing his legal representatives an opportunity to peruse and digest the material upon which the State proposes to rely.
	
	
	As McCallum J said in State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWSC 1254 at [2]:
	


“After serving any sentence of imprisonment lawfully imposed, an offender has the right to personal liberty. That is ‘the most fundamental and important of all common law rights’. It is one which ‘cannot be impaired or taken away without lawful authority and then only to the extent and for the time which the law prescribes.’”


	
	Her Honour’s decision to impose an extended supervision order rather than a continued detention order was upheld in the Court of Appeal: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280.
	
	
	An application such as the present is one that is calculated to violate that most basic right of which McCallum J, and the High Court before her, spoke: see, for example, Williams v The Queen [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278. It should not be - and I am quite certain that it is not - an application that is brought lightly by the State. Further, it is an application in relation to which a defendant has a critical interest and a right both to be prepared for the hearing and to have the opportunity to be heard to contest the application. Providing a defendant’s lawyers with thousands of pages of documents a few days before the hearing does not afford an offender that right and opportunity.
	
	
	In those circumstances, there is a heavy responsibility on those representing the State to bring such applications in a timely manner.
	
	
	The circumstances of the present case, which are not atypical, place inappropriate pressure on the Judge to make a decision of great importance to both the individual and the community hastily and under unwarranted time pressure. Just as importantly, it puts the defendant and his or her legal representatives in a position where they are unable to peruse all of the relevant material to uncover facts and circumstances which might militate against making the kinds of orders that are sought in such cases.
	
	
	I am not the first judge to have made comments such as these. For example, in the State of New South Wales v Phillips [2014] NSWSC 205, Bellew J described the situation in that case as “highly unsatisfactory” and said (at [15]);
	


“15. All of these circumstances combined to place the defendant in a position which was both invidious and unfair, and gave rise to two particular consequences. Firstly, the various delays to which I have referred resulted in the preliminary hearing coming before the court only 48 hours prior to the defendant's scheduled release from custody, necessitating the making of a decision virtually immediately. That created a number of difficulties with the court's administration, not the least of which was ensuring the availability of a Judge to hear the application.

16. Secondly, the defendant was placed in a position in which he had, to say the least, a limited opportunity to consult with his lawyers. I regard the position in which he was placed as one which bordered on being procedurally unfair.”


	
	Bellew J referred to similar observations made by judges in earlier cases and described the situation as “unacceptable”. I have come to a similar view in the present case.
	
	
	However, it is necessary to decide the case based on the evidence that has been presented, in accordance with the terms of the Act and particularly bearing in mind the principal objective of that Act in terms of the protection and the safety of the community.
	
	
	Nothing that I have said in the preceding paragraphs should be taken to reflect upon counsel for the plaintiff or his instructing solicitor. On my observation and understanding of the material, they have acted with some alacrity in getting the material ready for the Court and have conducted the hearing itself in a balanced and fair manner, bringing to my attention matters which might militate in favour of the making of a supervision order in spite of their primary position and instructions being to make an application for a detention order. I also have no doubt about the sincerity of the apology offered to the Court and to the lawyers for the defendant at the commencement of the hearing.
	


Are the threshold requirements of the act satisfied?


	
	A continuing detention order can only be made if the Court is satisfied that the defendant is a “detained sex offender”. I am satisfied that he is. He is currently in custody serving the final days of a lengthy sentence of full-time imprisonment for a serious sex offence.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the application has been brought within the time frame required by the Act. That is, the application may not be made more than 6 months before the end of the offender’s total sentence. Putting aside the question of possible amendment to that time period, the temporal limitation provided in s 13B has been complied with.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, pursuant to s 15(4) that the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order: see ss 10A, 15(4) and 18A.
	
	
	While those matters have been conceded by counsel for the defendant, it is necessary for me to be satisfied independently of those matters. In coming to those various conclusions, I have considered the matters that must be considered by the Judge presiding over the final hearing of the application. Section 17(4) states that in determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, the Court is to have regard to the matters listed from (a) to (k) that the Court considers relevant. Those factors include:
	


“(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 15 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an interim supervision order or an extended supervision order,

(g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender continuing detention order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender continuing detention order),

(j) in the case of an application made on the basis that the offender has been found guilty of an offence of failing to comply with the requirements of an extended supervision order or interim supervision order-the nature of the failure to comply with those requirements and the likelihood of further failures to comply,

(k) in the case of an application made on the basis that circumstances have altered since the making of an extended supervision order or interim supervision order against the offender-whether circumstances have altered since the making of the order and whether those altered circumstances mean that adequate supervision cannot be provided under an extended supervision order or an interim supervision order.”


	
	Due to the urgency of the application and the limited time available, I state the reasons for my conclusions in point form:-
	



	
	The defendant was convicted on 14 December 2001 of extremely serious sexual offences which occurred when he was an escapee from lawful custody: R v Anderson (District Court (NSW), Bellar J 14 December 2001, unrep).
	
	
	The nature of the offending was particularly grave. Along with a co-offender, the defendant abducted an innocent stranger and raped her repeatedly at various locations. The full description of the outrages committed by the defendant can be seen in R v Anderson (District Court (NSW), Bellar J 14 December 2001, unrep) as well as the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 304. It is unnecessary to repeat the pejorative expressions used by the primary judge and appellate Court to describe the horrendous nature of the offending but those expressions were entirely apt.
	
	
	A number of experts have assessed the defendant as being “within the high risk category of sexual and other criminal offending relative to other male sexual offenders”: see, for example, the report of Dr Richard Furst dated 3 August 2015 and the Risk Assessment Report under the hand of K Murphy and D Matsuo dated 28 January 2015.
	
	
	While the defendant has participated in a number of programs while in custody, there has been some resistance on his part to fulfilling requirements that had been stipulated by the Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC). Largely as a result of his failure to do those programs, he has been refused parole on a number of occasions since his non-parole period expired.
	
	
	One of the “triggers” (as described) for the offender’s criminal and sexually deviant activities is drug use and there have been a number of occasions during the course of his sentence where he has returned positive urine samples indicating the use of illegal drugs while in custody.
	
	
	Apart from the index offence, the defendant also has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1980. Significantly, that includes a number of offences of violence, including some extremely serious offences such as maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in relation to which he was sentenced to a period of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. That sentence was imposed in 1994 and the non-parole period was due to expire on 18 October 2001. He escaped from custody in late February or early March 2001 and committed the extremely violent aggravated sexual assaults that are the foundation or index offence for the present application.
	
	
	Apart from committing the crimes in question while he was a fugitive, the defendant also has a history of non-compliance with various forms of conditional liberty. He committed serious offences in 1994 while on parole and bail and there are several recorded occasions when he has breached good behaviour bonds.
	
	
	The defendant has spent almost all of his adult life in jail and has become institutionalised.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed the defendant as having an antisocial personality disorder, a substance use disorder and also describes him as possessing “psychopathic traits”.
	



	
	Based on the material in the brief as summarised in the foregoing series of dot points, I am satisfied for the purpose of ss 7(4), 10A and 18A that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high-risk sex offender extended supervision order or continuing detention order.
	


legal consequences of those findings


	
	As a result of the finding referred to in the last paragraph, I am required pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act to make the orders sought in paragraph one of the summons, namely to appoint psychiatrists and to direct the defendant to attend upon them so that reports can be prepared for the purpose of the final hearing.
	
	
	The second legal consequence of those findings is that the Court’s jurisdiction to make an interim detention order or interim supervision order is enlivened.
	
	
	When the matter comes on for final hearing and the Court is required to decide whether a continuing detention order or extended supervision order should be made, a relevant question will be whether adequate supervision can be or will be provided by an extended supervision order: see s 5D of the Act. While that is a relevant consideration on the final hearing, it has been held (and I accept) that it is not a proper exercise of discretion to make an interim supervision order rather than an interim detention order simply because the probabilities suggest that an extended supervision order is the more likely outcome at the final hearing: see Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at 99. In Tillman the Court said of the discretion (as it existed in the legislation at the time):
	


“99. Since s16(1)(b) is satisfied if either category of final order would be justified if the matters alleged in the documentation are proved, the Court is not required, at the stage of considering whether the discretionary power to make an interim detention order is engaged, to assess which category of final order is likely to be made at the end of the day. Because the word ""may"" in the closing portion of s16(1) imports a true discretion, it is open for the Court to refuse to make an interim detention order even if conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied. But it would not be a proper exercise of that discretion, in our opinion, for the Court to make an interim supervision order instead of interim detention order simply because the probabilities suggested that an extended supervision order was the more likely (final) candidate. That would involve reading words into the subsection that are not there. If (unlike the present case) there was only a claim for a continuing detention order, then the only options available to the Court under s16(1) would be to make an interim detention order or to dismiss the claim for interim relief.”


	
	Section 18A, which provides for interim detention orders, does not require proof on the part of the plaintiff that adequate supervision will not or could not be provided by an extended supervision order: see State of New South Wales v Thomas (Interim) [2009] NSWSC 1119. However, the legislation provides the Court with a “true discretion” (note the use of the word “may”) and that discretion must be exercised judicially and in the light of all of the information before the Court. It must be exercised in the light of the primary objective of the Act (to protect the community) and its secondary objective (to promote an offender’s rehabilitation).
	
	
	The material before me establishes that the defendant’s conduct whilst in custody, while very far from perfect, has largely been compliant. I accept the submission that his behaviour has improved over time. The material also demonstrates that the defendant undertook an intensive treatment program known as the CUBIT program prior to the expiration of his non-parole period in October 2012 (that being the expiration of a fixed term for escape accumulated on the non-parole period for the sexual assault offence): R v Anderson [2002] NSWCCA 304 at [51]. The report generated in April 2011 was mostly a positive one. The defendant was described as a confident and insightful group member and expressed what appeared to be genuine remorse and contrition for his offences. While his insight into his sexual offending was in some respects lacking, he was able to articulate specific situations and risk factors that might cause him to re-offend. It was considered that he had gained considerably as a result of his participation in the program. The report said that “in terms of overall treatment outcome, Mr Anderson was considered to have made some positive shifts and progress in developing insight into his offending.”
	
	
	The report also recommended that it was a priority for Mr Anderson to engage in what was described as “custody based maintenance” at the Metropolitan Special Program Centre at Long Bay.
	
	
	The defendant has not complied with that recommendation. Various reasons have been identified for his failure to undertake the custody based maintenance. In part, the failure seems to have resulted from the defendant’s own resistance and lack of trust in the professionals running the CUBIT program and the maintenance program which followed.
	
	
	It is impossible for me in the time available to determine whether some of Mr Anderson’s justifications for failing to do the maintenance program are valid or not. However, he has completed other relevant programs such as the Getting Smart and Smart Recovery programs and is described in the case notes as “an excellent and reliable worker who mentors young inmates”. A case note in October 2014 notes that he “wishes to be able to participate in pre-release programs”. Another reason for his failure to engage in the maintenance program seems to be the fact that it would require him to be moved from one correctional centre (Junee) to another (in Sydney). More recently (in July 2015) the defendant wrote to authorities asking if he could complete the CUBIT maintenance programme via audio-visual link (AVL). On 3 August he signed a consent form to participate in the sessions via AVL.
	
	
	A consistent theme that runs through the material, including the progress notes and his many interactions with psychologists within the system, suggests that he was resistant to engaging in the maintenance programs while in custody but repeatedly expressed a willingness to engage in intensive rehabilitation programs whilst in the community. It appears that his classification (which is affected by his status as an escapee) has impacted on his ability to participate in pre-release programs that encompass day release and similar.
	
	
	While there are various positive indicators of Mr Anderson’s willingness to participate in programs, the fact remains that he has not completed the maintenance programs that were recommended in the CUBIT report back in 2011. No doubt, that is the reason why his applications for parole have been consistently declined and is one of the strongest arguments raised by the plaintiff in urging me to exercise my discretion by ordering his interim continued detention rather than placing him on an interim supervision order.
	
	
	The plaintiff also points to a note dated 17 September 2015 which records that the defendant plans to visit a family grave in Coffs Harbour “regardless of restrictions” that might be imposed by those administering an extended supervision order. Counsel put to me that the defendant denied making such a statement and that I should treat the notation with caution.
	
	
	In a Risk Management Report prepared on 2 March 2015, Kevin Makar, a Senior Community Corrections Officer, identified the following risk factors that impacted on the likelihood of Mr Anderson committing further sexual offences. This analysis was predicated on the seemingly unanimous view that he was at a high risk of further sexual offending. The risk factors were as follows:
	



	
	Problems with intimate and non-Intimate relationships
	
	
	Problems with general self-regulation
	
	
	Superficial engagement with supervision
	
	
	Victim access
	
	
	Hostility
	
	
	Substance abuse
	
	
	Sexual preoccupation
	
	
	Collapse of social supports
	
	
	Emotional collapse
	
	
	Rejection of supervision
	



	
	Mr Makar went on to set out a thorough risk management plan which attempted to address each of the identified risk factors. Annexed to the risk management report is a detailed summary of the nature of the supervision that is available to an offender if released on an extended supervision order (ESO). Such supervision would commence if an interim order is made.
	
	
	Included in the management plan is an electronic monitoring system which enables the authorities to be aware 24 hours a day, 7 days a week as to whether an offender subject to an ESO is complying with conditions as to his whereabouts. There is also intensive counselling services and the opportunity for referral to the relevant programs and services.
	
	
	Mr Makar also gave evidence in the proceedings and confirmed that the there is a bed available at the Community Offender Services Program (COSP) and that this would be available from the day of Mr Anderson’s release if he is subject to an extended supervision order. The COSP is a residential program and it is quasi-custodial in its nature. Those administering the programme would transport the defendant from gaol directly to the COSP centre.
	
	
	Generally, participants in the program are only allowed to stay at the COSP for a period of between 3 and 6 months, although this can be extended with the agreement of the manager of the COSP. The participants in the program are locked in between 6 pm and 6 am. They are only permitted to be absent from the centre at times which are prearranged by the provision of agreed weekly diaries prepared in advance. In the early stages, permission to leave the premises is limited to necessary medical and similar appointments. Strict time limits are provided for such absences from the centre. If a participant fails to return in accordance with the schedule attempts are made to contact them and, if necessary, police are contacted and the electronic monitoring system used to locate and take the offender into custody. Substantial gaol sentences are prescribed for breaches of such orders.
	
	
	Mr Makar gave evidence that it is difficult, although not impossible, to remove the electronic monitoring equipment which is generally attached to the ankle of the offender. If the monitor is removed the electronic monitoring centre is notified immediately. Such removal would constitute a breach of the order and the person in question would be liable to be returned to custody as well as charged with an offence.
	
	
	In view of the grave criminality in which the offender engaged in 2001 and the reports to which I have made passing reference, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty that the onerous conditions proposed in the interim supervision order provide a complete mitigation of the risk that the defendant may pose to the community. However, that would be true in any case where a person has been held to fall within the provisions that enable their continued detention or extended supervision under the provisions of the Act.
	
	
	One ramification of an order making the defendant subject to an interim supervision order arises from the provisions of s 13B(4)-(6). Those sections mean in effect that if the defendant is compliant and circumstances do not change this may have some influence on the outcome of the final proceedings. This provides significant incentive for the defendant to be compliant if an ISO is imposed. Such an outcome accords with the secondary objective of the Act, that is encouraging high risk offenders to undertake rehabilitation.
	
	
	I have taken into account the opinion of Dr Furst that various risk facts “mean that his release in the community, even if supervised under the proposed conditions of an ESO, probably poses an unacceptable risk to the community”. However, Dr Furst goes on to acknowledge that:
	


“If he is deemed eligible for an ESO by the Courts, the proposed conditions of the interim extended supervision order would be reasonable in the circumstances, especially conditions relating to random urine drug testing and participation in psychological programs, such as the maintenance program run by the FPS at Surry Hills and appropriate drug and alcohol programs…”


	
	Mr Makar’s report and evidence indicate that those programs will form part of the highly structured and supervised conditions of the defendant’s life at the COSP centre if he is subject to an interim supervision order.
	
	
	Taking into account all of the relevant factors including the defendant’s willingness to participate in programs outside of the custodial setting and his increased insight into his behaviour and notwithstanding his criminal record and the appalling and chilling nature of the index sexual offence, I have decided to exercise the discretion in favour of ordering the defendant to be subject to an interim supervision order rather than ordering his continued detention pending the outcome of the final hearing of this case in December. This approach achieves the primary objective of the Act and is protective of the community because of the onerous conditions and quasi-custodial nature of the supervision and accommodation. It also achieves the secondary objective of the Act by requiring the defendant to participate in rehabilitation programs and providing him with the incentive to be compliant pending final resolution of the Plaintiff’s application for a continuing detention order.
	
	
	Accordingly I propose to make orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Summons along with some orders in the nature of a timetable. I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 15(4) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (“the Act”), Dr Jeremy O’Dea and Dr Andrew Ellis are appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by 27 November 2015.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 15(4) of the Act, the defendant is directed to attend those examinations.
	
	
	Pursuant to ss 10A and 10C of the Act, the defendant is subject to an interim supervision order from 17 October 2015 for a period of 28 days.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 11 of the Act, the defendant is to comply with the conditions of the interim supervision order as set out in the schedule to this judgment and order for the period of the interim supervision order.
	
	
	The proceedings are listed before the Duty Judge on Wednesday 11 November 2015 for mention and to hear any application for a further interim supervision order or interim detention order.
	
	
	The final hearing of the case is listed for 14 & 15 December 2015.
	
	
	I direct that access to the Court file in respect of any document shall not be granted without leave of a Judge of the Court. If any application for access is made by a non-party in respect of any document, the parties are to be notified by the Registrar so as to be given the opportunity to be heard.

2767974,R v Sen Van TRAN [2015] NSWDC 324,"Judgment

Indictment and charge


	
	On 20 March 2015, the offender was found guilty by a jury on a charge, that:
	


“On or about the seventeenth day of May 2011, at Bonnyrigg, in the State of New South Wales, (the accused) did supply a prohibited drug, namely buprenorphine, an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity of that prohibited drug.”


	
	That charge was brought pursuant to the combined effect of the provisions of ss 25(2) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (“DMTA”). The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment and/or 5,000 penalty units.
	
	
	A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment has been established for this offence.
	
	
	Section 29 of the DMTA was relied on by the Crown in its case as the ‘deeming provision’, that is, that when a person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug, unless the person proves that he had the prohibited drug in his possession otherwise than for supply, or where the prohibited drug is prepared opium, then that possession would be deemed to be for supply. If those factors were accepted as against the offender, then the provisions of s 25 would be otherwise applied.
	
	
	Here, the offender sought to establish that he had the buprenorphine for his own use. That defence was clearly not accepted by the jury.
	


Procedural history 


	
	Following the delivery of the jury’s verdict, orders were made for the offender to file any psychiatric reports by 15 May 2015. The report of Dr Anthony Levine dated 17 May 2015, was served on 21 May 2015. In it, he refers to the need for further assessments. Accordingly, Mr Santisi sought an adjournment over the opposition of the Crown. That adjournment was granted and the offender remanded in custody on 22 May 2015.
	
	
	The matter was then listed for sentence on 22 May 2015 at Parramatta. On this date, counsel for the offender, Mr Santisi, sought a further report by Justice Health. The sentence was stood over part-heard to 31 July 2015, to allow time for this to be prepared and released.
	
	
	Prior to that adjourned date, it came to the Court’s attention that that report had not yet been requested, and therefore not prepared. The sentence was then administratively adjourned to 25 September 2015. A further adjournment was required because Justice Health was unable to meet the deadlines, despite the report being re-requested on 10 July 2015. Accordingly, the matter was again administratively adjourned to today to allow further time.
	


Background


	
	The offender had an addiction to heroin amongst other substances. He gave evidence that he had been told by a friend that a substitution programme was available. He went to see Dr Bateman, his treating doctor, on 16 May 2008, who obtained permission from NSW Health for him to be placed on a drug treatment programme. He continued seeing Dr Bateman until 19 October 2010, during which time; he was prescribed at least 3,036 tablets.
	
	
	Dr Bateman prescribed him two drugs, Subutex and Suboxone, which were medications for heroin addiction. These contained the prohibited drug buprenorphine – the drug which is the subject of these charges. The offender was also given the substance Suboxone, which also contained the prohibited drug. It is also clear that the offender had been prescribed large quantities of those substances over a considerable period of time.
	
	
	Both of these had an analgesic effect, which Mr Tran utilised for pain relief. He had been in hospital for injuries to his leg. The jury was not informed of the reason for those injuries (that is, that the offender was involved in a prior shooting) but photographs were tendered of the extent of them.
	
	
	The offender took those prescriptions to a registered pharmacist, Ms Phan, at her pharmacy in Bonnyrigg. Ms Phan gave evidence that her practice was to give him the Subutex in a cup, usually in powdered or crushed form, with the direction that it be taken sublingually, that is, for it to be absorbed under the tongue and then into his system. Her practice was to check to see if the tablet had dissolved, then to give him a cup of water to assist in the ingestion process (T582; 587). Her evidence was that she specifically remembered the accused, in particular, that he was a quiet individual (T588). She recalled her systemic and particular practices in giving the substances to him. She said that she watched him while he was taking the substances in her pharmacy in accordance with the guidelines for the ingestion of such prohibited substances.
	
	
	The clear purpose of this dispensing procedure – which was mandated under guidelines incumbent on the supplying pharmacist – was to ensure that the drugs were not diverted from the mouth and otherwise into the possession of the party taking it.
	
	
	The offender’s case was that he did divert the drugs he was given pursuant to the prescription, and retain them in powdered or crushed form for his own personal use. When the drugs the subject of the count were discovered in his bedroom by the police, they were mainly fragmented in form. There was evidence that the colour and appearance of the broken parts of the tablets or some of them was consistent with being affected by saliva.
	
	
	In accordance with the established practices of the Division of Analytical Laboratories, five samples were taken of the drugs and they were found to contain buprenorphine. Some of the fragments had markings of “B” and “8” and a sword figure consistent with the manufacturer’s markings for Subutex. Buprenorphine is a form of derivative of prepared opium, being (on Dr Allender’s evidence, T103) a substrate of thebaine which is, in turn, an opiate constituent.
	
	
	It was an agreed fact in the trial that there was no evidence of any actual supply of that drug by Mr Tran to any other person.
	


Circumstantial case 


	
	The Crown relied on a circumstantial case made up of a number of features which are as follows:
	



	
	quantity of drugs;
	
	
	value of drugs;
	
	
	location of drugs;
	
	
	items consistent with the possession or indicia of supply, namely:
	



	
	syringes;
	
	
	10 mobile telephones;
	
	
	Two sets of electronic scales; and
	



	
	offender’s financial situation.
	



	
	The offender was asked at the relevant time (May 2011) the following questions, and his recorded responses were consistent with the following information:
	



	
	that he was not currently on the buprenorphine programme;
	
	
	that he was not using any non-prescribed drugs, apart from sleeping pills;
	
	
	that he was not using any other medications, apart from diazepam;
	
	
	that he had never used non-prescribed opioids, including buprenorphine; and
	
	
	that he did not have a current problem with substance misuse.
	


Knowledge of prohibited nature 


	
	An important issue in the case – and an element of the offence – was whether the offender knew or ought to have known that buprenorphine was a prohibited drug and, if so, whether the offender knew or ought to have known that Subutex and Suboxone contained buprenorphine.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the facts of the offender’s involvement in the program of supervised ingestion of the drugs concerned, meant that the offender must have been aware of the very severe restrictions on the removal of drugs which were put in place and needed to be observed; further, that that system when combined with what he was told, supported the inference that the offender knew of the nature of the drug as being a prohibited substance.
	
	
	The offender signed a series of documents relating to his being on the methadone and buprenorphine programmes. Some were signed by him, others were information sheets. Those documents were tendered in the course of the hearing (Exs 29, 37, 38, 39) and the offender confirmed that the signatures were his.
	
	
	The defence case was that the accused did not understand the content of those documents, as he had very limited English reading and writing abilities. That submission was consistent with the offender’s evidence.
	


Defence case


	
	The defence case was that the offender’s possession of the prohibited drug did not constitute ‘deemed supply’ on the basis that he had the prohibited drug in his possession for his own ‘personal use’. He had been prescribed several medications for pain relief in 2011, including the Subutex which contained the prohibited drug buprenorphine – the drug which is the subject of these charges.
	
	
	Counsel for the offender sought to rely on the fact that the amount of Subutex prescribed by Dr Bateman to the offender over a period of two years was an amount exceeding that which was found to be in his possession in 2011.
	
	
	The thrust of the offender’s evidence was that he had obtained the pills for his own treatment rather than storing them for subsequent sale. He thought there was nothing wrong with accepting the pills from the dispensing chemist, swallowing them and then subsequently extracting them from his mouth to be retained by him for later personal usage. He also stayed in the chemist’s dispensing area for a two minute period – consistently with the evidence of the supervising chemist. The offender also said that he did not think that there was any obligation on him to swallow them immediately as he was given them by the dispensing chemist.
	
	
	The offender kept the pills and fragments, some in their original blister packaging, in four different plastic containers. The Crown relied on the method of storage as being consistent with storage and packaging as indicia of supply.
	
	
	There was no evidence as to why he put them in his mouth and then took them out, if he did not think he needed to be supervised. It was also his practice to put all the pills in his mouth which was inconsistent with his evidence that he did not think that they needed to be taken. Many of the pills ultimately analysed showed indications of saliva coating consistent with him depositing them in his mouth and then taking them out at a later time.
	


Criminality 


	
	The offender’s criminality needs to be assessed in accordance with a number of factors, namely:
	



	
	the role of the offender;
	
	
	the amount involved;
	
	
	the period of time involved; and
	
	
	the value of the substances.
	



	
	The amount of prohibited drugs (containing buprenorphine) found in the offender’s house was 381.46g (98 tablets and 2039 fragments). That quantity is nine and a half times the amount constituting a large commercial quantity (40g).
	
	
	Here, the assortment of the fragments were found in a variety of forms (tablets, fragments, and in blister packets) and in a variety of places (hidden inside a chair and on top of a cupboard) which is consistent with a degree of planning for concealment.
	
	
	The Crown also submits that the Court should find that the offender did not obtain the buprenorphine located from Ms Phan, given the methods used to dispense the amounts involved, and the recording of that procedure. Given the other evidence in the case, I am not prepared to make that finding as the only possible inference which can be drawn in these circumstances.
	


Approach to determining criminality 


	
	Here, there was a very substantial amount of the particular drug involved. The offender’s role and the level of criminality involved is more important in determining a sentence than the quantity of the drug involved: Melikian v R [2008] NSWCCA 156 at [42]. The offender’s actual role in the steps taken to effect supply needs to be assessed: Paxton v R (2011) 219 A Crim R 104 at [135].
	
	
	While there is no evidence of actual supply, the amount involved may give rise to a suggestion of wholesale distribution or storage for distribution – particularly given the jury’s verdict which clearly involved a rejection of the defence of personal use.
	


Authorities 


	
	I have considered Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 per Hulme J at [27] in this respect, and accordingly have had regard to the quantity (as measured against the quantity constituting a large commercial quantity, i.e. nine and a half times that amount) when assessing the potential harm to the community. I have taken care not to count the quantity and the potential harm as separate and distinct factors to consider in assessing criminality, as the two are inextricably linked.
	


Nature of drug: quantity and value


	
	The seriousness of the drug itself – as compared with other drugs on the DMTA Schedule – is reflected in the relative amounts as prescribed by that Schedule. Here, the traffickable quantity of buprenorphine is 0.06g, whilst that of morphine is 3.0g, methadone (not in liquid form) is 3.0g, and heroin is 3.0g. It is not the Court’s role to construct a gradation of seriousness by reference to perceptions of their harmfulness: Bimahendali [1999] NSWCCA 409; 109 A Crim R 355; Adams v R [2008] HCA 15; 234 CLR 143, as this categorisation is already reflected in the differing amounts in the Schedule. I refer to this categorisation only to the extent that it is consistent with the Crown’s submission that Suboxone and Subutex (which each contain buprenorphine) is a pharmaceutical grade drug that is 25 – 45 times more powerful than morphine.
	
	
	The amount of the drug was 381.46 grams. The amount of buprenorphine, the prohibited component of those drugs, was considerably smaller than that, however the amount of prohibited drug is to be assessed as the amount of the whole drug, not just the prohibited proportion. In relation to this amount and the nature of the substance, the remarks of Hulme J in Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96 are apposite in determining the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	In any event, as outlined above, I emphasise that the quantity of the drug is only one relevant consideration of the seriousness of the offence: Wong v R; Leung v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584.
	
	
	Here, the evidence was that the value of the drugs was between $26,400 and $154,000. This opinion evidence was untested and represents a wide range of values. Defence counsel submits that that value should be treated with reservation that, in its form as found, it cannot be injected.
	
	
	The precise period of time involved is unclear. However, even on the defence case, the store of pills must have taken some time to accumulate.
	
	
	It was not an opportunistic nor chance acquisition. That, in turn, reflects a degree of planning and premeditation.
	


Absence of evidence of purpose to supply 


	
	Given that the deeming provision under s 29 of the DMTA was enlivened, to rebut that provision, the defence bore the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the drugs were in his possession for a purpose other than supply.
	
	
	As I have said, the jury’s verdict was that the offender did not successfully prove on the balance of probabilities that the drugs were in his possession for a purpose other than supply.
	


Indicia of supply 


	
	A further aspect of the circumstantial Crown case was a series of indicia of supply, including that 10 mobile telephones were located at the offender’s home; that there was a box of syringes found in his home, as well as two sets of scales; and that the drugs were being kept in mislabelled containers. It was suggested by the Crown that, inferentially, those mobile phones could have been in his possession for the purpose of supply. I did not necessarily accept that version, and accordingly, do not rely on that aspect to determine any additional or wider criminality.
	


Method of possession 


	
	The Crown submits that there should be a finding that the offender did not obtain the drugs found in his home from Ms Phan, the pharmacist or from Jacaranda House, based on the following evidence:
	



	
	the evidence of Ms Sutton about the policies and procedures used by Jacaranda House to dispense the drug;
	
	
	the evidence of Ms Phan about the standard method that she used to dispense the drug;
	
	
	the medical notes of Dr Bateman indicating that the offender was regularly taking the drug as prescribed; and
	
	
	the evidence of Ms Scopoletti and the medical notes concerning the information the offender supplied to Ms Scopoletti concerning his use of buprenorphine.
	



	
	If I did make such a finding, that would effectively lead to a further finding that the offender obtained the drugs through illegitimate means. However, the evidence as outlined above does not, in my view, sufficiently give rise to findings of fact beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, that the offender obtained the drugs from a source other than Ms Phan, and secondly, that the offender obtained those drugs through illegitimate means.
	


Findings as to criminality involved


	
	I find that the criminality involved was certainly above low-range, but below mid-range. I would make a more serious finding had there been any evidence of actual supply, particularly given the fact that the drugs were stored in a residential/family home where children were living.
	


Subjective features 


	
	The offender is aged 43 (DOB: 20 October 1971). He is a single man who lives with his sister and her children. He came to Australia from Vietnam via Thailand, with his family as a refugee, when he was eight or nine years old. He is one of nine siblings.
	
	
	He has a close relationship with his sister, niece and nephew, and was living with them in Bonnyrigg at the time of the offence, and until he went into custody on 22 May 2015.
	
	
	He has a son from a prior relationship, who is 24 years old.
	
	
	At the time of the offence, he was not working.
	
	
	He has a history of drug addiction, namely heroin, which he first used at the age of 20, and was on a methadone programme since the age of 24.
	


Prior record


	
	The offender was convicted of drug offences in 1991, 1995 (x 2), 1996 (x 3), 1997 (heroin), 1998 (heroin), 1999 (x 2), 2000, 2008 and 2010. These offences do not entitle the offender to any leniency, and make difficult any findings of prospects of rehabilitation on drug matters, or any suggestion that he does not have a long history of connections with the drug scene.
	


Rehabilitation 


	
	The offender has very limited education and employment qualifications.
	
	
	The evidence as to his drug use is that he has a history of cannabis and heroin abuse. He has also abused other drugs including cocaine and prescription medication such as Subutex.
	
	
	He continues to assert that the substances found were for his own personal use.
	
	
	The offender also suffered a skull fracture when he was the victim of an assault in 1994. There were complications arising out of related, or consequential hypoxic brain damage in 1995 (see the report of Dr Levine dated 20 May 2015).
	
	
	On all the evidence, it would seem that the offender has a medium chance of re-offending.
	


Psychological health issues 


	
	Reports were tendered by the defence on sentence, which addressed the offender’s brain injuries. Those reports were by Dr Levine, dated 20 May 2015 (Ex S5) and a further report dated 18 August 2015 (Ex S8). A further report was prepared by Dr Matthew Hearps of NSW Justice Health, dated 8 October 2015 (Ex S9). The Pre-Sentence Report dated 20 May 2015, also made reference to his brain injury.
	
	
	In his report dated 20 May 2015, Dr Anthony Levine made a provisional diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, and indicated that the diagnosis required information that he did not have available to him, including hospital records and neurocognitive assessments.
	


Remorse/contrition 


	
	Mr Tran said that his incarceration was unfair as he “didn’t do anything”. There is no remorse or contrition expressed. There appears to be little recognition that what he was doing was doing was to subvert the dispensing procedure which was designed to assist him.
	


Delay


	
	This charge arose out of matters which occurred in 2011. Thereafter there were a number of delays which took place including the fact that there were two previous trials which did not proceed because of delays in listing of the prior trials. The matters were not reached on two occasions.
	
	
	The delays do not seem to have been the fault of the Crown, nor the prosecuting authorities, but rather that the case was not reached a number of times. Part of that was as a result of the offender being prosecuted for other trials.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentence needs to be considered against the background of the evidence of the factors establishing criminality, the nature of that criminality, in particular the nature and volume of the drugs located, the absence of evidence as to actual supply, and the offender’s subjective features, in particular his brain injuries, his acquisition of the substances or at least a substantial proportion of them while on a treatment programme. The sentence needs to reflect the principle of general deterrence by ensuring that the policies and administrative arrangements of drug dispensary treatment programmes are not subverted.
	
	
	It is clear that, whatever he does, he will need to continue to be on such a programme. The sentence must have an element of personal deterrence to ensure the offender knows he cannot subvert the requirements of such programmes by diverting prescribed substances for his own purposes.
	


Comparable authorities 


	
	I have reviewed some of the comparable sentencing authorities as set out in the Public Defender’s website since the introduction of the standard non-parole period of 15 years for charges of supplying large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Care needs to be taken to differentiate between the drugs and the amount of drugs involved in those cases as well as whether there is evidence of actual supply, and other aspects of the role of those offenders compared to this offender. Having considered those decisions in Kwon v R [2011] NSWCCA 58; Chen v R [2011] NSWCCA 145; R v AZ [2011] NSWCCA 43; Hsu v R [2012] NSWCCA 248; Deakin v R [2014] NSWCCA 121, I am satisfied that the sentence I am considering is appropriate in these circumstances. Some of those authorities relate to supplying large commercial quantities of ecstasy or other drugs.
	


Sentencing options


	
	The offender has had a series of non-custodial sentencing options extended to him, including fines, and periodic detention, as well as prior periods of imprisonment.
	
	
	I do not consider that any of the options of an intensive corrections order nor a suspended sentence would be appropriate to reflect the principles of general deterrence. In this regard, I also note that the offender’s prior association with Community Corrections was deemed superficial and sporadic, with breach action being initiated on occasions due to non-compliance or re-offending (Pre-Sentence Report dated 21 May 2015).
	
	
	He has been assessed as being at a medium risk of re-offending.
	


Reasons for the departure from standard non-parole period 


	
	The standard non-parole period established for this offence is one of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	My reasons for departing from this guideline are that:
	



	
	the criminality assessed is one of below mid-range; and
	
	
	there is no evidence of actual supply.
	


Special circumstances 


	
	There is some guarded optimism expressed in the Pre-Sentence Report to the effect that “he appears to be more stable in managing his life with the help of his present methadone treatment programme.”
	
	
	Given the offender’s age and circumstances, the fact that he will have additional difficulties in gaol due to his limited English abilities, it is appropriate that there be a finding of special circumstances. Here, I assess that as warranting a departure from the statutory ratio, such that the ratio is reduced to one of 60 per cent.
	


Time in custody


	
	Prior to trial, the offender was in custody for 9 months and 22 days, one period of which 1 month and 23 days was attributable to this offence. However, the offender was acquitted on the charges for which he was in custody for those additional eight months. Counsel for the offender submits that the offender should be entitled to receive the benefit of his incarceration on what are agreed to be unrelated charges. However that submission is contrary to established authority: R v Niass (unreported NSWCCA, 16 November 1998) and Hampton v R [2014] NSWCCA 131. I will therefore take into account the period spent in custody solely attributable to this offence, namely, 58 days (from 13 December 2011 to 8 February 2012).
	
	
	In addition, the offender has been in custody, bail refused since 22 May 2015 (a period of 4 months and 24 days, i.e. 147 days). It is appropriate that the entirety of those two periods, namely 205 days, be taken into account, such that the sentence of five years and three months which I would otherwise regard as appropriate be backdated by that period with a consequential adjustment to the head sentence.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender is sentenced to a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of imprisonment of five years and three months backdated to commence on 24 March 2015 and expire on 23 June 2020, with the balance of term of three years and nine months to expire on 23 March 2024.
	


Parole


	
	I recommend that on his release to parole the offender:
	



	
	be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service;
	
	
	notify them of any changes to his residential address seven days prior to his changing any such address; and
	
	
	be subject to random urinanalysis.

2767977,R v Misiepo [2015] NSWSC 1533,"Judgment


	
	HALL J: The accused, Chad Frederick Misiepo, has been charged on indictment that on 1 January 2014 at Port Macquarie in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Peter Lesley Martyn: s 18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. The accused has entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. The trial of the proceedings is scheduled to commence in Coffs Harbour on 19 October 2015.
	
	
	Application has been made for a number of pre-trial determinations in relation to the following issues:
	



	
	Evidence of flight as consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	Evidence of a “selfie image”, being an image of the accused holding a replica pistol.
	
	
	Evidence of a note found on 7 January 2014 which the Crown alleges was created by the accused.
	
	
	Evidence of a knife.
	



	
	The alleged offence occurred in the early hours of the morning of 1 January 2014 at 4 Norfolk Avenue, Port Macquarie. The Crown case alleges that the accused inflicted a fatal stab wound with intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, Peter Lesley Martyn.
	
	
	The hearing of the pre-trial application took place in Sydney on 13 October 2015. Mr Brendan Campbell of counsel appeared for the Crown and Mr David Carroll of counsel appeared on behalf of the accused.
	


Evidence on the Application


	
	The Crown tendered a folder entitled “Crown Material on Pre-Trial Legal Argument” (Exhibit VD A). The material in Exhibit VD A includes a copy of the indictment and statements of investigating police officers. In addition the exhibit includes photographs and expert reports relevant to the crime scene and various investigations carried out by police into the death of Mr Martyn. I will refer to certain of that material in greater detail below.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown relied upon its written submissions (undated), supplemented by oral submissions made at the hearing of the application.
	
	
	Written submissions dated 12 October 2015 were provided on behalf of the accused, directed to the issue of the evidence which the Crown proposes to adduce of flight.
	
	
	Mr Carroll also supplemented his written submissions with oral submissions at the hearing of the application.
	
	
	I turn to consider the issues arising on the pre-trial application.
	
	
	On the issue of “flight”, the Crown submissions set out in summary form a number of factual events relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon evidence of flight in the following respects:
	



	
	The accused’s actions on 1 January 2014 in leaving the crime scene to the unit at 3/4 Norfolk Avenue and then through adjoining properties towards the beach.
	
	
	The accused’s whereabouts in the period during between 1 January 2014 and 7 January 2014.
	
	
	The accused fleeing from police on 7 January 2014, until he was eventually chased down.
	



	
	In respect of the accused’s action in relation to (1) above, the Crown placed reliance upon the witness statement dated 1 January 2014, a copy of which is marked as 3(a) as part of Exhibit VD A. The statement records the witness hearing a disturbance coming from outside unit block at 4 Norfolk Avenue, Port Macquarie, and then hearing a male voice saying, “I’ve been stabbed in the heart. Someone call an ambulance” (Witness Statement, 3(a) at [5]).
	
	
	The witness stated that, having gone back to her unit she heard rustling of bushes in the backyard of the townhouses that back onto her block. She saw a male who she described. She said that he was wearing royal or dark blue shorts. He did not have a shirt on. She noticed his hands down the front of his shorts. It appeared they were wrapped in something white. She said she saw him jump over the timber fence between the townhouse block and the house block. She saw him stand up briefly. He then headed towards Pacific Drive: Witness Statement, 3(a) at [6].
	
	
	The Crown also relies upon the accused’s conduct in the period between 1 January and 7 January 2014. In that respect the Crown’s allegation is that the accused went to Flynn’s Beach.
	
	
	At about 9:20am on 1 January 2014, the accused is alleged to have contacted an acquaintance, Taylor Whitney, by Facebook. The Crown case is that he asked for her number and that he said “send me your number pls I need a massive favour. Its urgent n would ask ic I didn’t have to”. The Crown also alleges that he said “I hav no one else I could ask pls taylor PLEASE”. The Crown alleges that he later said “I really need to speak to you”.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the accused arranged for Taylor Whitney to pick him up near the Waniora shops. The Crown alleges that he told her “I am in trouble. I need you to drop me off somewhere”. The Crown further alleges that he gave Ms Whitney money to book a motel room for him in her name.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the next day the accused contacted his brother and partner, Ms Natalie Clark, in Boambee East, near Coffs Harbour, and that Ms Clark subsequently collected him and drove him to their home. The Crown case is that the accused spent a number of days there until on 7 January 2014 police attempted to apprehend him. The Crown alleges that he fled from them on foot, but was able to be chased down: Statement of Senior Constable Keating. The Crown alleges that whilst he was being pursued, the accused discarded a mobile telephone which it alleges was subsequently recovered from a water-filled drain. The Crown alleges that police were able to recover images from the phone. In one image it is alleged that the accused is shown wearing the blue shirt which police allegedly earlier located at 3/4 Norfolk Avenue, and which is alleged to have had a DNA matching that of the deceased and the accused on it.
	
	
	The Crown further alleges that there are “selfie”-style photographs which were found on the accused’s phone showing him posing with a silver pistol. The pistol has been identified as a replica.
	
	
	The Crown additionally alleges that a search was made of the accused’s brother’s house where the accused had been staying. It further alleges that in a rear bedroom a note was found written in blue pen with a number of words overwritten in highlighter. It is alleged that a similar colour highlighter was found beside the note and DNA matching the accused was found on it. The note allegedly included mobile phone numbers for persons referred to as “Matt” and “Mano”. The Crown also alleges that the note said “Tell him Reece & his girl gave me up. Reece made full statement. The girl didn’t but said I was there at the scene”. The Crown alleges that the note also had the address at 3/4 Norfolk Avenue and the address of the mother of the Park sisters (who were staying at the unit where the offence occurred at the time) on it.
	


Crown Submissions on Evidence as to Flight


	
	It was submitted that the accused’s flight from the scene is highly relevant to the issues of the trial. In particular, the accused’s immediate attempts to leave the scene in “urgent” circumstances were relied upon as a circumstance that the jury could have regard to in drawing the conclusion that the accused was responsible for inflicting the fatal wounds: Crown Submissions at [22].
	
	
	Further, it was submitted that the accused’s flight from police on 7 January 2014, after there had been significant publicity, and after the Crown alleges the accused had written the note found at his brother’s premises, is evidence that the accused’s flight was related to the incident involving the death of Mr Martyn: Crown Submissions at [21].
	
	
	The Crown noted that the defence objected to the evidence of flight upon the basis that the accused could give evidence at the trial that he fled because he was in breach of parole. The Crown submitted that in this case, the assessment of the value of the evidence of flight, which will involve evaluating the possible reasons for the flight, is properly a matter for the jury: Crown Submissions at [22]. Reliance was placed upon observations made in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [47]. I will return to discuss the relevant principles below.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that any danger of “unfair prejudice” in this trial can be adequately guarded against with appropriate directions. It was submitted by the Crown that if the accused were to give evidence that he was in breach of parole at the time of the alleged offence it would not be necessary to explore in evidence the particular offence that resulted in that sentence having been imposed. A jury, it was noted, could be directed that they should consider the accused’s explanation for his flight and that they could not use the evidence of his flight against him unless they were satisfied it related to his consciousness of guilt in relation to the stabbing of Mr Martyn. If they were not so satisfied, then they should ignore his conduct. The Crown further submitted that the jury could be directed in conventional terms that they should disregard any other disreputable behaviour in assessing the accused’s alleged guilt in relation to the offence. Reference in this respect was made to the decision in R v Steer [2008] NSWCCA 295 at [45]: Crown Submissions at [24].
	


Submissions for the Accused


	
	In the written submissions for the accused, Mr Carroll identified the conditions which must be satisfied before evidence of flight is capable of amounting to consciousness of guilt evidence. These, he noted, were stated in R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234, and that were said to have been broadened in R v Cook, supra recently cited with approval in Lau v R [2014] NSWCCA 179 at [104] per Hoeben CJ at CL. The conditions were summarised as:
	


(i)   The flight must be deliberate;

(ii)   It must relate to a material issue;

(iii)   The motivation for flight is a realisation of guilt;

(iv)   (Where relevant) the evidence of flight must be from an independent witness; and

(v)   The flight must be capable of being seen as an indication of consciousness of guilt of the specific offence with which the accused is charged: Defence Submissions at [2].


	
	It was submitted that when the Crown seeks to tender evidence of an accused’s post-offence conduct as evidence of consciousness of guilt, two separate issues arise:
	



	
	The first is that in order to be admitted as evidence, the trial judge must be satisfied that the evidence (of flight) is capable of meeting all five conditions as outlined in Cook. If the evidence is not capable of meeting the requisite conditions then it is inadmissible. If it is capable, then it may be subject to one of the discretionary exclusion provisions under the Evidence Act 1995, in particular, those within ss 135 or 137.
	
	
	The second issue pertains to the directions to be provided to a jury concerning the use that may be made of the evidence of flight. This issue is only enlivened if the evidence is admitted: Defence Submissions at [3].
	



	
	In his submissions, Mr Carroll referred to the factual circumstances in Cook which placed the appellant in “an awkward position” in giving evidence as to an alternative explanation: Defence Submissions at [4].
	
	
	In the application of the relevant principles to the present case, it was submitted that:
	


“The probative value of the evidence of flight of the accused is significantly diminished by the fact that Mr Reece Barnes, who was prosecuted as an alleged co-accused, himself similarly fled the location and was discovered in the laundry at the rear of No 4 Norfolk Avenue, Port Macquarie. He told a resident who located him there that he was “just doing a load of washing”. Mr Barnes left the laundry and was then confronted by police at which point he surrendered to them.” (Defence Submissions at [5])


	
	It was noted that as at 1 January 2014 the accused was subject to a breach of parole warrant in relation to an offence of reckless wounding on 10 March 2012. It was noted that the facts of that matter had the accused using a screwdriver as a weapon to inflict a wound. In respect of that offence it was stated he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 2 years: Defence Submissions at [6].
	
	
	In that respect it was said that he could attempt, either by giving evidence or by calling witnesses or by cross-examination of Crown witnesses, to explain his conduct such that it would exonerate him of the murder of Mr Martyn, or he could choose to leave the evidence (of flight) as it may be presented. If he chose the latter course, it was said that there was an obvious possibility that the jury would draw an adverse inference: Defence Submissions at [7].
	
	
	It was further submitted:
	


“The essence of Mr Misiepo’s case in respect of admission of evidence of flight is that in order to provide an explanation for his conduct in fleeing the scene, he would necessarily reveal the existence of a breach of parole and the nature of the offence to which it relates.

Mr Misiepo maintains that such a revelation raises an obvious prejudice which enlivens Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 135 or, in the alternative, s 137. His explanation would both expose his previous criminal record and expose him as a person with a history of an offence of reckless wounding.” (Defence Submissions at [8]-[9])


	
	Mr Carroll in his submissions described the discretion in s 135 as providing a broad base for the exclusion of evidence whilst the mandatory form of s 137 provided a stronger basis for exclusion, given what was termed its “lower hurdle”: Submissions at [11].
	
	
	It was observed that “unfairly prejudicial” in s 135 and “unfair prejudice” in s 137 were considered to have the same meaning: Ainsworth v Burden [2005] NSWCA 174. Prejudice, it was noted, being not that which would advance the prosecution case or weaken the defence case, but rather “damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response” and which carries “a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way”: R v Suteski (2002) 137 A Crim R 371, 388 at [116] (Wood CJ at CL); Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297, 325 [51] (McHugh J): Defence Submissions at [12].
	
	
	In the present case it was submitted for the accused:
	


“13.   Bearing in mind the seriousness of the charge with which he breached his parole and the nature of the evidence required to meet the evidence of flight, Mr Misiepo submits that there is ‘a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way’, and the prejudicial effect is therefore unfair and outweighs the probative value of the Crown evidence.” (Defence Submissions at [13])


	
	In oral submissions Mr Carroll again referred to what he termed the “significant prejudice” which he said would arise if the accused gave evidence that he had been serving a sentence for a reckless wounding offence involving the use of a screwdriver to inflict a wound (though not causing grievous bodily harm). He submitted that there was a similarity in respect of the offending behaviour in the present case as in the case of Cook and that this was a significant factor: T 19, 13 October 2015. Additionally it was noted that disclosure of breach of parole would involve, in effect, a revelation of the accused’s failure to adapt to community life, a failure to embark upon rehabilitation in terms of drug addiction and that he had been brought under notice of police on two occasions in respect of illicit drugs. It was stated that these are the actual circumstances in which the accused found himself on 1 January 2014: T 19-20.
	
	
	It was submitted:
	


“What my friend implicitly acknowledges in his submission is that the true picture to explain the alternative basis for fleeing brings with it insurmountable prejudice. It is not a solution to limit the factual scenario to something which is not as significant. The reason why it’s not appropriate or I use the word ‘unfair’ is that it leaves the accused not in a position to meet fully the alternate explanation for the flight.” (T 20)


	
	This latter submission was directed to a suggestion or proposal by the Crown that there would be no need for there to be disclosure as to the offence for which the accused was serving a sentence as at 1 January 2014. However, Mr Carroll responded by submitting that a “neutral” account of events limits the prejudice created by the “true situation”:
	


“… what it does, in a practical sense, is limit the ability of the accused to rebut the consciousness of guilt.” (T 20)


	
	Mr Carroll raised as a further issue relevant to probative value the fact that the case would involve an issue as to the person who stabbed the deceased. In that context the submission was that in considering the position of Mr Barnes and Mr Misiepo he stated:
	


“… the fact that the other potential person responsible for the fatal blow has also embarked upon running from the scene, avoiding the detection of the police or trying to, providing false statements as to why he was hiding in the laundry to Ms Fardy’s saying he was doing a load of washing was significant in that respect it was contended that the probative value of the accused’s flight as evidence of consciousness of guilt was limited ‘to a substantial degree’ by the fact that Barnes also took steps to avoid detection on the morning of the first of January 2014.” (T 21)


	
	It was noted in the context of the present case that there would not be evidence from Mr Barnes on these issues. It was submitted that the probative value of the accused’s flight is to be weighed against Barnes’ conduct. Such conduct was not going to be properly explored as to why it was that Barnes told Ms Fardy that he was only doing his washing and why he ran down the stairs after being inside the unit shortly after the offence and that police halted his escape. He said it was very different from a situation where the facts of a case concerned only one person as responsible for the offence: T 21. He submitted that the only relevant difference between the accused and Barnes was the fact that the flight of the accused was effective for some seven days: T 21.
	


Crown Submissions in Reply


	
	In his submissions in reply, the Crown Prosecutor stated that it was necessary in relation to the issue of flight to consider the factual matrix of the case. It would be clear to the jury that the accused was not found at the scene of the crime, but that he was found in Coffs Harbour at a later date.
	
	
	There was also said to be the further issue as to the use the prosecution could make of the issue of flight. In that respect the Crown submitted that it would be open to the jury, because of the circumstances of the accused having immediately run from the scene of the stabbing, together with other factors such as his contact with Ms Whitney which told of urgent circumstances, his contact with having Ms Whitney book a motel room in her name for him to stay there, and his contact with his brother and brother’s partner arranging for them to travel to Coffs Harbour, were all matters relevant in constituting the factual matrix.
	
	
	In addition, the Crown emphasised that there was a further aspect – when the accused was approached by police on 7 January 2014, he ran and was chased, and the Crown alleges that during the chase he disposed of the mobile phone. The Crown submitted that the jury are entitled to reason based on such behaviour, that in acting that way he demonstrated consciousness of guilt and that that went to the ultimate issue as to whether he was the one who inflicted the stab wound to Mr Martyn.
	
	
	In relation to the submissions made as to the alternative theory or explanation for the accused’s flight, it was submitted that to explain that motivation did not necessarily involve any explanation as to why he was on parole or what the offence was for which he was placed on parole. It was noted that he had been released on parole on 6 August 2013 - that is a period of some eleven months and two days of a two year sentence. At that point he had just over twelve and a half months outstanding. By 21 January he had a little over eleven months of parole outstanding.
	
	
	The Crown outlined a limit on the explanation that needs to be given to the jury for the reason that the accused was on parole as a “mid-position” between the Crown’s hypothesis as to why he fled and what Mr Carroll was proposing: T 25. The Crown also emphasised that the jury would be told not to speculate as to the circumstances which had led to the sentence being imposed upon the accused and which resulted in him being on parole at the time of the stabbing.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the conventional directions given at trial in relation to evidence of flight, with the appropriate warnings given in the course of such directions, namely, that the jury would be instructed that they are not to speculate as to why the accused had been convicted of an offence and was serving time in a gaol. In short, the Crown submitted, that all such matters can be dealt with by way of appropriate directions: T 25.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that even if an alternative explanation was given which involved reference to the fact that the accused had been convicted of an offence of reckless wounding, that can be dealt with by appropriate directions: T 26.
	
	
	In relation to the position concerning Mr Barnes referred to above, the Crown submitted there was “a quantum difference” between the behaviour of Mr Barnes after the stabbing and that of the accused. Reference was made to the evidence of the accused’s flight, including his contact with Ms Whitney, and contrasted the same with the position with Mr Barnes who was found in the laundry and who surrendered when confronted by police.
	


Consideration: Admission of Evidence of Flight


	
	The Crown, by the material in Exhibit VD A, and the summary of the evidence set out in its written submissions, has identified the alleged conduct by the accused which it contends is admissible as evidence of flight.
	
	
	As her Honour, Simpson J, in Cook stated at [21]:
	


“Evidence from which a jury may be asked to infer that an accused person has acted out of a consciousness of guilt which is tendered in a prosecution case most commonly relates to lies, either in or out of court, alleged to have been told by the accused person.”


	
	Her Honour then noted that a considerable body of law with respect to the circumstances in which such evidence may be admitted, and the way it may be treated, has developed. Her Honour noted that various conditions must be fulfilled before evidence as to lies may be admitted as evidence of consciousness of guilt. These had been stated in R v Lucas [1981] 1 QB 720 and were adopted in the judgment of Clarke JA in Heyde, supra. Her Honour noted at [22] that the conditions are directed to a determination of whether or not the lies upon which the Crown seeks to rely are capable of amounting to corroboration.
	
	
	The principles in relation to the admission of evidence as to lies equally inform the admission of evidence of flight as consciousness of guilt. As earlier noted, those principles include the requirement that the evidence must be capable of being seen as indicating a consciousness of guilt in relation to the specific offence with which the accused is charged.
	
	
	There are two steps involved in determining the issue of admissibility. The first goes to the admission of the evidence which in turn requires an assessment and determination as to whether the evidence is capable of meeting the five conditions referred to above. If the evidence is capable of meeting those conditions, there then arises the question as to whether it should be rejected pursuant to one of the discretions available to a trial judge, in particular, the discretion conferred by s 135 or following the exercise that is required by s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The second step, which only arises where the evidence has been admitted, concerns the directions required to be given to the trial jury by the judge as to the use that may be made of the evidence.
	
	
	In the present case the jury would be asked to infer, if the evidence is admitted, that because the accused fled on at least two separate occasions, he exhibited a consciousness of guilt of the stabbing of Mr Martyn. An issue arises as to whether that would place him in an awkward position as arose in Cook. If so, the question of the discretion arises and, importantly, the power under s 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence. This aspect requires a balancing of the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. If that balancing process results in a finding that the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice then the Court is constrained to refuse to admit the evidence. In that respect no element of discretion arises: Cook at [27]. I will refer to the significance of the matters considered in that case below.
	
	
	Section 137 requires a consideration of the probative value of the evidence of flight relative to its prejudicial effect in giving rise to unavoidable unfairness. In other words, the probative value of the evidence is accordingly not to be assessed merely by examination of the evidence itself.
	
	
	In the present case, the evidence to which I have referred, in my opinion, supports the conclusion that the probative value to the Crown case is high. Within a very short period of the stabbing incident in question, the accused fled, ultimately taking refuge in the apartment of his brother and his brother’s partner and subsequently when located on 7 January 2014, he fled from police who chased him. In the course of the chase, as noted above, the Crown alleges he disposed of his mobile phone.
	
	
	The balancing exercise that is required by s 137 cannot be undertaken without an understanding of any explanation that the accused might seek to advance in order to nullify the adverse inferences that would, absent explanation, arise.
	
	
	There was no evidence on the pre-trial application from the accused himself. Mr Carroll’s submissions proceeded upon the basis that the accused was on parole as at 1 January 2014 and that he had been convicted, in that respect, in relation to an offence of reckless wounding. Those matters are accepted as the basis for the exclusion of the evidence.
	
	
	However, in the present case, the offence of reckless wounding, involved different factual matters and state of mind issues. As to the latter, an offence involving the element of recklessness requires that a person foresaw the possibility of harm and went on to commit the offence regardless: Blackwell v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 93. The nature of a reckless wounding offence is therefore materially different, in particular as to the issue of state of mind, from a case such as the present involving a charge of murder where the Crown alleges an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. Accordingly, I do not accept, as was submitted, that there is a relevant similarity with the circumstances in Cook.
	
	
	Ultimately, it is a question, as I have stated, of determining the result of the balance between the probative value of the evidence proposed to be relied upon by the Crown, and the nature and extent of the prejudice that would arise to the accused. That is a matter to which I have given close consideration. It is a central matter in the determination of the admissibility of the evidence as to flight. The exercise to be undertaken pursuant to s 137 I note also requires that there be brought into consideration the directions that would need to be given to the jury in order to ameliorate the impact of the jury’s knowledge of the accused’s prior conduct.
	
	
	As to the explanation which the accused might seek to advance with a view to eliminating the adverse inference that the Crown would rely upon it is necessary, as indicated in the discussion above, to consider the same insofar as it would, or may, involve disclosure of the fact that the accused had been convicted of the earlier offence and was on parole and, if so, whether such matters generally are such as to require the exercise of the discretion in favour of exclusion. In relation to a similar matter, Simpson J in Cook observed:
	


“39   Counsel for the appellant submitted that:

“Where the explanation involves revealing further offences generally the discretion should be exercised in favour of exclusion.”

40.   In favour of this proposition two authorities were cited: R v Power (1996) 87 A Crim R 407 (Court of Criminal Appeal, South Australia) and R v Taranto (1999) NSWCCA 396, unreported, 16 December 1999. In my opinion, neither is authority for a proposition as broadly stated as that extracted above. In Power, two appellants had been told by police that they were under suspicion for a series of bank hold-ups.”


	
	The principles to be applied, as discussed by Simpson J in Cook including in particular those concerning the application of s 137 include the following:
	



	
	It is not the role of the trial judge under the Evidence Act to make a finding of fact about the actual reasons for flight where such evidence is given on behalf of the Crown. That remains the province of the jury.
	
	
	The role of the trial judge is merely to determine the relative probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice that might result.
	
	
	In respect of such a determination there is no blanket rule that in considering evidence on the voir dire where the issue is the admissibility of the evidence under s 137, there is never any room for findings concerning credibility.
	
	
	There will be occasions where the credibility of the evidence will be inextricably intertwined with the balancing process. That means that particular caution must be exercised to ensure that the balancing exercise is not confused with the assessment of credibility, a task committed to the jury.
	
	
	Where an accused’s response is so preposterous as to give rise to the conclusion that it could be accepted by no reasonable jury then credibility may be taken into account in the assessment.
	
	
	The credibility exercise in such circumstances is to determine whether the evidence given by (or on behalf of) the accused, is capable of belief by the jury. If it is, then its prejudicial effect must be considered. If it is not, then the balancing exercise may well result in an answer favourable to the Crown. That is essentially because the prejudice arising to an accused from putting a preposterous explanation to the jury would not be unfair prejudice.
	



	
	In the present case, accordingly, I proceed upon the basis that the evidence that may be given by or on behalf of the accused as to the reasons for flight is at least capable of belief by a jury.
	
	
	In Cook, Simpson J observed:
	


“47.   In my opinion none of the authorities to which reference has been made support the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant. There is no general principle that, when the explanation for flight involves revealing other offence, the evidence should be rejected. Indeed, it is part of the conventional direction in relation to evidence indicative of a consciousness of guilt (whether of lies, or flight, or otherwise), that the jury be alerted to the possibility that the accused person has undertaken that course of conduct by reason of consciousness of guilt, not of the offence charged, but of some other offence or discreditable conduct.”


	
	As mentioned, in Cook it was noted that a particular circumstance of relevance in that case was that revelation of the charge that the accused there faced involved violence against women, and this had particular poignancy given the nature of the charge on the indictment. It was the admission of such evidence that put the appellant in Cook in an awkward position. As her Honour observed:
	


“… his response to the evidence not only disclosed previous criminal offence, it disclosed criminal offences with a disturbingly close relationship to the offence with which he was charged. That the evidence would have a prejudicial effect is clear.”


	
	In Cook, the essence of the appellant’s case on the question of the admission of the flight evidence was that in order to give an explanation for his conduct the appellant necessarily had to reveal the existence of an ADVO, his previous breach of it, and the fact of an assault. He gave this as the reason for his flight when police approached him. It was noted in that case that the prejudice to the appellant was plain. Not only would his explanation expose him as a person with a criminal record (the assault and the previous breach), but it would also expose him as a person with a history of violence against women. In the context of the charge he faced, that exposure, Simpson J noted at [32], would have a particular poignancy.
	
	
	As noted earlier, in the course of argument, the Crown proposed the evidence could be adduced in a way that could permit an alternative explanation by the accused to be led without reference to the nature of the offence (reckless wounding) for which the accused was convicted. Mr Carroll, however, indicated that the offence itself was part of the relevant circumstances and disclosure of it may necessarily be required. I accordingly proceed upon the basis that such disclosure may be seen by the defence as one that would need to be made
	


Conclusions on Flight Evidence


	
	I have closely examined the matters relevant to both the probative value of the evidence in question and the matters relied upon said to be supportive of the existence of unfair prejudice should the evidence be admitted. I have reached the following conclusions:
	



	
	I am satisfied that the conditions for the admissibility of the evidence discussed above are satisfied in this case.
	
	
	A proper application of the principles discussed above, and the provisions of s 135 and 137, lead me to the conclusion that there is no basis, such as existed in Cook, which would warrant the exclusion of the evidence. In other words, I do not consider that the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by any unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Disclosure of the previous offence for which the accused was convicted would not, in the context of the present charge against him, in my opinion, place the accused in an awkward position such as that advanced in Mr Carroll’s submissions. The availability of, and the capacity of trial directions to deal with any issue of unfairness, is a factor that cannot be discounted.
	
	
	Trial directions would plainly be required directed to the following matters:
	



	
	That the jury must be satisfied that the accused fled because of a consciousness of guilt, that is, that the evidence points unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of the offence charged and not by reason of some other offence or discreditable conduct.
	
	
	The terms of trial directions would need to both draw the jury’s attention to such evidence as well as to the way it is to be assessed.
	
	
	That the jury must not speculate about the circumstances concerning the offence for which the accused was convicted resulting in him being on parole as at 1 January 2014.
	



	
	I have concluded that the probative value does outweigh any unfair prejudice. I have, in making that assessment, had regard to the need and role played for appropriate trial directions.
	


OTHER ISSUES

Selfie Image on the Accused’s Phone


	
	The Crown submitted that a “selfie” image of a replica pistol found on the accused’s mobile phone is relevant and probative. The basis for the submission was as follows:
	



	
	The image demonstrates that the accused had an association with a replica pistol.
	
	
	That association, in turn, connects him as the person whom it is anticipated the witness Ms Hill will say she saw holding what appeared to be a gun not long before the stabbing of Mr Martyn.
	
	
	The image of the gun assists in identifying the accused as the person to whom Mr Martyn was referring when, according to Ms Hill, he said “Look out he’s got a gun”.
	
	
	The fact that the gun was a replica is relevant in explaining why a knife, rather than a firearm, was used to inflict the injuries upon Mr Martyn.
	



	
	In response to Mr Carroll’s submission that there was no evidence as to whether the image was taken from the accused’s mobile phone and no evidence as to a time, date or manner in which the image of the gun was taken, the Crown Prosecutor stated that the material provided to the accused’s legal representatives included information that indicates that the photo image was taken on the accused’s mobile phone at about 10:54am on 29 November 2013, that is approximately one month prior to Mr Martyn’s stabbing: T 27.
	
	
	In explaining the relevance of the image the Crown Prosecutor relied upon four matters:
	



	
	An essential question in the trial concerns the issue of the identification of the accused as distinct from Mr Barnes.
	
	
	Ms Hill’s evidence, it is anticipated, will be that she saw a male on the road outside Norfolk Avenue initially. She said she saw that person holding something which she thought was shiny and pistol-shaped. That person was said to be some distance away at the time Mr Martyn said, “Babe, they stabbed me in the heart”.
	
	
	It is important to distinguish the accused from Mr Barnes. This may be done by the fact that Ms Hill saw the person the Crown alleges is the accused with something that was pistol-shaped (ie, he is associated with such an object).
	
	
	The evidence as to the replica pistol assists the jury in making the distinction between the accused and Mr Barnes.
	
	
	The image on the phone is of a gun not capable of firing a projectile.
	



	
	The photo images shown in the expert report, Mr Carroll, observed, show the accused in what was referred to as “gangster poses”, shrouded in black. The Crown responded by saying that the evidence concerning the gun can be led in a way that reduced any risk in that respect. The Crown Prosecutor stated that showing a close-up image of the gun itself without other features may be a way that avoids any suggested risk: T 28.
	
	
	The evidence that establishes the gun was a replica, it was submitted by the Crown, is relevant in explaining why a knife not a gun was used in the assault of Mr Martyn.
	
	
	I am of the opinion that if Ms Hill’s evidence is as outlined above, the fact that a male person in close proximity to Mr Martyn when standing on the road was seen holding what appeared to be a gun, together with evidence that establishes an image on the accused’s phone of a replica gun (and the fact of the image having been taken approximately one month before 1 January 2014) is evidence that is relevant to a fact in issue in the proceedings, namely, identification of the person who stabbed the deceased.
	
	
	If the evidence of the image is tendered without any of the features raised by Mr Carroll, I consider no unfair prejudice to the accused will arise.
	


The Note Found on 7 January 2014


	
	The Crown submitted that the note is relevant and probative evidence: Crown Submissions at [27]. If the jury concluded that the note was written by the accused, it was contended that they could conclude it demonstrates that he was concerned that Mr Barnes and Ms Park had told the police of his alleged responsibility for the stabbing. On that basis the Crown submitted that it was evidence against interest.
	
	
	Mr Carroll submitted that the note is not a statement going directly to the critical issue in the trial, namely, the identity of the person who stabbed the deceased. He contended that it was “a general statement” about being given up and is capable of various interpretations which do not go specifically to the critical issue: T 21.
	
	
	The note, I have concluded, is relevant evidence in that it goes to a fact in issue in the proceedings, namely identification of the perpetrator of the stabbing incident, in that it is evidence: (a) that is capable of establishing the existence of knowledge in the maker of the note of facts concerning the stabbing of Mr Martyn, and (b) as to concern as to disclosure of information concerning the incident, that is, it is relevant to a state of mind issue concerning both knowledge and disclosure of facts concerning the same. It is also relevant as an admission against interest as to the person responsible for the stabbing.
	


The Knife


	
	The statement of Sergeant Jason Maxwell dated 2 February 2014 (document 2(a) in Exhibit VD A) establishes that the Operational Support Group (OSG) attended at Flynn’s Beach, Port Macquarie on or about 20 January 2014.
	
	
	Sergeant Maxwell reached a set of wooden stairs leading down from Tuppeny Road onto the picnic area of Flynn’s Beach. He said he noticed a metallic object lying on the ground. It was next to the wooden stairs. He saw that it was a serrated knife with a black handle similar to a steak knife. He took possession of the knife. The OSG Team completed the search.
	
	
	The knife is depicted in photographs 123 and 124 of Exhibit VD A.
	
	
	Exhibit VD A also contains a statement of a female (referred to here as Ms “A”). She stated that she was swimming at Flynn’s Beach between about 6:20am and 6:30am on Wednesday, 1 January 2014. She said she caught a wave to shore. She stood up and saw a male standing on the water’s edge on the beach. She said the male seemed a “little jittery”. He did not have a shirt on and was wearing blue shorts. She provided a description of the male. She said that she saw a photograph of the male that she had seen on the beach, in the ‘Port News’ Newspaper. This occurred on 6 January 2014. The newspaper featured an article on a stabbing that had occurred in Port Macquarie.
	
	
	Exhibit VD A also contains a statement of a male (referred to here as Mr “B”). In his statement he provided an account of his observations of a male he saw at Flynn’s Beach on 1 January 2014 about 50 to 60 metres south of the access stairs at the northern end of the beach.
	
	
	Mr Carroll submitted that there was no basis to link the particular knife found by police to the accused.
	
	
	DNA testing of the knife did not produce any result. As Mr Carroll observed, there was no evidence linking the knife to the stab wounds to the deceased.
	
	
	There is no sufficient basis, in my opinion, for the admission of evidence concerning the knife. In particular, there is no basis to link it to the accused. It was found on 20 January 2014 near the picnic area. It has been described as being a knife similar to a steak knife. It is at least consistent with it being a knife dropped by a visitor, in an area frequented by members of the public including picnickers near the picnic area in question.
	
	
	On the above basis, the knife is not admissible as evidence in the trial.

2767982,R v Wilson [2015] NSWSC 1538,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Pearl Marie Wilson, has been charged with murdering Jason Gordon Shepstone in February 2013. She was then in a relationship with him. She has pleaded not guilty to that charge. A question has arisen as to her fitness to be tried.
	


Orders


	
	At the hearing today I indicated that I would make orders in terms agreed by the parties. Those agreed were:
	


1.   The accused Pearl Marie Wilson is currently unfit to be tried for the offence of murdering Jason Gordon Shepstone at Dapto on or about 11 February 2013

2.   In accordance with Section 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal);

3.   Vary the conditions of bail previously granted by this court by deleting them all and substituting these:

The accused is –

(a)   To attend the Emergency Department at Shellharbour Hospital by 5pm Monday 19 October 2015 to be psychiatrically assessed, taking into consideration the two emails of Dr Furst dated 16 October 2015;

(b)   To accept all reasonable directions and treatment by the medical staff at Shellharbour Hospital or any other delegated treatment course;

(c)   To attend the Tribunal at such time and place as the Tribunal shall direct;

(d)   To comply with all directions of the Tribunal;

(e)   To reside at XX XXXXX XXXXX Road, XXXXX unless hospitalised

4.   Direct the Registrar to provide the following documents to the Emergency Department, Shellharbour Hospital:

(i)   A copy of these orders

(ii)   A transcript of the evidence taken from Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Richard Furst in this inquiry

(iii)   A copy of the emails sent by Dr Richard Furst to Mr Peter Pearsall on 16 October 2014

5.   Direct the Registrar to provide the following documents to the Tribunal:

(i)   A copy of this judgment

(ii)   A copy of these orders

(iii)    A transcript of the evidence taken from Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Richard Furst in this inquiry

(iv)   Copies of all exhibits tendered in this inquiry

The applicable requirements


	
	Under s 9 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), the Court conducted an inquiry into Ms Wilson’s fitness to be tried. In accordance with s 6 the question of Ms Wilson's fitness had to be determined on the balance of probabilities. Section 12 required that the inquiry not be conducted in an adversarial manner and that the onus of proof as to the question of fitness did not rest on any particular party to the proceedings.
	
	
	The principles that apply when an accused's fitness is determined are well settled. They are explained in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48, where Smith J said:
	


""[An accused] needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.""


	
	The application of those principles was considered in Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230, where an accused with a seemingly unstable psychotic condition was initially found to be fit. Later in the trial there was what might have been a “flare-up” or “florid outbreak”. The question of his fitness thus arose again for consideration, but was not further considered by the trial judge, in circumstances where the trial was close to its end. It was observed by the plurality at [35]:
	


“… In the context of a trial, fitness to be tried is to be determined by reference to the factors mentioned by Smith J in Presser and by reference to the length of the trial. It makes no sense to determine the question of fitness to be tried by reference to the accused's condition immediately prior to the commencement of the trial without having regard to what the accused's condition will or is likely to be during the course of the trial. There is simply no point in embarking on a lengthy trial with all the expense and inconvenience to jurors that it may entail if it is to be interrupted by reason of some manifestation or exacerbation of a debilitating condition which can affect the accused's fitness to be tried. Of course, that is not to exclude from the jury's consideration the question whether the condition is such that difficulties can be accommodated by an adjournment if and when they arise.


	
	It was concluded that the trial judge had erred in not dealing again with the question as to the accused’s fitness in accordance with the applicable statutory scheme, when it arose again.
	


Ms Wilson’s health


	
	There was finally no issue between the parties as to Ms Wilson’s health, or its impact on her ability to interact with her legal representatives, to give them instructions, and to understand or participate in what would be involved in a 3 to 4 week trial of the murder charge which she faces.
	
	
	Ms Wilson has been examined by a number of experts. The reports of four experts were tendered and Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst were called to give concurrent evidence, they having examined her again earlier this week, Dr Allnutt again this morning.
	
	
	Initially there was a common view amongst the experts as to the first elements of the Presser test, namely that Ms Wilson had an ability to understand the nature of the charge; she had the ability to plead to the charge and also to exercise her right of challenge; and she also had an ability to understand the nature of the proceedings. Opinions were, however, divided over whether she had the ability to follow the course of the proceedings; to understand the substantial effect of the evidence led; and to make a defence to answer to the charge.
	
	
	Ms Wilson’s lawyers identified an ongoing deterioration in her health. She was, as a result, further examined, as I have explained.
	
	
	The result was that a consensus emerged between the experts that Ms Wilson was no longer fit to be tried. Having considered the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I also came to the view that Ms Wilson was not fit to be tried. I also concluded that the opinions and concerns which Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst explained, when giving their concurrent evidence, as to her need for further treatment, had to be reflected in the orders made, in accordance with s 14 of the Act, as well as in Ms Wilson’s ongoing conditions of bail. The terms of those orders were also agreed by the parties.
	


The circumstances of Mr Shepstone’s death


	
	On the morning of 12 February 2013 Ms Wilson sought help from a neighbour, when she could not wake Mr Shepstone. An attempt at resuscitation was made, but when an ambulance attended, it was soon established that Mr Shepstone had died. He was also found to be covered in blisters.
	
	
	The account which Ms Wilson then gave included that he had become violent and aggressive while she was making a hot drink, which she had thrown at him. Later she told police that during their argument she had hit him with a metal bar, which she produced and had poured hot water over him. He had laid down on a mattress and had vomited up blood and other stuff, which she had wiped up. He had then gone to sleep and she had laid down with him. In the morning she was unable to wake him and had then gone to her neighbour, who called 000. Ms Wilson later made another statement to police.
	
	
	On later examination Ms Wilson was found to be suffering bruising and abrasions, as well as injuries to her neck, hand, breast, shoulder and arm, which on her account Mr Shepstone had inflicted.
	
	
	The cause of Mr Shepstone’s death was established to have been multiple blunt force and heat related injuries over the whole of his body. Ms Wilson was first charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and after post mortem results were received, with murder.
	


The expert evidence


	
	No evidence was called from Ms Wilson. She has given inconsistent accounts as to what happened to Mr Shepstone, which raised the question of her fitness. As a result, Ms Wilson was examined by the psychiatrists, Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, and by Dr Hepner and Dr Pullman, both neuropsychologists. Their reports were in evidence and unchallenged affidavit evidence was also led from Ms Wilson’s solicitor, Mr Rees.
	
	
	Ms Wilson’s background and present circumstances emerged from the histories which she has given to those who have examined her. These accounts differ in detail, but appear to have been consistent with various police and medical records referred to in the experts’ reports. She has a history of considerable deprivation, abuse and serious ill health.
	
	
	Ms Wilson is of Aboriginal heritage and is now aged 60 years. She has never learned to read or write and has a long history of treatment for mental illness and abuse. She is presently at liberty on bail, living in the community receiving treatment for her various physical and mental health problems. On the expert evidence her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she requires further treatment in hospital.
	
	
	Mr Rees explained recent events in his unchallenged affidavit. He had also considered audio recordings and notes of past conferences with Ms Wilson and has also discussed her mental state with the solicitor who previously had carriage of her matter and with Mr Pearsall of counsel. He had also considered the reports tendered. He gave a detailed account of the events which had led him to the view that Ms Wilson’s mental state had deteriorated since the Aboriginal legal Service was first retained to represent her. That was consistent with medical evidence as to her declining health, which on the expert evidence, is likely to continue.
	
	
	Mr Rees explained what had occurred at a recent conference when the question of fitness was discussed with Ms Wilson. He explained ongoing communication difficulties; what appeared to be efforts by Ms Wilson to participate; and her apparent difficulties in understanding and retaining basic information. He also explained her equating Mr Shepstone’s death with proof that she had murdered him and an inability to grasp issues such as intention, or defences of self-defence or provocation.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s June 2014 report noted that Ms Wilson had an awareness of the charge she faced and responded to questions asked as to the elements of the Presser test. Dr Furst then concluded that she was fit to be tried, notwithstanding her cognitive impairments and associated comprehension and communication difficulties.
	
	
	Dr Furst also referred to a range of records and documents provided to him, including the results of a March 2013 MRI, which identified infarcts in both hemispheres of Ms Wilson’s brain, consistent with vascular disease, hypertension and diabetes affecting her brain circulation and suggesting vascular dementia. He recommended neuropsychological testing, to established the level of her impairment, also noting that she appeared to suffer chronic anxiety disorder, PTSD, which appeared to have a significant impact on her functioning. He also considered that she had a defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.
	
	
	Dr Hepner’s August 2014 report referred to the material she had been briefed with, including Dr Furst’s report and various records and documents. Dr Hepner found Ms Wilson to be a poor historian, but noted her report of having been bashed, strangled and suffocated by others on multiple occasions, more than 20, during most of which she had lost consciousness. Dr Hepner administered various tests and also considered the Presser test.
	
	
	Dr Hepner found that Ms Wilson’s intellectual functioning fell into the extremely low range, with her verbal comprehension falling into the borderline impaired range. There were similar results for working memory, more complex learning memory, as well as memory for spoken and visual information. Her language performance also fell into the impaired range. There were similar poor results on other testing.
	
	
	Dr Hepner concluded that Ms Wilson had significant impairment in multiple areas of cognitive functioning and that she satisfied the criteria for diagnosis of vascular dementia. Her IQ also fell into the range for a mild intellectual disability. There was, as a result, significant concern that she could not follow the course of any proceedings and that her ability to give a reliable account of events or to instruct her counsel, or decide on any defence was impaired. In the result, Dr Hepner concluded that she was not fit to be tried.
	
	
	Dr Pullman’s April 2015 report referred to the reports of Dr Furst and Dr Hepner, as well as various records, reports and statements, including those of Ms Wilson. To her, Ms Wilson gave a history which included having suffered a heart attack, while being strangled. Dr Pullman administered various tests, which showed, despite good effort on Ms Wilson’s part, that she had problems with working memory and processing speeds, with her overall intellectual functioning falling into the extremely low range. She also had impaired results in testing of her recent memory and was assessed as having both auditory and visual memory impairments, as well as impaired executive functioning skills and language skills falling into the impaired range.
	
	
	Dr Pullman concluded that she did not have the cognitive capacity to instruct counsel, follow and comprehend the court proceedings and that given her dementia, that capacity would not improve.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt’s 7 May 2015 report recounted Ms Wilson’s account that at the time of Mr Shepstone’s death, she was not working, living on a disability support pension, suffering from heart problems and taking a variety of medications. She had been admitted to hospital in the past as the result of overdosing and had made other suicide attempts in her twenties and thirties, when depressed. When Mr Shepstone died, however, she had not been abusing alcohol, but was still using cannabis daily, having commenced its use when aged 27.
	
	
	Ms Wilson has given an account of being the victim of repeated sexual and other abuse over the course of her lifetime, commencing when she was a child and including at the hands of Mr Shepstone, who she met when aged 51. She said that on occasions she had been choked to the point of blacking out and described suffering anxiety symptoms in the period before Mr Shepstone died, when he was intoxicated.
	
	
	These accounts were consistent with various police records provided to Dr Allnutt, as well as with medical records and what examination of Ms Wilson revealed. COPS reports between 2001 and 2009 revealed reported domestic violence on multiple occasions in which Ms Wilson was the victim and on others, when Mr Shepstone was the victim and she the person of interest. Those reports include references to Ms Wilson being choked and smothered with a pillow, involving, for example, Mr Shepstone in breach of an AVO in 2008. There was another such report noted in 2012.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt had also reviewed the reports of Dr Furst, Dr Hepner and Dr Pullman. He also saw a DVD of Ms Wilson’s police interview.
	
	
	Ms Wilson’s medical records revealed that she has suffered significant ill health including diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, retinal aneurism, cloeithiasis, fractures and abscesses. Her cardiovascular disease resulted in her requiring an operation in 2012. She had also been diagnosed with depression, alcohol abuse and anxiety, as well as vascular and/or alcohol related dementia.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt noted that after her arrest in 2013, Ms Wilson was admitted to a mental health facility from 21 February to 22 March, where she remained as a voluntary patient, then being at risk of self harm. She was then diagnosed as suffering grief and depressive symptoms, as well as aggression. An MRI was found to be abnormal and she was referred to a neurologist. There had also been a diagnosis of PTSD and cognitive impairment, with her IQ falling in the range for mild intellectual disability.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt found Ms Wilson to be suffering mild depressive symptoms, arising from her PTSD, demonstrated memory problems, mild intellectual incapacity and vascular dementia, consistent with the findings of the CT scan of her brain. He considered then, however, that with breaks allowed during the hearing to address her cognitive problems, she was fit to stand trial.
	
	
	That opinion altered after Dr Allnutt’s most recent examination. At the hearing it was revealed that it had been agreed between Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, not only that Ms Wilson was suffering moderate to severe depression, but that she was also suffering a range of psychotic symptoms, including various auditory phenomena and unusual ideas and beliefs. They included that Mr Shepstone’s spirit is in her house; that she is being followed; that paedophiles are intent on killing her; and that it was not Mr Shepstone, but another person, who had died.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt considered it unlikely that these symptoms were feigned and that it was possible that they would respond to treatment. Dr Furst agreed. Given, however, her underlying cognitive impairment and dementia, which would continue to deteriorate, they both considered it unlikely that she would recover. They also agreed that she needed to be readmitted, for further treatment in hospital, to give her the best possibility of some recovery.
	
	
	In the circumstances, there was, however, no longer any disagreement that Ms Wilson could not meet the Presser test. Whether there was any prospect of recovery depends on a range of complex matters, including the basis of her psychotic symptoms, including whether or not they are psychotic memories. That cannot presently be determined.
	
	
	Given her frailty and deteriorating mental health otherwise, both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt considered it unlikely that Ms Wilson will recover sufficiently to stand trial on a charge which raises complex issues, which she would have to engage in over a period of some 3 to 4 weeks. They agreed however, that further treatment provided the best possibility of such a recovery.
	
	
	In the face of the common view which the experts had reached, when considered in light of the problems described by Mr Rees in advising Ms Wilson and obtaining instructions from her, the conclusion that she was not fit to be tried, was unavoidable, given the applicable principles. I was satisfied that she did not meet the Presser test and that accordingly, it had to be concluded that at present, she is not fit to be tried.
	
	
	It was in those circumstances that the orders which the parties agreed must be made.
	


ORDERS


	
	For the reasons given, I make orders in terms agreed by the parties.

		16 October 2015",2015-10-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2768001,R v Khalid [2015] NSWSC 1561,"Judgment EX TEMPORE (REVISED)


	
	These proceedings were listed before me today for the commencement of the hearing of a number of applications in advance of a trial which is listed to commence on 2 November 2015.
	
	
	On 9 October 2015, the solicitor for the accused filed a notice of motion seeking, amongst other things, an order that the trial date be vacated. That application was supported by an affidavit of the accused's solicitor of 14 October 2015. That affidavit set out, in broad terms, two bases for the application. The first concerned the Crown's failure to provide, in a timely fashion, material it was obliged to disclose, which was an issue which had been raised in a previous mention of the matter before me some weeks before. The second arose from what was said to be adverse publicity, the nature of which I do not propose to canvass, but which was said to affect the right of the accused to a fair trial.
	
	
	As events have transpired, it is the first basis of the application which has been the focus of attention today. The second basis has not been agitated. Notwithstanding that, it is appropriate that I make this observation: On Friday 16 October 2015, an article appeared in 'The Daily Telegraph' under the heading ""A Child in the Grip of an Evil Cadre"". The article canvassed the detail of a number of prosecutions currently before the Courts of persons charged with what might be generally described as terrorism offences. The article made reference to the present accused. It stated, amongst other things, that the accused was ""being held in Supermax and will stand trial next year on charges he was in possession of documents 'designed to facilitate a terrorist attack'.""
	
	
	Two observations may be made about that part of the article. Firstly, the description of the charge which has been brought against the accused is inaccurate. The accused is charged with possessing documents, connected with the preparation for a terrorist act, knowing of that connection. There is nothing in the Indictment presented against the accused which alleges that he was in possession of documents “designed to facilitate a terrorist attack"". The second observation to be made about that part of the article concerns the reference to the fact that ""the accused will stand trial next year"". Although, as a result of submissions that I have heard this morning, that may now be the case, it was certainly not the case at the time that the article was written. At that time, the trial was listed to commence not next year, but on 2 November this year.
	
	
	This Court has a Media Officer whose responsibilities include answering queries from members of the media about trials that are listed to commence before the Court, or which are proceeding before the Court. Leaving aside the misdescription of the charge faced by the accused, the confirmation of a trial date can be obtained in a simple phone call. Having reviewed the transcripts of the occasions on which this matter has been before the Court prior to today, it can be safely said that there has never been any suggestion whatsoever, up until today, that the trial would take place in 2016. The origin of that assertion, which is made in quite specific terms in the article, remains a mystery. Although, as events have transpired, matters of pre-trial publicity and the like have not been issues upon which I have had to make an adjudication in terms of the continuation of the trial, it is perhaps appropriate for me to exhort members of the media, in the event that they are in any doubt at all about factual matters such as this, to make use of the resource which is available to them through the Court's media officer, and simply make a phone call to confirm the correctness of their understanding of a particular matter. The taking of such a simple step can go a long way to alleviating difficulties which might otherwise arise.
	
	
	The primary basis of the application to vacate the trial which was argued before me this morning stemmed from the Crown's recent service of material to which its obligation of disclosure attached. In order to put that aspect of this application in its proper context, it is necessary for me to make some short observations about the history of the matter.
	
	
	The accused was arrested in December of 2014. In May of this year, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions made application to the Chief Justice to allow an indictment to be presented against the accused in this Court, as opposed to it being presented against him in the District Court. I can only infer, in those circumstances, that the Commonwealth Director took the view that the case was of particular and sufficient importance to warrant it proceeding in this Court.
	
	
	The Director's application was granted by the Chief Justice and arrangements were then made for the proceedings to be placed in the list before the arraignments judge. The Court moved quickly to allow that to happen. The matter first came before Johnson J on 3 July 2015. That was only a short time after the Commonwealth Director had made his application to the Chief Justice. When the matter came before Johnson J on that day, the Crown was not in a position to present an indictment, but indicated that it would be in a position to do so on the next occasion. In those circumstances, the proceedings were adjourned until 7 August 2015. On that day, the matter again came before Johnson J at which time an indictment was presented against the accused, to which he pleaded not guilty. Significantly, nothing was said to Johnson J on either of those occasions about any outstanding material which was required to be provided by the Crown to the accused by way of disclosure. The only conclusion I can reach, based on the material which is before me today, is that someone must have known that the service of such material remained outstanding at that time.
	
	
	I accept the submission of senior counsel for the Crown who has appeared before me today that he did not know at that stage that service of the material was outstanding. Indeed, he did not appear before Johnson J and may not even have been briefed in the matter at that point. Similarly, junior counsel did not appear before Johnson J and I accept she was similarly unaware of the situation that existed. However, as I have said, somebody must have known that this was the position. In those circumstances, it is of some concern that Johnson J was not informed of it. That is particularly so in circumstances where, in setting the trial date, his Honour canvassed with the parties the need to have any pre-trial matters resolved before 2 November. It was certainly not indicated to his Honour that the service of any material remained outstanding.
	
	
	When the matter first came before me some weeks ago I was informed, for the first time, that material which the Crown was obliged to disclosed had not been served. I was not informed at that time of the extent of that material. I infer that senior counsel was not in a position to determine that at the time. In any event, I made orders on that day requiring the material to be provided.
	
	
	The Crown has accepted that what was referred to in written submissions as ""final two tranches"" of the material was served on two separate occasions, the first of which was six and-a-half weeks before the scheduled commencement of the trial, and the second of which was just under four weeks before that time.
	
	
	The significance of the service of that material in such close proximity to the trial date is best gauged by reference to the affidavit of the accused's solicitor of 8 September 2015. In that affidavit, the accused's solicitor deposed to the fact that on 18 September she was served with material which included:
	



	
	a box of approximately 2,000 loose pages;
	
	
	21 CDRs; and
	
	
	a USB Stick.
	



	
	She observed (and it is not, as I understand it, disputed by the Crown) that one of the Discs served contained no less than 6,942 separate files. Those files included details of phone calls and text messages. They also included other media files. Other discs contained what were described as “thousands of materials including documents, briefs and media files”. As I say, the Crown did not cavil with those descriptions.
	
	
	A further bundle of material was served by the Crown on 6 October last. In that this material, although perhaps not as voluminous as that served in the first instance, was of a similar description.
	
	
	The accused's solicitor deposed to the fact that it would be an almost impossible task for any legal practitioner to view that material, digest it and obtain instructions from the accused about it prior to the trial. She also made the observation that amongst the material were recorded conversations in the Arabic language which would obviously need to be translated.
	
	
	The Crown, in written submissions before me today, has conceded that a ""significant amount of material"" was served on those acting for the accused on the two occasions to which I have referred. The submissions noted, and as I have indicated, I accept, that the Crown was not aware when the trial date was set that that the provision of such material was outstanding.
	
	
	In those circumstances the Crown has not opposed the trial date being vacated. In taking that position the Crown has acknowledged that those acting for the accused require further time to properly consider the material which has been served, and obtain instructions. Implicit in that concession is an acknowledgement of the fact that if the accused’s representatives are not given that opportunity, the accused will be denied a fair trial.
	
	
	The situation which has arisen as a consequence of the late service of this material is, to say the least, lamentable. The accused has now been in custody for a period of approximately ten months. Other than saying that the trial will not take place until sometime in 2016, I am not in a position to be any more specific. It may well be, given the workload of the Court, that the trial cannot be listed until sometime approaching the middle of next year. If that were to come to pass, it would mean that the accused, as a person who enjoys a presumption of innocence, will have been detained in custody for a period approaching eighteen months since the time of his arrest. The unacceptability of that circumstance needs no further comment.
	
	
	The fact that the situation has, as the Crown has conceded, been brought about in large measure by its failure to serve material in a timely fashion is, as I have said, lamentable. I repeat that whilst I accept that the Crown and his junior may not have been aware of the fact that this material was outstanding when the matter before Johnson J months ago, somebody must have been aware of it. Quite apart from consequences to which I have already referred, the vacation of this trial necessarily means that other accused person(s) have been denied the opportunity to have an earlier trial date.
	
	
	I have already observed that in bringing an application to the Chief Justice to have the trial proceed in this Court, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must have taken the view that the importance of the trial justified such a step being taken. It is to be hoped that from this point onwards the importance that the Director obviously attaches to the matter will be reflected in the way in which it is prepared for trial.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I make the following orders.
	



	
	The trial date of 2 November 2015 is vacated.
	
	
	The matter is listed before Johnson J, the arraignments judge on Friday, 6 November 2015 at 10am.
	
	
	I order that the accused attend by way of audio-visual link before Johnson J on that day.

2768004,R v Maybir (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1738,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Many of the events with which this trial is concerned occurred at a studio in Oatley where the accused, the deceased and the deceased's mother and siblings were living. The Crown proposed that the jury be taken to the premises in order to carry out an inspection (""a view""): s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Mr Brady SC initially opposed the view on the basis that alterations had occurred since the events in question to an extent that it would not be of assistance to the jury (T595.48). However, after receiving further information about those alterations he withdrew the objection (T598.41).
	
	
	The accused is aware of his entitlement to be present at a view: see Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA 198; 223 A Crim R 585 and Tongahai v R [2014] NSWCCA 81. However, and for understandable reasons (he is in custody), he wishes to waive that right (T839): s 53(3)(a).
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence which has been given to date as well as my (albeit limited) understanding of the evidence yet to come, I am satisfied that a view of the studio premises will assist the jury in understanding the evidence and in resolving issues of fact: s 53(3)(b).
	
	
	It has not been submitted, and I do not consider, that there is a danger that a view might be unfairly prejudicial, misleading, confusing or result in an undue waste of time: s 53(3)(c).
	
	
	I am also satisfied that the alterations that have been carried out to the premises as outlined to me by the Crown Prosecutor (T595) can be explained sufficiently to the jury so that they will not be diverted from a proper understanding of how it was at the material times: s 53(3)(e). There are sufficient visual depictions already in evidence that will aid the jury in this respect (for example, the photographs in Exhibit A and the Interactive Scene Recording and Presentation in Exhibit AH).
	
	
	I accede to the Crown's proposal that there be a view.

2768005,R v Maybir (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1739,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused is on trial for the murder of a 7 year-old child on 20-21 May 2013. He also faces charges of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, reckless wounding and production of child abuse material alleged to have been committed between 8 March and 19 May 2013, all involving the same child.
	
	
	The Crown will be tendering a recorded interview by police of the accused that occurred on 20 November 2013. Mr Brady SC objects to the following portion (the deceased and his sister have been anonymised):
	


“Q576   [Sister] has told her grandmother that on the morning that [the deceased] went to sleep for the day, which I think we can fairly safely assume is the, the day that he’s had his accident - - -

A   So we assuming now.

Q576   - - - that you forced him to eat his own poo - - -

A   On that morning I made him eat his own poo.

Q576   - - - and you have also hit him on the head. That’s what [sister], a 5-year-old girl, has said.

A   So I made him eat his own poo on that morning and hit him on the head. That is a lie, but he has, I have made him eat it before, but not the, then.

Q577   You’ve made him eat his own poo before.

A   Yes, I have. That was in the very first time they were in the studio and he kept pooin’ and hiding his stuff.

Q578   O.K. What was the purpose of making him eat his own poo?

A   There was no purpose. I was just angry.”


	
	Mr Brady conceded that the evidence was relevant but contended that it was inadmissible on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	After hearing submissions on 22 October 2015 I indicated that I would allow the evidence. The following are my reasons.
	


Background


	
	This trial involves a number of allegations of mistreatment by the accused of the deceased child prior to 20 May 2013 when the Crown contends he assaulted him and caused injuries which caused the child’s death. There is, and will be, evidence to the effect that the accused had some rather peculiar views (putting it mildly) about what was appropriate in terms of discipline and punishment of children. The Crown alleges he chastised the child’s mother for her relatively mild means of disciplining her children and introduced physical punishments and harsh “boot camp” style disciplinary methods into the family.
	
	
	The accused has pleaded guilty in the presence of the jury that on 16 March 2013 he assaulted the child himself and required the child’s siblings to punch him (3 counts of assault) and he filmed this cruelty (produce child abuse material). He accepted his guilt of striking the child with a kitchen implement at Bulli on 31 March 2013 (assault). He has also pleaded guilty to his involvement in the beating of the child with a piece of wood by the child’s mother at Bulli on an occasion between 12 and 20 April 2013 (reckless wounding).
	
	
	The accused has also pleaded not guilty to the balance of the charges. Aside from the murder of the child, he disputes that on 8 March 2013 he filmed the deceased child as he tried to persuade him to demonstrate how the child’s grandfather had sexually molested him (produce child abuse material). He disputes that on 17 March 2013 he assaulted the child in various ways (2 counts of assault). He disputes that on Bulli Beach on 31 March 2013 he struck the child with a stick and that later the same day he punched the child (assault occasioning actual bodily harm, alternatively, assault). He disputes that at Oatley on 19 May 2013 he filmed the “disciplining” of the child for “lying” because he would not agree that he had been sexually abused by his grandfather (produce child abuse material).
	
	
	There is, or will be, other evidence of other forms of inappropriate and/or unsavoury behaviour by the accused towards the deceased, and his siblings. For example, when they lived in his music studio in a small commercial unit block that had no internal bathroom but only communal facilities, he required the children, including the deceased, to urinate into a bucket and defecate into nappies. They lived there in late January – early March 2013 and returned to live there in early May 2013.
	
	
	The Crown case is generally to the effect that the accused particularly singled the deceased child out for “discipline” and punishment to a greater extent than his two younger siblings. The deceased was intellectually disabled and was less communicative and socially adapted compared to them.
	
	
	There is also evidence before the jury that he mistreated his own children in somewhat similar ways. That evidence was allowed on the basis that it had the capacity to establish that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way or have a particular state of mind, namely to assault young children in his care using his hands or objects for the purpose of disciplining or punishing them and that harm be caused to young children in his care or to be indifferent to the harm caused to them: see R v Maybir (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1737.
	
	
	The evidence of the forensic pathologist and related expert witnesses is anticipated to reveal that the deceased child had been the subject of quite an ordeal of physical abuse in the months preceding his death which resulted in him sustaining a considerable number of injuries including bone fractures.
	
	
	The circumstances of the murder itself are worth mentioning. It is alleged early in the morning of 20 May 2013 the child was subjected to a brutal assault which caused a catastrophic brain injury. The accused, and his mother, did nothing to summon medical attention until they woke the following morning to find the child dead.
	


The defence case as opened


	
	The defence case, as opened by Mr Brady, is to the effect that it was the mother of the children, Ms Kayla James, who physically disciplined the children, particularly the deceased. “She would do that by hitting him hard” (T53.43). The accused sought to circumvent this by introducing the “boot camp” concept. It was said that the accused now accepted that, in hindsight, this was inappropriate for such young children (aged 3, 4 and 7), but at the time he thought it was “a better option” than Ms James hitting them in the way that she was. It was said that he was “ill-equipped to handle the situation he found himself in” and was applying disciplinary techniques he had acquired from television and movies (T55.27). But it was also conceded that he was becoming increasingly infatuated with Ms James and he started doing things to the children that she was doing; for example, he concedes the matters the subject of his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	The defence case was also said to include an assertion that the numerous injuries found on the body of the deceased during the autopsy examination were “in large part caused by Ms James” (T57.10). It will also be contended that shortly before the deceased was injured and died, Ms James struck him to the face with such force that he smacked the back of his head against a door frame (T57.15). There was an element of vagueness in whether this is said to have caused the fatal injury (which was as a result of blunt force trauma to the back of the head) because it was also said that “the injury” was caused as a result of an accident which occurred during playful wrestling between the accused and the deceased (T57.35).
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown Prosecutor contends that the impugned evidence may properly be placed before the jury as “context evidence”. I find that term rather vague. He amplified this by saying that the evidence showed the nature of the interaction between the accused and the deceased. It provided the background to the events that led to the death of the child. It showed that the fatal assault simply did not occur “out of the blue”. I take that to mean if there was no such “context” evidence, the jury would be left wondering about how and why the accused could have acted so abominably towards the 7 year-old child on 20 May 2013 by assaulting him with such force as to cause the fatal injuries.
	
	
	It was also submitted that the probative value of the evidence needed to be assessed in the light of the anticipated defence case (and that is why I have summarised it above). In short, it was anticipated by the Crown that the accused’s case could convey the notion that he behaved in what he thought was the best interests of the children, albeit conceding now that he had been misguided. Evidence which portrayed the real attitude of the accused towards the children (and particularly the deceased) in the weeks and months leading up to the death could, permissibly, assist the Crown in dissuading the jury from such a view. Whilst there is other evidence that might assist the Crown in this respect, this piece of evidence was said to be particularly compelling, especially as the accused provided this in the interview as if it was not at all outlandish, outrageous or cruel but simply something he did when he was angry.
	
	
	It was acknowledged that anyone would find it highly shocking and offensive that an adult would force a 7 year-old child to eat his own excrement as some kind of punishment. But the Crown contended that this provided its probative force. If that be the case, then there was no danger of any unfair prejudice outweighing such probative force.
	


Defence submissions


	
	Mr Brady accepted that the defence case involved a contention that the accused’s “boot camp methods” were thought by him, at the time, to be in the best interests of the children. But there was already evidence before the jury that is sufficient to provide the “context” that the Crown sought to establish: the offences to which he has pleaded guilty; the evidence relevant to the offences to which he has pleaded not guilty and other evidence of his behaviour towards the children (for example, the deceased being denied food and water).
	
	
	So, it was submitted that the probative value of the impugned evidence was significantly reduced when regard was had to the other evidence that is, or will be, before the jury. However, the unfair prejudice associated with it was said to be “massive”. There was a danger of misuse of the evidence. The jury would find the evidence repulsive. They might misuse it as tendency evidence, namely to act in a particular way if the deceased had done something the accused did not like. The jury might find it more likely that the accused committed the murder. There was also a risk that the jury would consider it to be evidence of bad character “and simply say, ‘this man shouldn’t be allowed to walk free’” (T815.35).
	


Determination


	
	The evidence is admissible because it is very illuminating of the attitude of the accused towards the deceased. That the apparently sane accused would force a 7 year-old intellectually disabled child to eat his own excrement, simply because the accused was angry, could be taken by the jury to indicate that he had an extreme level of disregard and contempt for the dignity and well-being of the child. The other evidence in the case to which Mr Brady referred simply goes to establish the accused’s view about what was appropriate discipline and punishment for a child at the time but now concedes was misguided.
	
	
	The relevance of the evidence was conceded. It certainly is relevant in that it may assist in establishing that the accused had such a high level of disdain for the child that he was prepared to perpetrate a brutal assault which caused catastrophic and what would have been obvious brain injury and then failed to summon medical attention for 24 hours.
	
	
	It is not tendency evidence. It does not support an inference that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind (and it is not tendered for that purpose). It is evidence that the accused in fact had a particular state of mind. It is a state of mind he held from early in his relationship with the child’s mother through to the death of the child a few months later. (See Elomar v R; Hasan v R; Cheikho v R; Cheikho v R; Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303 at [356]-[367] for a discussion as to the difference between a person having a state of mind and having a tendency to do so.)
	
	
	The evidence is certainly capable of being regarded as confronting and inflammatory. Before the jury were empanelled I was at pains to point out to them the need for objectivity and dispassion in a case of this nature. I will be reminding the jury of the importance of this. I am not persuaded that they will allow passion or prejudice to prevail over rationality in the assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	In terms of s 137 of the Evidence Act, I was not of the view that the probative value of the evidence, which is significant, is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.
	


Ruling


	
	For these reasons, the ruling I made on 22 October 2015 (T840.36) was that questions and answers 576 – 578 of the police interview of 20 November 2013 is admissible.

INTRODUCTION


	
	HIS HONOUR: I now have before me ZF and AJH for verdict in relation to five counts on an indictment that was presented last Monday week. The two accused as well as a then co-accused JM, pleaded not guilty to the following charges.
	
	
	In relation to count 1, they pleaded not guilty to a charge alleging that they on 4 December 2012, at Bathurst, in the State of New South Wales, caused grievous bodily harm to John Shortland, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to him.
	
	
	The Crown pleaded an alternative to count 1, in count 2, that they each on 4 December 2012, at Bathurst, in the State of New South Wales, whilst in company of each other, caused grievous bodily harm to John Shortland and were reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to him.
	
	
	The third count was an allegation against the three accused, now resting in relation to the two accused, that they each on 4 December 2012, at Bathurst, in the State of New South Wales, did wound Joel Shortland, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	An alternative to that count pleaded in count 4, is that on 4 December 2012, at Bathurst, in the State of New South Wales, whilst in company of each other, they did wound Joel Shortland and were reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to him.
	
	
	A fifth and additional count pleaded, was that they each on 4 December 2012, at Bathurst, used unlawful violence against John Shortland and Joel Shortland, by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
	
	
	At this point of the trial as I have pointed out, JM is not in the dock. He was acquitted at the end of the Crown case, in the sense that, to use a colloquialism, I gave myself a Prasad direction and considered that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt his guilt on a number of bases having regard to the state of the evidence in the trial. Some of the matters that informed that verdict will be reflected in the judgment I now give, but they are also of some significance in the assessment of the evidence that remains in relation to each of the accused.
	
	
	During the course of my judgment, I propose without any disrespect to anybody, from time to time refer to John Shortland as either John or JJ, as he was referred to in the evidence, and Joel Shortland as Joel. Likewise in relation to ZF and AJH, I propose from time to time to refer to them by their given names. It is much easier this way, particularly delivering an oral judgment. I will give the full names of some of the dramatis personae, including witnesses in this case initially, but from time to time I may refer to them either by surname or given name. Likewise, in relation to Melissa Smith and Fergus O’Connor, I may from time to time refer to them either by their given name or their surname without any disrespect.
	
	
	Before I turn to the issues in the case, there is one pertinent observation I should make, that very much is present in this particular case. The case has been conducted in a most professional way by the learned Crown Prosecutor and of course counsel for the accused. It became apparent in the course of the giving of evidence, that various police had been officers-in-charge in relation to this matter, but had ceased their involvement for reasons I need not go into.
	
	
	It has to be fairly said that the case was very poorly investigated in a range of ways and it seems that a number of things that have occurred which have to my mind affected the quality of the Crown case could have been avoided if appropriate direction had been given to particular witnesses about care they should take in respect of the matter, or otherwise appropriate investigations that could be undertaken by them.
	
	
	A good example of that, putting aside any comments made about the supposed identification of the accused by Joel and John Shortland, is the issue of the young woman Shanaya Fitzpatrick-King, who I will refer to either as Shanaya or Ms Fitzpatrick, concerning her use of a golf club. It seems self evident to me that even preliminary inquiries at a very early stage would have established that a woman used a golf club that had been obtained from the Brearleys, either from them personally or from the boot of one of their two cars, who figure somewhat prominently in the evidence.
	
	
	There is no evidence from any police officer in the case. I understand from the evidence of the Brearleys that in fact they gave statements to police in this matter on 6 December 2012, that is two days after the event. I have not seen their statements, save for perhaps issues relating to refreshing their memory. But it became apparent when they were giving evidence before me, that one or other of them clearly accepted the fact ultimately that a golf club that was used in the attack upon Joel Shortland had come from one of their cars. I have no evidence before me as to what investigations were undertaken in an endeavour to find that golf club to, for example, conduct some sort of examination of it to determine whether any DNA profile could be obtained, fingerprints could be obtained or whatever.
	
	
	Perhaps it was a ‘no through road’ in the investigation of the matter. But it is an illustration, it seems to me, of a failure to properly investigate this matter. Bearing in mind clearly that John and Joel Shortland were injured, bearing in mind that there was clearly a police investigation in place as early or as late as 5 December 2012 and bearing in mind at that time, putting aside issue of the identification or recognition of particular people, the fundamental facts as to what had happened to John and Joel were known to the investigating authorities. The failure to properly investigate has created considerable difficulties for the prosecution in the conduct of this case.
	
	
	Another difficulty in the conduct of this case is the fact that the trial has come on almost three years after relevant events. On a number of occasions a number of witnesses have said that they could not recall particular events occurring. Perhaps they made statements closer to the event that might have filled the gap of their recollection in this trial. Some witnesses were either allowed to refresh their memories from their statements, in the sense of being led by the Crown which was a sensible course of action, or by being cross-examined upon previous statements. I do not know the reasons for the delay, but all the witnesses were put in a very difficult position in order to give to this Court a cogent and coherent and perhaps reliable account of relevant matters when they were called upon to remember events well after the events had occurred. Three years to my mind is an unacceptable delay. I appreciate it is no fault of the learned Crown or counsel for the accused or the accused themselves for that matter for all I know. But the situation is entirely unacceptable. It has infected the reliability of the evidence in the case to some extent.
	
	
	Another aspect of the case that concerns me is the fact that witnesses were permitted to talk amongst themselves about relevant matters, in good faith it would seem in some cases, and in an understandable way without warning. The fact that witnesses gave multiple statements was another difficulty in the case, giving an opportunity for people to build upon their recollection in circumstances. As I point out in my summary of the evidence Mr Coleman SC demonstrated through examining Joel Shortland that memory of relevant events would be clearer closer to the events in question.
	
	
	But then again this has become a common problem in criminal trials, where people give extensive statements, particularly to the police, and are called back many months later to give further statements, volunteering information that either should have been volunteered, or could have been volunteered when the first statement was obtained and in circumstances where there was always the risk that the further information is a result of some contaminated memory.
	


OUTLINE OF THE CROWN CASE AND THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL


	
	To summarise the Crown case as I can best do in a nutshell as the cases was conducted and also to perhaps reflect upon the defence case, although no evidence was given by the accused, the two “victims” as I may call them, John and Joel Shortland were brothers. John was older than Joel. Joel Shortland had a problem with two young men, who are identical twins, called “The Brearleys” who had a number of associates in their company on 4 December 2012. There was some exchange of insults between the Brearleys and Joel Shortland that afternoon or early evening and ultimately after Joel Shortland had thrown a bottle at one of the cars of the Brearleys, Joel Shortland, O’Connor, John Shortland, Melissa Smith and a man called Jacob Shortland, another brother, went to a BMX track, in Bathurst in the middle of a public park, and some conversations or a meeting occurred between Joel Shortland at least and the Brearleys and some other people.
	
	
	When Joel Shortland left the BMX track, being driven away by Fergus O’Connor, O’Connor most unwisely, in my view, manoeuvred his car in a manner which was interpreted as intimidating some of the people there. It was the catalyst for subsequent events and although Mr Fergus O’Connor was a quietly spoken witness, it is quite clear on the evidence that he bears at least some responsibility for what subsequently happened.
	
	
	Because after that the group that had been at the BMX track associated with the Brearleys, including as I have concluded the two accused, went to George Street Bathurst and there was a confrontation near the corner of Piper and George Street, some few blocks from this Court House, an area that I have had to walk past and through at least two or three dozen times in the last week and a half as I am staying nearby.
	
	
	The confrontation involved a man armed with a sword, another man or men, one possibly armed with a knife, and Ms Fitzpatrick armed with a golf club confronting the Shortlands, John Shortland was struck a number of times with the sword and in defending his head with his forearm had his forearm struck twice causing both lacerations and a compound fracture to his arm. Joel Shortland intervened to protect his brother and in fact knocked the first person with the sword down. I will call that person the ‘first’ swordsman. A second person intervened, picked up the sword (‘the second swordsman’) and he struck Joel Shortland a number of times causing the wounds the subject of counts 3 and 4. The acts constituting counts 1 and 2, in my view were completed before the acts constituting counts 3 and 4 were committed not withstanding some evidence to the contrary. The assailants ran away.
	
	
	Ultimately Ms Fitzpatrick apparently was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On the basis of the Crown case in this matter why she was not deemed to be part of the same joint criminal enterprise that ZF and AJH were concerned with is a mystifying question. Maybe it reflects matters that I have ultimately concluded in relation to the case. Again this is no criticism of the Crown or the DPP for that matter. It would seem that she was prosecuted summarily before the matter ever came to the attention of the learned Director.
	
	
	In any event she pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and came to this Court ultimately to give evidence as a witness who had not provided a proof of evidence but apparently provided some information to a police officer well after the event. Another unsatisfactory situation. It is quite unsatisfactory in my view for police to be going off and interviewing potentially vital witnesses and taking “bullet point” summaries of what they say. It puts the Crown in an impossible position. The later it is done, of course, the less satisfactory it is. She had a conference with the Crown before she gave evidence, but I had to conduct a Basha inquiry to ascertain what evidence she would give.
	
	
	In the summary of this case I will refer to the ‘Shortland group’ if I may call it that, which will be Joel, John, Melissa and Fergus. I will refer to the ‘Brearley group’ which will include the twins and a number of other witnesses who I will identify and I will refer sometimes to the ‘Bettles group’. I include within that Shanaya Fitzpatrick and the two accused.
	
	
	I should also say as a preliminary point, to better understand the detail of the evidence that I address, that it seemed to be without dispute that ZF, AJH and JM  at various times are known by the name Bettles. Nobody bothered to assist me with any information of a legal or factual character in relation to the basis for that to be. But the case proceeded on that assumption because instead of having a jury trial as I told I would have after the call-over of the Bathurst list last Thursday week, a fortnight ago, I was confronted at the last moment with an application for trial by Judge alone in circumstances where, given the fact the Crown consented to the application, subject to not granting leave for the late application to be pursued, I was bound to conduct a trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	The basis of that application, I do not mean this in any unkindness of ZF or AJH and I certainly have ignored it for the purposes of the fact finding in this matter as their characters are not in issue, was evidence to suggest that the name 'Bettles' was well known in the Bathurst area for a range of reasons. Most of those reasons had nothing to do with these two accused, I hasten to say. The ‘family’ was alleged as having involvement in criminal activity in Bathurst. Thus, it was submitted a fair trial could not be obtained with a local jury.
	
	
	I pointed out to learned counsel for AJH, Mr Chhabra, who led the charge in relation to this application, that it seemed to me that the matters to which he referred were properly matters to be considered in determining whether there should be a change of venue, which should have been attended to many, many months before. It turned out, as I understood although it was not expressly stated at the time, that if it transpired that of the 43 members of the panel we had available to us 20 put up their hands to say that they had heard the name Bettles in one way or another I would have been left with the position of not having enough jurors in the panel and would have been confronted with the reality that I would need to grant a trial by Judge alone.
	
	
	Something has got to be done about s 132 and 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to give trial Judges greater discretion to determine whether a trial should be a trial by Judge alone, even where the parties consent. Our criminal justice system has proceeded for hundreds of years on the basis that when citizens are charged with serious criminal offences, the accused is entitled to a trial by Judge and jury, the Judge being the Judge of the law, separated from the constitutional tribunal of fact, the jury, and those separate functions being recognised by the trial Judge and the jury and the parties throughout the trial.
	
	
	I appreciate the legislation provides some discretion to a Judge if the parties do not agree and the discretion not to grant leave should an application, such as the one that confronted me, be made on the day of the trial. Bearing in mind the legislation ostensibly provides for at least 28 days notice. It seems with respect that not to grant leave where the parties agree would be ultimately an improper exercise of discretion. The leave issue really to my mind is more concerned with the question of convenience to the parties, convenience to the Court and other matters. The legislature should address the question of giving a Judge in all circumstances some residual discretion to deal with the matter, even if it involved such as in this, ordering a change of venue. This was to my mind, a pure jury case in many respects and should have been properly considered by a jury.
	


LEGAL PRINCIPLES


	
	I turn now to the legal principles to be applied. It is a trial by Judge alone, according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as I have pointed out. It requires the Judge in his or her judgment not just to state the principles of law which have been applied, but the finding of facts that were made and to expose what is described “the reasoning process” justifying the findings of fact and ultimately the verdict or verdicts returned.
	
	
	All principles of law which are relevant and are required to be applied and considered, should be identified in the judgment, including any necessary warnings that the trial Judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence. Where particular warnings are applied, a Judge must state where appropriate, the relevant warnings and the consequences of them, and why a particular verdict has been reached. This was so held by the High Court in Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR at 250, a judgment of the High Court arising from a judgment of a Judge of my Court, the late Judge Luland QC.
	
	
	So far as the onus and standard of proof is concerned, the prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of the accused. That burden or onus rests upon the prosecution in relation to all matters requiring proof by the prosecution. The prosecution is required to prove each and all essential ingredients or elements, sometimes referred to as essential facts, going to the proof of relevant ingredients or elements. The prosecution is of course not required to prove every fact in the case and there may be in a particular case, as is here, many conflicts in relation to facts in the case, but ultimately the Crown by reference to the evidence must establish all relevant essential ingredients germane to the proof of guilt of an accused person in respect of a particular charge.
	
	
	The accused bears no onus of proof in respect of matters requiring proof by the prosecution. An accused person is presumed to be innocent of any charge or charges, brought against him until such time as that presumption is displaced by the Crown proving his guilt. Proof of guilt requires proof of the essential ingredients or elements beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Court has a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused in respect of a matter requiring proof by the Crown, the Court is obliged to return a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	The words “beyond reasonable doubt” are to be given their ordinary English meaning. Reasonable doubt is sometimes referred to in a particular case as being present when there is a reasonable possibility that a circumstance or situation inconsistent with guilt emerges from the evidence. This is a case as I will refer to later, where the issue of drawing inferences to establish guilt, or relying upon a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence matters, are central to the way in which the Crown seeks to prove its case.
	
	
	Furthermore the cases against each of the accused, even though in this case there are allegations of being in company, or alternatively, is argued by the Crown that they were involved in a joint criminal enterprise particularly in relation to counts 1 and 3, are matters requiring proof by the Crown. There is of course in the case much common evidence in the cases against each of the accused. But a Court must be astute to ensure that evidence that is only admissible in relation to one accused is not used in relation to the issue of whether another accused is guilty or not of a particular crime alleged against him.
	
	
	I also bear in mind that there are alternative counts pleaded. I am, firstly, in respect of count 1, to consider that if I determine that a particular accused is not guilty of that count, I turn to the alternative count. I then turn to count 2, and determine whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of that count. And then give separate consideration to the relevant evidence in relation to count 3. If I find one or other of the accused not guilty of count 3, I turn to the relevant alternative count for that accused. Count 5 requires separate consideration, although with much common evidence to the other counts.
	
	
	If I may deal with the elements of the charges they are required to be set out in the judgment. Here there is no issue in relation to the elements of the charges in this matter. The law is well settled in respect of each of the charges and the directions I give myself are in accordance with the Trials Bench Book.
	
	
	Count 1, contains these essential elements, that the relevant accused caused grievous bodily harm to John Shortland, and secondly, did so with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The relevant intent must exist at the time of the infliction of the grievous bodily harm. The Crown must prove in relation to each accused that the relevant act that it relies upon was a voluntary act. The Crown must prove, of course, that the relevant accused, either personally or as part of a “joint criminal enterprise”, caused grievous bodily harm to John Shortland. With regard to the word ‘cause’ that means simply to inflict or bring about by voluntary act. ‘Grievous bodily harm’ means really serious bodily harm. There is no dispute in this case, that the compound fracture to the arm, associated with the wounding, was grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	With the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, the prosecution must prove that the relevant accused acted with the relevant intent, subject of course to application of the joint criminal enterprise direction I will outline soon, in that it was an event that the particular accused wished or wanted to cause. That is the relevant accused intended in the way that that word is ordinarily understood to cause really serious bodily harm to John Shortland. Intention is concerned of course with the state of mind of the particular accused at the time of the relevant infliction of grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	In relation to the alternative count the prosecution must prove the causing of grievous bodily harm, secondly, that each of the accused were in company with each other, and thirdly, that each of the accused in company were reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to John Shortland.
	
	
	I do not need to deal with the issue of causing grievous bodily harm. The expression ‘in company’ is concerned with an allegation that he accused have committed the offence jointly with one another and/or with others and that the relevant accused was immediately present for the purposes of committing the offence of causing grievous bodily harm. He must relevantly intentionally participate by assisting or encouraging a particular person said to be inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the complainant in the manner pleaded in respect of count 2. The presence of more than one person, including the accused, and the ability of those people present to assist in the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the complainant if called upon, must be known to the relevant complainant.
	
	
	In relation to that direction I give myself, it is the same direction to be given in respect of count 4, save for the fact that what is required to be established in count 4 is the relevant presence for the intention of assisting or encouraging persons to ‘wound’ the relevant complainant.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of recklessness in order to establish that a particular accused was reckless, the prosecution must prove that the relevant accused, in conjunction with of course the joint criminal enterprise directions, foresaw the possibility of actual bodily harm being inflicted, but nevertheless participated in the events giving rise to the injuries caused. Actual bodily harm means real bodily harm. They are words to be given their ordinary meaning and can include any hurt or injury that interferes with health or comfort. It need not be permanent but it must be more than trifling or transient.
	
	
	With regard to count 3, the relevant elements to be proved against each of the accused that they did wound Joel Shortland, secondly with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. ‘Wound’ is an injury involving the breaking or cutting of both exterior, that is the epidermis or outer layer of the skin, and the interior dermis layer of the skin. There is no dispute in this case that Joel suffered relevant wounds. With regard to the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, that has of course the same meaning as it does in relation to count 1.
	
	
	In relation to count 4, the relevant elements in respect of that matter, require proof of a wounding of Joel Shortland, done so, in company and that each of the accused was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to Joel Shortland. I have already given a definition for wounding, the issue of in company is, save for reference to wounding rather than grievous bodily harm, the same as for count 1, and being reckless as to whether each of the accused caused actual bodily harm has the same meaning of course as it does in respect of count 2, relating to John Shortland.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of affray, in order to establish count 5, the prosecution must prove that a particular accused, each or in company with each other, used or threatened actual violence against John and Joel Shortland. That each caused a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety, and intended to use or threaten violence or was aware that his conduct maybe violent, or threaten violence. The words ‘in company’ so far as they may pertain to the case in question have the same meaning as I have earlier identified.
	
	
	In relation to the use and or threat of unlawful violence against the two complainants, where two or more persons use or threaten unlawful violence, the conduct of those persons must be taken together and considered for the purposes of determining whether this element has been established. In relation to the second element I identified, I am concerned there with whether objectively a person of reasonable firmness, who was present at the scene, would fear for his or her personal safety. In the circumstances as I find them of the altercation, as the Crown alleges between the two accused and others, and the Shortland brothers. No person of reasonable firmness need actually be or likely to be present at the scene.
	
	
	In relation to this count the prosecution has to establish that the relevant accused intended, that is had the state of mind that he wanted or was endeavouring to use or threaten unlawful violence, or understood that his conduct may be violent or threatened violence.
	
	
	In relation to each count, where it arises on the evidence, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not act in self defence. Of course no submissions were put to me in relation to the issue of self defence. It realistically was not an issue in the case. In one sense it had a potential, bearing in mind the case was really fought on identity, to arise in relation to the second swordsman in the sense that on the Crown’s own case the second swordsman became armed after Joel Shortland had effectively disabled the first swordsman. But one would have thought that even if raised it could not realistically be considered or would be easily proven not to exist, having regard to the circumstances of the confrontation, the alleged violence used and the reasonableness of any actions of the second swordsman in the context of the case.
	
	
	I turn now to the issue of joint criminal enterprise, which is very much central to this case in respect of counts 1 and 3 and of course, is of some significance in one sense to a consideration of the alternative counts in the context of the pleading that the offences were committed “in company”.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of joint criminal enterprise, the law is that where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, that is an agreement to carry out a particular criminal activity, each is held to be criminally responsible for the acts of another participant in carrying out that enterprise or activity, this is so regardless of the particular role played in that enterprise by any particular participant. The Crown must establish both the existence of a joint criminal enterprise and participation in it by the accused. A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or an arrangement amounting to an agreement between them, that they will commit a crime. The agreement need not be expressed in words and its existence maybe inferred from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence that are found proved on the evidence.
	
	
	The agreement need not have been reached at any particular point of time before the crime is committed provided that at the time of the commission of the crime the participants have agreed that the crime should be committed by anyone of them. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish that at some point in time an agreement has been reached between them, that the crime should be committed. For example, if two people at the very same time are punching a third person, the tribunal of fact could infer or conclude that they have agreed to assault that person. It does not matter whether the agreed crime is committed by only one or some of the participants in the joint criminal enterprise, or whether they all played an active role in committing that crime. All of the participants in the enterprise are equally guilty of committing the crime regardless of the actual part played by each in its commission.
	
	
	The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the crime which was the subject of joint agreement was in fact committed. It therefore must prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the essential facts or ingredients which make up the crime was committed, regardless of who actually committed them. I have already outlined the relevant ingredients of the particular counts specifically concerned with joint criminal enterprise. Further, in respect of a particular accused, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that he or she was a participant in the commission of the crime as part of the joint criminal enterprise with one or more persons.
	
	
	There are of course other aspects to be taken into account in relation to the issue of joint criminal enterprise. Joint criminal enterprise or joint criminal liability, may be established by the Crown in different ways. It may be established where the crime charged is the very crime that each of the participants agreed to commit. For example in a very clear cut case, where two men go with an agreement to kill another man unlawfully, one might think that that is clear evidence, if established, of an agreement to commit the crime of murder or manslaughter. That is the specific crime that the men were intending. Secondly, it may be so where the crime committed fell within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise agreed upon as a possible incident in carrying out the offence the subject of the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	A third matter where joint criminal enterprise may arise but not here, is where the crime committed was one that the accused foresaw might have been committed during the commission of the joint criminal enterprise, although the crime was outside the scope of the joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Some other matters of a legal nature I need to take into account are as follows. The accused did not give evidence. I direct myself as I am required to do, that each accused bears no onus of proof, each of the accused is presumed to be innocent, until such time as his or her guilt is proven by the Crown. I cannot draw any inference adverse to either of the accused because each accused exercised his right to silence in Court. I cannot interpret it in anyway as being an acknowledgment on his part of the accuracy, veracity or strength of the Crown case. And I cannot be tempted to reason that the accused has remained silent in Court because he is guilty. Such reasoning is prohibited and I must not engage in it. Such a process or means of reasoning is entirely inconsistent with the burden of proof resting upon the prosecution. I cannot speculate as to why the accused has not given evidence. Furthermore, I must not treat the accused election not to give evidence, as being capable of filling any gaps in the Crown case that I may perceive to exist.
	
	
	In relation to this case I have referred to the issue of inferences. In relation to this case, as I understand the way it is argued, firstly, the Crown would argue and has argued of course, that the participation of each of the accused is established by a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence, from which a conclusion or inference maybe drawn that the identify of a particular accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt. That will require me to give a direction to myself in respect of circumstantial evidence where it is to be considered in conjunction with direct evidence.
	
	
	It seems to me and again, this is a legal issue not debated at great length, but on my understanding of the case that in respect of one aspect of the case, that is the issue of the alleged joint criminal enterprise, the Court in conjunction with the reliance upon circumstantial evidence is required to consider the matter from the standpoint of whether in fact an inference of agreement, such is required to be established by the Crown has been established. The directions given in respect of inferences and circumstantial evidence where those two concepts are separate in a legal sense are very much the same.
	
	
	The tribunal of fact is entitled to draw inferences or conclusions from other facts established from the evidence, it is something we do every day. I cannot draw an inference or conclusion unless it is a reasonable inference that can be rationally drawn from the evidence I accept. I must be careful about drawing inferences, especially where the inference is about guilt, or the proof of an element or essential ingredient of the charge, when drawing a conclusion about guilt, or existence of an element required to be proven by the prosecution, that is an inference or conclusion adverse to the relevant accused, I cannot draw that inference unless it is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. There may be a number of inferences that can be reasonably drawn, some adverse to the accused, some not adverse to the accused. In other words, some consistent with guilt, some inconsistent with guilt, or consistent with the existence of a particular element of the offence, or not consistent with a particular element of the offence, in such a situation I cannot draw the inference adverse to the accused, unless I am satisfied of two things.
	
	
	Firstly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all the inferences favourable to the particular accused can be excluded, and secondly, the only inference that can be drawn beyond a reasonable doubt is the one adverse to the accused that is consistent with guilt. Unless I reach the point where I am so satisfied I cannot find that the relevant element or essential ingredient or guilt has been made out and therefore the accused must be found not guilty. But in circumstances where of course the proof of guilt is dependent upon drawing a relevant inference, so long as there remains an inference reasonably open that is favourable to an accused person that cannot be excluded beyond reasonable doubt, I must find the charge not made out and the accused must be found not guilty. Inferences are particularly relevant here to establishing matters concerning the intention and/or state of mind of each accused or the existence of a particular agreement to commit a crime.
	
	
	In this case the Crown relies upon, particularly in respect of the issue of identity, a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence. In relation to the circumstantial evidence the Crown seeks to draw from basic facts it says exist, other facts that are circumstances pointing towards guilt. For example, from the fact that the Crown would allege that ZF was present at the BMX track, it submits I should draw an inference that ZF was moved by the conduct of Mr O’Connor in his vehicle, to become concerned to chase the ‘Shortland group’ and ultimately confront them at the place of relevant events near the corner of Piper and George Street. The Crown used the expression motive. It might so described.
	
	
	Circumstantial evidence where it is relied upon by the Crown can be stronger than direct evidence, as has been demonstrated in this case. Some direct evidence can be of very dubious quality, including identification evidence. However, in a case involving direct and circumstantial evidence, no particular circumstantial matter can prove the guilt of the accused. Where the Crown’s case depends either wholly or partly in circumstantial evidence, then I am asked to reason in a staged approached the Crown asks me to find certain basic facts established from the evidence, these facts do not have to be established beyond reasonable doubt, save for one matter in this case, taken by themselves standing alone they cannot prove the guilt of the accused and then I am required to draw the relevant inferences or conclusions.
	
	
	As I said a case based on circumstantial evidence maybe just as convincing and reliable as any case based on direct evidence. This will depend on a range of considerations including the nature of the basic facts concluded - looked at as a whole not individually or in isolation - and whether all the evidence leads to the avoidable conclusion that the Crown has established the guilt of the accused. Thus, I am required to determine basic facts and then determine whether the inferences to be drawn are reasonable ones and whether ultimately they are the only reasonable and rational conclusions that can be drawn excluding any conclusions inconsistent with guilt.
	
	
	There is one matter averted to in the submissions of Mr Coleman that I concede. It seems to me, whether it is to be seen only as “direct evidence” or in someway relevant in a circumstantial evidence way and/or drawing inferences, bearing in mind the witness herself does not give any direct evidence of any specific conduct of ZF and AJH, there is evidence from a source other than the Shortland group directly consistent with the allegations brought by Joel and John Shortland. This is the evidence of Ms Fitzpatrick of the presence of the two accused ZF and AJH with her in the car that went to George Street and their presence with her at the time of approaching the Shortland brothers. I accept the submission of Mr Coleman that her evidence in that regard must be established beyond reasonable doubt. As I will indicate later I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence having regard to the totality of the evidence and the quality of the evidence given by that witness.
	
	
	In respect of this matter it is worthy to point out some aspects of the case. The direct evidence the Crown identifies is of course of the evidence of if I may call it, them again, the Shortland group of the circumstances of the attack upon Joel and John Shortland.
	
	
	There is the evidence of their claimed identification of relevant participants. There is the evidence of the observations of the injuries relevant to establishing wounding and grievous bodily harm. There is direct evidence of the conduct of the car driven by Fergus O’Connor and the events at the BMX track. There is direct evidence of course from other people. O’Connor and the ‘Brearley group’ saw a group of people approaching where the Shortlands were. Some people observed with various weapons in the manner I will outline shortly.
	
	
	When I refer to the issue of identification evidence, I bear in mind these fundamental matters which I will need to reiterate. With the exception of Joel Shortland, amongst the Shortland group none of the group knew any of the people who were alleged to be involved in the attack upon Joel and John Shortland. Joel Shortland had some familiarity with the man known as JM, the former accused. Their association was brief and transient, although I accept his evidence in general terms that he had a familiarity with him. It could be fairly said that ultimately Joel Shortland’s evidence as to what JM did could be regarded ‘technically’ as recognition evidence.
	
	
	However Joel Shortland did not know anybody else in the group, save for of course Shanaya Fitzpatrick with whom he was a Facebook friend but apparently with whom he had little other contact. She knew him as her evidence revealed. I am putting aside the issue of Shanaya Fitzpatrick’s ‘identification’ by him if I could call it that for the moment. There is no dispute that Shanaya Fitzpatrick was not only identified by members of the Shortland group. There is no dispute obviously from her evidence and what she admits that she did, that that identification was accurate, reliable and honest.
	
	
	However in relation to Joel Shortland, apart from recognition of JM , the Crown as I would have understood it would have relied upon the totality of the evidence to amount to a “identification” of the other two people, the two accused now here, in circumstances where those people were not known to Joel Shortland.
	
	
	Ultimately, as a matter of logic and common sense and understanding of matters by reference to the warnings I give myself, I cannot be satisfied notwithstanding the self satisfaction of particular people, and I do not mean this unkindly of Joel and John Shortland or Ms Smith, that relevant people have been “identified” in a manner that would satisfy any court beyond reasonable doubt that the identities have been established. Putting aside the issue of recognition of JM, it seems to me that as best it can be quantified is that by reference to the claimed ‘identification’ and the process by which that identification came about, the Crown case is one where in reality what the witnesses are saying, making allowance for all the limitations and restrictions upon the reliability of their accounts, is that AJH is a person “similar” to the person that has been identified, at least in some evidence, as the second swordsman and ZF is “similar to” the person identified as the first swordsman.
	
	
	I hasten to say again that is not what they say in their evidence in this Court but for reasons that I will outline I cannot accept the “identification” of the accused as such having regard to the fact that they were strangers to all and sundry.
	
	
	This brings me back to what I see in summary from both the Crown’s submissions and my analysis of the matter, the circumstances that have to be considered in conjunction with the direct evidence, bearing in mind I accept that the supposed identification and/or recognition is part of the Crown’s direct evidence case.
	
	
	First of all, the similarity of people is a circumstance to be taken into account. Secondly the supposed motive, particularly the threat made to ZF and Ms Fitzpatrick as she described it by the movement of O’Connor’s car, is a circumstance to be taken into account. Thirdly, there is the issue of the descriptions given by the witnesses, unsatisfactory as they are and as contradictory as they are. Fourthly, there is intimately involved bound up with the claimed motive the evidence of presence of the accused at the scene at the BMX track where the meeting took place between Joel Shortland and others.
	
	
	Another circumstance relied upon by the Crown, if not available as an admission against interest, are the statements of attackers either before or after the relevant events in which words were said and I am paraphrasing the detail of the language, “Don’t mess with the Bettles”. Or references to “the Bettles” as having been responsible for what happened or being present in order to confront the Shortlands. I will deal with the detail of that evidence later. I hasten to say of course evidence of an admission if established would be direct evidence. I will indicate shortly when I deal with the legal character of the matter that I could not be satisfied of a relevant admission being made by either of the accused on the basis of the evidence in this case as to the statements allegedly made before or after the relevant events.
	
	
	Another piece of circumstantial evidence of significance is the location of the injuries and the character of the injuries insofar as inferences may be drawn about the intention of a particular person. I hasten to say that the issue of inferences arises in relation to establishing intention as it relates to an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. These matters overlap.
	
	
	This brings me to the issue of identification evidence, both by reference to s 116 Evidence Act and 165 Evidence Act and the circumstances of this case. Having been asked by Mr Chhabra and Mr Coleman to give myself a ‘s 165( Evidence Act)’ direction I am required to direct myself concerning the reliability of the supposed identification evidence and consider matters that may render that evidence unreliable. I am also required to warn myself of the dangers of acting upon identification evidence where it is sought to be established. This is an important direction because it is well known, as juries are told all the time, that injustices have occurred from the failure to properly identify or accurately identify particular persons as having committed crimes.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to deal with one other aspect of the matter that came into sharper focus during the course of this trial. One of the matters that arose in the course of the examination of the Shortlands and to a lesser extent Ms Smith was the fact that certain matters were added to the recollection of those witnesses over a period of time, moving inexorably to conclusions the witnesses reached about the actions of particular people or the identity of particular people.
	
	
	The matter was discussed between myself and the learned Crown Prosecutor during the course of Ms Smith’s evidence in light of a particular answer Ms Smith gave to a question asked of her in cross-examination. The issue arose of course in relation to whether memory is reliable and circumstances in which people will believe that they can remember something happening, when in fact there are reasons for them to be mistaken about happened in their memory, or where an initial memory has been transplanted by another memory caused by the intervention of a third party providing further information. The example of that, that brings sharp focus to a consideration of the issue, was the recent statement by the Honourable Peter Garrett, former Federal Member of Parliament, that an allegation in a book that was published that he had received a sum of cash in an envelope from a representative of the Hotels Association or the Clubs Industry was, in fact, what he described as a “mis-memory”.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to point out that in the interview which was on national television within the last week, Mr Garrett specifically said that he had a memory at one point of being given a sum of cash in an envelope. He put that in his book which he not only wrote but had been typecast or set in type. Then after it had been placed in his book, ready for publication or already published I do not know, he spoke to one of his staffers. That staffer gave him certain information which caused him to doubt the memory that he had originally had. In fact not only did he doubt it but he changed his memory to allege that in fact it was not a sum of cash it was a cheque and it was not a bribe, nor could be construed as a bribe, but it was a legitimate campaign donation.
	
	
	There we have a man of intelligence rationally considering the matter and committing it to writing. How many drafts he wrote of that particular part of his book we do not know. The book was printed. That was his memory until he spoke to a third person and then he changed his memory of what had occurred most significantly. This type of situation is very much at the heart at the need for caution in considering the supposed ‘identification’ of the two accused in this matter.
	
	
	A witness of course may be honest but that does not necessarily mean the witness will give reliable evidence. Because a witness who gives evidence of identification honestly and sincerely believes that his evidence is correct, that evidence can be quite impressive, even persuasive. So even if I thought a witness was entirely honest in the evidence that he or she gave in relation to identification I must approach the task of assessing the reliability of that evidence with special caution.
	
	
	Special caution is necessary before accepting identification evidence because of a possibility that a witness may be mistaken in their identification of a person accused of a crime. The experience that criminal courts over the years both here in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that identification evidence may turn out to be unreliable. There have been some notorious cases over the years in which evidence of identification has been demonstrated to be wrong after innocent people have been convicted, in some cases executed. I must be careful to consider the circumstances in which a witness made observation of a person, their prior familiarity or not with that person and the circumstances in which the person came to conclude that a particular person was identified as having committed a particular act.
	
	
	There are a number of matters I am required to take into account in relation to the matter. Summarising them now, although the Bench Book sets them out in greater detail , whether a person identified was a stranger and that seems to be a common aspect of the matter so far as these accused are concerned. The opportunity to make observation of a person. It is clear relevant events happened very quickly and suddenly and were no doubt very shocking to both the “victims” and those looking on. The issue of focussing attention. Whether a witness was distracted or the like is another matter and it is quite clear that there were various events occurring, sometimes at the same time that would rightly distract people. I am reminded of Ms Smith’s evidence of walking away, talking on a mobile phone and not seeing relevant events occurring in relation to Joel Shortland. Perhaps the only witness who might be said in one way to have not been particularly distracted, beyond telling her to move away, was O’Connor. But of course his account of what happened does not seem to fit in very neatly with the accounts of what Joel Shortland and John Shortland saw.
	
	
	I have regard to the fact that this happened at night. There was street lighting available but I am mindful of the fact that the people at the other end of the block, if I can call them the Brearley group, were looking down the street in circumstances where the lighting available to them might not have been the same as the lighting available to the people close to the action. I bear in mind of course that what was the light available was not even light, but street lighting.
	
	
	There are matters concerning any distinctive features of people including tattoos, a matter about which I will comment shortly as it affects JM, any special reason for remembering the person, whether a person was under stress or pressure at the time, whether a person was trying to identify someone of the same “racial background” with which they may or may not have had familiarity. I have got to have regard to the descriptions that a particular person who claims to identify someone has given and compare that to reliable evidence of description that can be identified. One of the problems in relation to the description evidence in this case, as I will point out later, is that not only are the descriptions all over the place and in some places contradictory, but there is no consistent evidence of any description, if I could call it consistent (it may be better expressed as objective evidence of description) of either of the accused such as to provide some sort of template or guidepost or yard stick for assessing the descriptions that were made. I do not have any description from anybody that can be said to be an objective, considered description of clothing. Often when a person is arrested shortly after the event police officers will make observation, in fact even take photographs of a suspect and his or her clothing. Their appearance can be established quite independently. But in this case there is no such evidence.
	
	
	There is also the question of how the identification came about which is a critical matter in this case. How long it took to identify a person, how long after the relevant events and the like that this occurred.
	
	
	Of course the same problems can arise in relation to evidence of recognition where more than one witness has identified an accused person. This is a matter I can take into account in determining how strong the evidence is but that does not mean necessarily that there is less chance that a mistake has been made. Two or more honest witnesses can be just as mistaken as one, even if they reach the conclusion of identification quite independently of each other. But as the evidence unfolded of course that was not the case in this matter.
	


THE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL


	
	In relation to the evidence largely from Joel Shortland, dealing with that in some little detail at this point to summarise matters largely not in dispute, on the afternoon of 4 December 2012 Joel Shortland was at a flat at 110 George Street, Bathurst. It was a ground floor flat apparently occupied by John Shortland and his older brother. At the time of relevant events as I understood the evidence Joel Shortland was seventeen years of age. His brother John was twenty-two years of age. Ms Smith was approximately two years older. John and Joel Shortland had at least two other brothers Jacob and Jed, a sister Jessie and some younger half siblings. There may have been other siblings, they did not figure in the evidence.
	
	
	John Shortland’s girlfriend was Melissa Smith. Jessie Shortland’s boyfriend was Fergus O’Connor. He was a man at the relevant time in his twenties. Although Jacob Shortland was present at the BMX track and apparently was present at or near the events giving rise to the charges, he did not give evidence.
	
	
	Joel Shortland had previously ‘problems’ it would seem, or they had had problems with him it is not abundantly clear, with the Brearley twins. Those two brothers drove more or less identical modelled Ford vehicles, one silver and one black or dark blue. Associated with the Brearleys were a number of people including people who gave evidence in this trial. The people who gave evidence in this trial were Brandon Pringle, otherwise known as Brandon Hahn, who was known to Joel Shortland and in fact was apparently friendly with them for one reason or another. Cameron Southwell was another associate of the Brearleys who gave evidence.
	
	
	Sometime before sunset on 4 December the Brearleys apparently were just driving aimlessly around Bathurst in their cars and yelled some abuse towards Joel when he was in John’s flat, which was heard by Mr O’Connor. This led to Mr O’Connor going out in a motor vehicle and trying to find them which led to him saying: although he was very coy about the matter, he “noticed” him throwing a glass bottle at one of the cars of the Brearleys. Joel was contacted in due course and arrangements were made for them to meet at what was described as the BMX track. I have a Google map of Bathurst. The BMX track as I understand it is part of a complex of parks and sporting fields on the other side of the Macquarie River from the CBD.
	
	
	Joel Shortland went over there to meet the Brearleys and was driven there by Fergus O’Connor in his Holden utility which was described respectively as a Rodeo or Colorado. They may be the same model, it does not matter. They were joined at the BMX track by John Shortland, Melissa and Jacob in a vehicle that as I understand it belonged to John, of a similar character but different make. There was a meeting between Joel and at least the Brearleys. The numbers of people that were not part of the Shortland group that were present varied. Some estimates of ten and more were given and there were at least as I understand it two motor vehicles there, the Brearley’s vehicle and a silver Astra.
	
	
	It is alleged that the two accused were associated with the silver Holden Astra in the context of evidence from which an inference could be drawn, that the occupants of the silver Astra were the people who later confronted the Brearleys. I am mindful of the fact that Ms Fitzpatrick, who admits to being at the BMX track although apparently with no real interest in the events, said she travelled to George Street to confront the Shortlands in a blue car, the model of which he does not know.
	
	
	The silver car was seen there by a number of people including Southwell and Hahn. There was also reference in the evidence to a green Lancer, being present or associated with the Brearleys. Not much turns upon this.
	
	
	Joel Shortland’s evidence was that there were three or four cars there, quite a number of people, perhaps more than were mentioned by the Brearleys. There is evidence from Ms Fitzpatrick, which I accept, that she came to be at the BMX track because she understood, although from what I understood of her evidence it was not abundantly clear as she did not receive the phone call, that the Brearleys were in some way fearful for their safety, having regard to the meeting at the BMX track. It is interesting that Joel Shortland went over to the BMX track not only accompanied by Mr O’Connor, but was joined shortly after by his brothers John and Jacob, John being considerably older than any of the other people involved on the Brearley side as I understand it. She used the expression that the Brearleys were “distressed”.
	
	
	I hasten to say when they gave evidence the Brearleys seemed to downplay the matter but for various reasons I do not believe that they were truthful witnesses. There are important matters that they did not disclose in their evidence, because it appears to me there is direct evidence to suggest that they knew the “Bettles” group, although they denied knowing who the people were that they said pursued the Shortlands after Mr O’Connor’s conduct of his vehicle.
	
	
	When Mr O’Connor drove away his movement of the vehicle apparently on various views of the evidence threatened people that were nearby. The way the Brearleys gave evidence it would seem that the group with Shanaya Fitzpatrick were people that they did not know and really gave no explanation for their presence. It seemed strange when I look at the photographs that in a darkened field the Brearleys would be there and there would be another car parked almost alongside for no reason according to the Brearleys. That just does not make any sense at all.
	
	
	The Crown case is that ZF was threatened by Mr O’Connor’s vehicle and that in high dudgeon, angry at what O’Connor had done, ZF  accompanied by AJH and JM and perhaps another male drove off with Shanaya Fitzpatrick and chased the Shortlands back to the residence at George Street where the Shortland vehicles were parked and picked a fight with them.
	
	
	The Shortland group returned to outside 110 George Street where John lived. They were standing on the footpath apparently talking to one another not far from the intersection of Piper Street and George Street and the intersection itself was well lit, but the lighting further down the street was not very good. Ms Smith had started to leave the group to walk to the flat which was on the ground floor by walking up what I understand to be a grass embankment, apparently to prepare a meal.
	
	
	At this stage to the north, bearing in mind George Street runs north-south, of where the Shortlands parked, a number of cars pulled up including the Brearleys car and the silver car earlier referred to. Ms Fitzpatrick called it a “blue” car. The distance they are away is not entirely clear, but I accept on the evidence that the other cars parked almost a block away from where the Shortland cars were parked and it would seem the relevant silver car and/or dark blue car, as Ms Fitzpatrick described, was parked closer to the Shortlands than the Brearleys’ cars. There may have been another car there.
	
	
	Mr John Shortland referred to the cars pulling up about twenty-five metres away but nobody supports that view. In any event it does not fit in with description of the physical relationship of cars, one to the other.
	
	
	The Crown case was, on differing versions of the evidence, that a group of people got out of the cars parked down the street or up the street and a group of up to six people approached on foot led by one person who had something behind his back. The Crown case was this was the person carrying the sword and Ms Fitzpatrick was carrying a golf club. The primary weapons observed by the majority of witnesses were a sword, described as a Samurai sword by most witnesses and the golf club, although some witnesses referred to the possibility of one person having a knife or the fact that one person did have a knife. There is no definitive evidence as to who had the knife except perhaps a third man other than the second swordsman. There is no evidence that the second swordsman as I have earlier described him carried a weapon into the affray.
	
	
	Of course as one would expect there are differing versions of what then ensued. There are different versions within the Shortland group let alone from the perspective of the people further away who clearly could not see as much as the Shortland group.
	
	
	There are however two fundamental assertions made by the eye witnesses at close range that is common in the evidence. Firstly, that the first swordsman struck John Shortland either on the body or the neck or the head and then on the right forearm as he sought to defend himself by holding his forearm up, causing the grievous bodily harm pleaded in counts one and two.
	
	
	There is some minor dispute, if I might call it that, within the Shortland group as to whether Joel Shortland was struck first. Joel Shortland said he intervened. He punched the person who I described as the first swordsman and knocked him to the ground. The evidence is clear on the Shortland side that the first person played no further role in proceedings. Whether he was knocked unconscious or simply disabled or knocked to the ground I do not know.
	
	
	A second person, who on the evidence as I understand it was unarmed, picked up the sword and then struck Joel with the sword, causing wounds to him. Joel Shortland says that the first swordsman had also struck him with a sword. I am not satisfied of that matter beyond reasonable doubt because there are not consistent accounts that happened form the ‘Shortland‘ group who gave evidence.
	
	
	Joel’s version also was that a third person came up towards him and had made gestures with his hands consistent with what I understood to be a stabbing motion, although he did not see a knife. On the Crown case it was that this person was the person who was seen with a knife by some people. The Crown case was that this was JM. It is Joel Shortland’s belief that the wound to his elbow described in the medical evidence was caused by this third person. The third person being a person with whom Joel was previously familiar on his account. After that event the woman carrying the golf club struck Joel Shortland about five or six times and on differing versions was either dragged away or walked away of her own accord.
	
	
	I will deal in some little detail later with the respective versions of the specific witnesses. John gave evidence that he saw a group of people coming from the cars. I am dealing now specifically with the events that occurred when what I could call the “Bettles group” and the Brearley group had parked in George Street some distance from the Shortland group. He saw a group of people coming from the cars, they were yelling and led by one man holding something behind his back. John focussed on that one person. When that person approached John who was sitting on the back of the tray of a utility, as I understand it of Mr O’Connor’s ‘Rodeo’, he saw that the person had a sword in two hands and demonstrated the person holding the sword upwards, more or less perpendicular to the ground. He said this person had “brown hair” and was “a bit shorter than me”. John Shortland was six foot or thereabouts. He could not remember the clothing. The man held the sword up and hit him on the side of the head and the neck and the collarbone with the flat side of the sword, then turned the blade around to the sharp side and then hit John on the right forearm twice in the location where injuries were subsequently observed.
	
	
	I have already said he put the arm up to protect himself. These were the blows that caused the injuries giving rise to grievous bodily harm. He fell back. He said his’ little’ brother stepped in and punched the attacker, knocking him to the ground. Then John walked or turned away. He then saw Joel fighting a different attacker who he then knocked to the ground. I took the different attacker to be, in the context of certainly his first version, the second swordsman.
	
	
	As I said he did not know any of these people. He said the second attacker at one stage, nominated to be “JM”, was a person shorter than Joel with dark hair. He noticed tattoos on that person but nothing in particular about the tattoos. It needs to be fairly said from what I have seen of Facebook photographs that JM is heavily tattooed on one of his arms and has a tattoo on his neck. John then saw a girl hitting his brother with a golf club, then the group left. He heard a voice say or someone say, “We’ll be back with guns, don’t fuck with the Bettles family”.
	
	
	He said initially in his first account that only two men were involved in the attack upon him and his brother. There were two other men who were standing at one point as he would estimate it seven to eight metres away, one of them grabbed the girl and dragged her away. He said in his first account in his evidence-in-chief the two people standing seven and eight metres away did not become “involved with the incident”. Later in his evidence-in-chief he changed his evidence to suggest that one of those two people became involved.
	
	
	Fergus O’Connor saw multiple cars parked down near the Catholic school, which as the evidence establishes, is to the north of where the Shortlands were parked. He described them being parked “at the end of the block”. By reference to the geographical layout of Bathurst the next cross street of George Street to the north of Piper and George Street is Keppel Street, one of the main streets of Bathurst that leads eventually down to the east to the Railway Station. He saw ten to fifteen people jump out of the cars and start yelling and running towards him. Ultimately five ran towards him and the others. Four males and one female.
	
	
	He said that he was about three or four metres away from the man who was verbally challenged by Joel. He said this person pulled a sword out from behind his back. He described this person as being about five foot nine. He, Mr O’Connor, was six foot six. He described this person as being “blonde wearing a shirt”. He said he saw this person raise the sword and go down on Joel and then John and JJ intervened and then he saw the sword hit John in the arm as he raised it. He could not see what part of Joel was struck. In fact he said he did not know if it hit Joel. I hasten to say that account is not the same as the account given by Joel and John in terms of the order of events.
	
	
	He said he was about three or four foot away from where John was hit. Apart from the man with the sword he did not pay much attention to the others, but a second male he described as having “a rat’s tail” and was wearing
	
	
	“a t-shirt” and about the same height as the first man on the scene and there was a third male that he described as “shorter”. The males were all of the same build. One of the males was wearing a red cap. He said in his first statement that the blonde person dragged away the girl that he had seen with the golf club. He said at one stage the first person had a “white shirt”. He also described Ms Smith as being in a somewhat different position than she described herself.
	
	
	Ms Smith says that she was told, when the group from down the road approached, to ring the police. She at that point as I earlier said was moving towards the flat on the ground floor. She said she saw the group coming along the footpath. She said when the vanguard of the group, to use my words, approached John she was about ten metres away. She saw about five or six people coming in her direction, probably about three males and two girls from memory. She saw one person with a sword and a girl with a golf club. She saw no other weapons. John was leaning on the back of one of the cars. She saw one man mouthing off with a light coloured shirt and darker bottoms and with a very square haircut. That person’s hair was “mousy brown” and he was shorter than John. She described his build as “quite fit”.
	
	
	She saw John struck by the sword on the torso first and then the swordsman went for John’s head. John put his arm up to protect himself and John was hit twice. Then, she was “not sure” what happened. She did not know where others of her group were although she felt Joel was nearby. She then saw the guy with the sword as she described it on the ground and then she saw two other guys “rustling around”. She said in evidence that one of those person had a tattoo “like writing” on his neck. That person had dark brown hair and was shorter than John. The other person who I take to be consistent with the other versions of the second swordsman had brown hair. She was not sure if that person was taller or shorter than John. She then saw the girl with the golf club hit Joel repeatedly. She at that point was in a position towards the movie theatre called ‘The Metro’ complex which is to the south of where the relevant events occurred, perhaps slightly south-east. She walked she said towards what she would call the ‘Anytime Fitness Centre’, which is on the other side of the road of George Street from where the incident occurred. Thus, she walked in what I take to be a ninety-degree or 120 degree angle from where she made the initial observations. She was making a phone call to the police and she was trying to get away from the girl. I have all ready as I said in the earlier general summary referred to details of Joel’s account which I have taken into account.
	
	
	Ms Fitzpatrick in her evidence before me admitted hitting Joel Shortland, who she knew, with a golf club and as I have earlier pointed out she had pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at the Local Court some time in 2013. She knew ZF, JM and AJH. She had had her eighteenth birthday about a month or so before these relevant events and met ZF at about that time and as I understood her evidence had got to know AJH and JM at the same time or about the same time.
	
	
	On 4 December she said she went to a house in West Bathurst. She was involved in some type of friendship with ZF. ZF, AJH and JM were there. She said a phone call was received apparently from the Bettles by one of the people there. As I said earlier they were “distressed”. She said she left the house at West Bathurst to go to the BMX track with AJH and ZF and an “unknown” person who drove. She could not remember whether that person was male or female. At the BMX track she and ZF were standing together and were not involved in any of the discussions between the Brearley brothers and Joel Shortland who she saw.
	
	
	After the discussions when Joel was leaving in one of the vehicles, she said she and ZF were-
	


“Leaning against the bonnet of the car when their car had come speeding towards us and we ran out to the right. The car followed us, they pretty much tried to run us over”.


	
	She said she stuck her arm out, as she demonstrated, as a diversion or an indication for them to stop. They stopped and she stopped running and they skidded off to follow the car apparently occupied by John Shortland. She described the Brearley brothers as chasing after the Shortland cars, she was “pretty sure”, in one car to follow the Shortland vehicles. She claimed she followed in the blue car with AJH, ZF and the driver who she said “she did not know was either a male or female”. She could not remember any other cars being present.
	
	
	The car she was in drove to George Street. She described where they stopped as being “just to the end of George Street across from the cinema”. She got out of the car and saw the Shortlands “coming towards us”, one holding what appeared to be a “car tool”. One of the Shortland group was holding “something behind his legs” but she did not know what it was. She, ZF and AJH got out of their car and she said the Brearley boys “popped” their boot open and handed out golf sticks, one of which was handed to her. She said she had then gone into a fury. She decided to smash the windscreen of one of the cars that tried to run her over. Her specific evidence was this-
	


“Q. At that point did you see if ZF and AJH were still in the cars?

A. Yes.

Q. What did they do if anything?

A. Once they realised the boys were walking towards them they started to walk and meet in the middle.

Q. At that time did you see whether they had anything in their hands?

A. No they didn’t.

Q. As I understand your evidence then you had gone towards one of the Shortland brothers’ cars?

A. Yes.

Q. With a golf club?

A. Yes.

Q. And you’ve indicated that you’re in a fury or whatever, now what happened next from what you did?

A. I was then ready to swing the club when I was approached by I think it might have been Joel and he tried to grab the golf stick from my hand and I had by that time - I had struck and I had realised I had struck him (that was Joel)...about three or four (times)”.


	
	She was then asked, “Now at that time do you know where ZF and AJH were?” She replied “No”.
	
	
	She went back after she had struck Joel to the car and then went back to a house with AJH and ZF. She believed she left the golf stick at the scene and did not see it or the Brearleys later in the night. She said she did not see anybody with a sword and did not see anybody with a knife.
	
	
	That was her evidence in‑chief during the course of a voir dire/Basha inquiry admitted as evidence in the trial. She was not asked any questions at all after that. She was not challenged as to whether she was truthful or not in nominating ZF and AJH as there, a matter discussed in submission but which I would not hold against the accused. No issue was raised with her of any type to raise a question as to why she would falsely implicate ZF  or AJH in relevant events.
	
	
	I have some medical reports as I said earlier in relation to the treatment of the two Shortland brothers. In relation to John Shortland the examination of him revealed that he had “two incise wounds on the dorsal aspect of his forearm”. One was two centimetres in length and involved deeper tissue. The incision closest to the wrist was six centimetres in length and showed underlying “muscle belly” in the wound. An x-ray showed “a segmented compound fracture that is multiple bone fragments fracture of the ulna ( the forearm bone) these fractures were at six and fifteen centimetres above the wrist joint”. Such injuries are referred to by the medical practitioner as “night stick injuries” and are commonly seen as “defence injuries” consistent with the account that John Shortland gave. I have another report with more detailed information from Dr Baird who treated John Shortland at Royal North Shore Hospital. Dr Marshall who reported in relation to John Shortland also treated Joel Shortland. He presented at the Base Hospital about 10.40pm. I should point out of course that all relevant events at the BMX track and at George Street occurred after sunset as the photographs in exhibit A make clear. There are a number of photographs apparently taken by Ms Smith which show that the only illumination is from artificial lighting, particularly the headlights of cars.
	
	
	Joel gave a history to Dr Marshall, which was not the subject of any cross‑examination of Joel, that he had been “in a brawl and initially attacked with a golf club sustaining injuries to his forearm and had then been attacked with a large knife sustaining injuries to his elbow and back”. In the context of no cross‑examination of him on this history I could not conclude necessarily that it is inconsistent with the essential account he have in this Court. It does at face value to be inconsistent. The doctor was not called to give evidence as to the accuracy of the history recorded in the statement.
	
	
	Joel had a large bruise over the posterior of his forearm with a small puncture site in the middle of the haematoma. This was consistent with a blow from the golf club. He had an incised wound on the inner aspect of his left elbow immediately adjacent to the bony prominence. This wound was full thickness laceration with exposure of deeper tissues. He had two longer incised wounds on his left upper back, one five centimetres in length and the other six centimetres in length. The respective wounds were sutured and there is no doubt there were wounds.
	
	
	There was other evidence from the Brearley group. This group was associated with the twins, Lucas and Mitchell Brearley. As I said, they came from Blayney and were known to Joel Shortland, who had apparently lived in Blayney for some period of time although they went to a different school and as I understand it, were slightly older than him. The evidence seems clear from that of Joel Shortland and other witnesses, that there was some bad feeling between Joel Shortland and some members of the Brearley group. The Brearley group included these people. John Malvicino, Brandon Hahn or Pringle, Jasmine McCarthy, Jamie Clark, Cameron Southwell, Mickey Cole, Jayden Sargent and Vaughan Hart. Only some of that group gave evidence.
	
	
	Mr Chhabra at one point of his submissions sought some direction as to the failure of the Crown to call some of these people that I have named. However the problem with that submission was that on the facts of this case apart from some involvement in earlier events, although that was unclear as it turned out, such as perhaps shouting abuse at Joel Shortland when they were driving around Bathurst, such as perhaps throwing rocks at O’Connor’s car as he drove away, perhaps seeing a bottle thrown by Joel Shortland, none of these people had any involvement in any key events. If they knew the accused beforehand they may have been able to provide evidence as to either their presence or absence at relevant times.
	
	
	However, the difficulty with the submission made by Mr Chhabra was there was no attempt made in the examination of witnesses to ascertain matters that might have been considered relevant to either their availability or their capacity to make relevant observation. There were no applications made to me for the Crown to call witnesses or make them available. There was no evidence called from any police officer, no police officers actually gave evidence in the case such was the police involvement in this matter, to ascertain the availability of people that were not called whether they provided statements before or whether legal representatives of the parties had been provided with any points in relation to these people that might shed some light on the proceedings and give some realistic foundation for considering the implications of these people not being called. No issue was raised with me by the parties for any direction in relation to the calling of witnesses.
	
	
	I am mindful of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279, I am not saying of course there is any impropriety on the part of the Crown in this case. Kneebone was a case that emanated from Bathurst, setting out details in relation to the obligation of the Crown. No suggestion has been made the Crown has not fulfilled his full obligation to make available those persons that he believes are relevantly concerned with matters. Here no suggestion was ever put to a particular witness that any of the other persons named, but not called, were in a position to see relevant events.
	
	
	There is nothing before the Court to indicate there was any deliberate decision by the Crown not to call any particular witnesses and it was acknowledged, I thought ultimately from the submissions of Mr Chhabra, that really no groundwork had been laid and no basis existed for concluding that any of these witnesses had any better view of the fight with the Shortlands by their attackers than the Brearleys, Southwell and Hahn. Ultimately on the state of the evidence I could not draw any conclusion one way or the other as to what evidence may have been given by these people or what assistance they may have been given and I could not conclude any prejudice to the accused whatsoever.
	
	
	The Brearley group I must say as a general group were not particularly impressive witnesses. To my mind, the Brearley twins themselves in their evidence revealed a failure to disclose information which one might have thought was available to them. For example, Mr Pringle on the version of Joel Shortland, knew members of the Bettles family. According to Mr Shortland, which I accept, he was contacted by Brandon Hahn or Pringle and was told by him that he believed the Bettles were involved in the fight and said that he himself was not involved. Of course, that may have been second hand hearsay, I appreciate. But having said that to Mr Shortland his evidence at this trial is he did not know the people in the car. This is to be understood in the context of Ms Fitzpatrick’s evidence that she was in company with two people who might reasonably be regarded as part of the Bettles group in the general sense.
	
	
	Lucas Brearley gave evidence that he had a black XR6 Ford sedan driving around as I said earlier with his brother. There is no need to go into the detail of his confrontation. He did not give any evidence that he had contacted anyone to “back him up” in his meeting with Joel Shortland down at the BMX track, although it seems that in the context of Ms Fitzpatrick’s evidence, that was precisely what happened. I cannot be positive on that however. He remembered when Joel Shortland was leaving that there were people standing in front of the car which he described as light coloured car later as a white or silver car. These people he said he did not know but he did say that these people were menaced by the manner of driving by Mr O’Connor, “barely missing them”.
	
	
	He heard screams and yells that followed that car as it drove away and saw another car chasing the Shortland’s vehicle, the light coloured car to which I referred, and he followed that car to George Street. He said that he parked near the corner of Keppel and George Street. He said that the other car, that is the light coloured car, was parked twenty or thirty metres closer to where the Shortlands could be seen in George Street.
	
	
	He thought there were probably five people, a mixture of males and females, leave that car. He heard a lot of screaming but he was too far away and it was too dark for him to see anything but he thought there were a lot of fist fights and stuff. He did not know either the girl or the male as he described them who jumped out of the way of O’Connor’s car. But he was pretty sure that the same girl got out of the car at George Street and approached the Shortlands. He described her as dark skinned or tanned. I understand Ms Fitzpatrick is an Aboriginal person although I would not have necessarily have described her as dark skinned.
	
	
	He described one male who got out of the silver car, as he then described it in George Street, as “tall and bulky” wearing a “t-shirt and jeans I think”. That person had short hair. The girl was short with black hair. He confirmed that he had golf clubs in the boot of either his car or of his brother’s car. He said that what happened in George Street happened pretty quickly and he said in his statement to police that he gave in early December that he had never seen the people involved in the fight before that night.
	
	
	Mitchell Brearley gave the same general account although he was more clear that it was a silver car at the BMX track and he confirmed that Mr O’Connor’s car “almost hit a girl” and she had to move out of the way. He did not know the name of the girl. He also said that the car driven by Mr O’Connor “went to hit my car”. He confirmed he followed the silver car and parked outside the Park Hotel in George Street. The Park Hotel, I hasten to say, is on the opposite side of Keppel Street from the Piper Street/George Street intersection. He said the silver car or the Holden Astra, as he described it, “parked forty metres in front of me”. I took that to mean further south of his position closer to where the Shortlands were.
	
	
	He confirmed that he had golf clubs of his father either in his car or they were in Lucas’ car. He believed that one of the group associated with the silver car took a golf club from the boot of his care unbeknownst to him at the time at BMX track. This was a fact that emerged I think from a question that I asked him about golf clubs. He said he saw a number of people run from the silver car. He thought it was four but he could not remember, either one or two females. One of the group had a sword. They ran towards the Shortlands. The person with the sword was holding it behind his back, as was stated by John Shortland, and he could hear a lot of screaming and yelling and then he heard that “the cops were coming” and he went off to Jade’s house. He saw the people that had run up to the Shortlands running back, he did not see anything in their hands. He did not then see the sword and he did not see a female with a golf club.
	
	
	He confirmed, as Lucas did, that where he was watching the events he was a fair way away and he could not see because it was dark. In his statement of early December 2012 he said the person carrying the sword was wearing black Canterbury track pants, was wearing a t-shirt, he estimated his height to be about five foot six and he was of skinny build. He also recollected the guy with the sword had “short black hair”. I point out, although I was not led in evidence to the height of the Brearleys, that they seem to me to be relatively short men themselves.
	
	
	Pringle or Hahn was present at the BMX track. He knew the Shortland brothers as I said. He saw the silver Astra, he thought there were five or six people in it. He thought it was a female driver who he did not know. He followed in Lucas’ car, the silver car, to outside the Park Hotel in George Street. He saw the Astra closer to the Shortlands’ residence about seventy metres from where Lucas parked his car. He thought about five or six people got out of the Astra. He was positive there was at least one female. He saw a sword, a golf club and he thought someone had a knife. The female had the golf club and the male had the sword. He did not know any of the people that were walking towards the Shortlands. He said there was a lot of yelling and screaming and he described the action outside of the Shortlands house as “a bunch of like blurs ... human blurs”. He could not recognise anyone outside the Shortland residence, including Joel or John.
	
	
	He went to McDonalds, walking there. He gave evidence that he heard as the group walked towards the Shortlands one of that group say, “You want to have a go at me to try and run me over, you don’t know who you’re messing with, we’re the Bettles”. As it transpired it turned out that which he had told the police he heard was not what he actually heard, but what he and others he was with had agreed that they had heard. They had reconstructed the conversation. His evidence in this Court was that he heard the words, “Don’t mess with me, you don’t know who you’re starting or messing with”. The reference to’the Bettles’ was apparently heard by somebody else. Clearly it was second hand hearsay in that instance.
	
	
	Mr Southwell was also travelling with Lucas, he confirmed the silver Astra at the BMX track, he did not know anybody associated with it. He went to George Street, he saw the people from the silver car go up the street more than a hundred metres away from where he was. One of the people had a sword but you could not see much because he saw the group running up the street and it was dark and one could only see figures moving around in the dark he said. He heard the words “You don’t know who you’re messing with”. He heard a lot of yelling. He thought there were five or six people who ran up the street and that a male had a sword. He thought he heard Mitchell say something about the “cops coming” and they left the scene. Lucas said, in probably an understatement, “It’s a bit messed up lets go”.
	
	
	Southwell went to a house elsewhere in Bathurst. He claimed that all of the cars went back to that address, a version that nobody else gives. He said the occupants of the silver car were there and he saw the sword taken out of the silver car. After an examination on the voir dire the witness was permitted to give evidence that he actually saw a golf club, a Samurai sword and a knife taken from the silver car towards the confrontation on George Street. I accept that that was his memory at an earlier time. He was also refreshed from his statement that he gave on 16 July 2013 about other matters. He said he had not discussed the events of 4 December with members of the Brearley group before he gave that statement.
	
	
	I am going to take a break for ten minutes, I will resume at 12 o’clock. The accused's bail continues until 12, thank you.
	
	
	SHORT ADJOURNMENT
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: As I have earlier indicated, the Crown case was that the first swordsman was ZF, the second swordsman was AJH and the third person to assault Joel Shortland was JM, the people generally regarded as the “Bettles”. There was other evidence relied upon by the Crown particularly from the Shortland group.
	
	
	Evidence was given that the words were heard by John Shortland for example to the effect, “You don’t fuck with the Bettles boys”. There were other words said concerning coming back with “guns”, as I have earlier indicated, from John Shortland. I have already pointed out Joel Shortland claimed to be familiar with JM and their association was casual, having only met twice before and the man JM having been identified by a third person.
	
	
	Joel Shortland was interviewed on 5 December and 6 December 2012. I gather, without having been provided with those interviews as part of the evidence in the case, the interviews which were electronically recorded were quite extensive. On 6 December 2012, during the course of the second interview conducted with him, when asked about the person JM, who he had claimed to already know in one way or the other, and whether he was one of the “boys” that was there, he said “He was just hanging around with them”. He also said JM “Did not touch (him) in any way,” nor did he touch his brother. On 5 and 6 December 2012 he said nothing about a distinctive tattoo on the accused’s neck and as I understand the way the case has been conducted it is the case that JM had a tattoo with writing on his neck in the terms of some evidence given by Ms Smith.
	
	
	As I said earlier, on the evening of 4 December, Joel Shortland agreed in his evidence in this Court that Brandon Hahn had supplied him with the name of the Bettles group. As a result of that Joel Shortland said in this trial and elsewhere that he undertook a Facebook search digging up the name of JM and ultimately obtaining a photograph of three people which he claimed he recognised as being involved, or identified as being involved. Those three people being the three accused. I am certainly satisfied that he has given evidence to the effect that he sent a copy of that photograph to Melissa Smith in this Court or the committal proceedings. I should point out in his first interview on 5 December, having been given the name Bettles by Brandon Hahn, he had told police in answer to a question asked of him that he did not know whether “JM was trying to get the sword off him” (the first swordsman).
	
	
	John Shortland had to be airlifted from Bathurst Hospital to Royal North Shore Hospital. He remained at Royal North Shore Hospital until 7 December 2012, approximately three days later. Ms Smith went down to Sydney on 7 December 2012 and brought him back to Bathurst. She had in her phone, as I would understand it having it sent to her by Joel , the photograph of the three men. She also gave evidence that she in conjunction with Joel Shortland on the evening of 5 December did some searching of Facebook photographs.
	
	
	There was a lot of confusing evidence about this matter and in fairness to the witnesses I do not believe any of the witnesses are now in a position to give me any clear evidence of precisely what they did, when they did it and how they did it. Ultimately, as I would understand it, a number of photographs were downloaded from Facebook some of which were produced to the police by Melissa Smith. She said she did so on or about 21 December. Various Facebook photographs were produced to the Court and they show various people including the three accused, some are group photographs, some are individual photographs of individual accused.
	
	
	What is clear from the evidence of the Shortland group is that before they were able to identify or recognise people in photographs and ascribe to those particular people particular tasks relevant to the assaults committed upon John and Joel Shortland for police purposes, they had a number of discussions focussing upon the name Bettles and of course the names of the three accused as they appeared in Facebook posts. At various times they discussed the various photographs of the accused and other people, as I have earlier pointed out, the detail of which is lost in time. I appreciate as part of the background of this matter, although it is not evidence in the case, that sometime in the middle of 2013 there was some attempt to undertake some form of video recorded photograph identification with members of the Shortland group. What the outcome of that is I do not know.
	
	
	I am assuming from what I was told for what it is worth that there was some identification that occurred in that circumstance. But that exercise was hopelessly compromised notwithstanding any good intent on the part of the Shortlands to find out who was involved, by the deeply flawed circumstances of their searching of Facebook photographs, discussions with one another about which there is absolutely no independent or reliable record. As I pointed out to the learned Crown Prosecutor in the course of the discussion in Ms Smith’s evidence, when the prosecution leads evidence of identification obtained by the police in the modern era, we usually have videotaped recording of the precise comments made by the identifying witness. This is very, very important in ascertaining the certainty or otherwise and the accuracy or otherwise of any identification occurring. The extent to which any of these witnesses were influenced by one another’s recollection is impossible to identify with precision, but there is absolutely no doubt that their recollections were influenced by each other’s discussions and that was made abundantly clear in the cross‑examination of Joel Shortland.
	
	
	There is a body of evidence within the Shortlands’ accounts that suggests that only two men not three, were involved in the respective assaults upon John and Joel Shortland. There is evidence that clearly indicates at least from some witnesses, that the person who was regarded as JM dragged the woman with the golf club away with, on one version, at least at one point of time no participation by him in the fight. That was the initial version of Joel Shortland, the only person who was familiar with him. I have already pointed out the evidence of John Shortland about the third man standing at one point with a fourth man seven or eight metres away.
	
	
	There is no evidence on any version of anything being said in the course of the assaults by any of the men involved, or the woman for that matter, evidencing a particular person’s participate on in a particular joint enterprise or any specific intent. The intention to inflict grievous bodily harm must be inferred on the Crown case from all the circumstances of the matter including the weapons, the location of the injuries, the use of force and the like.
	


SUBMISSIONS


	
	I turn now to the submissions. The Crown submissions were essentially that a lot of matters were not in dispute and that is true. There was grievous bodily harm suffered by John Shortland and wounding suffered by Joel Shortland and there was no issue of self defence.
	
	
	The Crown said squarely it relied upon the evidence of Ms Fitzpatrick to establish the presence of the two accused in conjunction with the other evidence in the manner I have outlined and went on to detail a number of matters most of which I have already referred to. He particularly relied upon the use of the expression, coming from Mr Pringle’s evidence, concerning the group leaving the ‘fray’ with the Shortlands injured behind, to the effect that someone said “Don’t fuck with the Bettles boys” or “We’ll be back with guns, don’t fuck with the Bettles”.
	
	
	He said that if this evidence was not available for a hearsay purpose it was relevant to the issue of identity as a non‑hearsay issue relying upon the decision of Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 189 and to explain the conduct of the person as relevant to inferring an agreement, relying upon the single Judge decision of Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 648 of Whealy J.
	
	
	The Crown also referred the Court to the decision of Landini a decision which I will refer to in a moment of Hall J, sitting as a single Judge. The prosecution relied upon it as evidence of recognition. It also relied upon particular circumstances, including the statements made and the like, the location of the injuries, the descriptions, the various matters which I believe I have already outlined.
	
	
	Mr Chhabra took the Court to four essential matters. He firstly said that the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a second swordsman, which is alleged to be his client, AJH, and thus, AJH ought be acquitted. If the Court was satisfied there was a second swordsman, then the Court could not be satisfied that the accused AJH was identified as such. Thirdly, he identified many problems in the evidence relied upon by the Crown reflecting upon the reliability of supposed identification or recognition and/or similarity of the accused with the assailants. He also made submissions about the use to be made of representations that the Crown said had a hearsay purpose. He conceded they could be used for a non hearsay purpose, as submitted by the Crown, but that would require limiting the evidence under s 136 Evidence Act.
	
	
	The submission was also made about the failure to call witnesses and reflected upon aspects of the evidence that rendered the accounts of the Shortland group as being unreliable, such as the conflict as to where Melissa Smith was at relevant times. He pointed to the facts of the matter that things happened quickly, it was dark and other aspects of the matter that I have taken into account in warning myself in respect of the so called identification evidence.
	
	
	Mr Coleman’s oral submissions centred around an aide memoir, that I have marked for identification, and which I have read in detail, setting out reasons for concluding that the Court could not prove beyond reasonable doubt ZF was present. He said as Mr Chhabra had said, there was no dispute as to the injuries, and there was generally no challenge to the honesty of the witnesses called except for Ms Fitzpatrick. He made the submission which I accept, that the genuine belief of witnesses that events occurred is not the same as establishing the truth of that evidence.
	
	
	He referred to the surrounding circumstances in which the event occurred, sudden, sharp, short, in unfavourable lighting conditions. He noted the relationship of Joel Shortland to Ms Fitzpatrick and his general knowledge of Mr Bettles. He said that the reference to ‘the Bettles’ and ‘messing with the Bettles’ and the like was a matter of no great weight. It did not follow in any event that it was hearsay, because no one could establish who said the words. He said there was no credible identification of either of the accused.
	
	
	He submitted that Ms Fitzpatrick was not to be accepted as a witness of truth and the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of her evidence, particularly in relation to the presence of the two accused. He said there were numerous possibilities of persons, other than ZF, being involved. The existence of these as reasonable possibilities or a reasonable possibility in a particular case was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I do not propose to put on the record the various matters identified in page 2 of his ‘aide memoire’ concerning Ms Fitzpatrick’s evidence. He pointed out where her evidence was completely at odds with a number of witnesses, such as the colour of the car in which she travelled, the order of cars chasing the Shortlands, the failure to be unable to know or remember the gender and name of the person who drove the blue car. He at one point, it was the weakest part of his argument, suggested that she stuck up her arm and that had the effect of stopping Mr O’Connor’s car as being ‘unbelievable’. In fairness to Ms Fitzpatrick it is a minor matter. She was just demonstrating what she did to protect herself, the way in which of course John Shortland sought to protect himself, against the man with the sword. It was probably a hopeless gesture. I have got no doubt by the way that Mr O’Connor was not intending to run over anybody. But I also have got no doubt on the evidence available to me that he was trying to scare the people that were present.
	
	
	Mr Coleman submitted that even if I was minded to accept the evidence of Ms Fitzpatrick, as to the alleged presence of the accused, I would not reject her evidence that the accused ZF did not have anything in his hands whilst in the vicinity of the Shortland’s residence. He said, as I earlier mentioned, that he did not submit that the Crown’s witnesses were other than essentially honest. He went through details of the evidence of Joel Shortland, Fergus O’Connor, John Shortland, Mel Smith, the unreliability of the recognition evidence which I accept, and other matters from that material as well as evidence of Brandon Pringle and Cameron Southwell, which I have taken into account, some of which I have already identified.
	
	
	He took me through the evidence of description and the conflicts in that, which I have taken into account. He pointed to, most importantly, the many descriptions of the first swordsman, none of which seem to be reconcilable. He said that the identification by the Shortlands of Ms Fitzpatrick, given her admitted presence at the scene, did not enhance the credibility of their recognition of the other two men, a submission with which I ultimately agree.
	
	
	Following upon the submissions, it is clear that on the application Mr Chhabra, supported by Mr Coleman, that I am required to warn myself as to the potential unreliability of particular evidence. In relation to any evidence that might said to be hearsay evidence or admissions, I am required to warn myself of the potential unreliability, because of the fact that the supposed hearsay representations and/or admissions, if they be that, are not proven independently of the say so of witnesses and maybe regarded as imprecise. There is a need for caution in relation to any such evidence in the terms of determining what weight should be given to it in any event.
	
	
	I am required to warn myself in relation to identification evidence. I am also required to warn myself as to the reliability of the evidence from a person suffering injury and the effect of that injury upon the person’s capacity to make observations, have a memory of relevant events and the like, which I do.
	
	
	Of particular importance arising under s 165, is the warning I am required to give myself particularly concerning Shanaya Fitzpatrick as a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding. There is absolutely no doubt that that is so, I appreciate that evidence maybe unreliable. A reason that it may be unreliable, amongst a number of reasons is that she could be regarded as a person lacking credibility, because she admits to criminal conduct of that type. Secondly, she may have an agenda either secret or open, to tell falsehoods in relation to a particular accused. She also would have intimate knowledge of the relevant events which would give her the capacity to invent matters that would implicate the accused from that personal knowledge. There could be matters arising that are not known to the accused or to the Court, that might provide a motive for her to give a false story, or provide a basis for her to tell falsehoods about each of the accused. I have taken all those matters into account.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	In the context of all the evidence and the submissions and the legal directions I am required to give myself, I am required to consider these fundamental issues. Has the prosecution proven beyond reasonable doubt that what occurred in the attack upon the Shortlands involved specific things done by particular people, without necessarily establishing identity? In other words, established the facts of what happened, causing injury to both men, beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Has the prosecution proven beyond reasonable doubt the identify of a particular person who performed particular acts? If satisfied as to the involvement of a particular person, having committed particular acts, has the Crown satisfied the Court beyond reasonable doubt in relation to that particular person, the relevant elements, that relate to each of the counts and where needs be, participation of that person in a joint criminal enterprise?
	
	
	At the end of the Crown case I acquitted JM of all counts. In the matter of the Crown case against him, the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that he performed any particular act towards any particular person, or was even necessarily present participating in a joint criminal enterprise and/or in company. There was a reasonable doubt as to his presence as I have pointed out briefly before, given particularly the unreliability of Joel Shortland’s evidence on his involvement and the evidence of Ms Fitzpatrick, which I accept on this matter.
	
	
	For reasons elsewhere described it became apparent that the one person who was previously familiar with JM, that was Joel, initially ascribed no involvement of him, although presence. He subsequently changed his version of events to implicate him in performing acts evidencing at least his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to wound Joel. He is contradicted, as I said, by evidence from John. The subsequent ‘identification’ was almost valueless, or was so deeply flawed and contaminated by subsequent events that no evidence of recognition of him as present and/or participating could be regarded as reliable from Joel Shortland or from any other witness.
	
	
	In assessing this matter there was a truth in respect of the accounts of the Shortland faction which emerged in response to the question from Mr Coleman that I earlier referred to. That is, the memory of the witnesses of relevant events was better closer to the event.
	
	
	The accounts of Joel and John gave either at the first opportunity to give an account, or on subsequent occasions in either interviews with the police statements or evidence at committal, is in many respects substantially at odds with the detail of their evidence at trial. Not only as to what occurred, but as to who did what to whom, and the role of two or three people in the events I have described. Of course these witnesses appear to have no uncertainties about what they now believe in various ways. Their now stated certainties have to be tested against their previous certainties or uncertainties.
	
	
	It is clear from the cross-examination of Joel that his recollection of the events of the evening when he spoke on 5 December and 6 December, were the two men had attacked him and his brother with a sword. A woman had attacked him with a golf club. He had no recollection and did not nominate JM as being directly involved.
	
	
	On 21 December, 14 days after release from hospital, John Shortland had obviously had a number of discussions with Joel Shortland, Melissa and others, in the presence of one another. They were entirely frank about that, because as far as I was concerned they had nothing to hide. They did not appear to have been given any instruction by police not to discuss the matter. They had discussions as to the identity of the assailants are shown in Facebook photographs available to them all.
	
	
	John said in his first interview that two men had attacked him and his brother, and a woman had attacked Joel. As I said earlier, in the first part of his evidence at trial, he described five people approaching, and two people attacking him, two people standing some distance away, a third man not involved but for pulling the woman away. I bear in mind what Joel’s evidence about the identity of the person who pulled the woman away was the person who struck him with the golf club.
	
	
	Joel in his evidence at trial said he was not ‘a hundred per cent’ sure what JM did. But he did believe JM had confronted him and he was involved in injuring him, because he made “an assumption” arising out of what he saw concerning the movement of his hands, although he did not see him with a weapon. On 15 July 2013, as I understood the date, John Shortland nominated JM, a person he did not previously know as being at the scene, but said in that account he did not see him do anything apart from possibly dragging a woman away.
	
	
	I go back to the issue of how all this unfolded. I am satisfied that Joel and John heard words to the effect “Don’t fuck with the Bettles boys” or something along those lines. I have the evidence of Joel that Brandon Hahn rang him and nominated “the Bettles” as being involved when he was not sure who was involved. I also have his evidence that he went searching for the name JM, either before he was interviewed on 5 December 2012 or probably after, “I initially thought he was a relation so I went to Facebook”.
	
	
	That statement was a reference to the fact that he believed JM may have been a relation to the people who assaulted him. He also gave evidence that he knew as at 4 December, that JM had a tattoo on his neck with the word “Faith” on it. He made no mention in his accounts on 5 December of any attacker or person having a distinctive tattoo on his neck of a particular type.
	
	
	I bear in mind some of the descriptions of the attackers as wearing T-shirts. Although other people refer to them wearing shirts. If the man JM was one person wearing a T-shirt, one might have thought the tattoo would be easily seen. Certainly in the Facebook photographs there is a photograph of JM with a clear tattoo on his neck. It could be writing. I am unable to say whether it says the word ‘Faith’. Joel accepted that this feature would have been important to mention when he gave his account to police, but he did not do so.
	
	
	I go back to the conversation he had with Brandon Hahn. He gave evidence or accepted as having given evidence before, that he had asked Brandon Hahn “Who might’ve been involved?” And it was Brandon who said “JM, and I didn’t know the others.” This representation was not given by Brandon in evidence. It could not serve a hearsay purpose given one could not be satisfied it was first hand hearsay. But the purpose it does serve for a non hearsay purpose, is that it shows a basis for concluding that Joel did not know who had assaulted him and secondly, it provides a basis for understanding how it came to be that he went searching for the name JM.
	
	
	The evidence is overwhelming that Joel went to Facebook as I said and found the photograph of the three people. This led to the other photographs on Facebook. I point out the photograph of the ‘three people’ together has never been produced to this Court. I do not know whether it was ever produced to the police. I have seen the various photographs taken from Facebook. I am aware they found a photograph of Shanaya Fitzpatrick who was known to Joel Shortland as a Facebook friend. They all successfully identified her.
	
	
	There is no doubt the critical witnesses who the Crown rely upon to identify or recognise people as performing particular tasks, discussed all this between themselves and I have got no way of knowing, nor could any tribunal of fact know precisely when they came to the relevant conclusions as to who did what. This is of great significance in considering the assumption, if I might call it that, of everybody in the Shortland camp side that ZF was the first swordsman and AJH was the second swordsman.
	
	
	I note the evidence of Joel at the committal where he said that when relating what occurred about the incident when he discussed the matter with John and Melissa after John’s release from hospital:
	


“He (John) didn’t know what happened, but then after I went on Facebook and I said “John this might – (I emphasise the word might) - be the bloke"". And he asked me to send a picture of him and he...and then he said “Yeah that’s him.””


	
	Later on in that same evidence at the committal proceedings last year, he said, “I might’ve seen the name and then we got home I might’ve shown him the picture.”
	
	
	At the committal, as he also agreed at trial, he said that he had spoken to Melissa Smith about the matter and shown her either a photograph or photographs and said “Yes...this may have been the person that done it.” Those statements of ‘might’ and ‘may’ are not statements of confident identification in their own terms. I pause to point out that I understood this evidence at committal adopted for the trial was evidence of the identification, so to speak of the person with a sword, a person who was unknown to Joel, John and Melissa before 4 December.
	
	
	John Shortland at the committal agreed they had gone through “heaps” of Facebook photographs. They had gone through photographs randomly, “looking for the attackers on the night.” He said at the committal, “He had no idea” how he ended up settling upon ZF as the person who first assaulted him.
	
	
	Ms Smith at the committal proceedings and in the trial confirmed the joint discussions between herself and/ or Joel, John and possibly “Jake” Shortland who I take to be Jacob, at various times before and after John Shortland returned from hospital on 7 December. She appears to have had other conversations with Joel Shortland. She also drove John Shortland back from Sydney as I said. She believed that they went through the Facebook photographs together. That is she and Joel on 5 December, after she finished work. This would have been after Joel had first been interviewed. She said that she believed this was facilitated by Joel because she did not have a Facebook page. She confirmed the first name they were told was “JM”, so they went from there. And she also confirmed flicking through photographs collectively.
	
	
	When she was interviewed by police in late December 2012, after this exercise, she did not indicate that she recognised any of the people that were in the photographs. She told the police that she was producing the photographs which I have to assume are part of exhibit A, because they were the photographs that had been “used by the boys” in the identification process. She also gave evidence that people shown in the photographs she had been told were there.
	
	
	In July 2013 having attended the identification exercise with the police, she told the police “She could not recognise” two of the men that were supposedly there, being AJH and JM inconsistent accounts lend no credibility to a claimed recognition of ZF  as being the first sword wielder. As for the tattoo that she gave evidence of in this Court on the neck, when first interviewed on 21 December 2012, she did not mention seeing a tattoo. This was at a time as I said, when she was in possession of a photograph showing JM name in the Facebook entry with a tattoo on his neck. The first mention of a particular tattoo was in July 2013. One might have thought in any event that of all the people in the Shortland group that claimed to have seen relevant things she was the greater distance away from the scene than the others.
	
	
	There are no means of unscrambling the mechanism by which one or other of the Shortland group contaminated the other’s recollection beyond the candid concession by Joel that his recollection of events was assisted by suggestions made to him of the participation of particular people in the context of hearing a reference to “the Bettles”.
	
	
	As was obvious from the submissions there is no issue of relevant identification. I have dealt with the issue of similarity. It is important to remember that statements that people “look like” a person involved in a criminal act, are not statements of identification or could even be regarded as statements of “recognition”. I refer particularly to the High Court judgment of Pitkin v The Queen [1995] 69 ALJR 612, particularly at [8].
	
	
	That was a special leave application in Sydney where the point was taken about the fact that the active identification in the presence of police, was a statement made by one of the witnesses that an accused person “looked like” the assailant. The High Court held in Pitkin, having granted special leave and then heard the appeal on the spot rather than referring it to Canberra,
	


“That to surmise when someone says that someone looks like a particular offender means the same as identification is wrong. Look like is not an expression of identification and is insufficient to sustain a conviction that an accused committed a particular crime.”

(see also [9]).


	
	In conjunction with this deeply flawed method of seeking to recognise particular people in the absence of any prior knowledge of them, except for Joel’s prior knowledge of JM and Facebook friendship with Fitzpatrick, there are the issues I have earlier pointed out of the contradictory descriptions, some of which I have already identified. Putting aside the fact that Mr O’Connor was 6 foot six inches and everyone appears smaller than him, it was pointed out by Mr Coleman that in respect of the first swordsman, purportedly ZF, there were a number of different descriptions, including markedly different descriptions of the colour of his hair and his build. There were also different descriptions as to clothing as there were in relation to the second person and even to some extent the third person.
	
	
	There was one fundamental problem however in relation to the issue of descriptions and the weight one can give to that evidence. Putting aside any question of whether the descriptions given accorded or did not accord with the appearance of a particular accused in Facebook photographs, posted in about September 2012, there was no evidence of any descriptions of the three accused as at 4 December in circumstances other than that given by people watching the fight. With no contemporaneous description of ZF and AJH, noting the inconsistencies in descriptions, there was no basis for concluding that the descriptions were accurate or even close to reliable.
	
	
	Ms Fitzpatrick who was a person who was able to identify each accused as present, was not asked any questions about how tall they were at the time, what clothing they were wearing, the style of their hair, or any other matter. It is all well good for one person to say an offender had a ‘rats-tail’, but if there is no evidence that a particular accused had a ‘rats-tail’. The description is of little value whatsoever.
	
	
	Of course when the descriptions vary so much and lack consistency it raises the question of whether one can have any confidence, or should at least be reserved in one’s confidence, about the capacity of witnesses to describe the same person having done particular acts. In that regard I particularly refer to the marked differences and description between Joel Shortland and John Shortland as to the colour of the hair of the first person.
	
	
	I turn now to the issue of the representations or statements made either before the assault, by the attacking group, or from someone within the attacking group and after the assault, and particularly the reference “the Bettles” in one form or another.
	
	
	As to the statements before the event, ultimately Mr Pringle’s evidence was he did not know who said the words and he did not know himself that the expression “the Bettles” was actually said. I have already dealt with the evidence he gave on that matter. His assertion that somebody else told him that they were the words, renders that evidence second-hand hearsay, it is not admissible as second-hand hearsay as the Evidence Act makes clear. But as to the fundamental proposition of whether the representations made could be regarded as hearsay, the evidence of what was said before and after suffers a fundamental problem. There is no identified person having made the representation.
	
	
	In order for the evidence to be receivable as an admission (see Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 189 which the Crown referred to as of assistance in relation to the non hearsay purpose) one needs to know who was the person making the representation in order to be able to be reasonably satisfied it was an admission. I am also mindful of what was said by Hall, J in Landini, a case to which the Crown referred me, ([2007] NSWSC 259), particularly at [25], that:
	


“A representation will usually be more than a narrative statement of some past event to satisfy s 87(1)(c).”


	
	S 87 (1)(c) is the provision that the Crown relied upon to admit the evidence as hearsay evidence. The Crown said the statements made, ascribed to Mr Pringle before the event, or the statements made after the event, may be relevant for a ‘non hearsay purpose’. Ultimately Mr Pringle’s evidence would leave the statements as possibly available as statements of discussions, evidencing agreement or alternatively, in relation to representations that serve the non hearsay purpose of establishing identity in accordance with the decision of Lodhi.
	
	
	With regard to the purported statements that might evidence agreement or intention to do a particular act, the terms of what was said provide little evidence of agreement. The statements made before are general and certainly are not sufficient in my view to even in conjunction with other evidence, establish a relevant joint criminal enterprise. The statements made after the event, in their terms are more an ex-post facto reflection, coupled with a threat, rather than a representation evidencing intention or agreement at the time of the relevant acts. Bearing in mind they do not serve a hearsay purpose, their probative value is further diminished.
	
	
	Likewise, in relation to the supposed evidence reflecting upon identity. In Lodhi the evidence, although not available for a hearsay purpose, was very specific. Here the representations are very general. It is of very little assistance in identifying specific offenders. I should bear in mind that there is no reason necessarily to conclude that the statement had been made by someone who was an accused person in any event. It could have been a commentary of a ‘non Bettles’ person, deflecting attention from their own conduct or seeking to blame others. The matter is just unclear from the evidence.
	
	
	So I come to my conclusions. Ultimately as was submitted by the Crown and not in dispute by the defence, the Court is satisfied that John Shortland relevantly suffered the grievous bodily harm and pleaded and Joel Shortland suffered the wounding. There is no doubt in my mind that the wounding and grievous bodily harm were unlawfully inflicted, no issue of self defence arises.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that ZF and AJH were two of the group, who left the motor vehicle parked in George Street and walked up to confront the Shortlands.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of that group was carrying a sword and Ms Fitzpatrick was carrying a golf club.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was Shanaya Fitzpatrick, because not only does she say so, but what she says about her own involvement is confirmed by the observations of the Shortland group.
	
	
	I cannot exclude the fact that there were at least four people in the group, not three. I will come back to the significance of the identification if I can call it that of Ms Fitzpatrick and its implications for the recognition, identification/similarity of the accused as the attackers.
	
	
	In coming to the conclusion that the two accused were part of the group taking into account all the matters identified in the written submissions and the oral submissions of counsel for the accused and the Crown, I am satisfied that Shanaya Fitzpatrick was truthful, not withstanding the fact that there are matters about which she is either not truthful, inaccurate or has a poor recollection. So far as her observations concerning neither of the men having anything in their hands, that could be untruthful or inaccurate. One feature of her evidence that I divine both in the manner in which she gave her evidence and the form of it, was that she clearly was concentrating on wreaking her own revenge against people that she had aggrieved her. The fact that she does not see items in the hands of the two accused is to be weighed up against the evidence - by the overwhelming evidence that one man was carrying a sword. She saw no weapons in anybody’s hands. She is at least mistaken as to the nature of the car that she travelled from BMX track to George Street.
	
	
	There is no reason however that arises from the evidence, not that the accused have an obligation to put it to her, I that I can find her to deliberately misdescribe the car, or the circumstances of her travelling in the car. As to whether she is truthful or simply unable to recollect the identity of the person driving the car, I cannot say. Her recollection of the number of people in the car could be inaccurate. Certainly I do not regard it as untruthful. The evidence of the number of people in her car as I have earlier pointed out is in its terms from other sources is rather general.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the conclusions I have reached in relation to the Brearley twins, particularly in my view they have not been truthful, concerning their prior knowledge of the ‘Bettles group’, I accept her evidence that she obtained a golf club from the Bettles group at one point for the purposes of assaulting someone associated with the Shortland group. She may have been mistaken as to where she obtained it. If it came to a question of preferring her version to the Brearleys I would prefer her version. Again, she has not got any reason to invent the precise circumstances in which she obtained the golf club, bearing in mind one of the Brearleys reluctantly conceded that she had obtained a golf club from the boot of one of their cars.
	
	
	Notwithstanding a number of matters earlier referred to as being matters where she was contradicted I can find no reason in the context of her frank evidence against her own interest, admittedly under the protection of a s 128 Evidence Act certificate, which I have taken into account and have warned myself about, for her to mistakenly or falsely implicate ZF and AJH. She knew them both reasonably well. There is no question that she could “identify them”. She was in some form of relationship, not particularly serious, with ZF who, had known them for a number of weeks. She had travelled to a house where they were present.
	
	
	She had ample opportunity it would seem over time to make observation of them during the course of the evening of 4 December to be able to identify them. She said she was with ZF at the BMX track for a period of time. Perhaps with some exaggeration in a description of the movements Mr O’Connor’s car, there is other evidence, including evidence from Joel Shortland and Mr O’Conner themselves, regarding their departure from the scene which supports the essence of her claim that she believed she and ZF were menaced by the car in which Joel Shortland was present. Her arm being held up, as I said earlier, was an act of self preservation.
	
	
	In this context she frankly admitted that a motive for eventually confronting the Shortlands arose out of her anger and rage. I have taken that into account as it may have concentrated her mind as she approached the Shortlands. Her evidence clearly identifying ZF as present at the BMX track, provides evidence, or a reason as the Crown says, for ZF to be upset with the Shortlands and for ZF later to confront the Shortlands. Bearing in mind I accept her evidence that AJH was present and bearing in mind I accept what is clear from the evidence that AJH and ZF had a relationship through either blood or friendship there are reasons for AJH to be involved.
	
	
	There are reasons thus available from the evidence to conclude that ZF would have been aggrieved by the conduct of Mr O’Connor’s car. I bear in mind in that regard that the evidence is clear that ZF had no role to play in the direct negotiations between the Brearleys and Joel Shortland. It is clear that the young people at the BMX track associated with the Brearleys felt threatened by the presence of the Shortlands in their various forms.
	
	
	I am satisfied that ZF and AJH were there in support of the Brearley group, not necessarily to commit any criminal act. Ms Fitzpatrick’s evidence as I said earlier about the Brearleys being distressed had a ring of truth. It was not without some significance that all of the Shortland group from what I understand of the evidence, with the exception of Melissa Smith, were bigger than the people they confronted, and most of them were older. In the case of John Shortland substantially older.
	
	
	I paid very close attention to the manner in which Ms Fitzpatrick gave her evidence. In fact I stopped taking notes very early in her evidence, given that I would be provided with a transcript, and watched her evidence very closely. One of the problems with conducting a trial, where you are both Judge of the law and the fact, is that sometimes you can be distracted by the note taking involved. In my view, her evidence as to the presence of the two persons, and the way she gave her evidence, in conjunction with other evidence was truthful evidence, and given as such.
	
	
	What is interesting about her evidence is her claim, apparently without any ulterior motive disclosed, that JM was not present. That claim is in my view somewhat supported having regard to other evidence of a contradictory nature concerning his presence and/or involvement. I cannot find any motive for her to falsely implicate the two accused but exculpate JM. I am mindful the accused bear no onus in relation to this. There is certainly no obligation of counsel for the accused to put to her a motive, or to question her in relation to the matter. But it seemed to me that I am not assisted in this respect by her not being cross-examined about matters within the ethical duty of counsel that might reflect adversely upon her credibility in this regard. Of course counsel rely upon other aspects of her evidence that could not be accepted as reflecting upon her lack of credibility. Of course, what is to be balanced against that submission is her fundamental account of being present wielding a golf club is true. It is not a case of a witness putting themselves at the scene in circumstances where there is a real doubt that they were there. As I said, I am mindful that she did not see anybody armed with a weapon. This evidence may be in correct, it may be deliberately untruthful, it may be truthful given as I said her concentration on what she was doing.
	
	
	Even assuming that evidence is deliberately untruthful, warning myself in relation to the matter pursuant to s 165(1)(d) Evidence Act, and having given the evidence as I have noted under the protection of the ‘certificate’, the evidence itself does not, in the context of other evidence, render her essential account of their presence as untruthful or unreliable. Of course, every tribunal of fact, as I have warned myself, is entitled to accept some or other of the evidence of a particular witness. There is evidence of Joel Shortland and John Shortland that I have rejected. It is not because I found that they are untruthful, but I found that they are unreliable. If anything, in this matter concerning Ms Fitzpatrick, there was no element in her evidence concerning the attack upon the Shortlands of ‘gilding the lily’ or exaggerating the role of anybody else to in someway diminish her role in the matter.
	
	
	One of the reasons or rationales behind the warnings given in relation to people that are criminally concerned in a particular enterprise is that a person participating in a criminal enterprise has intimate knowledge of the facts, not only to falsely implicate others, but to diminish their own role, or in someway shift blame to others. This did not occur in her evidence. In any event I formed the view that she lacked the guile to invent a motive for the two accused to be present. Perhaps she thought by not nominating them as being in possession of any weapons that that would assist to exculpate them for all I know. There might be other reasons for her not seeing them with weapons or seeing anybody else with weapons in circumstances where clearly a sword was present.
	
	
	To get back to the absence of any reason to implicate the two accused falsely, she had absolutely no reason for exculpating JM falsely either. There is no suggestion she was in a relationship with Jm at any relevant time. Clearly at one particular time she was in the camp of ZF. That is the reason she armed herself with a golf club. Whether that relationship continues or not, I do not know, nothing has been raised about that matter.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	I cannot conclude definitively, how many men were involved in the assault upon the Shortlands. There were at least two. All present were there to confront the Shortlands, some armed, the others must have known they were armed. There is evidence establishing the possibility of other woman being present. But nobody seems to be identified or described with any confidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one person armed with a sword inflicted the injuries on John Shortland relevant to counts 1 and 2. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a second person took up the sword after the first person was knocked out or knocked down and that person wounded Joel Shortland. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, notwithstanding Joel Shortland’s evidence and some evidence from Mr O’Connor, that Joel Shortland was relevantly wounded by the first person. Although he says the first person struck him with a sword before he knocked him down. There is no reliable evidence to support his account of that event even in the evidence of Mr O’Connor.
	
	
	I am also mindful in assessing his credibility in that regard, the contradictory accounts he has given in relation to the role of JM. I have to bear in mind in relation to him and John Shortland that in their recollection of events, apart from their various discussions about what happened and who did what to whom, the events happened in a rush.
	
	
	There can be no doubt as a starting point that the character of the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon John Shortland was unlawful, as was the wounding of Joel Shortland. No issue of self defence arises. There can be no doubt that there was an unlawful confrontation with Joel and John Shortland at the relevant time. I am mindful of the number of blows struck against John Shortland and the number of blows struck against Joel Shortland, there were three distinctive wounds. Whether those wounds were caused by two or three blows I cannot conclude Joel Shortland says that they were three separate blows.
	
	
	The recognition of Shanaya Fitzpatrick by the Shortland group, with the exception of O’Connor, is confirmed by her subsequent admission of guilt of assaulting John Shortland. It may bolster the credibility of the recognition or identification or the similarity of the attackers with ZF and AJH. This is an aspect I raised with the Crown myself. It was a matter taken up by defence counsel. But it has to be borne in mind that so far as it might reflect upon the credibility of the observations made by John and Joel and Melissa, that aspect of the matter is considerably weakened when one considers that only one woman was directly involved and clearly performed separate recognisable acts towards Joel Shortland with a distinctive weapon. On the various versions of John and Joel up to three men were involved and thus for the purposes of identifying particular people performing particular acts there is potential for greater confusion.
	
	
	As the tribunal of fact sitting in Court seeing the three accused sitting in Court over a number of days it has not escaped my attention, as it would not escape a jury, that the three accused have some differences in appearance but they also have a number of similarities in appearance and height. Although I would have considered JM, no longer in the dock, as being shorter than the other two.
	
	
	In circumstances where one can have no confidence to the point of being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a particular witness is individually without contamination or suggestion reached a conclusion as to the description and/or recognition and/or identification or similarity of a particular person performing a particular act. It comes to pass that in accepting the presence of the two accused at the scene I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that even in conjunction with other circumstantial evidence identified by the Crown, that ZF was the first person with a sword and that AJH was the second swordsman. As I have said when I refer to the availability of evidence of similarity I am prepared to accept the process of the Shortlands satisfying themselves of that similarity, arises from a belief that the people shown in the photographs that they examined were at least similar in appearance to the people who participated in the attack.
	
	
	This brings us to the issue of the presence of one or other and possibly two other people at the scene. John Shortland’s evidence is of some significance in this regard. His evidence at one point is of two attackers that he saw and two people not participating in the attacks, except one person from those other two pulling the girl away. In fact this was the account given by Joel and John in December 2012.
	
	
	All this in my view establishes the reasonable possibility at least and in fact the probability, that there has been in the ascribing of responsibility to particular individuals a jump to conclusions which has contaminated the reliability of the distribution of blame. There is no admission available in the evidence of participation by the two accused. There is obviously no independent scientific evidence ascribing to an individual accused connection with any particular item. Thus, in all the circumstances I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to who was the first swordsman and who was the second swordsman. I have come to the conclusion beyond reasonable that the two accused were present and that having been said, bearing in mind I am satisfied in the circumstances of the case with their presence and other evidence, I am satisfied that they were relevantly involved in an affray given the essential account of assaults by the Shortlands, Ms Smith and O’Connor.
	
	
	I have turned to the question of whether having regard to the respective allegations I could conclude whether they were participating in a joint criminal enterprise, or being relevantly in company, as required to be proven to establish the charges. Joint criminal enterprise in relation to counts one and three, being in company primarily in relation to counts two and four.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the man with the sword was intending to use it either to threaten or strike one of the Shortland group. In the circumstances of the matter I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that person had at the time an intention to cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that John Shortland was struck first simply because he was the one who the group came across. However, I could not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the second person was relevantly in company for the purposes required to be established in relation to, count two, or was participating in a joint criminal enterprise as required in relation to count one.
	
	
	As I understand the evidence there is a reasonable possibility, in fact a very high probability, that the ‘second’ person was unarmed. There was no evidence of any agreement amongst the group to do any particular act of any reliance. If the second person went with the intention of backing up the first person it does not necessarily mean that he entered into an agreement required to be established or contemplated the relevant possibility that particular crimes would be committed relevant to counts one and two.
	
	
	What has not been removed beyond a reasonable doubt is the fact that the second person’s participation was prompted by the fact that Joel Shortland in effect disabled the first swordsman by knocking him to the ground. I am mindful of the fact that by picking up the sword the second person may not evidence his agreement to participate in a joint criminal enterprise, or was relevantly in company for the purposes of causing grievous bodily harm. But on the facts of this case at the time that he picked up the sword, counts one and two were completed offences. His reaction whether lawful or not was reasonably possible a response to an unforeseen event.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that relevantly his presence in all the circumstances proves beyond reasonable doubt what is required in respect of those matters to establish he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise or being in company to commit the crimes identified in Courts one or two.
	
	
	As it transpired that person did not attack John with the sword, but turned his attention to Joel. He then struck Joel in the manner that Joel described, causing the wounding, after the events giving rise to count one and two were completed.
	
	
	I note also in relation to the first person that once the second swordsman picked up the sword the first person did not participate any further. Perhaps he was unconscious for a period of time. Perhaps he was temporarily disabled, it does not matter. The only person who definitely further participated on the facts of the matter concerning events of course happening very quickly was Ms Fitzpatrick. She earlier has never been charged or at least convicted of participating in a joint criminal enterprise or acting in company to inflict grievous bodily harm or to wound Joel Shortland. I am satisfied in relation to the wounding of John Shortland that the wounding of him by the second man was a response to what happened to the first swordsman. The fact that it was a response subsequent to the unlawful act by the first swordsman does not necessarily prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the relevant agreement or relevantly acting in company in respect of counts one and two.
	
	
	It does not necessarily establish a relevant joint criminal enterprise to commit counts three and four or alternatively to be in company for the purposes of committing count four, that is because the second swordsman acted on his own without the assistance of the first swordsman. A reasonable possibility is the second swordsman was present, but embarked into the affray in circumstances where it emerged by committing a criminal act of his own volition in retribution for what Joel Shortland had done to his friend or relative.
	
	
	The first swordsman in my view in these circumstances could not be in company in respect of count four, or participating in a joint criminal enterprise in relation to count three if he was out of action, bearing in mind the circumstances of his confrontation with John Shortland.
	
	
	The same cannot be said of course of Shanaya Fitzpatrick. But her account demonstrates the reasonable possibility of several and separate criminal acts being committed in a short period of time connected by circumstance but separate as to liability.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the combination of circumstances and the direct evidence that both AJH and ZF were involved in the confrontation with John and Joel, performing separate roles. Ultimately, however, in respect of the offence of affray I am satisfied by their presence, by the evidence of yelling coming from the group generally, the clearly aggressive approach as evidenced by Shanaya Fitzpatrick, the fact that weapons were being carried by Shanaya and a male person and that weapons were used in the circumstances that they were present, that the elements required to be established in respect of the affray have been made out beyond reasonable doubt are sufficient to return verdicts of guilty in relation to count five.
	
	
	There can be no doubt given the evidence not disputed from John and Joel Shortland that there were acts of unlawful violence being used against John Shortland and Joel Shortland and the conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness as I have defined it, present at the scene, to fear for his personal safety, that matter not depending upon whether any of the Shortland group so feared for their personal safety.
