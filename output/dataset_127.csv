 District Judge Chiah Kok Khun:
Introduction
1       The plaintiff was riding his motorcycle no. JNU9053 along Admiralty Road West towards Woodlands on 29 September 2012. The defendant was driving taxi no. SH8107G along the same road but from the opposite direction. Admiralty Road West forms a T-junction with Woodlands Ave 8, at the point where one end of Woodlands Ave 8 intersects with Admiralty Road West. The T-junction is traffic light-controlled. The defendant was turning right from Admiralty Road West into Woodlands Ave 8 at the T-junction. It was about 3.30pm. Whilst the defendant was turning at the junction, a collision occurred between the Plaintiff’s motorcycle and the Defendant’s taxi. The Plaintiff’s was travelling along Admiralty Road West and straight across the junction. The plaintiff was injured. He claims against the defendant for the injuries suffered.
2       The plaintiff says the defendant is liable for causing the collision. The plaintiff’s case is that the traffic lights were green in his favour as he rode into the junction. He proceeded straight across the junction. The defendant’s taxi suddenly made a right turn in front of his motorcycle. The plaintiff did not expect the taxi to make the turn without giving way to him. He collided into the front left portion of the taxi.
[note: 1]
3       The defendant denies liability. He says that when he approached the junction the traffic lights were green in his favour. He slowed down to almost a halt. He was on the second lane from the right. Next to him on the first lane from the right was a van waiting to make a U-turn. Almost immediately after reaching the white stop line, the green turning arrow came on. The van proceeded to make the U-turn. The defendant checked for on–coming traffic and there was none. He turned right, across the junction. Whilst he was making the right turn the plaintiff collided into the left front of his taxi.
[note: 2]
Issue
4       There is only one issue in this case. It is a factual issue. What was the state of the traffic lights at the time of the accident? The plaintiff says it was green for him. The defendant states that it was green turning arrow in his favour. These are mutually exclusive positions. If it was green light for the plaintiff, the green turning arrow would not have appeared for the defendant. If the green arrow came on for the defendant, the traffic light for the plaintiff would not have been green for the Plaintiff. It would have turned red.
Analysis and findings
5       The plaintiff and the defendant were the only witnesses at the trial. This is a case of one person’s word against another. In such cases, the court relies heavily on the objective evidence. Unfortunately, the usual objective evidence in a motor accident case does not assist in this case. The damage pattern is consistent with either version of the accident. There is no evidence of the resting positions of the vehicles. I suspect even if there were, it would also be consistent with either version. This is because whichever the state of the lights, the collision would be the same in the present case. In other words, the manner of the collision would be the same on either version of the accident. Police investigations in this case were inconclusive.
6       The only objective evidence left to be considered is the contemporaneous documentation making reference to the accident. These would include the accident reports, the police reports and the medical reports. To these I turn.
7       The plaintiff lodged a police report on 22 Oct 2012 (“first report”), about 3 weeks after the accident.
[note: 3]
 In this report, the location of the accident was stated wrongly by the plaintiff. The name of the road where the accident took place was also stated wrongly (erroneously stated to be Senoko Avenue). The plaintiff stated in this report that he was on his way back to his work place (the name of his company was given in full in describing his workplace). This would mean that he would have been on the opposite side of the road.
8       When cross-examined in court, he said that the report was written by the police officer. All he did was to give his work permit to the police officer. He also told the officer the light was green in his favour.
[note: 4]
 The plaintiff said that the police officer then wrote the report. This implies that the police officer had the information on the accident. I considered whether it was such a case, where the plaintiff after tendering his work permit when making the report, he was not required to give a narration of the accident as the accident was already in the police records. On further reflection however, it would mean that the police record of the accident contained material errors. The location of the accident was wrong. The name of the road where the accident took place was also wrong. It was also stated that the plaintiff was on his way back to his work place and that would mean that the plaintiff would have been on the wrong side of the road. These are very basic information about the accident and important information for police investigations; as they indicate where the accident took place. Without any evidence that the police records indeed contained these errors, I find it difficult to accept that the police have made these mistakes. As there is also no evidence that the report was in fact written based on information in the possession of the police, the only finding I can make is that the report was written based on information given by the plaintiff.
9       The plaintiff confirmed in court that the first report was wrong.
[note: 5]
 He made a second police report on 29 Oct 2012 (“second report”). The plaintiff said he wanted to make the second report because he realised the first report was in error.
[note: 6]
 He brought a colleague to act as translator with him. In this report he stated he was travelling on Admiralty Road West going towards a hardware shop when the accident happened. He stated that the report was “
on the best of my knowledge
” and he was yet to confirm what happened. He also stated in the second report that he could not recall what actually happened during the collision. When he was cross-examined on the second report, he seemed uncertain about the content as he agreed with counsel that this report was wrong as well.
[note: 7]
10     The third document connected with the plaintiff’s version of the accident is the Motor Vehicle Claim Form filed by the plaintiff with his insurers Pacific & Orient Insurance Co Berhad (“claim form”). This was filed on or about 16 November 2012, after the second report.
[note: 8]
 In the claim form, the plaintiff stated he was going to work when the accident happened. This was in line with the first report, but not exactly so. It was stated in the first report that he was going 
back
 to his workplace, suggesting he had gone out from his workplace and was returning when the accident happened. Both of these versions were of course wrong. As noted above, it would mean the plaintiff was travelling on the opposite side of the road (same side as the defendant). The place of accident stated in the claim form was as in the first report (Senoko Avenue), which was also erroneous. The description of the accident was also as in the first report.
11     When crossed examined by counsel on the claim form, his response was that it was filled in for him. Counsel for the plaintiff suggests in his closing submissions (paragraph 13(f)) that the plaintiff’s insurers reproduced the first accident report in the claim form because the administrative staff at the insurers’ office filled the form based on the first report available to them. Reference was made by the plaintiff’s counsel to the transcript of the re-examination of the plaintiff.
[note: 9]
 A perusal of the portion of the transcript referred to shows that this was not so. In fact, the transcript shows that when the plaintiff was asked in re-examination by his counsel whether his insurers were given anything in order to fill the claim form, the plaintiff replied that “
I do not need to give them anything.
”
12     The fourth document that referred to the plaintiff’s version of the accident is a medical report dated 2 December 2012 (“medical report”).
[note: 10]
 The medical report was attached to the plaintiff’s statement of claim. It was stated in the medical report that, “
Patient was a motorcyclist who was hit from behind by a vehicle and landed on the windshield of the car.
” This version of the accident is of course very different from the versions in the other documents considered above. The description of the accident must have originated from the plaintiff. The medical report indicated that the plaintiff was alert when he was seen by the doctor at the hospital. The plaintiff did not suggest that someone else had described how the accident happened to the doctor. The author of the medical report was not called by the plaintiff to explain the description of the accident therein.
13     The fact of the different versions above is suggestive that the plaintiff did not know for sure how the accident happened. However, the plaintiff insists that whilst he could not recollect what happened after the collision, he was clear about how the accident happened.
[note: 11]
 This was emphasised in the plaintiff’s closing submissions.
[note: 12]
 He also reiterated it in his AEIC.
[note: 13]
 However, when he was cross-examined on the description of the accident in his AEIC, and it was suggested to him that his affidavit was wrong, he agreed that “
it’s wrong
”.
[note: 14]
14     In contrast, the defendant has stated a consistent version of the accident in all three different documents produced by him. These are his accident statement, his police report and his AEIC. He also gave a consistent version in court. The plaintiff’s counsel could only point out that the defendant’s sketch of Admiralty Road West shows a 3-lane road when it was in fact a 4 lane road. Even then, the defendant explained that the 3 lanes filtered out into 4 lanes at the turning point. As to whether the road became 4 lanes after the junction, the defendant said he was not travelling that way.
[note: 15]
 He had turned right before that, and the accident happened after he had turned right.
15     The defendant was questioned in court as to why he did not see the plaintiff’s motorcycle if he had looked for on-coming traffic just before he made the right turn. The defendant’s evidence was that it took about 3 seconds for him to move off from the turning pocket where he had stopped to the point the collision took place. He checked for on-coming traffic after the green arrow had appeared, looking out at least 10m to 20m ahead.
[note: 16]
 After that, he moved off to make the turn. He did not look again in the direction of the on-coming traffic as he was looking at the direction he was driving towards.
[note: 17]
 The plaintiff had said that he was travelling at 60km/h to 70km/h as he approached the junction. Looking at the junction in the photograph at PB11, the distance from the junction to the point where the line of sight ends is about 50 to 60 m. The road bends away beyond that. In other words, anyone travelling along Admiralty Road West towards the junction would not be seen from the junction until he is 50 to 60 m from the junction. This distance is corroborated by the evidence of the plaintiff who said that when he could see the traffic lights at the junction he would be at the point where the arrows are on the road (see PB 11). Going by the plaintiff’s stated speed of travel of 60km/h to 70km/h, in the 3 seconds that the defendant said he took to move from the turning pocket to the point of collision, the plaintiff would have covered at least 50m (16.7m to 19.4m per second). Therefore, it was conceivable that the plaintiff was not in the defendant’s line of sight when he checked for on-coming traffic before he turned. He then looked in the direction he was travelling as he made the turned. The traffic light was showing the green arrow in his favour and the defendant had done all that he could and should do in the circumstances.
Conclusion
16     As mentioned above, this is a case of one person’s word against another. I only have the documents making reference to the accident to differentiate the two versions. In view of my analysis of the documents above, I prefer the defendant’s case over the plaintiff’s case. All in all, the defendant has given a more consistent version of the accident. The question raised on behalf of the plaintiff as to why the defendant did not see the plaintiff’s motorcycle prior to the collision has been adequately answered by the defendant. There is also no evidence pointing to what more the defendant could have done to prevent the collision.
17     In the circumstances, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove his case on a balance of probability. I therefore dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. I will hear parties on costs.
