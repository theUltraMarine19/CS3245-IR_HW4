YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): 
 The facts 
 1.The appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted by the High Court of ten charges: four charges under s 377 Penal Code (Cap 224) for having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with a certain man (the first charge, fourth charge, seventh charge, and tenth charge), one charge under s 377 read with s 511 Penal Code for attempting carnal intercourse against the order of nature (the 13th charge), and five charges under s 377A Penal Code for committing acts of gross indecency with another male person. The appellant was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment on each of the four charges under s 377 Penal Code, five years` imprisonment on the charge under s 377 read with s 511 Penal Code, and one year`s imprisonment on each of the five charges under s 377A Penal Code. The terms of imprisonment on the four charges under s 377 Penal Code were ordered to run consecutively from the date of conviction, and the terms of imprisonment passed on the remaining six charges were to run concurrently with the terms of imprisonment passed on the four charges under s 377. In all the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of 40 years with effect from 29 April 1997, the date when he was remanded in prison. For the purposes of sentencing, the learned judge took into consideration, with the consent of the appellant, ten charges under s 377, and 20 charges under s 377A Penal Code. He appealed against the sentences on the ground that the total sentence was manifestly excessive. We dismissed the appeal and confirmed the total sentence of 40 years` imprisonment. We now set out our reasons.
 2.The charges arose out of a series of sexual abuses inflicted by the appellant on five young victims. The appellant was a irrepressible paedophile who had repeatedly committed offences of having carnal intercourse against the order of nature and committed acts of gross indecency on five school-going boys between the ages of 8 and 12 years at the time of the commission of the offence. All the boys attended the same primary school. (We will refer to the victims as V1 to V5.) The appellant had accepted all the facts in the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution. The modus operandi of the appellant in the commission of each offence was similar and this was a horrific case of how a paedophile systematically manipulated and abused the trust placed in him by the five naive young boys and then had them subjected to humiliating and unnatural carnal intercourse with him in order to satisfy his perverse sexual instincts.
 3.
 V1 and V2
The 1st, 4th, 16th and 20th charges on which the appellant were convicted related to V1 and V2. They were aged 12 years and 10 years respectively when the offences were committed by the appellant. They were brothers and attended the same primary school. In September 1995, the appellant befriended the two brothers when they were playing computer games at an amusement centre. He subsequently offered to become their informal guardian and the two children regarded him as their `godfather`. During the period of their association with him, the appellant built up their trust by bringing them to fun-filled outings in Sentosa and East Coast and giving them free tuition at their home in an HDB flat. He even approached the boys` father who not only consented to him acting as an informal guardian to the two boys but even allowed him, after some initial reluctance, to stay with the family. (The boys` mother was deceased.) He occupied the servants` room in the flat and this unfortunately facilitated his sexual abuse of the boys. Prior to his moving into the flat, he would visit the boys` flat at the times when their father was not present, and persuade them to engage in sexual acts with him.
 4.In respect of the first charge, in October 1995, the appellant had unnatural carnal intercourse in the form of anal sex with V1 at the boys` flat. The appellant visited V1 at the flat when V1 returned home from school in the afternoon, and persuaded him reluctantly to have anal sex in the master bedroom. V2 (V1`s brother) who was at the flat followed the two of them into the master bedroom and witnessed what happened. V1 protested because the acts of intercourse caused him great pain but the appellant ignored him and continued with the act.
 5.The circumstances surrounding the 16th and 20th charges (committing acts of gross indecency with another male person) were even more appalling. This also took place in October 1995 after the appellant already had unnatural sexual intercourse with V1. V2 and the appellant were performing oral sex at the victims` flat when V1 came home from school in the afternoon and witnessed the incident. The appellant then persuaded V1 to perform oral sex with him. V1 reluctantly acquiesced and the appellant performed oral sex with him. The appellant then promised the boys that he would purchase gifts of computer games for them as a reward.
 6.In respect of the fourth charge, in November 1995, the appellant arranged to bring the two boys to NTUC Chalets at Pasir Ris Close on an outing. This sadly provided an opportunity for the appellant to indulge in his sexual perversions again. The appellant persuaded V2 to have anal sex with him. When the appellant began the act, V2 protested repeatedly that it caused him great pain. However the appellant ignored him and continued with the act.
 7.Subsequently, when the appellant moved into the victims` flat, anal intercourse and fellatio continued between the appellant and the two victims until September 1996. Both V1 and V2 were warned not to disclose their sexual relationship with the appellant to anyone else.
 8.
 V3 and V4
V3 and V4 were the complainants in respect of the 7th, 13th, 22nd and 36th charges on which the appellant was convicted. V3 and V4 were brothers, attending the same primary school as V1 and V2. V2 and V3 were classmates. At the time of the commission of the offences, V3 was aged 10 and V4 was aged 8. V2 had invited V3 to V2`s flat to do his homework where V3 met the appellant. V3 gradually got to spend a considerable amount of time with V1, V2 and the appellant. The appellant would bring all the boys to outings at the amusement arcade centres, East Coast and Kallang River. Again he sought the trust and confidence of V3`s parents by first seeking their permission prior to bring V3 on some of the outings. Subsequently the appellant even gave free tuition to V3 with the consent of V3`s parents, who could not have afforded private tuition for their son.
 9.In May 1996, V3 was at V1`s flat to complete some homework when he witnessed V1 committing oral sex with the appellant. The appellant then persuaded V3 to perform fellatio on him. V3 reluctantly acquiesced when the appellant promised him that he would be allowed to play with computer games. The first incident of fellatio formed the subject matter of the 22nd charge. After the first incident of fellatio with the appellant, V3 agreed to perform fellatio whenever requested by the appellant, including one forming the subject matter of the 23rd charge. In respect of the 7th charge, on 6 September 1996, the appellant had anal intercourse with V3 after V3 had performed fellatio on him.
 10.V4 first met the appellant when his elder brother V3 brought him there for free tuition in May 1996. The first sexual encounter took place when both V3 and V4 spent the night at V2`s flat together with the appellant. It was after midnight when the appellant woke V4 and persuaded V4 to perform fellatio on him. V4 acquiesced after some persuasion. In respect of the 13th charge, the appellant brought V4 to V2`s flat and persuaded him to perform fellatio on him. Whilst performing oral sex, the appellant wanted to have anal intercourse with V4. When V4 refused, the appellant threatened to cane him. V4 eventually agreed on fear on being caned. However, when V4 complained of unbearable pain before the appellant could achieve penetration, the appellant desisted immediately.
 11.
 V5
V5 was aged 11 years and was a classmate of V2 and V3. He was first introduced to the appellant when V5 came to V2`s flat to do his homework. V5 similarly received free tuition from the appellant on the recommendation of V2. In fact the appellant had met V5`s parents who were suitably impressed by him and allowed their son to have tuition from him. It was not long before V5 became one of the victims of the appellant. In late August 1996, after the appellant had brought the victims on an outing, the appellant offered to bathe V5, in spite of the fact that V5 was already 11 years old and was quite capable of taking his bath unassisted. Whilst both were in the bathroom, the appellant persuaded V5 to have unnatural carnal intercourse with him. V5 agreed reluctantly and the appellant performed anal intercourse on him.
 12.All these cases of sexual abuse only came to light when one of V2`s classmates learnt about V2`s relationship with the appellant and informed his parents. The classmate`s father lodged a complaint with the school principal who confronted V2. V2 narrated the history of his relationship with the appellant. The principal then sought the assistance of the police and a police report was made. On 6 November 1996, the appellant was arrested and he readily confessed to the offences committed. He was examined by the Registrar of Woodbridge Hospital (Dr Liow Pei Hsiang) who diagnosed him as having paedophilia of the exclusive type and recommended hormonal therapy. The appellant refused hormonal therapy and opted for psychological treatment with a psychologist. However, the appellant discontinued the treatment after four sessions with the psychologist. Against this background, the prosecution pressed for a deterrent sentence against the appellant.
 13.The appellant had previous convictions for similar offences. On 7 October 1988, he was convicted of two counts under s 377 of committing unnatural carnal intercourse as well as one count of gross indecency with another male person under s 377A. Three counts under s 377 and three counts under s 377A were taken into consideration. All four victims were between 9 to 12 years and were known to the appellant either through his giving tuition to them or through activities at the Church. He was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each charge under s 377 (to run concurrently) and to six months on the charge under s 377A (to run consecutively with the other sentences), ie he was sentenced to 15 months` imprisonment. On 8 September 1993, he was convicted on two counts of gross indecency with another male person under s 377A and sentenced to 16 months` imprisonment on each charge, both charges to run consecutively. Two charges under s 377A were taken into consideration. Again the victim was a nine year old boy to whom the appellant had been giving tuition.
 14.
 The appeal against sentence
This is a case of a paedophile who abused the trust and confidence placed by the young victims in him and who had callously manipulated their innocence to satisfy his perverse sexual instincts. In the oral judgment delivered by the learned judge, he took into account the medical reports on the appellant`s paedophilic condition, and the psychiatrist`s report on the psychological harm the five victims suffered as a result of the appellant`s acts. He took into account the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the ten charges, but held that as the recidivism rate of a paedophile was very high, and he was very likely to commit such offences on his release, he should be incarcerated for a very long period of time.
 15.In addressing the question of whether the individual sentence imposed on the appellant on each charge under s 377 Penal Code was manifestly excessive, we would lay down some guidelines governing the sentencing for the offence of unnatural carnal intercourse involving children as victims, as well as set out the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors for such offences. These guidelines should not be taken as all-embracing or exhaustive. We emphasise that these guidelines would not apply in cases of offences of unnatural carnal intercourse committed between two consenting adults, which would carry wholly different considerations.
 16.
 Unnatural carnal intercourse with children
We first set out the legislative framework for offences under s 377 and s 377A Penal Code. Consent is irrelevant for a charge under s 377 or s 377A, as held by the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Kwan Kwong Weng
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 697
 . It is still an offence for two consenting adults to indulge in unnatural carnal intercourse. Some guidance as to what amounts to unnatural carnal intercourse is found in 
 Kwan Kwong Weng 
. For example, fellatio and cunnilingus are regarded as unnatural carnal intercourse within s 377 except where couples who engage in consensual sexual intercourse willingly indulge in fellatio and cunnilingus as a stimulant to their respective sexual urges. The position in England is different in that under the Sexual Offenders Act 1967, following Parliament`s adoption of the Wolfenden Report (
 Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution 
, Cmnd 247, 1957), a homosexual act between two consenting adults in private is no longer an offence. Be that as it may, in Singapore, Parliament has chosen to adhere to the position that unnatural carnal intercourse, including homosexual acts between two consenting adults in private, is an offence.
 17.Section 377 Penal Code reads as follows: 
Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 18.Section 377A Penal Code reads as follows: 
Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.
 19.Section 511 Penal Code provides that where a person is convicted of an attempt to commit an offence punishable by the Penal Code with imprisonment, and where there is no express provision made by the Penal Code (as is the case here), he is to be punished with such punishment as is provided for the offence, provided that the term of imprisonment imposed shall not exceed one-half of the longest term provided for the offence. In effect, the maximum punishment on a charge under s 377 read with s 511 Penal Code is ten years` imprisonment, since the practice prior to 
Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 643
  was to take life imprisonment to mean 20 years. The Court of Appeal in 
 Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah 
 held that the reference to life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant that the sentence was for imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person`s natural life. However the decision was expressed to be a prospective one, ie the interpretation should affect only offences committed after the pronouncement which was on 20 August 1997. All the offences committed by the appellant took place prior to 20 August 1997, and hence the old practice of 20 years` imprisonment for offences carrying `imprisonment for life` continued to apply in this case.
 20.The Penal Code does not have separate provisions for punishment for the offence of unnatural carnal intercourse involving children and involving adults. In both cases, the maximum punishment under s 377 is imprisonment of life. However, the starting position must be that where the victims are vulnerable children, the offence becomes much more serious and the punishment meted on such offenders has to reflect the gravity of the offence. The punishment for rape offences is much more serious where the victim is below 14 years and sexual intercourse takes place without her consent. Section 376(1) Penal Code provides that the maximum punishment for rape is imprisonment for life and the offender will also be liable to fine or to caning. Section 376(2) goes on to provide that the offender who commits rape by having sexual intercourse with a girl below 14 years of age without her consent is subject to a minimum punishment for a term of not less than eight years and shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes. Even in England, it is still an offence to commit buggery on a boy aged below 16 years; the Wolfenden Report took the firm view of the necessity of protection of the young, despite the fact that it took the view that criminal law is not concerned with private morals or ethical means. Under s 12 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 1956 read with Second Schedule, Part I, the maximum punishment for buggery of a boy below 16 years is imprisonment for life.
 21.
 Harm to the victims 
 Social danger 
In considering the appropriate tariffs for sentences, the gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed had to be taken into account. . Gravity of the offence:
 (1). . The harm to the victims includes both the physical and the emotional harm. The physical injury may be caused as the direct result of penetration of the victim`s anus (as in this case), which may be exceedingly painful. Where the victims are very young, it may leave them for life with embarrassing disabilities, as noted in the Wolfenden Report. In addition, the victims are exposed to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. What is of greater concern is that violence or threats of violence may be used to compel the victims to submit to the offender. Where violence or threats of injury are used, the punishment should be more severe to deter offenders from re-offending. The long-term emotional harm and psychological scars to the victims cannot be underestimated, though there has been caution in 
R v Willis
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 146
 that the courts should not readily assume that the victims will later develop homosexuality in life because they have been sexually abused when young. Much will also depend on the support the victims receive from their families.
 (2). . Paedophilic offences are by their nature unpleasant and most distressing and the society has to express its marked disapproval for such harm to the young and vulnerable victims. The presumption is that the safety of the child must be paramount and chronic paedophiles who have a propensity to re-offend, because they are either totally unable or unwilling to control themselves, have to be put away for long periods.
 22.We referred to previous cases where the offenders had been convicted and sentenced under s 377 Penal Code. In 
PP v Norli bin Jasmani
 (Unreported) , Rubin J sentenced the offender to three years` imprisonment for each of the three charges under s 377 and nine years` imprisonment with caning in respect of the rape charge. The complainant was a young girl aged 12 years at the time of the commission of the offence. The sentence for the rape offence and one of the three sentences under s 377 charge were ordered to run consecutively. The prosecution relied on 
PP v Sikendar Sellamarican
 (Unreported) , where the accused pleaded guilty and was convicted on two counts under s 377 for committing fellatio with a 13 year old boy; he was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment on each charge and the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. He had a previous conviction for similar offences of unnatural carnal intercourse with two young victims. Unfortunately there have been very few cases where grounds of decision have been given for the sentences imposed for offences under s 377 involving child victims.
 23.We were of the view that the guidelines relating to sentencing rape offenders are relevant and helpful. After all the offence of unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of anal intercourse) represents the gravest form of sexual abuse. It is unfortunate that no provision has been made for caning for offences under s 377 Penal Code, in contrast to rape offences. Anal intercourse constituted by penetration of the anus contains, by its very act, an element of violence. In England, the offence of buggery of a boy below 16 years and the offence of rape carry the maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Under the UK Sexual Offences Act 1956, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, a man who has sexual intercourse (anal) with another man without his consent commits rape and is charged accordingly. The legislature had chosen to depart from the English case law found in 
 R v Wall 
 (1990) 11 Cr App R (S) 111 which held that non-consensual buggery between adults should not be treated as one of rape, due to the risk that the seriousness of rape would be diminished. In Singapore, the guidelines for sentencing rape offenders are found in 
Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
 , where the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the starting point is ten years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
 24.Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from the position that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of anal intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without any aggravating or mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years` imprisonment. There should not be any difference whether the victim is a young girl or a young boy. The court would then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in increasing or reducing the sentence. Second or repeat offenders who are demonstrated to be a menace to society should be sentenced to a far longer period. We again emphasise that these sentencing guidelines do not necessarily apply to unnatural carnal intercourse between two consenting adults.
 25.
 Abuse of trust and authority 
 Moral corruption 
 R v Willis 
We considered the relevant circumstances of the offence in placing a particular offence according to its relative gravity. . Circumstances in which the offences are committed:
 (1). . Where an offender is placed in a position of trust by the parents or by the victims, the breach of trust justifies a substantial sentence on the ground of general deterrence. All those who have charge of children cannot abuse their positions for the sake of gratifying their sexual urges.
 (2). . Where the offender has enticed or cajoled the victims to indulge in unnatural carnal intercourse by the promise of gifts (for example, money) this has a very corrupting effect on the young victims, especially adolescents: . This should be reflected by a more severe sentence.
 26.Turning to the present case, there was no doubt that the appellant had committed a series of very grave offences against the victims. Not only was physical harm caused to the victims (as a direct result of penetration of the anus), but the victims had complained that the experience was exceedingly painful. The appellant also threatened V4 with physical violence to compel V4 to succumb to the offence. All the victims were examined by psychiatrists from the Child Guidance Clinic and they opined that they would require long-term counselling although they were responding well to treatment.
 27.Turning to the circumstances in which the offences were committed, none of the offences committed by the appellant were committed on the spur of the moment. All the incidents, the subject of all the charges, showed how he had carefully and calculatedly expended time and effort to build up trust and confidence in him by the young victims and their parents. He appeared to the parents be a pleasant young man who liked children and seemed genuinely interested in their welfare; there was no way for the unsuspecting parents to think that he was in any way sexually deviant. At present, it is neither possible nor practical to impose long-term compulsory supervision on him if he is released early into the community.
 28.The method of operation of the appellant in not only the present case but also in his previous convictions showed that he was a highly resourceful and clever man whose activities would prove difficult to detect and stop. He was likely to find innovative ways to gain access to children. The case also showed that, once he managed to get the victim to succumb to him, it would be the beginning of a long period of sexual abuse. Gifts of computer games and other toys would be given as rewards to cajole and persuade them to consent to unnatural carnal intercourse. The sexual abuse of the first two victims took place repeatedly for more than a year, and it intensified when the appellant was allowed to stay with the victims in their flat.
 29.Further, the appellant had previous convictions for having unnatural carnal intercourse under s 377, as well as for gross indecency under s 377A. What was crucial here was that the appellant had shown that he was a dangerous and clever offender who targeted a particular class of victims, ie young boys who were known to him initially under respectable circumstances, for example through church activities. For his earlier offence he was sentenced to 15 months` imprisonment. Shortly after his release in 1992, however, he again committed acts of gross indecency with a young victim to whom he was giving private tuition, and was sentenced to a total of 32 months` imprisonment. Again, just three months after his release from prison, the appellant began a course of conduct of sexual abuse towards the first and second victims in the present proceedings. The previous convictions for similar offences under similar circumstances were aggravating factors which weighed heavily against him. The court`s immediate concern must be to protect other potential young victims from him.
 30.On appeal, the appellant told this court that he had been molested as a child by a man, and he wanted to sexually abuse other young boys as a form of perverse revenge on society. In view of this, it was plainly impossible for the court to believe that he had been in any way reformed or was remorseful for his past deeds. If the appellant deliberately chose not to control his sexual urges and sexually abused the children, it only heightened the wickedness of the offences. Both the psychological report and the psychiatrist`s report on the appellant were tendered in court. The reports were not encouraging. In the psychiatrist`s report, he was described as one who lacked a supportive family environment and, more disturbingly, most of his close friends turned out to be his potential victims. The appellant received cognitive behaviour therapy since his arrest in November 1996 but the therapy was discontinued after four sessions by the appellant.
 31.There were no significant mitigating factors in this case. The learned judge had found, rightly in our opinion, that paedophilia is not a disease or a physical illness but is a disorder. According to the 
 American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
 (3rd Ed, 1980), paedophilia is a condition where there is recurrent and intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or sexual activities involving prepubertal children. Even if paedophilia is an illness, we reject any suggestion that the sufferer cannot help it and therefore carries only a diminished responsibility for his actions. There is no evidence that paedophiles cannot exercise a high degree of responsibility and self-control. The learned judge found that the appellant had a choice of whether to commit paedophilic offences against the victims, and chose to do so. The psychiatrist who examined the appellant expressed the opinion that treatment of paedophilia was difficult. Given the high recidivism rate of offenders, the learned judge took the view that the appellant had to be removed from society for a long period of time.
 32.The appellant pleaded guilty to the offences charged and spared the victims from the further trauma of testifying had it been a contested trial. He readily confessed to the commission of the offences. While the plea of guilt is a relevant consideration, the protection of the public is an exception to the general rule that the plea of guilt will entitle the convicted person to a discount. We reaffirm the views on sentencing in 
Fu Foo Tong v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
 .
 33.In 
 Fu Foo Tong v PP 
, Karthigesu JA held at p 455: 
The mitigation of a plea of guilty is another matter. However there is a misconception that must be dispelled. It is not axiomatic that every plea of guilty `entitles`, as it was contended by counsel to a discount of between one-quarter to one-third of what might otherwise be considered an appropriate sentence after a trial. A plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence overwhelmingly supports a conviction.
 34.In our judgment the learned judge`s observation that `though pleading guilty must be given effect to in determining sentence, it must depend on the facts of each and every case` is perfectly proper and correct. For example, in a rape case, where the trauma of the victim having to recount the rape in evidence is saved, a plea of guilty might be considered as justifying an appropriate discount to the sentence that might have been passed after a trial. But there is always the public interest to be considered.
 35.The learned judge`s imposition of a sentence of ten years` imprisonment on each of the four charges under s 377 could not be regarded in any way as manifestly excessive. The public protection justifies a long-term incarceration. In future, chronic paedophiles (such as the appellant) who are shown to be unable or unwilling to control themselves and who target children as victims should be sentenced to life imprisonment and if the offences have taken place after 20 August 1997, it would mean imprisonment for the remainder of the prisoner`s natural life. Similarly there is no reason to interfere with the learned judge`s decision to sentence the appellant to five years` imprisonment for attempting carnal intercourse under s 377 read with s 511 Penal Code on the grounds that it is manifestly excessive.
 36.Neither is there reason to interfere with the learned judge`s decision to sentence the appellant to imprisonment for a period of one year in respect of each of the five charges under s 377A Penal Code. The maximum punishment under s 377A is imprisonment for two years. The statement of facts pertaining to the charges under s 377A showed that the appellant had committed oral sex or fellatio with the five young victims.
 37.We also addressed the question of whether the sentences under s 377 should be ordered to run consecutively or concurrently. Under s 18 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted must order that the sentences for at least two of the offences shall run consecutively. In 
Maideen Pillai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 161
 , it was held that the sentencing court had the discretion as to which and how many of the sentences ought to run consecutively, and there was no absolute rule precluding the court from making more than two of the sentences consecutive, although a decision to go beyond the stated minimum of two consecutive sentences should be taken only in exceptional cases. In addition, the sentencing court, in exercising its discretion to impose consecutive sentences, should have regard to the principle of the `one transaction rule` and the totality principle. Both principles are subject to s 18 CPC.
 38.The `one transaction rule` provides that where two or more offences were committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive. This principle was not applicable here since all the four charges ordered to run consecutively were concerned with separate and distinct offences; they were committed on different occasions involving different victims.
 39.The remaining question was whether the four sentences in respect of the s 377 charges should be ordered to run concurrently. The High Court in 
 Maideen Pillai 
and the Court of Appeal in 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
  adopted the totality principle as defined by DA Thomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing 
 (2nd Ed, 1979), at pp 57-58: 
The many decisions of the court in which the totality principle has been applied explain the reduction of a cumulative sentence made up of correctly calculated individual parts suggest that the principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.
 40.The totality principle applies to a persistent offender as much as to any other category of offender: 
 R v Cooper 
 (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 295. In 
 Kanagasuntharam 
, where the accused committed rape and hurt and had a previous conviction for rape, the court held that an aggregate sentence of 22 years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was not a crushing one. In 
 Fu Foo Tong v PP 
, the first and second appellants were convicted on six counts of gang robbery and were sentenced to eight years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each count. A number of other charges were taken into consideration. The maximum punishment for gang robbery under s 395 Penal Code is 20 years` imprisonment and caning with not less than 12 strokes. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively except that the sentences on two charges were to run concurrently with the sentences on another two charges, and hence each offender was sentenced to a total of 32 years` imprisonment. It was held that the aggregate of the punishment was a crushing one and the appeal against sentence was allowed. In 
R v Blake
 
[1962] 2 QB 377
, the court upheld consecutive maximum sentences totaling 42 years where the accused had passed on top secret information to a then hostile foreign power for nine years.
 41.In the present case, the sentence on each charge was not manifestly excessive when viewed in isolation. The offender was aged 29 years. If he was imprisoned for 40 years, he would only be 55 years old when released, if he obtained a one-third remission for good behaviour whilst in prison. The learned judge did take into consideration the overall effect of the aggregate sentence imposed, but held that the offences which the offender had committed were very grave and the preventive and deterrent aspects of punishment were very important. In so doing, the sentences could not be said to be wrong in principle in view of the appellant`s antecedents, the total number of charges taken into consideration, and the nature and circumstances of the offences. It could not be said that the sentence was a crushing one or one that was not in keeping with his record and prospects. The result was that we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of imprisonment of 40 years.",1998-01-05 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 In the court below, the appellant was convicted by the district judge Abdul Rahim bin Abdul Jalil on the following charge: 
DAC 30098/96
 
You,
 
Daw Aye Aye Mu @ Daw Aye Than, f/42 yrs
 
(Passport No 147643, Nationality: Myanmese)
 
are charged that you, on or about 8 May 96 to 27 June 96, at Budget Lodge, 77 Loewen Road, Singapore, did abet one Ng Ching Yong in the employment of San Lwin, a Myanmese national, as a maintenance staff cum worker supervisor, being a person who had overstayed in Singapore in contravention of the provisions of s 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act, read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the Immigration Act.
 There was another charge against the appellant of employing one Maung Tun Hlaing (Maung) but she was acquitted on that charge. The trial was a joint trial with one Ng Chin Yong (Ng) whom the appellant was alleged to have abetted in the employment of San Lwin and Maung. The district judge found Ng guilty of employing both San Lwin and Maung. Ng did not appeal. The appellant appealed against her conviction.
 2.
 The prosecution`s evidence
San Lwin arrived in Singapore on 23 April 1996. He was given a social visit pass which entitled him to stay in Singapore for 14 days. He said that he came to Singapore to seek employment as he had some relatives including a younger brother in Singapore.
 3.San Lwin first met the appellant in a taxi stand at Orchard Road on 2 May 1996. While queuing at the taxi stand, he had heard someone speaking Burmese. This turned out to be the appellant. San Lwin therefore asked the appellant whether she was Burmese and she said yes and a gentleman who was with the appellant then proceeded to give San Lwin her address and contact number.
 4.San Lwin called the appellant the next day and asked her whether there were any job opportunities and he was told to bring all his particulars when he came to visit her. He did so on 4 May 1996 at the appellant`s house in Geylang. After looking at San Lwin`s papers which comprised a diploma certificate of civil engineering and his resumes, the appellant told him that his papers were good enough to apply for an employment pass. He also showed the appellant his passport. San Lwin passed $200 and his documents to the appellant to apply for an employment pass for him.
 5.According to San Lwin, after he had shown his papers to the appellant, she informed him that she was going to see one employer and she asked him to follow her. However, at that first place the employer was not around so he was then brought to a hotel at 77 Loewen Road (Budget Lodge). He went there with the appellant and two other persons who were also waiting for job vacancies.
 6.At Budget Lodge he met one William Chen (William). San Lwin said that he saw the appellant discussing about jobs for the other two persons with William. San Lwin also met a Filipino lady, Zaiton bte Abdullah alias Angeline R Acoreba (Vangie) at Budget Lodge. She was the receptionist there. According to San Lwin, Vangie persuaded him to work for them as she said that he spoke better English than the other two persons.
 7.San Lwin said that when Vangie asked him to work for them the appellant said that it was his decision. He worked for only one day and was paid $35. He worked until 8pm carrying mattresses from downstairs to the rooms upstairs. San Lwin said that he met Ng on that day as well but he did not speak to him.
 8.After he had finished his day`s work at Budget Lodge, San Lwin went back to the appellant`s house in Geylang. He was then told by the appellant that they did not require a civil engineer which was what San Lwin was. It seemed that the company only required an electrical engineer. San Lwin did not receive any money after he had finished the work and he informed the appellant of this but the appellant told him that he had not completed the work yet and he had to go back to continue it and only after the completion of the work would he get paid. He said that he had given the $200 to the appellant with the understanding that if he could not obtain the civil engineering job, she would be searching for another job for him and therefore he could not ask for the money to be returned to him.
 9.San Lwin said that he had shown his passport to William and Vangie before his visit pass expired. They told him that they liked his work and asked him to move into Budget Lodge, which he did on 6 May 1996. As his social visit pass was due to expire on 7 May 1996 William asked him to extend his pass but his application to extend his pass was rejected. San Lwin also testified that Ng had asked him for his passport two or three times but he had told Ng that his passport was kept with his brother. According to San Lwin, he thought that Ng had asked him for his passport as it was normal practice to see if he had overstayed. San Lwin further stated that he did not know Ng`s role in Budget Lodge but that Ng often came to Budget Lodge and he used to brief and instruct William and Vangie and at times he slept in his own room in the hotel.
 10.San Lwin testified that he worked at the hotel from 5 May 1996 till he was arrested on 27 June 1996. During that period, he worked as a foreman and interpreter for the other workers. He said that he received instructions from Vangie and sometimes from William. Ng also instructed him once or twice a week.
 11.In total San Lwin received three payments for his work. He said that, as he was new, he had to ask the appellant for help to settle his salary. The appellant then came to the hotel on 20 May 1996 and paid him his salary for ten days which amounted to $350. William paid him another $350 at the end of May and then he received a third payment of $300 on 10 June 1996 from Ng.
 12.San Lwin said that he did not see the appellant regularly but he knew that she came to the hotel once in two weeks. She usually came to the hotel with other Myanmese. In all, he saw her three times.
 13.On 27 June 1996, San Lwin was fixing an air-conditioner in the hotel when he was arrested. He was charged in court for overstaying for 52 days. He pleaded guilty on 29 June 1996 and was fined $2,500 in default two months` imprisonment.
 14.Vangie also gave evidence. She said that she was introduced to Ng by a Filipino friend, Mercy. During the first week of May 1996, she had a misunderstanding with her husband and Mercy told her that there were vacancies at Budget Lodge. She had sought temporary accommodation there. While she was there Ng had asked her to help him manage the place and she agreed. She then worked at Budget Lodge as a receptionist.
 15.Vangie said that she understood Ng to be the owner of Budget Lodge. This was because he attended to most of the matters in the hotel and contracts concerning the hotel were negotiated by him. Ng came to the Budget Lodge office everyday and collected the income from the guests and also checked on the workers whenever he came. She considered William to be her colleague. His name was used in financial transactions. He was the person who signed the cheques and documents, also the company was registered in his name and he was also the lessee under the tenancy agreement for the building where Budget Lodge was housed.
 16.Vangie said that she knew the appellant as she often came to Budget Lodge to bring in part time workers from Myanmar. The appellant usually came to Budget Lodge as often as four times a week. Besides part time workers, the appellant also brought in some of the regular workers at Budget Lodge, from Myanmar.
 17.Vangie said that she knew San Lwin from Budget Lodge. He did mainly handyman work and general supervising services as well as acting as an interpreter for his fellow workers who did not know English well. She came to know San Lwin a week or two after she started work at Budget Lodge. San Lwin had been brought to Budget Lodge by the appellant and, after an interview, he started work there the next day. She was not involved in the interview between San Lwin, Ng and the appellant. Vangie said that usually it was Ng who gave instructions and, when he was not around, she would give the instructions.
 18.Vangie said that Ng gave the salaries to the appellant to distribute among the workers. She had only seen the appellant paying San Lwin his salary once and she did not know what happened after that. Ng and San Lwin had discussed his salary. She knew this as San Lwin had approached her as he was wondering how much the other workers were receiving from the appellant.
 19.
 The defence`s evidence
The appellant testified that many employment agencies would contact her husband and herself to seek employment of Myanmar nationals. Myanmar nationals who had come to Singapore would also approach her, seeking her help to obtain employment. The appellant said that she was approached by San Lwin around May 1996 at a taxi stand. She said that she gave him her contact number as she understood that he was a civil engineer and she thought she would have a vacancy for such a post.
 20.Subsequently, San Lwin contacted her as he had no money and needed a job as well as accommodation. She told him that there was a place which would cost him $10 per day. She suggested that he go for an interview to apply for an employment pass or work permit. When San Lwin came to her premises in Geylang, he had shown her his educational certificates and his passport. She noticed that he had been given a fourteen days social visit pass and that there was still a period of a few days before the pass expired.
 21.According to the appellant, she had brought San Lwin along with two other Myanmar nationals to Budget Lodge. She had been told by the employer at Budget Lodge that they would test him for one or two days first. She said that at Budget Lodge, Ng had interviewed San Lwin and she was present at the interview as she had to interpret. After two days, San Lwin came to her house and told her that Ng and Vangie had promised him that they would apply for an employment pass for him, and he was to inform the appellant once he got it.
 22.The appellant then said that she did not know that San Lwin had obtained an employment pass through Budget Lodge as San Lwin did not contact her subsequently. As for any money she was alleged to have paid to San Lwin, she said that she had just returned $200 to him. This money had been given by him to her for the employment pass fees if it was approved. She said that as his employment pass was not approved, she returned the $200 to him. She said that when she returned the money to San Lwin he had told her that he had extended his social visit pass.
 23.In cross-examination, the appellant said that the first time she had been to Budget Lodge was when she brought San Lwin there. She had actually intended to bring San Lwin to see another employer but the employer was not in, so she had brought him to Budget Lodge to look for cheap accommodation as well as to look for employment. Although the appellant had earlier testified that it was Ng who had interviewed San Lwin, in cross-examination she said that it was William and Vangie who had interviewed him. She said that she thought that Vangie was the person who could employ people on behalf of Budget Lodge.
 24.The appellant said in cross-examination that, when she arranged for interviews for Myanmar workers, she would only check their immigration status if they showed her their papers as it was a kind of trust as both of them were of the same nationality. She said that she would check their immigration status if they passed the employer`s interview and she had to submit their applications for employment passes.
 25.The appellant had seen San Lwin`s passport earlier and had known that he was on a social visit pass which was going to expire in a few days. In cross-examination it was suggested that therefore she must have known that San Lwin had overstayed in Singapore and yet he was still under the employment of Budget Lodge. The appellant said however that she did not know that he had overstayed as he had told her that he had been given another 14 days on his social visit pass. However, she had not checked his passport to see if this was true. He had told her that Budget Lodge would take care of his immigration status.
 26.Overall, the appellant`s defence appeared to be that she had just brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge to look for cheap accommodation. When he was there he had been interviewed by William and Vangie and they had said that they would test him out for a day or two but after that everything that happened was independent of any participation on her part.
 27.
 District judge`s decision
The district judge found Ng to be the employer of San Lwin. He found Ng to be in substantial control as he handled most of the matters at the hotel. He also noted that on 10 June 1996 Ng had personally given San Lwin his salary.
 28.The district judge found that the appellant had abetted Ng in the employment of San Lwin in that, prior to and at the time of the employment, she did facilitate the employment of San Lwin by Ng. She had done this by bringing San Lwin to Budget Lodge with the purpose of his getting a job there and she had also helped in paying San Lwin his salary.
 29.Even though his social visit pass had not expired when the appellant first brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge on 4 May 1996, the district judge did not think that this would exculpate her as the appellant had helped in settling San Lwin`s salary on 20 May 1996 when San Lwin was already an illegal overstayer. Therefore she had facilitated his employment at the time of San Lwin`s illegal stay.
 30.As for the mens rea of the appellant, as to whether she knew that she was facilitating the employment of an illegal overstayer, the district judge found that she must have known that he was an overstayer as she had seen his passport when he first came to her house in Geylang and knew that his social visit pass was going to expire.
 31.The district judge did not accept the appellant`s testimony that she had been told by San Lwin that he had managed to get an extension of his stay. This was since the district judge had accepted San Lwin`s evidence that, even though he had lied to Ng and told him that his pass had been extended, he had not told the appellant the same thing. The district judge also did not find the appellant to be a credible witness as there were many inconsistencies in her evidence. The district judge found it difficult to believe that, being an experienced employment agent, the appellant would not have bothered to check San Lwin`s passport when San Lwin had allegedly told her that his pass had been extended.
 32.
 The appeal
Section 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states: 
A person abets the doing of a thing who - 
 
(c) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing
 Explanation 2 of that section reads: 
Whoever, prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
 33.The appellant submitted that it was a pure chance that she had brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge. The contention was that it was Vangie who offered San Lwin a job while he was there. The decision to accept the employment and move into the hotel was San Lwin`s own decision. She was only seeking for San Lwin a job fit for an employment pass holder as he was a qualified civil engineer and therefore when he had been asked by Vangie to work as an ordinary workman, she did not encourage him and told him that it was his decision. Therefore in trying to divorce herself from San Lwin`s employment, she contended that she had nothing to do with his decision to work there.
 34.The appellant`s submission was that introducing San Lwin to the hotel or helping him in translating what was being said could not amount to abetment . The prosecution must prove that she 
 in fact 
 intended to abet and did abet Ng, knowing that San Lwin had overstayed.
 35.The appellant also submitted that the aiding or facilitating, as stated in Explanation 2 of the Penal Code must be 
 prior to or at the time of commission of that act 
. As the act of employment was either on 4 May 1996, when San Lwin was first brought to Budget Lodge, or on 6 May 1996 at the latest when San Lwin moved into Budget Lodge, he could not be charged for abetment on subsequent dates. The district judge had said that, even if on 4 May 1996 San Lwin`s social visit pass had not expired, there was the appellant`s subsequent act of settling San Lwin`s salary on 20 May 1996 when he was already an illegal overstayer. The appellant submitted that this money was because San Lwin had requested that the appellant ask the management for part payment of his money. Furthermore, as this was after the act of employing San Lwin, it could not be considered as an act of abetment. In addition, the appellant submitted that it could not be said that on 20 May 1996, when she was given money from the management to hand it to San Lwin, she had known that he had overstayed. This was because San Lwin had lied to Ng that he had obtained an extension on his pass until 22 May 1996. Therefore no one at the hotel knew that he was an overstayer.
 36.In addition, counsel for the appellant tried to persuade me that the charge should be amended from one of abetting Ng in employing San Lwin while he was an overstayer to one of abetting San Lwin to be employed while he was an overstayer. His reason for suggesting this amendment was that the offence of abetting Ng had not been made out as there was no evidence that the appellant had known Ng previously and therefore there was no connection between the appellant and Ng. The appellant had no previous connection with Budget Lodge. Therefore she was not exactly aiding Ng, as the employer of Budget Lodge, in employing San Lwin. However, there was strong evidence which showed that the appellant had been acting as an `employment agent` for San Lwin. This was because she had tried to obtain employment for San Lwin and initially she had also tried to obtain an employment pass on his behalf; therefore if she was intentionally aiding any person, it would be San Lwin and not Ng.
 37.
 Amendment of the charge
It is settled law that the High Court acting in its appellate capacity has the power to amend charges under s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). This point had been considered in 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
  where it was held that it is implicit that, as the High Court may `alter a finding` pursuant to the current s 256 (b)(ii) CPC and convict the appellant on a substituted charge (see 
Ng Ee v PP
 
[1941] MLJ 180
 , 
Lim Teck Seng v R
 
[1957] MLJ 71
 , 
Sivalingam v PP
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
  and 
Periasamy v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 MLJ 551
 ), the High Court may also `alter the finding` by convicting on an amended charge. In doing so, I had respectfully declined to follow the decisions of 
Quek Ching Kim v R
 
[1956] MLJ 54
 and 
Wee Toon Boon v PP
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
  [1975-1977] SLR 498 where it was held that the High Court, acting in its appellate capacity, could not amend the charge. As I have already set out my reasons for departing from those previously decided cases in 
 Garmaz 
, I will not be repeating them in the present case.
 38.It is very important however that, before a charge is amended, certain safeguards are required to prevent prejudice to the appellant. This is clear from Cussen J`s observation in 
 Ng Ee 
`s case which I quoted in 
 Garmaz 
. Cussen J had said at p 149 of 
 Ng Ee 
`s case: 
It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same - that the prosecution evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused`s defence the same.
 It is clear therefore that before any amendment the court must ascertain that the amendment should not affect the substance of the evidence that was given in the proceedings below, and that the amendment would in no way prejudice the appellant`s defence. In fact in 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
 , in relation to the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to alter the charge, it was said that this power had to be exercised judiciously and that the possibility of prejudice to the accused (or the prosecution) must be of utmost concern when the court decides to alter the charge. Accordingly the amendment should not cause prejudice to the prosecution either.
 39.Even though, as seen above, this court has the power to amend the charge, there were a few problems raised by counsel for the appellant in his submission: (a). first, it is necessary to ascertain whether the original charge is not the appropriate charge on the facts of the case. It is not unusual to find that a given set of facts can give rise to a number of different charges. Therefore if the suggested charge is merely another possible charge, it is difficult to challenge the original charge as it is the prerogative of the prosecution to decide which charge to prefer, see 
Govindarajulu & Anor v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 838
 ;
 (b). there also appears to be a problem with the dates in the original charge, as it does not coincide with the actual date when the appellant did the act which constitutes the abetment of the offence. The actual offence in the charge may also have to be substituted with a different one to be consistent with the facts of the case; and
 (c). if the original charge is not made out and the charge is amended to one of abetting San Lwin to be employed while he was an overstayer, we are faced with the problem that this was not the offence that San Lwin had been charged with. San Lwin had been convicted of illegally overstaying. This was not the offence that the appellant had abetted. This would depend on whether the appellant could be convicted of abetting an offence that San Lwin, the principal offender had not technically been convicted of.
 40.
 Abetment
To determine if the charge against the appellant of abetting Ng in the employment of San Lwin is made out, we have first to review the law on abetment. In the present case, we are faced with a problem as to who the appellant actually aided. There are three options: (a). the appellant could have aided Ng in the employment of San Lwin;
 (b). the appellant could have aided San Lwin to be employed; or
 (c). the appellant could have aided both Ng and San Lwin.
 It is important for us to determine which is the right option as it affects the possible amendment of the charge. If the right option is (a), then the charge should remain as it is, without any amendment. However, if it is (b), then the charge should be amended. If the right option is (c), the charge should still remain as it is, as in every situation, although each set of facts can present a number of offences, it is the discretion of the prosecution to prefer the charge: 
 Govindarajulu v PP 
.
 41.It is arguable that it is impossible to abet Ng without abetting San Lwin and, vice versa, it would be impossible to abet San Lwin without abetting Ng. This is since San Lwin`s employment would necessarily involve Ng employing him. However, in my opinion, whom the appellant actually aided would depend on the appellant`s `dominant intention` at the time she did the act which led to San Lwin`s employment by Ng. It is clear that, before the appellant can be held to have abetted either one, she must have had the necessary intention to commit an offence, as s 107 states: to abet, one needs to `intentionally aid, by any act, the doing of that thing`. Ajaib Singh J in 
PP v Datuk Tan Cheng Swee & Ors
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 166
  had said at p 173: 
Briefly to constitute the offence of aiding and abetting the prosecution must prove intention on the part of the abettor to aid and he must be shown to have known the circumstances constituting the crime at the time when he voluntarily does a positive act of assistance.
 42.In 
Purushothaman & Ors v State of Kerala
 
[1989] 95 Cr LJ NOC 184
, the accused only had an intention that deserving students should not suffer on account of the greed of the second accused, who happened to be the practical examiner, for money. The students had approached him for advice to meet the second accused. His suggestions however were not considered as amounting to abetment of the commission of the offence of giving illegal gratification by students to the second accused. KT Thomas J held: 
An act which merely amounts to aiding the commission of an offence is not abetment. The aiding must snowball into intentionally aiding the doing of a thing. The commission of the act must be the dominant intention of the person who aids it. Then only can it be said that he intentionally aided it. If there is a community of interest between the aiding persons and the one who commits the offence, there is a possibility to draw the inference that the dominant intention was to aid the doing of a particular act. If the person only knows or has only the reason to believe that his act would facilitate the commission of an offence, it cannot be said that his dominant intention was that.
 Therefore, in that case, it was clear that the accused`s dominant intention was to help the students, due to the community of interest between them, to prevent them from being taken advantage of. He may have known or had reason to believe that his act would facilitate the commission of the offence, but to my understanding of the case, it cannot be said that his dominant intention was to assist the second accused to receive illegal gratification from the students.
 43.In many of these cases of abetment, the abettor is the middle person, the introducer of one to the other. I will give a few scenarios to illustrate this point. In a day to day situation, if a child (A) wants candy and she tells this to B who brings her to a shop and the shopkeeper (C) then sells candy to the child, would B be assisting A to buy candy or would B be assisting C to sell candy to A? Another situation would be if A wants to buy stolen goods and he tells B who brings him to meet C. Would B be assisting A to receive stolen property pursuant to s 411 of the Penal Code or would B be assisting C to deal with stolen property pursuant to s 413 of the Penal Code? In my opinion, this would depend on the dominant intention of B. In the scenarios given above, B would be assisting A. It is different however if B had been actively soliciting customers for C and A happened to be one of the customers solicited. In the first scenario, this would be if B had approached the child (A) to ask A to buy candy from C or in the second example if B had actively asked A whether he wanted to buy stolen goods from C. In such a situation, B would then be assisting C.
 44.One may ask what difference does it make as to the person aided? In my opinion, the difference is very important as in most of these cases, the punishments imposed upon A and C are very different. Section 109 of the Penal Code states: 
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
 Under s 109, B, the abettor will be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. Therefore, if B is to held to have abetted A, his punishment will be the same as A`s. However, if B is to be held to have abetted C, his punishment will be the same as C`s.
 45.Overall, it can be seen that the justice of the situation is that the appellant should receive the appropriate sentence commensurate with her dominant intention. Sections 110 and 111 of the Penal Code state: 
110 Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 
111 When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent, as if he had directly abetted it:
 
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
 
Illustrations 
(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A`s instigation, and the act done was under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had instigated the child to put poison into the food of Y. 
(b) A instigates B to burn Z`s house. B sets fire to the house, and at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. 
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for the murder.
 46.From a reading of s 110 it is apparent that Parliament intended for the abettor to receive the punishment which is commensurate with his intention. This emphasises the importance of determining the `dominant intention` of the abettor. From 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
, p 424, s 110 would apply in cases where s 108 of the Penal Code, and Explanation 3 apply, that is where the principal may not be capable by law of committing an offence, for example, where the principal is a limited company: see 
 Anath Bandhu v Corporation of Calcutta 
 AIR 1952 Cal 759, or a person of unsound mind. In these cases, the abettor will still be liable for the offence and be punished if the abettor had the intention for that offence.
 47.However, I am of the opinion that this is not the only situation where s 110 would apply. As s 111 prescribes the liability of an abettor where the act is a probable consequence, s 110 must necessarily prescribe the liability of an abettor where the act is not a probable consequence. If the act abetted is a lesser offence but the act done is a greater offence and the greater offence is a probable consequence of the abetment then the abettor, according to s 111, would be liable for the greater offence. In fact under s 112, if the act done (the greater offence) is in addition to the act abetted (the lesser offence) and they are distinct offences, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. However, if the greater offence is not a probable consequence of the abetment and the abettor only had the intention for the lesser offence, then according to s 110, the abettor would only be punished for the lesser offence.
 48.In the present case, one may argue that even if the appellant intended to abet San Lwin to be employed, it is surely a probable consequence that she would also abet Ng to employ San Lwin. Therefore, would this not come within s 111 which would mean that the appellant would be punished for abetting Ng (the greater offence) and not merely for abetting San Lwin (the lesser offence)? In this situation, since they are distinct offences, under s 112, she could even be punished for both.
 49.A closer look at s 111 and the illustrations provided with the section show that the section is concerned with cases where there are two different acts, as the section itself provides: 
 when an act is abetted and a different act is done 
. As seen from the illustrations of s 111, they also only concern one principal or at least one group of principals. In illustration (a), if the act abetted is also done, that is if the child had also put the poison into the food of Z, together with the act actually done, that of putting the poison into the food of Y, there are two acts done by one principal, the child. In (b) the act abetted was the burning of the house and the act done of theft was in addition to the act abetted, therefore there are two acts by one principal, B. In (c) the act abetted was the breaking into of the house and the act done of murder was in addition to the act abetted, therefore once again there are two acts by one group of principals, B and C.
 50.In the present case however and in other similar situations to which I drew attention in the scenarios above, there is only one act which results in two different offences by two different principals. There was only one act of employment here which resulted in an offence committed by San Lwin and an offence committed by Ng. It would be unfair to say that the appellant is liable for both. This sort of situation would not therefore fall within s 111. Instead, as seen from s 110, the appellant should just be liable for the offence which she had the dominant intention to abet. Therefore, in my opinion, in the case of abetment, where there are two possible principals, it is important to determine who the abettor had the dominant intention to abet. I am not saying however that it is impossible for the abettor to have intended to abet both. In such cases, if the abettor had the dominant intention to abet both, he should be charged accordingly.
 51.Applying s 110, it would appear that it would be appropriate to amend the charge to ensure that the appellant answers the offence she had the possible mens rea for, having regard to her dominant intention and therefore, if the charge is found to be made out against her, she can be convicted and sentenced for the appropriate offence. The charge of abetting Ng would not be made out on the facts as the appellant did not have the dominant intention to aid him.
 52.There is no doubt that the prosecution has the discretion in deciding the charge to prefer in all cases. I do not wish to fetter this discretion. However, I feel that in these cases involving abetment, with two possible principals, the prosecution should determine the most appropriate charge based on the facts of each particular case.
 53.In the present case, I was not convinced that the prosecution had preferred the correct charge on the facts of the case. Based on the evidence, in my opinion, the appellant was assisting San Lwin to be employed rather than assisting Ng to employ San Lwin. This is clear from the following observations: (a) San Lwin had approached the appellant telling her that he needed a job; (b) San Lwin had given her $200 to obtain an employment pass for him, indicating that he considered her as his `employment agent`; (c) the appellant had originally brought him to another employer but, because the employer was not there, San Lwin had gone along with her to Budget Lodge, indicating that she was not specifically obtaining workers on Budget Lodge`s behalf ; (d) she had not asked Budget Lodge to give him a job, instead Vangie had offered him a job which he decided to accept, without any encouragement from the appellant. These factors were gathered from the evidence of San Lwin and the appellant.
 54.On the other hand, there was Vangie`s testimony that she knew the appellant as the appellant had previously been to Budget Lodge bringing workers there, which implies that the appellant sources for workers on behalf of Budget Lodge. Even if we accepted Vangie`s evidence, it was clear that the appellant went there with a view to obtaining employment for her `clients`. She had also brought along two other Myanmese nationals with her. It would appear that her whole purpose of going to Budget Lodge was to aid her `clients`, not Budget Lodge.
 55.Accordingly, I was of the view that the charge should state the appropriate offence which was that of abetting San Lwin to be employed. Amendment in the present case was appropriate as there were many defects in the charge. The present charge related to an offence of Ng employing San Lwin while he was an overstayer. The period stated for the offence charged against the appellant was between 8 May 1996 to 27 June 1996. Reading the charge, I was of the view that the charge had to be amended in three respects to suit the offence made out on the facts.
 56.First, as we have seen, the offence against the appellant should be amended from abetting Ng to abetting San Lwin. Secondly, the appellant had done the act of abetment, which was the act of bringing San Lwin to Budget Lodge on 4 May 1996. In the circumstances I was of the view that the charge should be amended to reflect the date on she committed the act. Thirdly, when she first brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge on 4 May 1996, he was not yet an overstayer as his social visit pass had not expired. It was more appropriate therefore to charge the appellant with abetting San Lwin to be engaged in paid employment while on a social visit pass rather than of working while he was an overstayer. Engaging in paid employment while on a social visit pass is an offence under Regulation 12(7) of the Immigration Regulations (1990 Ed), the subsidiary legislation to the Act. Under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed), there is no provision for an offence of being employed while being an overstayer, there is merely the offence of overstaying under s 15 of the Act. It would therefore be incorrect to say that the appellant abetted San Lwin to be in employment while he was an overstayer. Neither could it be said that the appellant abetted San Lwin to remain in Singapore unlawfully.
 57.In the light of the circumstances in the present case, before I go on to consider whether the appellant should be convicted of any offence, the charge was amended to read as follows: 
Case No: MA150/1997/01
 
You,
 
Daw Aye Aye Mu @ Daw Aye Than, f/42 yrs
 
Passport No 147643
 
Nationality: Myanmese
 
are charged that you, on or about 4 May 1996, at Budget Lodge, 77 Loewen Road, Singapore, did abet one San Lwin, a Myanmese national, in engaging in paid employment, as a maintenance staff cum worker supervisor from 5 May 1996 to 27 June 1996, while on a social visit pass, in contravention of the provisions of reg 12(7) of the Immigration Regulations (1990 Ed.), Immigration Act (Cap 133) and you have thereby committed an offence under reg 12(7) of the Immigration Regulations (1990 Ed.), Immigration Act (Cap 133), read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), punishable under reg 40(2) of the Immigration Regulations.
 58.I was mindful that I had to have regard to the safeguards specified earlier. In the present case, it was an amendment which substituted the charge. I was convinced that the amendment would not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below. It would appear that with the amendment, the appellant`s defence would be the same, that is that she had brought him to Budget Lodge for the purposes of accommodation and not for employment and also that she had not encouraged San Lwin to accept the job but left the decision entirely up to him. With the change in the dates and the actual offence, however, it cleared up the problem of the appellant contending that, when she first brought San Lwin there, he was not yet an overstayer. Clearly, the appellant did not contest that, when she first brought San Lwin to the Budget Lodge, she knew that he was on a social visit pass as she had seen his passport earlier. I was of the view that the amendment would not cause any prejudice to the appellant and indeed it was counsel`s submission that the charge be amended in the first place. As was stated in 
 Garmaz 
`s case, there is no practical utility in requiring the charge to be read and explained again to the appellant since there is no question of her seeking to tailor her evidence or adduce fresh evidence to meet the amended charge.
 59.It would appear from 
 Lee Ngin Kiat 
`s case that, in addition to ensuring that no prejudice is caused to the appellant in the amendment of the charge, we have also to ensure that no prejudice is caused to the prosecution by the amendment of the charge. I did not envisage that the prosecution would need to change their case in any material manner. The prosecution was originally proceeding on the fact that she was abetting Ng by intentionally aiding his employment of San Lwin. It was clear from the evidence however that the appellant could have been abetting San Lwin. Therefore the prosecution would not have to alter its evidence in any material way.
 60.
 Can the appellant be convicted of abetting an offence which San Lwin had not technically been convicted of?
I considered the law on abetment in 
Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 73
 . In that case, the principal accused had claimed trial to the charge against him of committing the offence of criminal breach of trust which the petitioner had been convicted of abetting. Counsel for the petitioner in that case had submitted that where a principal accused had not been found guilty of an offence, no person could be convicted of intentionally aiding such an offence. I made the following observations at p 77: 
In my view, the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentionally aiding an offence must direct its mind towards a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed; and the court may, indeed must, do so in all cases, including those where the principal has not been convicted of that offence by the time the alleged intentional aider is tried
 61.It is clear from 
 Yenna Ong 
`s case that the principal does not even have to be convicted of the offence before the abettor can be convicted of abetting the offence, as long as the actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed. In the present case, although San Lwin had not technically been convicted under reg 12(7) of the Regulations, rather he had been convicted under s 15(1) of the Act for overstaying, it was clear that the actus reus of his being engaged in paid employment while on a social visit pass had been committed. Therefore it would be acceptable for the charge to be amended as above and there was still a possibility that the appellant could be convicted of the charge above even if San Lwin had not been convicted of the particular offence which the appellant was alleged to have aided in the amended charge.
 62.
 Has the case against the appellant on the amended charge been made out?
I had to consider next whether the amended charge had been made out against the appellant. I had no doubt that the act of bringing San Lwin to Budget Lodge was sufficient to constitute an act that facilitated his employment. It may be that ultimately the decision to accept Vangie`s job offer was San Lwin`s. However, the appellant had known that San Lwin was looking for a job. In fact, in her testimony, she referred to Budget Lodge as a potential 
 employer 
. It was unlikely from the evidence that the appellant had just brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge only to obtain cheap accommodation. In fact, in her evidence, she said that she brought San Lwin to Budget Lodge to look for cheap accommodation as well as for employment. By her actions of looking through his documents and taking a fee from him to apply for an employment pass, it was obvious that she had the intention to bring him to potential employers and Budget Lodge happened to be one of them.
 63.There was an additional issue which was considered by the district judge, that the appellant had assisted in paying San Lwin`s salary on 20 May 1996. Vangie had also testified that she had seen the appellant paying San Lwin his salary once. According to the appellant, she had been asked by San Lwin to assist him in obtaining his salary because, even though he had worked, he had not received his salary. That was how she came to pay his salary. This was confirmed by San Lwin in his evidence as he said that he had asked the appellant for assistance to obtain his salary. The district judge had found that this act of payment was also an act of abetment. I was of the view that it was not crucial whether this act was an act of abetment as the act of the appellant in bringing San Lwin to Budget Lodge was clearly an act that facilitated San Lwin to be employed. That act alone was sufficient without the need to consider this separate act. I did not therefore consider the appellant`s submission that this act could not be considered an act of abetment as it was not 
 prior to or at the time of the commission of the offence 
. It would appear that this act however strengthened the proposition that the appellant was really assisting San Lwin and not Ng. San Lwin would refer his problems to her, and she would not have tried to assist him if she were not his `employment agent`.
 64.
 Mens rea
As seen above, it was important to determine whether, when the appellant did the act of abetment, namely, of bringing San Lwin to Budget Lodge, she did this with the intention that San Lwin would commit the offence of working while on a social visit pass. As seen from
 PP v Datuk Tan Cheng Swee 
, she must be shown to have known the circumstances constituting the crime at the time when she voluntarily did the positive act of assistance. In the present case, it was clear that, when she brought him to Budget Lodge, she knew that San Lwin did not possess a work permit and he merely had a social visit pass. Therefore she was aware of the circumstances which could constitute the present offence. This was especially so since she was in the business of assisting Myanmese workers in obtaining employment passes. She would know from her experience that a person was not allowed to engage in paid employment while on a social visit pass but required a work permit or an employment pass. I was therefore of the view that the appellant had the requisite mens rea when she facilitated San Lwin`s employment while on a social visit pass.
 65.
 Sentence
I was satisfied that the offence against the appellant on the amended charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. She should therefore be sentenced accordingly under reg 40(2) of the Immigration Regulations. Regulation 40(2) states: 
Any person who without reasonable cause contravenes or fails to comply with any condition imposed in respect of or any direction endorsed on any pass or permit shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding $1000 or to both.
 The appellant in the present case was convicted and sentenced to six months` imprisonment, which is the minimum mandatory sentence under s 57(ii) as she was originally charged with abetting a s 57(1)(e) offence. The appellant appealed against conviction but not sentence. I amended the charge, and even though the appellant had not appealed against sentence, it was only just to reconsider her sentence in the light of her conviction on the new amended charge.
 66.In any event, I felt that a sentence of six months` imprisonment for her act was excessive. Section 256(b)(ii) of the CPC states: 
At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may - 
 
(b) in an appeal from a conviction -
 
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence;
 The High Court sitting in its appellate capacity, after amending the charge can accordingly reduce or enhance the sentence. In the present case, I was of the opinion that the appellant`s sentence should be reduced from six months` imprisonment to a fine of $1,000 which is the maximum fine under reg 40(2). Imprisonment is an option under reg 40(2) but is not mandatory. I was of the view that the offence in the present case was not the sort that justified a custodial sentence, particularly as this was her first offence.
 67.
 Conclusion
In conclusion, I was of the view that this was an appropriate case for an amendment of the charge as the original charge was not appropriate based on the facts of this case. I would ask that the prosecution, in exercising its discretion to decide the charges to proceed upon, make a closer examination of the facts in cases of these nature, where it is possible that the offender can be abetting two different persons and as a result two different offences, to determine what the dominant intention of the offender is. It would not be desirable if, in each case of this nature, the prosecution merely proceeds on the charge bearing the greater sentence without a determination of the actual offence which the offender was abetting. I therefore amended the charge and reduced the sentence accordingly.",1998-01-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 In the court below, at the close of the prosecution`s case, the district judge acquitted the accused of the following charge: 
You, Annamalai Pillai Jayanthi, female 34 years, passport no B132687, date of birth 12 April 1962, an Indian national, are charged that you, from 7 May 1996 till 23 January 1997, at No 27 Realty Park, No 98B East Coast Road and No 9 Jalan Selandang Delima, Singapore, did abet, by intentionally aiding one Janice Marissa Hogan to employ one Rengappa Santhi, female 28 years, an Indian national, as a domestic maid, being a person who acted in contravention of s 6(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed) and you have thereby abetted the commission of an offence under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act, which offence is punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the Immigration Act read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 The prosecution appealed against the order of the district judge. I allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the district court for the defence to be called on an amended charge. I now give my reasons for doing so.
 2.
 The prosecution case
One Rengappa Santhi (Santhi) arrived in Singapore on 15 March 1993 in order to work in Johore Bahru for a period of two years. Her travel arrangements had been made by the accused, who had promised her a job in Malaysia. The accused was herself a domestic maid in the home of one R Santhi (RS). At the time of Santhi`s arrival, she possessed a valid passport and social visit pass. She was taken by car to Johore Bahru, where she worked for one Janicki Nadason (Janicki) for a period of two years. The acts complained of in the charge arose upon the completion of her two year contract. She was taken by car to Singapore, and thereafter worked for one Janice Marissa Hogan (Janice). It was the prosecution`s case that her entry into Singapore from Johore Bahru was without a valid entry permit in contravention of s 6(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed); that she was employed by Janice despite her contravention of the Immigration Act; and that the accused had been the person responsible for Janice`s employment of Santhi.
 3.The prosecution case centred on the evidence of Santhi. Santhi testified that upon her arrival in Singapore in 1993, she handed her passport to the accused, who kept it. She did not see her passport again. When she was taken by Janicki and another person by car to Johore Bahru, however, the car passed through the Singapore and Malaysia checkpoints, and she saw three passports handed over. Whilst in Malaysia, whenever she asked for her passport, Janicki merely said that she did not need one as she possessed the requisite work permit. On two occasions when she spoke with the accused on the telephone while she was still in Malaysia, the accused explained that she had sent Santhi`s passport for renewal. Upon the completion of her two years in Johore Bahru, she was taken by Janicki and another in his car to Singapore. Again, they passed through the Singapore and Malaysia checkpoints, but she was unable to say whether any passports or other travel documents were handed over at this point.
 4.Upon arrival in Singapore, she stayed briefly in the house of the accused`s employer, R Santhi (`RS`). The accused told her that her passport was lost and that a replacement would cost $2,500. When she revealed that she did not have such a large sum of money, the accused suggested that she earn the money. She was thereafter introduced to Janice, for whom she worked from 7 May 1996 until sometime in January 1998. Throughout this period, she was assured by Janice that the requisite work permit would be obtained for her. She was also informed by the accused on the telephone that her passport had been renewed.
 5.The investigating officer, Yeo Seng Guan, was called. Unfortunately, he was unable to shed much light on the circumstances of her entry into Singapore. He had contacted the Data Processing Centre, but they had been unable to help, as Santhi was unable to supply her passport number or even the exact date of her re-entry into Singapore. Thevavani, the immigration officer who dealt with Santhi, was also unable to check her immigration status, as Santhi could not supply either her passport number or the name used in her passport.
 6.The accused`s employer, RS, testified that when Santhi stayed briefly at her house upon her return from Malaysia in 1996, she saw Santhi put a passport into a drawer. Santhi also told her that she was on a social visit pass. She testified that some days after Santhi`s arrival, Santhi furnished her with a pager number and asked her to telephone Janice so that arrangements could be made for Santhi to work for Janice. She herself conversed briefly with Janice, who said that she would arrange for Santhi`s work permit. Santhi, too, spoke with Janice. She left RS`s house soon after to work for Janice.
 7.Janice was called as a prosecution witness. She testified that sometime in April 1996, she was in desperate need of a maid. Her mother told her to contact the accused. When she did so, she was told that there was a maid available for baby-sitting and that there would be a $500 agency fee for the introduction. This was later paid for by her mother. She went thereafter to fetch Santhi, who worked for her until the end of December 1996. She testified that the accused said she would make arrangements for a work permit but she was not given any documents. She terminated Santhi`s services in December as she `did not want to keep someone I don`t know anything about`. She contacted the accused and returned Santhi to her. In the week before the trial in the court below, Janice pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1991 Ed), of having employed Santhi without obtaining for her a valid work permit, and had been fined.
 8.Janice`s mother, Goorusamy Mynavathy, confirmed that she had given the accused`s telephone number to Janice and Janice had engaged Santhi through the accused. She testified that subsequently, she went with Janice to RS`s house to pay the accused the $500 brokerage fee which the accused had demanded prior to introducing Santhi.
 9.
 The district judge`s decision
The district judge pointed out that Janice`s employment of Santhi was not in issue, and concentrated on the two remaining elements of the charge, first, whether Santhi was in contravention of s 6(1) of the Immigration Act; and secondly, whether the accused had intentionally aided Janice to employ Santhi. On the first issue, the district judge held that the prosecution had failed to adduce any evidence of Santhi`s contravention of s 6(1) of the Immigration Act. On the second issue, the district judge was of the view that the prosecution`s evidence was manifestly unreliable, being `full of contradictions and inconsistencies`. Accordingly, she acquitted the accused of the offence charged at the close of the prosecution case.
 10.
 The appeal
On the appeal, the prosecution conceded that there was no evidence that Santhi contravened s 6(1) of the Immigration Act. Instead, the prosecution contended that the district judge erred in finding that the prosecution`s evidence in respect of the accused`s abetment of Janice`s employment of Santhi was `manifestly unreliable` and argued that the charge ought to have been amended by the district judge to one of the accused abetting by intentionally aiding Janice to employ Santhi without a valid work permit contrary to s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (the EFWA).
 11.
 The district judge`s assessment that the evidence adduced to show that the accused aided Janice to employ Santhi was manifestly unreliable
The district judge made her finding that the prosecution evidence on the accused`s assistance to Janice was manifestly unreliable on the basis that there were inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence of Santhi, Janice and RS. She did not make clear, however, which contradictions she considered important, but merely recorded the various witnesses` testimonies. The following are inconsistencies found in the trial judge`s accounts of the witnesses` testimonies in her grounds of decision, upon which she may have relied: (i). The length of time Santhi stayed in RS`s house prior to her employment with Janice. Santhi testified that she stayed a month. RS stated that the period was two weeks.
 (ii). Whether Janice was to be responsible for getting Santhi`s travel documents in order. According to Santhi, when Janice came to fetch her in a taxi, she related her whole ordeal to Janice with many tears and much drama, and Janice assured her that she would ensure that the requisite documents were obtained. According to Janice, however, the accused was the person responsible for obtaining the requisite permits for Santhi and the accused had told Janice not to worry. Janice stated that Santhi was not at all distressed during the taxi ride from the accused`s place of employment to her house.
 (iii). Whether it was Santhi or Janice who terminated the employment arrangement. Both stated that the termination was their idea.
 (iv). Whether Janice owed Santhi money at the end of the employment. Janice testified that she paid Santhi a $350 levy for the first five months and $1,200 as salary for October, November and December. Further, when she released Santhi, she paid $2,800 for all outstanding salaries and an air-ticket for Santhi to go back to India. Santhi, on the other hand, testified that Janice had only paid her a total of $400 for her nine months of work.
 (v). Whether it was the accused who assisted Santhi in locating Janice. RS testified that while Santhi was living in her house, Santhi approached her with a pager number and asked her to contact Janice on her behalf. She accordingly spoke to Janice about the employment arrangements. Thereafter Santhi herself spoke to Janice and Janice later came to fetch Santhi.
 (vi). Whether Janice informed RS in the course of the telephone conversation at (v) that she would obtain a work permit for Santhi. RS testified that Janice had undertaken to apply for Santhi`s work permit. Janice denied that they conversed about a work permit: it was her evidence that they merely talked about when Santhi would start work with her.
 12.After a careful consideration of the inconsistencies in the various witnesses` evidence, I was of the view that the district judge misapplied the 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 test. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge is obliged to keep an open mind about the veracity of witnesses, she is merely to assess whether there exists evidence, not inherently incredible, that would support the charge. This, of course, does not mean that if there are parts of the evidence which go towards supporting the charge, there is automatically a case to answer; the state of the rest of the evidence must also be taken into account: see 
PP v IC Automation (S) Pte Ltd
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 249
 . Nevertheless, the mere presence of several discrepancies in the prosecution`s case cannot, per se, render its case manifestly unreliable. It is incumbent upon the trial judge to consider whether the inconsistencies are sufficiently fundamental to nullify that part of the evidence which supports the charge.
 13.The case of 
PP v Tan Aik Heng
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 244
  is illustrative. In that case, the trial judge held that a prima facie case had not been made out against the respondent because, inter alia, his s 122(6) statement contradicted his s 121 statement. The Court of Appeal accepted that discrepancies existed, but went on to analyse the various discrepancies and concluded as follows at p 254: 
In our opinion, at this stage of the prosecution`s case, these discrepancies between the two statements are not such as to nullify the evidential value of either of the statements to the extent that neither of them is not even prima facie reliable. Of course, the discrepancies would certainly affect the weight to be attached to the first accused`s allegations against the respondent with which the court will be concerned at the end of the whole case, after hearing all the evidence including the evidence, if any, adduced by the defence.
 
 
The trial judge in the instant case, if we may respectfully say so, has taken great pains in examining the two statements and made detailed evaluation of their accuracy and veracity by casting them against each other and against other evidence With the utmost respect, it seems to us that such evaluation of evidence as carried out by him would be a proper and appropriate exercise to be carried out at the end of the case when all the evidence (including, if any, evidence adduced by the defence) has been placed before him. At the close of the prosecution`s case, however, the test to be applied in evaluating the evidence is that as laid down in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP
.
 14.In the present case, the crucial evidence was that which was directly relevant to whether the accused assisted Janice in her employment of Santhi. There was evidence, from Janice and Janice`s mother, that the accused asked for and was paid a $500 brokerage fee. Janice testified that she telephoned the accused to ask specifically about a maid and was promised one. Santhi, Janice and Janice`s mother testified on the role of the accused in arranging for Santhi`s employment. From the notes of evidence, there was nothing to suggest that this evidence had been totally discredited in cross-examination, nor that other evidence had rendered this part of the evidence completely unreliable. In considering whether the accused assisted Janice, I think the district judge may have placed too much emphasis on RS`s evidence that she, too, was asked by Santhi to telephone Janice. RS`s efforts on behalf of Santhi could not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the accused herself made no contact with Janice. It was not explained, afterall, how Janice`s pager number came into Santhi`s possession: it may well be that the accused had spoken to Janice previously and thereafter given the pager number to Santhi, who merely wished to speak to Janice herself for reassurance. Janice, too, did testify that her telephone conversations were not limited to those with the accused. She stated that she spoke with RS when the latter telephoned to ask about Santhi starting work with her.
 15.The other discrepancies that could be gleaned from the district judge`s grounds of decision - such as the length of time Santhi spent in RS`s house prior to her arrangements with Janice, whether it was Janice or the accused who was meant to be responsible for the paperwork, whether Janice was aware that Santhi had no passport and no work permit, whether Janice had paid Santhi all her outstanding salary - were not material to the core question of whether the accused assisted Janice in securing Santhi`s employment with her. They related only to the credibility of each witness` evidence, which is relevant only at the end of the entire case, when all the evidence is to be assessed by the trier of fact.
 16.
 The amendment of the charge to one of abetment in the commission of an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA
A charge of abetment in the commission of an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA required evidence that Janice employed Santhi in contravention of s 5(1) of the EFWA and that the accused intentionally assisted her in doing so. In view of Janice`s plea of guilty to a charge under s 5(1) of the EFWA, the first aspect of the charge was not in issue at all. And, as detailed above, it seemed to me that a case to answer had in fact been made out in respect of the accused`s assistance. There was sufficient evidence to show that the accused hawked Santhi`s services to Janice in consideration of a $500 fee. Before me, counsel for the accused contended that there was no evidence to show that the accused was aware that Santhi did not possess a work permit. In my judgment, the notes of evidence plainly indicated otherwise. From Santhi`s evidence, it was clear that Santhi`s lack of a work permit was known to the accused. Janice testified that the accused was not only aware of the omission of a work permit, she was in fact the party responsible for obtaining the work permit. The veracity of these testimonies would, certainly, have to be carefully weighed in balance against all other evidence adduced at the end of the trial. For the purposes of the appeal, I was concerned only with such evidence as did not appear inherently incredible, either on its own or by comparison with the rest of the evidence.
 17.In the circumstances, the prosecution ought to have applied for the amendment of the charge prior to the close of its case; and when they omitted to do so, the district judge ought to have exercised her discretion to amend the charge, as she is entitled so to do: see 
PP v Tan Khee Wan Iris
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 214
 .
 18.In 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  the Court of Appeal held that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, possessed the implied power to amend a charge when exercising its powers on an appeal from a conviction pursuant to s 256(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). A fortiori, the High Court is empowered to amend a charge while exercising its powers under s 256(a) of the same Code, on appeals from orders of acquittal. The only limiting factor in each case is the prejudice, if any, suffered by a defendant. In the present case there was none. The prosecution would have led substantially the same evidence on a charge of abetment in the commission of an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA. More importantly, the defence has not yet been called. The accused may conduct her defence in any way she sees fit.
 19.
 Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal of the prosecution and, in exercise of the powers conferred on the High Court by s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code, remitted the case to the district court for the defence to be called on an amended charge of abetment in the commission of an offence under s 5(1) of the EFWA.",1998-01-22 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The first appellant was a Deputy Superintendent of Prisons. He was charged under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) for obtaining a loan of $10,000 for a colleague, from a prisoner Peter Tham Wing Fai (Tham), by showing the prisoner favour. The first appellant had posted Tham to the kitchen and had appointed him as an assistant librarian in the prison. He had also allowed Tham four visits from an ex-prisoner against prisons rules. The second appellant was charged with intentionally aiding the first appellant in the offence, in that the loan was obtained from Tham through the second appellant.
 2.The alleged offences happened sometime between July and August 1992, but investigations were not commenced until October 1995 and the appellants were not charged until 6 November 1996. The case was adjourned for a further mention on 6 January 1997. Thereafter, pre-trial conferences were held on 29 January and 28 February. At the second pre-trial conference, the matter was fixed for trial from 14 to 25 April 1997.
 3.On 4 April, ten days before the trial was due to commence, the deputy public prosecutor requested that the trial dates be vacated on the basis that Tham, who was the prosecution`s key witness, had a serious medical problem and was unable to attend court. Tham had undergone an operation to implant a permanent heart pacemaker and was not then physically fit to testify. The prosecution`s request was supported by a medical report of one Dr Choo dated 1 April 1997 documenting Tham`s condition.
 4.The original hearing dates were thus vacated and another pre-trial conference was fixed on 10 April 1997. There were further pre-trial conferences on 8 May, 19 June and 9 July 1997. On all of those occasions, the deputy public prosecutor informed the court that Tham was still unwell and unable to attend court. The court adjourned the matter for a further pre-trail conference on 14 August 1997.
 5.Meanwhile, by a letter dated 17 June 1997, counsel for the appellants made representations to the public prosecutor for the withdrawal of the charge. On 14 August, the deputy public prosecutor informed the court that he had rejected the representations made by the appellants` counsel and that it intended to apply for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, pursuant to s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The hearing of this application took place on 22 and 27 August. On 28 August, the trial judge ordered that both appellants be discharged, such discharge not amounting to an acquittal. The appellants thus appealed against the trial judge`s decision.
 6.In the meantime, since 23 November 1996, the first appellant has been interdicted on quarter pay and has not been allowed to go back to work.
 7.
 Reasons for the prosecution`s application
The prosecution gave the following reasons for their application. First, the medical condition of Tham rendered him unable to testify in court. Second, they alleged that one of their material witnesses, Philip Soh (Soh) was not available as the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) had lost contact with him around March 1997, and that they were still trying to locate his whereabouts.
 8.
 The appellants` contentions
As a preliminary issue, counsel for the first appellant argued that the court had no jurisdiction to make any order under s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code as the summary trial had not commenced. At the time the prosecution made the application, no hearing dates had been fixed and none of the prosecution`s witnesses had given evidence.
 9.The first appellant further submitted that if the court granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, this would be prejudicial to him as he could be interdicted indefinitely. This is because under reg 8(a) of the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations, no disciplinary proceedings can be taken against the first appellant until the criminal proceedings have been determined. A discharge not amounting to an acquittal is not a determination of the criminal proceedings.
 10.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge dealt firstly with the issue of jurisdiction and held that the court had jurisdiction to make an order under s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code. An application can be made under s 184 `at any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered`. The trial judge held that under s 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a summary trial commences when the charge is first read and explained to the accused. In this case the summary trial began on 6 November 1996. The prosecution`s application was thus made after the summary trial had begun.
 11.The trial judge then proceeded to deal with the prosecution`s reasons for the application. First, with regard to the unavailability of Tham due to his medical condition, the prosecution had subsequently abandoned their stand on this. The position was thus that Tham was available and was able to give evidence. As such, the prosecution`s application on this ground would have failed.
 12.Next, the trial judge agreed with counsel for the first appellant that a discharge not amounting to an acquittal would not determine the criminal proceedings, within the meaning of reg 8 of the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations, as the first appellant could still be charged subsequently on the same charge. As such, this reason could not be used to support the prosecution`s application.
 13.Lastly, the deputy public prosecutor informed the court that the CPIB had lost contact with a material witness, Philip Soh, since March 1997 and that they were still trying to locate his whereabouts. The trial judge held that the non-availability of Soh was, in this case, not a factor that militated in favour of the court granting a discharge amounting to an acquittal. Soh was a Singapore citizen, the CPIB had indicated that the assistance of the police had been sought in tracing him and a check with the Singapore Immigration Department did not indicate that he had left the state.
 14.In addition, arrangements had been made for the investigator to be informed if the Singapore Immigration Department came across the witness should he attempt to leave the state. This was not a case where the witness could not be found even after much effort and time had been expended. The trial judge stressed that the loss of contact was only recent. Moreover, both appellants faced serious charges and the prosecution did not intend to leave matters suspended indefinitely. On the other hand, should the appellants be granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal, they could not be charged again for the same offence. Thus, the trial judge ordered that both appellants be discharged, such discharge not amounting to an acquittal.
 15.
 The appeal
At the appeal before me, counsel for the appellants gave two reasons why the court should have made an order for a discharge amounting to an acquittal. First, counsel submitted that the unavailability of Philip Soh was not a good ground to exercise the discretion in favour of the prosecution. This ground was never raised by the prosecution before 22 August 1997 and it had not been demonstrated that Soh is a material witness for the prosecution.
 16.Second, by virtue of reg 8 of the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations, disciplinary action cannot be taken against the first appellant upon any grounds involved in the criminal charge until the determination of the criminal proceedings. Since 23 November 1996, the appellant has been interdicted on quarter pay and has not been allowed to go back to work. At the same time, he is not permitted to get another job. As such, there was a great deal of prejudice to the first appellant.
 17.Turning then to s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) which states as follows: 
(1) At any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered, the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge and thereupon all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same. 
(2) Such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court so directs except in cases coming under section 177.
 18.Before I deal with the substantive issue of whether the discharge should have been one amounting to an acquittal or not, I would like to deal with a few preliminary points. First , s 184 of the CPC allows the prosecution to make an application `at any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered`. As to when a summary trial begins for the purposes of s 184(1), I had previously dealt with this in 
PP v Chieu Poi Guan & Ors
 
[1994] 1 CLAS News 308
, at p 309: 
Inter alia powers under s 184 can only be invoked `at any stage of a summary trial`. In this case the order was made before hearing dates had been fixed. Accordingly one might inquire whether the order was made `at any stage of a summary trial` ie had the summary trial begun when the order was made.
 
 
Generally it is not the case that a court will proceed to immediately hear the complainant after a plea of `claim trial` is recorded when an accused is first produced in court. The usual process following such a plea will be an application by the prosecution or the defence or both for an adjournment for one or more reasons Such applications will generally be granted by the court in the exercise of its powers under s 198 Criminal Procedure Code. However, the fact that evidence is not recorded immediately after a plea of `claim trial` does not detract from the fact that the summary trial has begun. It is from that point of the proceedings that the public prosecutor can, if he chooses to do so, under s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant and the court will then make an order of `discharge amounting to an acquittal` or `discharge not amounting to an acquittal`.
 19.It was accepted in 
 PP v Chieu Poh Guan 
 that the summary trial against the accused had begun when they entered a plea of `claim trial`. However, although both the appellants did not enter a plea of `claim trial` when they first appeared in court on 6 November 1996, the charges had been read and explained to them on that date. I agree with the trial judge that from a reading of s 180 of the CPC, a summary trial commences when the charge is first read and explained to the appellants.
 20.This view is also consistent with the approach of Matthew CJ in 
Goh Tong v PP
 [1953] MLJ 252 where the court dealt with the phrase `commencement of the trial` in s 173 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code which is in pari materia with s 180 of our CPC. His honour stated at p 252: 
In s 173 the phrase does not occur, but for the purposes of that section the trial the framing of the charge which means, in practice, the approval by the court of the draft charge entered beforehand by the prosecution.
 21.Second, the jurisdiction of the court to grant a discharge under this section only arises when the public prosecutor informs the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge. As I had stated in 
PP v Kolandavelu
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 446
 , in the absence of such information, the court has no jurisdiction to exercise its powers under this section.
 22.Third, when the public prosecutor informs the court that he will not further prosecute a defendant upon a charge, he does so in the exercise of the discretionary power conferred upon him by the Constitution and the CPC. Article 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore provides: 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 Section 336(1) of the CPC further states that: 
The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 As I had previously stated in 
Arjan Singh v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 271
 , there can be no suggestion that the court may interfere with the prosecutorial discretion to make such a decision.
 23.Fourth, when the public prosecutor informs the court that he will not further prosecute a defendant upon a charge, the court has no discretion as to the staying of all proceedings on that charge and as to the discharge of the defendant from and of the same. This is obvious from the wording of s 184(1) which states that `all proceedings on the charge against the defendant 
 shall 
 be stayed and he 
 shall 
 be discharged from and of the same` [emphasis mine].
 24.The court`s discretion arises only as a result of s 184(2), to direct whether or not such discharge shall amount to an acquittal. Such discretion is unfettered, although the initial presumption under s 184(2) is that in the ordinary case, the order of discharge should not amount to an acquittal.
 25.Fifth, although it is for the prosecution to decide whether or not it will further prosecute the accused on the charge in question, if it decides not to do so, it ought to inform the court in clear terms. In addition, and for the purpose of s 184(2) of the CPC, the public prosecutor ought to inform the court of all relevant matters as early as possible, for example, the difficulty of tracing a material witness and his intention as to the likelihood of future prosecution of the accused on the charge.
 26.Clearly, a discharge per se is no more than a mere release from particular proceedings which are being stayed. As I had explained in 
 Arjan Singh v PP 
 the significance of the court`s discretion for these purposes is not merely that an acquittal would entitle the defendant to a plea of previous acquittal under s 239 of the CPC in the future. More immediately, where a defendant is discharged but not acquitted, the prosecution may be seen to have unconstrained licence for indefinite and possibly unconscionable delay, the cost of which will be substantially visited upon the hapless defendant.
 27.With regard to the exercise of the discretion of the court under s 184(2), I would agree with the considerations which were adopted in 
 K Abdul Rasheed v PP 
; 
 Ah Chak Arnold 
 
v PP
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 193
  [1984-1985] SLR 561 where Lai Kew Chai J stated at pp 195E (MLJ) and 564 (SLR): 
a court must bear in mind and give due regard to the right of the prosecution to proceed at a later stage: 
 Seet Ah Ann v PP
. On the other hand, there is ample persuasive authority for the proposition that unless some good ground is shown it would not be right to leave an individual saddled with a charge in which proceedings are stayed for an indeterminate period
 Hence, the court must act judicially and consider both the public interest and any unfairness to an accused person.
 28.The deputy public prosecutor had stated the unavailability of Philip Soh as one of the grounds in support of it application. As pointed out by the appellants, Soh`s unavailability was not brought to the attention of the trial judge before 22 August 1997, which was some five months after the CPIB had lost contact with him. Moreover, the prosecution had not made known when this witness could be made available.
 29.As I had stated earlier, the prosecution ought to inform the court of all relevant matters as early as possible. In March 1997 or sometime thereafter, the prosecution should have informed the court that one of their material witnesses was not available. There were numerous occasions between March and August 1997 at which the prosecution could have done so, and no explanation was given for their omission to notify the court until 22 August 1997.
 30.The prosecution`s failure to inform the court as early as possible of the unavailability of a material witness is a factor which may result in great prejudice and unfairness to the accused. After all the court should be appraised of all relevant matters to enable it to come to a decision as to whether to proceed with the trial or to grant further adjournments (short of the public prosecutor invoking s 184 of the CPC), whilst the accused should not have to bear the burden of a charge hanging over his head indefinitely.
 31.Be it as it may, on the facts of this case, I agreed with the trial judge that an order for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was appropriate. First, it is not true to say that the prosecution had not demonstrated in any way that Soh was a material witness. In the prosecution`s written submissions tendered to the court below for their s 184 application, they had explained that Soh was a material witness in that he was the intermediary in the alleged offence.
 32.Second, the non-availability of Soh was not a factor which militated in favour of the court granting a discharge amounting to an acquittal in this case. The witness was a Singapore citizen. The CPIB had indicated that the assistance of the police had been sought in tracing the witness. A check with the Singapore Immigration Department did not indicate that he had left the state. Arrangements had been made for the investigator to be informed if the Singapore Immigration Department came across the witness should he attempt to leave the country.
 33.This was not a case in which the prosecution was not making sufficient effort to trace a witness, nor where the witness could not be found even after much effort and time had been expended. The loss of contact was fairly recent. Moreover, it did not appear that the prosecution had intended to leave matters suspended indefinitely.
 34.The appellants relied on the cases of 
 K Abdul Rasheed v PP; Ah Chak Arnold v PP 
 and 
Goh Cheng Chuan v PP
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 401
  
[1990] SLR 671
 , in which the accused persons were discharged with such discharge amounting to an acquittal. However, these cases can be distinguished from the present facts. In 
 Ah Chak Arnold 
, one of the two prosecution`s material witnesses had died and the other was a foreigner who was unavailable and was likely to remain so indefinitely.
 35.In 
 K Abdul Rasheed 
 no reasons were given by the prosecution for its application for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. In such circumstances, it may not be easy to see why the court should exercise its discretion in favour of the prosecution. In any event, at the appeal by the accused, the prosecution had indicated that it was not resisting the appeal. In 
 Goh Cheng Chuan 
, the material witness was unavailable and could not be found even after five years from the date the charge was first brought against the appellant. In addition, one of the complainants had passed away.
 36.Counsel for the first appellant then brought up the issue of reg 8 of the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations which states as follows: 
If criminal proceedings are instituted against a public officer, proceedings for his dismissal upon any grounds involved in the criminal charge shall not be taken until - 
(a) the criminal proceedings have been determined; or 
(b) if there is an appeal against conviction, the appeal has been withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn or disposed of by the Appellate Court.
 37.Counsel for the first appellant submitted that if the court granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, the criminal proceedings would not have been `determined` within the meaning of reg 8(a) and accordingly, no disciplinary proceedings could be taken against him. This would be prejudicial to the first appellant who could be interdicted indefinitely. The deputy public prosecutor however submitted otherwise.
 38.I would firstly like to point out that this argument is applicable only with regard to the first appellant, who is an officer in the public service. I agreed with the learned trial judge that criminal proceedings would not have been `determined`, in the ordinary sense of the word, should a discharge not amounting to an acquittal be granted, as the first appellant could still be charged subsequently on the same charge. As I had earlier explained, a discharge is no more than a mere release from particular proceedings which are being stayed. As such, this argument could not be used to support the prosecution`s application.
 39.It is invariable that some prejudice will be caused to an accused person who has been granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, particularly where he may be interdicted indefinitely. In as much as the prosecution should prosecute its cases with due diligence, it would be an unwarranted restriction of the court`s discretion to demand an assurance from the prosecution that it will commit itself to a deadline for recommencing the case against an accused. As I had stated in 
 Arjan Singh v PP 
, an indefinite apprehension of criminal proceedings being recommenced cannot be conclusive but simply a factor to be weighed in the balance with all the other circumstances of the case.
 40.However, as I had mentioned earlier, this was not a case in which the prosecution intends to leave matters suspended indefinitely, and the loss of contact with Soh was recent. In addition under reg 7(4) of the Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations, if any subsequent disciplinary proceedings against the first appellant do not result in his dismissal, the Public Service Commission has a discretion to refund such portion of the emoluments withheld as a result of his interdiction. Under reg 7(3), if proceedings against the public officer do not result in his dismissal or other punishment, he shall be entitled to the full amount of the emoluments which he would have received had he not been interdicted.
 41.Thus, the prejudice to the first appellant at the end of the day may not be as harsh as it seems as the Regulations do provide adequate protection and compensation to an officer who has been interdicted but subsequently cleared of fault at the disciplinary proceedings. On the other hand, it would be prejudicial to public interest to allow the appellants to be discharged with such discharge amounting to an acquittal, as public interest demands that crimes should be prosecuted and criminals be brought to justice. This is more so if the charge is of a serious nature, as in this case.
 42.As this juncture, I would like to reiterate the words of Lai Kew Chai J found in 
 K Abdul Rasheed 
 at p 195G (MLJ) and p 564 (SLR) where his honour stated: 
It is not desirable to set down any principles which a court must follow when acting under sub-s 183(2) of the Code [now s 184(2)] as if it is writ in stone and thereby fetter the discretion of the court which has to be judicially exercised. Circumstances do vary from case to case. Each case has to be dealt with on its merits, with the court bearing in mind the public interest and the right of the individual
 43.Based on all the above factors, I did not see fit to interfere with the order made by the learned trial judge.",1998-02-02 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (PCA). In each charge the appellant was alleged to have corruptly given a sum of money to one Abu Bakar s/o Koya Pattukudi (Abu Bakar), an immigration officer, as a reward for assisting him in obtaining social visit passes for various Indonesian nationals to enter Singapore through the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint. Seven similar charges under s 6(b) PCA were taken into consideration in sentencing. The appellant was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each of the two charges, both sentences to run consecutively. This total of 18 months` imprisonment was to run consecutively with sentences currently being served by the appellant. Effectively, the appellant was to serve a total of 36 months` imprisonment. His appeal against sentence was dismissed by me. I now give my grounds.
 2.
 Background
The statement of facts revealed that on 8 October 1996 at the Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint an immigration inspector noted that three vans carrying Indonesian nationals headed specifically for Counter No 23 for clearance. This drew his attention because there were other counters with no queue of vehicles waiting for clearance. The immigration inspector checked and found that the 18 Indonesian nationals in the vans had each been issued with a two-week social visit pass by Sharifah bte Daud (Sharifah), the immigration officer manning Counter No 23 when they should only be granted a pass for three days to one week. The three vans and 18 Indonesian nationals were detained.
 3.Investigations exposed the involvement of Sharifah and five other immigration officers with two syndicates operating to assist Indonesian nationals in obtaining two-week social visit passes in return for bribes. The appellant acted as an intermediary between a `Fudin` who operated the syndicates and the immigration officers in the scheme. The immigration officers were recruited by the appellant`s cousin, Abu Bakar, on his behalf. Details of their respective shifts and counter duties would be provided by the immigration officers to Abu Bakar who would then inform the appellant who in turn would convey the information to Fudin whereupon Fudin would then make arrangements accordingly.
 4.Upon clearance at the checkpoint, the Indonesian nationals would be driven to a car park to meet the appellant. They would then make a payment of between S$125 to S$130 to the appellant. The money collected would be shared between the appellant, Abu Bakar, Fudin and the immigration officers. Investigations also revealed that on two separate occasions in September 1996, the appellant had at a coffeeshop at Choa Chu Kang given two sums of $1,560 and $1,500 respectively to Abu Bakar for clearing 26 and 25 Indonesian nationals respectively. These transactions were the subject of the two charges proceeded with in the court below.
 5.
 Decision below
In assessing sentence, on the application of the prosecution and with the consent of the appellant, the district judge took into consideration seven similar charges, brief details of which were as follows:
 
(1)
DAC 4887/97 (P3A)
$30
(2)
DAC 4888/97 (P4A)
$1,080
(3)
DAC 4889/97 (P5A)
$540
(4)
DAC 4890/97 (P6A)
$480
(5)
DAC 4891/97 (P7A)
$300
(6)
DAC 4892/97 (P8A)
$300
(7)
DAC 4893/97 (P9A)
$420
 In all the above charges, over a period between June to August 1996, Abu Bakar received these bribes at a coffee shop in Choa Chu Kang Road. The court was also made aware that the appellant was serving sentences for four similar charges which he had been found guilty of and convicted after a trial and for which he was ordered to serve six months` imprisonment on each of the four sentences. Three of the sentences were to run consecutively while the fourth sentence was ordered to run concurrently. He was thus serving an 18 months` imprisonment sentence with effect from 30 September 1997.
 6.The district judge took into account as mitigating the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty. He also considered that the appellant had no similar previous conviction. The district judge was of the opinion, however, that the nature of the offence called for a deterrent sentence and sentenced the appellant to nine months` imprisonment on each of the two charges, the sentences to run consecutively. He also ordered that this 18 months` term of imprisonment run consecutively to the sentence already being served by the appellant.
 7.
 The appeal
Counsel`s main contention was that the district judge had erred in ordering a deterrent sentence since the appellant was already serving a deterrent sentence. He submitted that the district judge had exercised his discretion purely on the need for what he saw in effect to be `double deterrence`. It was true that the appellant was already subjected to a deterrent sentence of 18 months` imprisonment on the four charges in the first hearing. The prosecution in that case had applied for a deterrent sentence and the court had granted one. Counsel for the appellant argued that the prosecution in the present case `did not press for a deterrent sentence for the obvious reason that he (the appellant) was already serving a deterrent sentence`.
 8.A deterrent sentence is granted entirely within the court`s discretion. There is no requirement in law for the prosecution to apply for deterrence before a court may consider it in the exercise of its discretion. There is also no prohibition in law from judicial discretion being exercised in favour of ordering a deterrent sentence where the offender is already serving a deterrent sentence. The court must direct its mind to the nature of the offence and the relevance of deterrence in arresting the offender`s criminal intent. The court in 
PP v Loo Chang Hock
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 316
  at p 318 observed that deterrence `may well be of considerable value where crime is premeditated`. In this case, the appellant was involved in a carefully orchestrated scheme of illegally securing two-week social passes for more than 60 foreigners intending to find illegal employment in Singapore. I might accept counsel`s point that the court`s exercise of its discretion to order a second deterrent sentence may be an exercise in futility in terms of deterring the appellant as an individual. But my view was that we are here concerned with deterrence at a wider more general level.
 9.So this was to be distinguished from instances where such an approach was censured because the need for a deterrent sentence arose out of a desire not so much to educate and deter like-minded members of the general public but more out of a need to rehabilitate the criminal persuasion of the offender. One such offender was Peter Tham in 
Tham Wing Fai Peter v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 404
 ; 
[1989] SLR 448
 where he successfully appealed against sentence. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) expressed the view that to impose another deterrent sentence would be tantamount to making the appellant suffer double deterrent sentences arising out of basically the same matrix of facts relating to the appellant`s stockbroking business. Although the facts of that particular appeal did not concern a separate case bearing the same defendant (a case concerning offences that shaped the Pan-El debacle (referred to below)), it was clear to Chao Hick Tin JC that the surrounding circumstances had erroneously influenced the district judge`s decision. Therefore, Chao Hick Tin JC in that case interfered with the sentence because he felt the district judge had been wrong in deciding to impose a deterrent sentence by taking into account matters which had nothing to do with the charge. Those factors blamed Peter Tham for the Pan-El turn of events and we need no reminder of what bearing that disaster had on the general public as a whole. Such considerations would have justified a deterrent sentence of general application. Such considerations, in this particular 
 Peter Tham 
 case were not relevant, thereby deeming such general deterrence irrelevant. Chao Hick Tin JC felt disinclined to allow a deterrent sentence because the sentence was a manifestly excessive one which could only achieve a limited deterrent effect on Peter Tham. In the present appeal, justified by the threat to national security posed by the offence, I was inclined to the view that the sentence was not so manifestly excessive as to have a limited deterrent effect at a wider general level and found no reason to disturb the court`s exercise of its discretion.
 10.
 Other contentions
Counsel argued that the appellant was already undergoing a sentence of 18 months` imprisonment with effect from 30 September 1997 on charges of a similar nature that formed part of the same transaction, saying that they were not distinct from the conviction at the earlier trial. I encountered some difficulty accepting this as an accurate statement of the facts. On the face of it, many facts of this case might suggest one transaction. All the charges concerned the same conduct of unlawfully awarding gratification to a government officer and were only distinguished one from the other in terms of the amounts charged. All the charges referred to `a coffee shop in Choa Chu Kang Road`. The recipient in all the charges was one Abu Bakar, a cousin of the appellant`s. And, finally, the investigations that led to the charges were prompted by one incident : the discovery by an inspector that three vans were suspiciously headed to the same counter at the Woodlands Checkpoint on 8 October 1996.
 11.The fact of inter-relation is significant but inconclusive. The various acts may be inter-related, yet in all the circumstances, the proper conclusion may be that there is not one criminal liability but several, as in the case of 
Tham Wing Fai Peter v PP
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 424
  
[1988] SLR 424
 (the `forgery` case). This was the separate `other` case mentioned above where Peter Tham was charged with 18 charges of forging 18 separate share certificates, individually numbered, and 18 corresponding `blank transfers` on two occasions. Each could not be a component part of the other and the Court of Appeal said the trial judge was right in holding that there were 36 offences. The law framed the appellant in the present case as being involved in several transactions. Great care should be taken before accepting this series of events as one or the same transaction as the sentences might then be taken to offend the `one-transaction` rule discussed in 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 .
 12.I thought it most unfortunate if such a rule were made to apply to the present facts. Should an offender be subjected to a shorter period of incarceration because he managed to commit distinct offences within the same period of time? Given the gravity of the offences concerned, the law could not afford to award a discount in sentence by virtue of the appellant`s ability to usher in 18 Indonesian nationals in three vans within one night as compared to if he were to channel each Indonesian national in at widely spaced intervals of time. The law has framed the offences in the present appeal as corruption. That may be so. However, the consequence of this corrupt scheme not only concerned gaining some ill advantage, it also threatened the very happy belief shared by Singaporeans that adequate controls are in place to ensure security.
 13.
 Sentences in related cases
In separate hearings, the immigration officers involved pleaded guilty to offences under s 6(a) PCA for receiving bribes in various amounts. In deference to counsel for the appellant`s arguments raised at the appeal before me, I shall mention one of the sentences ordered by the courts below in dealing with the immigration officers. Sharifah, for example, faced a total of 13 charges under s 6(a) PCA. The prosecution proceeded with five charges, taking into consideration the remaining eight. She received a six months` sentence on each charge, the sentences to be served consecutively.
 14.Counsel for the appellant argued that Sharifah, although a public servant and a recipient of bribes, was given a comparatively lower sentence of six months` imprisonment on each charge. Time and again, I have emphasised that consistency in sentencing, while being a desirable goal, is not an overriding consideration, since the sentences in similar cases may have been either too high or too low: see 
Yong Siew Soon v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 933
  at p 936. It was noted in that case that Grimberg JC had observed in 
Goh Moh Siah v PP
 
[1988] 2 CLAS News 14
 that he saw no reason why a court should be fettered by a sentence imposed by another court and which he rightly regarded as being inadequate for his present purposes. Similarly I did not think the sentence imposed on Sharifah or any of the immigration offices posed any ceiling to the discretion of the court below. While holding public office is deemed an aggravating factor, the appellant`s case was not devoid of aggravating factors. The corrupt scheme was, in a real sense, initiated by the appellant in approaching his cousin, Abu Bakar.
 15.In any case, I believed that the present appeal might be distinguished from Sharifah`s case. The appellant initially claimed trial to the charges. He did not plead guilty to all his charges whereas Sharifah did not appear to have hesitated in owning up to her involvement in the scheme. No doubt the appellant eventually pleaded guilty and could now inform the court of his remorse. This aspect of his case had been addressed by the district judge in his decision and I saw no reason to fault his decision on these grounds.
 16.Before concluding, I would make one observation. In delivering his grounds of decision, the district judge considered the absence of any similar previous convictions on the appellant`s record. Strictly speaking, this was incorrect. However, because the appellant`s previous conviction on 30 September 1997 was of a similar nature, and was so close in time and arose out of offences of a similar although distinct character, little or no weight was given to this previous conviction for the purposes of sentencing.
 17.
 Whether sentence manifestly excessive
Given the many charges in the present appeal, the overriding consideration remained whether the sentence offended the totality principle. I noted that the present sentence did not fall foul of either of the limbs: the cumulative sentence of 36 months did not exceed the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, nor could the aggregate sentence of nine months be said to have the effect of imposing on the offender `a crushing sentence`. I did not think it fair to compare the sentence of six months meted out for each similar charge in the appellant`s first conviction for the reason that, in the present case, although only two charges were proceeded with, the court had to take into account some seven remaining charges.
 18.In conclusion, I turn once again to the facts of the present case. At [para ] 8 of his judgment, the district judge noted: 
On the other hand, the offences committed by the accused are undoubtedly serious. He is part of a syndicate to make financial gains at the expense of the interest and security of the State. Such acts of corruption cannot be allowed to proliferate. 
 Acts of corruption must be effectively and decisively dealt with. Otherwise the very foundation of our country will be seriously undermined.
 Therefore a deterrent sentence was called for to deter the accused and like-minded persons from committing similar offences in the future. [Emphasis mine.]
 It was clear that the district judge had properly addressed his mind to the relevant issues discussed above. In my opinion, the sentence was fully justified and I dismissed the appeal.",1998-02-23 00:00:00,SG High Court

 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This is an appeal against the decision of the learned judge in the court below. We dismissed the appeal and we give our reasons now for so doing.
 2.
 The charge
The first and second appellants were charged as follows: 
That you,
 
Sim Cheng Hui
 
Teo Seng Peng
 
on or about 17 January 1997 at about 11.10am at the car park between Blocks 51 and 52 Marine Terrace, Singapore, did engage with one another and one Teo Lam Choon in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), namely, ten packets of substance containing not less than 499.5g of diamorphine by the said Teo Lam Choon and in pursuance of the said conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, one of you arranged for the said Teo Lam Choon to collect and transfer a plastic bag containing the said drugs from motor car JDM 8808 to motor car EV 5580J which were parked in the said car park for him to transport the said drug without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations make thereunder, and you have thereby abetted the commission of the offence by the said Teo Lam Choon of trafficking in the said drug, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 3.Both appellants claimed trial to the offence. In addition, Teo Choon Lam (Teo) was also charged for the offence of drug trafficking in the same trial, but he pleaded guilty soon after the trial commenced in the court below. Hence, his role subsequently in the trial, if any, was minimal.
 4.
 The brief facts
The facts pertaining to the appeal, which were largely undisputed, was this: sometime in the early hours of 17 January 1998, several Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers, acting upon instructions from their superiors, proceeded to Marine Terrace to conduct a stakeout on the first appellant. They were also told to look out for Teo and one Tan Bee Lan (Tan), and were shown photographs of all three of them to help identify them. According to Inspector Paul Teo, the officer in overall charge of the whole operation, CNB officers had previously tailed the first appellant and had received anonymous tip-offs about his activities. They had reason to believe that he was involved in drug trafficking activities. As for the second appellant, he was initially not a target of surveillance by the CNB officers. Unfortunately, they then came to be suspicious of his presence when he was spotted conversing with the first appellant.
 5.At about 11am, the first appellant was spotted leaving his flat at Block 52 Marine Terrace. The CNB officers at the scene therefore proceeded to tail him. By this time, more CNB officers had joined in the surveillance operation. Shortly thereafter, the first appellant was observed to have met up with the second appellant before walking together to the void deck of Block 52 where they had a conversation. It was also roughly around this time that the second appellant`s car was noticed and one of the CNB officers radioed his other colleagues at the scene informing them that this car had a Malaysian number plate of JDM 8808.
 6.After a brief moment, the first and second appellant parted company. While the first appellant walked along the void deck of Block 52, the second appellant walked towards Block 51. Consequently, the second appellant was observed to have made a phone call from a public phone nearby.
 7.The first appellant, on the other hand, met up with Teo. Teo was never anywhere near the scene previously, and had only just arrived in a car driven by Tan. This meeting took place somewhere at the entrance of a car park between Blocks 52 and 53. They were seem exchanging a few words before Teo handed over to the first appellant a white plastic bag. Consequently, the first appellant and Teo parted, and while Teo was seen returning to his car, car number plate EV 5508J, the first appellant took the white plastic bag and proceeded back to Block 51.
 8.At this juncture, the CNB officers divided themselves into two distinct groups. One group undertook to continue to observe the first appellant, while the second group proceeded to follow Teo. For those observing the first appellant, he was seen meeting up again with the second appellant, this time at the void deck of Block 51, and the white plastic bag which he obtained from Teo was handed over to him. After the handover, the first appellant walked towards Block 52 whereas the second appellant walked to a public telephone at the end of Block 51. The trial judge accepted that this was roughly around 11.10am or so.
 9.A quite different scenario was observed for Teo. After he returned back to his car from meeting the first appellant, he and Tan exited the car park and proceeded to the adjacent car park between Blocks 51 and 52. The car was then parked next to the second appellant`s car, whereupon Teo then got out and opened the front passenger door of the second appellant`s car before retrieving a white plastic bag. Thereafter, he closed the door and left the car park.
 10.As soon as he left the car park, the CNB officers at the scene received their instructions to arrest the first and second appellant. For the second appellant, he was apprehended just after he made his telephone call at a public phone booth at the end of Block 51. According to PW 13, who was one of the arresting officers, he testified that they moved in for the arrest sometime at 11.15am. The white plastic bag which the second appellant was carrying was seized. After the arrest, when the second appellant was pinned to the wall, PW 13 also confirmed he felt some wetness along his thighs and he realised consequently that the second appellant had urinated in his pants. Thereafter, the second appellant was escorted back into a car where he was guarded by some other officers. In addition, the car which he was driving, JDM 8808, was searched and apart from a sum of money totalling $9,600, nothing else was found. The plastic bag which the second appellant was found to be carrying contained money in the amount of $22,900.
 11.The arrest of the first appellant was equally straightforward. After he parted company with the second appellant, he walked towards Block 52. When the CNB officers moved in to arrest him, he ran, but only for a short distance, for he then gave up and surrendered to the officers. After he was arrested, he was searched and a handphone and pager was found on him. The handphone was subsequently handed over to Singapore Telecoms where it was established that its number was 96557426 and the subscriber the first appellant. During the trial, the first appellant did not dispute that the handphone belonged to him.
 12.Teo and Tan were also arrested, and this was done along Siglap Road, where they had travelled to after they left the car park at Marine Terrace. All this while, they were tailed by CNB officers. This journey took them along Marine Terrace, Marine Parade Road, Marine Crescent and finally to Siglap Road where Teo and Tan parked their car. Teo was also seem putting the white plastic bag which he took from the second appellant`s car into the car boot. When the CNB officers arrested them both, they were walking along Siglap Road towards Marine Parade Road.
 13.After the arrest, both of them were brought back to the car and they were questioned while the car was searched. Teo admitted without any qualification that he had drugs in his car which belonged to him and that he had obtained these drugs from a car with the number plate 8808. He had no idea who owned that car. Further, he also explained that he received a page call from a person named `Ah Pui` who left the number 8808 on his pager so as to help him identify the car to collect the drugs from. All he did therefore was to go to the car and retrieve the drugs. These were all then written down and signed by Teo. During the hearing in the court below, this statement was admitted as part of the prosecution`s case.
 14.Apart from the drugs seized from Teo, which amounted to ten slabs of matter containing diamorphine, two pagers were also seized from Teo and Tan respectively. It was established from Singapore Telecom Paging that the pager seized from Teo bore the number 93163664 while the one seized from Tan was numbered 95901232. It was also established that the pager seized from Teo was registered under Tan`s name.
 15.During the trial, the prosecution adduced documentary records which showed that the first appellant had paged Teo on 96319664 sometime after they met. These paged numbers contained the number 8808. The prosecution`s case was that after Teo and the first appellant met and parted, the first appellant met up with the second appellant to hand him the money for the drugs while at the same time giving Teo instructions as to where to collect the drugs which he had purchased. It was the prosecution`s contention that the second appellant was selling drugs to Teo with the first appellant acting as a middleman to transfer the money for the drugs from Teo to the second appellant.
 16.
 Close of prosecution`s case
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the learned judge concluded that a case had been made out against both the first and second appellants. After reminding himself of the law which he had to apply in assessing the prosecution`s evidence at the close of its case, he noted that the evidence of the prosecution, if believed, was that the second appellant was a drug supplier and Teo was the purchaser, and that the transaction was executed through the first appellant. He then continued: 
25 It was reasonable to infer from the evidence that [the first appellant] who played an active and vital part in the transaction knew what [Teo] was buying and what [the second appellant] was selling. I therefore found that a case had been made against each of the accused for him to be called to make his defence
 17.
 The defence
The first appellant elected to remain silent throughout the trial. He did not give any evidence, nor did he call any witnesses to support his defence. All his counsel did was to address the court below that there was insufficient evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case which warranted calling his defence.
 18.The second appellant, on the other hand, gave his own evidence. He did not call any other witnesses to testify on his behalf. His defence was simple, and it was that he did not know that the money which he received were for drugs. He was a 25 year old Malaysian who worked in a jewellery shop in Johor Bahru engaging in repairs and the making of gold jewellery. When he came to Singapore on the 17 January 1996, it was to purchase some tools for his work and also to collect some money for a childhood friend of his. This childhood friend, by the name of Ah Seng, had told him to collect some money from the first appellant. The second appellant had met the first appellant twice before, but had no idea who Teo was. As for the car which he was driving (ie the car with the number plate JDM 8808), he had rented it from a friend.
 19.When he met the first appellant, he was told to wait while the first appellant went to collect the money. This explained the first meeting between them and the parting afterwards. When they met for the second time, the first appellant handed the money over to him.
 20.After he was arrested, he claimed he was asked by the CNB officers who arrested him to open his car doors, which were locked at that time, so as to enable them to search the car. The CNB officers had by this time also taken his car keys. He obeyed the instructions, and the car was searched. He claimed that when he locked his car before meeting the first appellant, he had not noticed any white plastic bag. He also objected to the suggestion by the prosecution that Teo had opened the car door of his car without any problems, for he insisted it was locked and could not be opened without first deactivating the alarm.
 21.The learned judge, in addition to summarising the second appellant`s defence, also noted two inconsistencies which he felt were material. As he pointed out at [para ] 29 and 30 of his grounds of decision: 
29 When the [second appellant] was cross-examined, [he] said that [the first appellant] did not meet him at his car, and did not know how he got there, and was not told that he had come in motor car 8808. He also said that when [the first appellant] went to collect the money, he saw him going to the lift landing at Block 52 and pressing the lift button. Then he corrected himself and said that he saw [the first appellant] standing in front of the lift door, but did not see him pressing the lift button. 
30 With regard to the money to be collected, his evidence was that he was not told of the amount to be collected from [the first appellant]. It was only after he had collected the money that Ah Seng told him to check `if the amount was twenty-odd thousand.` He counted the money and told Ah Seng `there was about twenty-odd thousand`. This vagueness over the amount extended to [the first appellant] as well. When he delivered the money he told [the second appellant] that there was `twenty plus thousand` in the plastic bag.
 22.
 The learned judge`s decision
At the end of the trial, the learned judge found the first and second appellants guilty and convicted them accordingly. Further, since the first appellant elected to remain silent when his defence was called, the learned judge also drew an adverse inference against him under s 196(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). He held (at [para ] 41 of his grounds of decision): 
There was more evidence against the [first appellant] than there was against Oh Laye Koh [as in 
 Oh Laye Koh v PP 
]. There was no direct evidence that Oh Laye Koh was present or that he played a part when the girl was killed. [The first appellant`s] counsel accepted that he was engaged in the transaction, but contended that he was an unsuspecting dupe who became involved with [the second appellant] and [Teo] without knowing that they were dealing with drugs. In this situation [the first appellant] must explain his ignorance in the face of his active participation in the transaction. It is reasonable and well within his ability to do that. He is the best person to explain what he thought they were dealing with. When he refused to do that I drew an adverse inference against him.
 23.He continued (at [para ] 42): 
Consequently, when I reviewed all the evidence covering his first meeting with [the second appellant], his collecting the money from [Teo] and delivering it to [the first appellant], and his transmission of the pager messages to [Teo] of [the second appellant`s] car number and the adverse inference drawn from his silence. I found that his guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted him.
 24.As for the second appellant, after a review of his defence which included the inconsistencies in his evidence, the learned judge rejected his explanation that he was an innocent party who had been set up by his childhood friend. He concluded (at [para ] 49 of his grounds of decision): 
The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that [the second appellant] had driven his car with the drugs and had parked it in the car park to enable [Teo] to take delivery of the drugs. I therefore convicted him on the charge he faced.

 The first appellant`s appeal
During the hearing of the appeal, the first appellant relied on one ground of appeal only, namely that the learned judge erred when he recalled two prosecution witnesses to clarify certain matters relating to the prosecution`s case after its case had closed but before the defence was called. In the court below, the learned judge noted that the pager which was seized from Teo was initially not identified, nor was any direct evidence given that the pager was seized from Teo. He therefore asked the prosecution to produce additional evidence to supplement this omission in their case. Counsel for the first appellant argued that the learned judge erred in law accordingly, applying the principles for recalling witnesses as set out by this court in the case of 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 162
 . His argument was that the learned judge should not have allowed supplementary evidence to be called to clarify doubts within the prosecution`s case.
 26.With respect, we think the principles propounded by 
 PP v Bridges Christopher is 
 unhelpful to the first appellant and inapplicable in this respect. That case dealt with the recalling of rebuttal evidence to rebut the evidence which was crucial to the defence at the end of the defence case. In the present case, the scenario is quite the opposite. Not only had the defence not called its defence yet, the supplementary evidence called was done at the instance of the learned judge, and not on the application of the prosecution.
 27.In our opinion, s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) governed the position in the present case. Section 399 reads: 
Any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned, as a witness or recall and re-examine any person already examined and the court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person, if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.
 28.In essence, s 399 retained for a trial judge a statutory discretion to summon or recall a witness at any stage of the proceedings and this discretion was exactly what was exercised in the present case. The application of s 399 have been examined in various cases both by our local and the Malaysian courts. In 
PP v Phon Nam
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 415
 , a decision from the Supreme Court in Malaysia, Abdul Hamid Ag LP, explaining the precise ambit of this section (of which the exact Malaysian equivalent is found in s 425 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code), held (at p 416H): 
Section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code is clearly divided into two limbs; first, a discretionary provision which provides that the court may, on an application, summon any person as a witness or recall and re-examine any person already examined at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In exercising the discretion under the first limb, the court clearly must proceed with utmost circumspection especially when there was likelihood of the fresh evidence proving to be prejudicial to the accused. Secondly, an imperative provision which requires the court to do so where the court is satisfied that the evidence to be summoned would appear to the court to be essential to a just decision of the case (see 
 Mohd Azam v Mohd Iqbal
 PLD 1984 SC 95 with the corresponding section in the Pakistan Criminal Procedure Code).
 29.Similarly, in the case of 
Ramli bin Kechik v PP
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 33
 , Mohamed Azmi SCJ, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, held, in relation to s 425 (at p 34E): 
The section is intended to enable the court to get at the truth and to come to a proper conclusion in the matter under inquiry or trial. It is not limited to witnesses whom the court examines on its own behalf but also applies to witnesses for the prosecution as well as witnesses for the defence. Hence, the defence as well as the prosecution may be allowed to adduce additional evidence under this section. The object of the section is just as much the prevention of escape of a guilty person through some carelessness of the prosecution or the Magistrate as the vindication of the innocence of the person wrongly accused owing to the carelessness and ignorance of one party. If there is the apprehension of justice failing by an erroneous acquittal or by an erroneous conviction the court would be justified in exercising its discretion in calling for additional evidence under this section. Where the court is of the opinion that the evidence of certain witnesses is essential to the just decision of the case, it is bound to summon them, and for this purpose the trial can be adjourned. A just decision under this section does not mean a decision in favour of the defence (see 
 Rengaswami Naicker`s
 case[1954] Cr LJ 123). Thus, it would not be an improper exercise of the power merely because the evidence taken supports the case of the prosecution and not that of the accused. In our view, by its nature the discretion to be exercised under section 425 CPC depends on the facts of each case - the main consideration being the essentiality of the additional evidence to the just decision of the case.
 30.We think the above two cited passages sum up essentially what can be said about s 399. In our opinion, we respectfully agree that s 399 confers a discretionary power upon a court to recall or summon witnesses and this power should be exercised sparingly and judiciously to the just decision of the case (see 
 PP v Phon Nam 
). In the local context, s 399 was discussed in the case of 
Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 276
  but for present purposes, we think it unnecessary to set out the facts of the case as that case was one which dealt with the approach to be taken where the trial judge failed to call a witness under s 399 of the CPC. However, it is pertinent to note that the relevant Malaysian authorities pertaining to this section were followed.
 31.Applying s 399, and reverting back to the facts of the present case, we had no doubt whatsoever that the learned judge did not err when he exercised his discretion to recall two prosecution witnesses to clarify matters in relation to the prosecution`s case. In the notes of evidence, the learned judge clearly made known his concerns to all the parties in the trial below as to the inadequacies within the prosecution`s evidence (ie that the pager might not have belonged to Teo). There was no doubt that if these inadequacies were not addressed, there might result in a failure of justice, in the sense that the truth pertaining to the case could not be established. Hence, it was perfectly within the learned judge`s authority and discretion to recall the witnesses to supplement the prosecution`s evidence so as to allow him to dispense justice fairly. It was imperative for the learned judge, as he did in the present case, find out the number of the pager which Teo was carrying so as to enable him to draw the link that the first appellant paged Teo instructing him where to collect the drugs. As in 
Chee Wee Tiong v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 499
 , the sole purpose for recalling the witnesses in the present case was to clarify evidence which had already been adduced before the court. Both Teo and the first appellant were on trial for the offence of drug trafficking and abetment to trafficking respectively. The learned judge sought to connect them together in the whole transaction of drug trafficking using s 399. Accordingly, we hold that there was no question that the learned judge exercised his discretion properly in the present case. As Wan Yahya J stated in the case of 
PP v Abdul Rahim bin Abdul Satar
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 188
  (at p 190H): 
The role of a judge in our adversarial system of justice has often been misunderstood. Although depicted symbolically as a blindfolded lady balancing the scales of justice, a judge should not be completely oblivious to the surrounding events at the trial affecting his assessment of a case. It is true that he must not load onto any side of the scales extrinsic evidence but he certainly owes a duty to take onto the scales formal evidence which, although available and alluded to, was inadvertently left out by either party.
 32.This was exactly what the learned judge sought to achieve in the present case and therefore the first appellant had no substance in his appeal that the learned judge erred when he directed the prosecution to recall witnesses to clarify some doubts within its case.
 33.In any event, it seemed unusual to us that the first appellant should choose to appeal on a ground which had little bearing on his own case. The first appellant`s appeal that the learned judge erred in admitting additional evidence, insofar as it was material, only related to the prosecution`s case against Teo himself and had nothing to do with the first appellant`s involvement in the present case. Hence, even if we were to hold that the learned judge erred by allowing the supplementary evidence to clarify the prosecution`s case, ultimately it would have little impact in determining the first appellant`s guilt in the present case. We could therefore see no relevance in the first appellant`s ground of appeal in relation to himself. However, since he did not appeal on any other substantial, we had little choice but to dismiss his appeal.
 34.
 The second appellant`s appeal
The second appellant, on the other hand, ran a distinctively different appeal as compared to the first appellant. First, he contended that the elements of the offence had not been satisfied by the prosecution when it closed its case.
 35.In our judgment, this argument was without any merit. The second appellant, together with the first appellant, was charged with abetment of trafficking by conspiracy. The position in relation to this area of the law was this: before the second appellant could be found guilty, the prosecution must show that there `was the existence of a conspiracy to do an illegal act, with the result that the illegal act which was the object of the conspiracy was actually carried out` (see 
Lai Kam Loy v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 787
  at p 795). In the case of 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , this court held (at p 873G): 
The essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. In fact there is no requirement in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other`s company throughout or at all
 
One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
 36.The same principles were stated in the case of
 Lai Kam Loy v PP 
.
 37.Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we were of the opinion that the offence of abetment by conspiracy had been made out by the prosecution. First, there was no dispute by the second appellant that he met with the first appellant and had received a large sum of money totalling nearly $23,000 from him. It was also not disputed that the money which the first appellant handed over to the second appellant was obtained from Teo. In addition, there was incontrovertible evidence that Teo then retrieved a bag containing ten slabs of drugs from his car and he consequently admitted that these were collected from the second appellant`s car. Just as significantly, the first appellant communicated to Teo the number 8808 instructing him as to where to collect his purchased drugs, and this number corresponded to the car number plate of the car which the second appellant drove to Singapore. The second appellant also could not support his testimony that he was doing his childhood friend a favour by coming to Singapore from Johor to collect some money owed to this friend by the first appellant.
 38.Taking all the evidence as a whole, we had no doubt that it could be inferred that there existed a conspiracy between Teo, the first and second appellants to traffic drugs. The prosecution had adduced enough evidence which justified such an inference to be drawn. The second appellant argued that there was no evidence which could prove that he ever abetted Teo in the commission of the offence of drug trafficking but we think this line of argument is unmeritorious. Far from it, we think it could be seen that the second appellant played an active role in selling the drugs to Teo. The second appellant brought drugs to be sold to Teo. He came to Marine Terrace in a car bearing the number plate 8808 and this number plate was subsequently communicated to Teo, whereupon he (meaning Teo) then went to the car and retrieved the drugs after paying for it though an intermediary (ie the first appellant). As such, there was overwhelming evidence produced by the prosecution that the elements of the offence had been satisfied.
 39.The second appellant also sought to challenge the legality of the learned judge`s decision using Teo`s statement against him in the trial below. It will be remembered that after Teo was arrested, he made a statement that the drugs which he was found to be in possession of belonged to him and that he had collected them after receiving instructions from a car bearing the number plate 8808.
 40.The learned judge took the approach by holding that Teo`s statement was admissible against the second appellant under s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). At [para ] 47 of his grounds of decision, he held: 
[Teo] admitted in his statement that he had collected the bag from car 8808 in a car park somewhere in Marine Parade. [Teo`s] confession is admissible against [the second appellant] under s 30 of the Evidence Act as explained in 
Goh Joon Tong v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 305
 .
 41.The second appellant contended that this was a wrong approach. He argued in his submissions: 
28 It is humbly submitted that s 30 is activated when there is a `confession`. The statement made by [Teo] to [PW 15] is not an admission made by him stating or suggesting the inference that he has committed an offence of drug trafficking on or at the relevant date and time in question. The statement of Teo would at its highest by relevant to a fact in issue and therefore this cannot be construed as a confession.
 42.The only issue which we had to determine was whether Teo`s statement which he made to the CNB officers upon his arrest admitting to possession of the drugs found in his car fell to be considered as a `confession` within the Evidence Act and general case law. In this respect, we answered the question in the affirmative.
 43.Section 17 of the Evidence Act clearly provided the definition of `confession` to be: 
(2) A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 44.In our opinion, Teo`s statement which he made upon his arrest clearly implicated him in the offence of drug trafficking. In this respect, we only need to refer back to the case of 
Abdul Rashid v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 119
 , where this court held that statements made by the accused that he was in possession of drugs `unequivocally connected him` with the offence of drug trafficking and therefore such statements amounted to confessions within the definition of s 17(2). Although in the present instance Teo did not expressly admit to the offence of drug trafficking, we think this is immaterial, as the fact that he was found to be in possession of such a large amount of drugs must allow the inference to be drawn that he was trafficking these drugs. It was particularly pertinent to note that Teo did not say that the drugs were for his own consumption, and in such a case, it could be inferred taking into account all the circumstances of the case that he possessed the drugs for the sole purpose of trafficking them.
 45.In 
 Abdul Rashid v PP 
, this court endorsed the Privy Council decision of 
Anandagoda v R
 [1962] MLJ 289 where Lord Guest held (at p 291C): 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts.
 46.This cited passage has been approved time and time again in our local courts and applying the test enunciated by Lord Guest, we had no doubt whatsoever that Teo`s statement which he gave upon his arrest amounted to a confession as the statement allowed the inference to be drawn that he committed the offence of drug trafficking which he was later charged with. In that situation, following this court`s decision in 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 , Teo`s statement was rightly used by the learned judge against the second appellant under s 30 of the Evidence Act.
 47.That just leaves us with a final note, which we make for completeness sake. The second appellant`s appeal that Teo`s statement did not amount to a `confession` was only relevant to the extent that the statement could not be used against the second appellant. Once Teo`s statement was found to be a `confession` however, that statement became part of the evidence against the second appellant. Although Teo`s statement did not expressly point the guilty finger at the second appellant by saying that he was involved in the conspiracy to traffic drugs with the first appellant and Teo, the statement was probative to the extent that it showed Teo retrieved the drugs from the second appellant`s car (ie the car with a number plate 8808). This fact, coupled with the fact that the second appellant did not deny having possession of the same car, necessarily allowed the inference that he had drugs which were subsequently sold to Teo. In the circumstances, the only conclusion which the learned judge rightly drew was that the second appellant was also guilty of being involved in a conspiracy with Teo to traffic drugs.
 48.Having regard to both the first and second appellant`s appeals, we were satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case against each appellant beyond reasonable doubt and that the learned judge was right when he convicted them of the charge which they stood accused. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeals of both appellants.",1998-03-06 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted by the district court of three charges under s 213 Penal Code (Cap 224) for accepting gratification to screen an offender from punishment for offences of cheating under s 420. The appellant appealed against the sentences on the three charges only. After hearing the submissions, I dismissed the appeal and now set out my grounds.
 2.The charges against the appellant were set out as follows: . First charge (DAC13953/97)
 
You, Tay Boon Sien, M/40 yrs NRIC No: S 1239568Z are charged that you, sometime in the month of May 1994 in Singapore, did accept gratification of a sum of $4,000 for yourself from one Lim Boon Hui, in consideration of you screening the said Lim Boon Hui from legal punishment for offences of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, to wit, that you should be the scapegoat and admit to the investigation authorities that you had committed the offences of using a company Bojin Building Construction to cheat various victims into believing that the Thai workers supplied by Bojin were issued with genuine work permits and thereby inducing the victims to pay over to Bojin the MOL levy payments for the said workers, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 213 of the Penal Code.
 . Second charge (DAC13954/97)
 
You, Tay Boon Sien, M/40 yrs NRIC No: S 1239568Z are charged that you, sometime in the month of June 1994 in Singapore, did accept gratification of a sum of $4,000 for yourself from one Lim Boon Hui, in consideration of you screening the said Lim Boon Hui from legal punishment for offences of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, to wit, that you should be the scapegoat and admit to the investigation authorities that you had committed the offences of using a company Bojin Building Construction to cheat various victims into believing that the Thai workers supplied by Bojin were issued with genuine work permits and thereby inducing the victims to pay over to Bojin the MOL levy payments for the said workers, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 213 of the Penal Code.
 . Third charge (DAC13955/97)
 
You, Tay Boon Sien, M/40 yrs NRIC No: S 1239568Z are charged that you, sometime in the month of July 1994 in Singapore, did accept gratification of a sum of $4,000 for yourself from one Lim Boon Hui, in consideration of you screening the said Lim Boon Hui from legal punishment for offences of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, to wit, that you should be the scapegoat and admit to the investigation authorities that you had committed the offences of using a company Bojin Building Construction to cheat various victims into believing that the Thai workers supplied by Bojin were issued with genuine work permits and thereby inducing the victims to pay over to Bojin the MOL levy payments for the said workers, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 213 of the Penal Code.
 3.The appellant was sentenced to ten months` imprisonment and fined $10,000 in default five months` imprisonment on each of the three charges. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration. The imprisonment sentences for the first and third charges were to run consecutively. In all the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of 20 months` imprisonment and fined $30,000, in default 15 months` imprisonment. He appealed against the sentences on the ground that the total sentence was manifestly excessive, and that the learned district judge erred in law in his application of s 71(1) Penal Code (Cap 224). At the court below, the prosecution did not press for a deterrent sentence.
 4.
 The facts
This case involved the supply of illegal foreign workers with forged work permits in Singapore. The prosecution`s case was that the masterminds of the illegal operation were Tan Chye Keng (Tan) and Lim Boon Hui (Lim Boon Hui) who had both used Bojin Building Construction (Bojin), a sole proprietorship business, to carry out their fraudulent transactions. Bojin was first registered under Tan`s name in the Registry of Companies and Businesses. Tan ran the business of Bojin and Lim was his employee. When the business was transferred to Lim on 12 April 1993, Tan continued to assist Lim in running the business.
 5.Between January 1993 and August 1994, nine victims were deceived by Lim and Tan into believing that Bojin was in the business of supplying Thai workers and that all the Thai workers supplied were in possession of valid work permits issued by the work permits department, Ministry of Labour (MOL). However the reality was that the Thai workers supplied by Bojin were illegal immigrant workers in possession of only forged work permits. The nine victims had been tricked into paying a total of $156,055.01 to Bojin in respect of MOL levy payments for the Thai workers supplied by Bojin.
 6.In February 1994, Lim approached the appellant and requested that he take over the sole proprietorship of Bojin in name only. The appellant was asked to take over the responsibility for the offences and to admit that he had committed the offences of cheating the various victims should the investigation authorities find out about the wrongdoing. He was promised $4,000 per month in return. The appellant agreed to assume responsibility for the offences on the terms proposed by Lim. Pursuant to this agreement, on 2 March 1994, the sole proprietorship of Bojin was transferred to the appellant and the change was effected at the Registry of Companies and Businesses. The appellant remained the registered proprietor till the date of his arrest. He accepted from Lim a sum of $4,000 per month in the months of May, June and July.
 7.The appellant and Lim were arrested on 24 August 1994. Lim pleaded guilty on 15 September 1995 to three charges of abetment of cheating under s 420 read with s 109 Penal Code, one charge under s 474 read with s 466 Penal Code for the possession of eight forged work permits with intent to use them as genuine, and one charge under s 35(1) Miscellaneous Offences Act (Cap 184) for the fraudulent possession of 63 Thai passports. In respect of the charges of abetment of cheating, he pleaded guilty to using Bojin to cheat the various victims into believing that the Thai workers supplied by Bojin were issued with genuine work permits and thereby inducing the victims to pay over to Bojin the MOL levy payments. He was sentenced to two years` imprisonment on each of the abetment of cheating charges and the total sentence imposed on him was six years` imprisonment. Tan committed suicide whilst he was in remand.
 8.
 The appeal
I first set out the legislative framework for the offence under s 213 Penal Code. Section 213 provides that: 
Whoever accepts, or agrees to accept, or attempts to obtain 
 any gratification
 for himself or any other person, or any restitution of property to himself or any other person, in consideration for his concealing an offence, or of 
 his screening any person from legal punishment
 for any offence, or of his not proceeding against any person for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment, shall, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment not extending to 10 years, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence, or with fine, or with both.
 9.Under s 213, the maximum sentence imposed for accepting a gratification in consideration of his screening any person from legal punishment for any offence, shall, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment not extending to ten years, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence, or with fine, or with both. The offence which the appellant purported to screen Lim from was cheating under s 420. Under s 420, the maximum punishment of imprisonment was a period of seven years. Hence the maximum punishment for the appellant in respect of the charge under s 213 Penal Code would be a quarter of seven years, which was 21 months.
 10.In respect of the fine, counsel for the defence argued in the court below that the one-quarter rule applied to the fine as well. However, he cited no authority for such a proposition and this argument was totally without merit. On a plain reading of s 213, the one-quarter rule only applies to the term of imprisonment. The reference to one-fourth in s 213 is only in relation to the `longest term of imprisonment`. This is supported by the comma which is placed directly after the word `offence`. In addition, counsel`s argument would lead to an absurdity. Many of the offences under the Penal Code do not stipulate the maximum fine in respect of the offences, including offences under Ch XVII against property. The maximum length of imprisonment is stipulated in all cases. Parliament could not have intended the one-fourth rule to apply as well to the maximum fine where there was no maximum fine provided in respect of most of the offences.
 11.I now address the issue of whether the sentence meted on each charge was manifestly excessive. The offence of screening an offender from legal punishment for any offence is a grave one. It is akin to an act that tends to pervert the course of justice. In this case, the appellant was to admit to the investigation authorities and to undertake responsibility for an offence which he did not commit so as to be made a scapegoat, in order the principal offender might escape conviction and punishment. This undermined the basis of administration of criminal justice. The severity of the offence which an offender is screened from is relevant under s 213. This can be discerned from the provision itself which determines the kind of criminal sanction which the offender receives by prorating the maximum original sentence that can be imposed on the principal offender. For instance, if it is a capital offence, the offender found guilty of screening under s 213 is punishable with imprisonment for a maximum of seven years, and if it is one of imprisonment for life or with imprisonment, which may extend to ten years, the offender is punished with imprisonment for up to three years.
 12.The offence which the appellant agreed to screen Lim was deceiving the employers that the workers supplied by Bojin were workers with genuine work permits. Lim had cheated $156,055.01 from nine victims. Trafficking in illegal immigrants and representing to employers that they are in possession of genuine work permits can create serious social problems. There is a need to closely supervise and regulate the influx of immigrant labour into Singapore, as emphasised in a number of cases including 
Lim Gim Chong v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 825
  and 
Kuek Ah Lek v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 252
 . It is to that end that severe minimum punishments are prescribed under the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed) for illegal immigrants, overstayers, and employers of illegal immigrants or foreign workers. More pertinently, the Immigration Act was amended to provide clearly that the onus is on the employers to inquire whether the foreign workers they employ are not overstayers or illegal immigrants. The learned district judge rightly took into account public concern about this type of offences involving illegal immigrants.
 13.Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence committed by Lim, the appellant chose not to report him to the authorities but agreed to receive a sum of money in return for screening him from the investigation authorities and being made a scapegoat. Counsel for the appellant argued that the agreement by the appellant was doomed to fail from the outset as it was a matter that was bound to be detected but I was unable to see how that was relevant. The fact that the offender was incompetent was irrelevant. It was the agreement to receive money in return from screening the principal offender in the hope of producing a false result that was the mischief. The length of imprisonment must be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence which requires the need for deterrent sentence.
 14.Two other similar charges were taken into consideration. In sentencing the offender, the learned district judge had rightly taken into account the fact that the appellant was not the mastermind nor was he the instigator behind the illegal scam to deceive the victims. Lim took the lead and played a more significant part in the course of events. The appellant did not take part in the actual arrangement for the supply of the illegal foreign workers and his only involvement was to sign blank cheques at Lim`s request.
 15.Counsel for the appellant raised before me the argument that an appropriate guideline for sentencing the appellant to a term of imprisonment was a quarter of the term of imprisonment actually imposed on the principal offender, ie Lim, where the principal offender was actually convicted and sentenced. There was no merit in this argument. In considering the appropriate sentence of the principal offender, the court would inevitably have taken into account not only the gravity of the offence and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, but also his personal characteristics, which would be irrelevant to the appellant.
 16.The only mitigating factors in the appellant`s favour were that it was his first offence and he had pleaded guilty. Hardship by way of financial loss occasioned by imprisonment was not relevant since it arose from his own acts. While the plea of guilt was a relevant consideration, the protection of the public was an exception to the general rule that a plea of guilt would entitle the convicted person to a discount, as held in 
 Fu Foo Tong v P 
P 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
. The only previous reported decision where the offender was convicted and sentenced under s 213 Penal Code was 
Wee Lee Harry v PP
 [1980-1981] SLR 301 , which was wholly different from this case. That dealt with the punishment in respect of an advocate and solicitor who obtained restitution in consideration for the concealment of the offence of criminal breach of trust by his legal assistant. In that case, Choor Singh J had sentenced the appellant to a fine of $1,500 on each of the eight charges under s 213.
 17.In these circumstances and bearing in mind that the appellant had admitted to receiving a total sum of $20,000 from Lim, a sentence of ten months` imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 on each of the three charges was not manifestly excessive.
 18.The next issue was whether the learned district judge erred in properly sentencing the appellant for three offences. He held that: 
19 I was of the view that s 71(1) of the Penal Code was applicable in the present case. I was of the view that the charges against the accused related to one offence only and that the five charges were only instances of payments comprising this present offence. That being the case I considered all five charges to be one offence and, therefore, in assessing the maximum sentence, I was of the view that it should be 1/4 of a total of 21 months for the three charges proceeded with. 
20 In considering all the facts and circumstances of the case I was of the view that a sentence of ten months` imprisonment and $10,000 fine would be adequate for each of these charges. By making two imprisonment sentences to run consecutively I was satisfied it would not offend the totality principle.
 19.I set out the above passage at length because I think the district judge was misconceived in his application of s 71. He held that s 71(1) Penal Code applied because the charges against the accused related to one offence only and that the five charges were only instances of payments under this single offence, relying on 
 Zeng Guoyuan v PP (No 2 
) 
[1997] 3 SLR 883
, which extensively examined the relation between s 71(1) and s 170 Penal Code. He considered all five charges to be one offence and that, in assessing the maximum sentence, it should be `1/4 of a total of 21 months for the three charges proceeded with`. I presumed he meant that the maximum sentence would be a 1/4 of the seven years` imprisonment (the maximum under s 420 Penal Code), ie 21 months. However, in para 20, he said that he was of the view that a sentence of 10 months` imprisonment and a $10,000 fine would be adequate for each of these charges and he ordered two imprisonment sentences to run consecutively.
 20.It can be seen that the reasoning is incorrect. The effect of a successful application of s 71(1) Penal Code is that the offender is not to be punished with the punishment of more than one of such offences. He is only to be punished for one offence. This is amply supported by not only the wording of s 71(1) but also by case law. In 
 Behari 
 AIR 1953 All 510, Desai J fully discussed the scope and application of s 71(1). After referring to s 71 illustration (a), he held that: 
But when it comes to punishing him, the first part of S 71 IPC [in pari materia with s 71(1) Singapore Penal Code] provides that he cannot be punished with the punishment of more than one of the offences. So for practical purposes, the whole beating is treated as one offence under s 323 IPC If he cannot be punished more than once for the several offences committed by him, it would be no use convicting him of the several offences; that is why in practice only one charge is framed and only one conviction is recorded
 
An important point to be noticed is that the first part deals with a case in which the whole of the act is punished under the same section under which its parts are punished; it does not deal with a case in which the whole act constitutes an offence different in nature from the offence or offences constituted by its parts. This is made clear not only by the illustration but also by the provision about the punishment. The provision is that the accused must not be punished with the punishment of more than one of the offences. The restriction is on the number of the sentences to be passed and not on the quantum. The very fact that he is required to be punished only once shows that otherwise he would be liable to be punished several times, ie, several times for the same offence. Were the part dealing with a case in which the accused is liable for the various offences under different sections to punishments different from one another, the restriction would not have been that he should be punished only once or for only one offence; it would have been similar to that imposed under the second and third parts [s 71(2)].
 21.Hence, if s 71(1) applies and the court convicts him of all the charges, an accused can only be sentenced on one charge since he cannot be punished with the punishment for more than one of the offences. Counsel for the appellant argued that there was the possibility of imposing multiple sentences, as long as the total sentences did not exceed the maximum punishment that the court would have the jurisdiction to pass for the one offence, citing a number of Indian cases including 
Malu Arjun
 
[1899] 1 Bom LR 142
 and 
Fakira Khan
 
[1905] 4 CLJ 90
. With respect, counsel had completely overlooked that the cases cited were dealing with s 71(2) Penal Code and the relationship between s 71(2) and s 18 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). Those cases were dealing with the scenario in s 71(2) where an offence falls within two or more separate definitions of any law by which offences are defined or punished, or where several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different offence. In 
 Malu Arjun 
, the accused committed house-breaking in order to commit theft, and it was held that he could be convicted of each of these offences. The court referred to s 36 Indian CPC 1898 and held that it was the intention of legislature that only one sentence for either of the offences was to be awarded. However, the court held that inflicting separate punishments was not in violation of the law if the aggregate punishment awarded was not in excess of what the court could inflict for either of the offences. A similar view was taken in 
 Fakira Khan 
. Section 35 Indian CPC 1898 has since been amended (an amendment which we have not followed) and Indian decisions have reached different conclusions in the light of the amendment. It was unnecessary for me to decide the proper interpretation of s 71(2) which did not arise on the facts. However, the point to note was that all those cases cited were clearly dealing with s 71(2), where the act, in itself an offence, might constitute different offences because it became either an aggravated form of that offence or a different offence when combined with other acts. They had nothing to do with s 71(1). Section 71(1) is very clear; once that provision applies, the offender is not to be sentenced for the separate offences but only for one offence.
 22.Here the district judge found that s 71 applied and yet went on to impose separate sentences in respect of all three charges that formed the subject-matter of the conviction, and even considered whether the sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently. In doing so, he was plainly in error. Once s 71(1) applies, the court should consider the maximum sentence in respect of one offence and sentence the accused accordingly. No question of whether the sentence should run consecutively or concurrently should even arise.
 23.In any event, I held that s 71(1) did not apply. As held in 
 Zeng Guoyuan (No 2) 
, s 71(1) only applies when all the acts complained of are component parts of but one offence or are so closely connected to form in reality one offence. This was not the case here. Each acceptance of the gratification which took place over a period of three months (on a monthly basis) constituted a separate offence of screening the offender from lawful punishment. All these offences were cumulative. In addition, unlike the factual matrix in 
 Wee Lee Harry v PP 
 where the High Court in Zeng Guoyuan (No 2) held that s 71(1) could possibly apply because the eight acceptances of restitution were not in respect of eight distinct breaches of trust by the dishonest legal assistant but one offence which was to accept restitution to conceal the legal assistant`s total amount of defalcation. In this case, the first occasion where the appellant started to receive the gratification was in May 1994 (the first charge), and Lim was still engaging in his deception on various victims. The acceptance of the $4,000 per month was not only to screen Lim from the offences committed prior to May 1994 but also in respect of the wrongdoing in an on-going scam which only ended on the arrest of Lim and the appellant.
 24.In 
Tham Wing Fai Peter v PP
 [1988] MLJ 424 
[1988] SLR 424
 , the appellant was charged with 36 counts of forging documents purporting to be valuable securities and was sentenced to four years` imprisonment on each of the 36 charges. The High Court in Zeng Guoyuan (No 2) approved of the reasoning in 
 Tham Wing Fai Peter 
 which held that s 71(1) was inapplicable as the forging of each share certificate and each transfer form stood separately by itself as a distinct offence; s 71(1) only applied to composite offences, ie offences which in themselves encompassed specific offences which were ingredients of the composite offences.
 25.Hence, as s 71(1) Penal Code was inapplicable, the only question was whether the imprisonment sentence imposed on each charge should run concurrently or consecutively. Under s 18 CPC, where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted must order that the sentences for at least two of the sentences shall run consecutively. Hence the learned district judge had no discretion but to order at least two of the sentences to run consecutively.
 26.
 Conclusion
In conclusion, I was of the view that the overall sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive and accordingly the appeal was dismissed.",1998-04-17 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This appeal arose out of the conviction of the appellant by the learned district judge of three charges under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (the Act) for the receipt of red packets (ang pows) on three occasions corruptly as gratification or reward. For DAC 9964/97, the appellant was fined $12,000 and in default, three months` imprisonment. For DAC 9965/97, he was fined $6,000 and in default, one month`s imprisonment. For DAC 9966/97, he was fined $6,000 and in default, one month`s imprisonment. The district judge imposed a further penalty of $7,000 and in default, two months` imprisonment, pursuant to s 13 of the Act. Being dissatisfied with the decision, the appellant appealed before this court for a reversal of his conviction.
 2.The appeal came up for hearing before me on 3 March 1998. At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the appeal and will now set out the grounds of my decision.
 3.

 4.
 The facts
The appellant was the purchasing manager of Conner Peripherals Pte Ltd (Conner) from 1987 to 1988. He was subsequently promoted to the position of senior purchasing manager in 1989. In 1991, he was promoted to be the materials manager. In 1992, he received another promotion to the post of director of materials. He resigned from Conner in March 1993 and took up employment with another company, Maxtor Peripherals, in Hong Kong from May 1993 to November 1993. He returned to Singapore and worked with Maxtor Singapore until September 1994 when he tendered his resignation. He joined IBM Singapore as the director of procurement when they set up a new factory here in September 1994. He resigned from IBM shortly before the trial below.
 5.In July 1996, Ng Sim Kwee (PW3), the sole proprietor of Exim & Manufacturer Enterprise (Exim), which supplied fasteners to Conner, was called up for an interview by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in connection with an investigation into the giving of `ang pows` and other gifts corruptly. In particular, PW3 was questioned with regards to two documents: the first showed a list of names with varying amounts of money corresponding to each name for the Chinese New Year period in 1992 and 1993. The second document was of a similar nature for the Chinese New Year period in 1989. These documents were tendered by the prosecution as exhs P4 and P5 respectively. The two documents were allegedly evidence of gifts or `ang pows` which PW3 had given to the people on the list during the festive season in each of the three years. PW3 told the investigating officer at the CPIB that he gave `ang pows` to the appellant on three occasions, in 1989, 1992 and 1993. The appellant was subsequently charged under s 6(a) of the Act for accepting the `ang pows` corruptly on the three occasions.
 6.The exact dates and circumstances surrounding each occasion of the alleged act of corruption by the appellant was subject to much dispute. The origin and contents of exhs P4 and P5 were also not clarified. As such, the facts and discrepancies arising out of these events accorded further attention.
 7.The events in 1989, 1992 and 1993 were looked at in turn. With regard to the occasion in 1989, PW3 testified that he informed the investigating officer at the CPIB that he gave an `ang pow` of $5,000 to the appellant in February 1989. He denied telling the officer that the appellant was the materials director then (it was not disputed at the trial that the appellant was the senior purchasing manager at that time). Besides remembering giving the appellant $5,000 over a lunch or dinner sometime before Chinese New Year (the Chinese New Year holidays fell on 6 and 7 February 1989), he did not remember the details, such as the denomination of the notes, the size of the red packet or the exact date he gave the `ang pow`. He told the CPIB that he was certain that he gave the appellant the money as it was reflected in exh P5, which contained a record of his payment. The appellant denied receiving the money. At the trial, he testified that he met PW3 on a day during the Chinese New Year period 
 after 
 the public holidays for lunch in a Chinese restaurant in the Geylang area. After lunch, in the car, PW3 offered a red packet to the appellant but he rejected it. He did not accept the `ang pow` as he felt it was not ethical since it would be a bribe. Besides, he did not want to put himself in a position which might compromise Conner`s relationship with a supplier vis-a-vis another supplier. This was contradictory to his statement to the CPIB where he stated: 
It is true that SK had on about 2 to 3 occasions, tried to give red packets to me during the festive seasons. As far as I could recall, the first occasion was around 1989 
 before
 the Chinese New Year period wheh (sic) he visited me at my office and invited me for lunch.
 With respect to the second occasion in 1992, PW3 testified that he gave the appellant an `ang pow` of $1,000 before Chinese New Year (the Chinese New Year holidays fell on 4 and 5 February 1992). Again, he could not recall exactly when and where this took place. The appellant denied taking the `ang pow`. Under cross-examination, he added that the occasion took place on a day after the Chinese New Year public holidays but during the festive season in a similar fashion as that in 1989. With regard to the third occasion in 1993, PW3 said that he met the appellant three to four weeks before Chinese New Year (the Chinese New Year holidays fell on 23 and 24 January 1993) and gave him a $1,000 `ang pow` under similar circumstances. However, he could not remember the exact date. Under cross-examination, upon the defence counsel tendering evidence to show that the appellant was in China from September 1992 to 21 January 1993 when he returned to Singapore for a holiday and left for China on 26 January 1993, PW3 varied his testimony: 
Q: If Peter was in Singapore in January only from 21 to 26 January, you would have seen him? 
A: Yes. 
Q: But this is contrary to your evidence earlier that you saw him three to four weeks before the Chinese New Year? 
A: As I have said many times, red packets were given to him before the Chinese New Year. 
Q: You said you gave him the red packets three to four weeks before Chinese New Year. But my instructions are that he was not in Singapore during that time? 
A: It was a `guesstimate` time frame ie a rough estimate of three to four weeks. I`ve definitely given him the red packet before the first day of the Chinese New Year.
 PW3 admitted that he did not know that the appellant was in China and returned only on 22 January 1993. Under cross-examination, the appellant denied ever meeting up with PW3 during the short period when he was in Singapore. However, this testimony was somewhat contrary to his statement to the CPIB where he recalled that there were three such occasions in 1989, 1991 and 1992. Besides the incident in 1989 cited above, the appellant pointed to two other occasions in his statement: 
As far as I could recall, there was one other occasion in 1992 where S K also wanted to give me a red packet during the Chinese New Year period.
 
 
To the best of my recollections, there was one other occasions (sic) where he also wanted to give me red packet which I think was in 1991.
 8.PW3 said that his intentions for giving `ang pows` were three-fold: first, it was in appreciation for past support; secondly, it was to maintain good working relationships; thirdly, it served as a gift for the festive season. If a person did not accept the `ang pow` the first time round, he would not offer it again. He also testified that the did not give `ang pows` in 1990 and 1991 as he was too busy. He maintained that his meeting with the appellant all took place before the Chinese New Year holidays began.
 9.The circumstances surrounding the origin and production of exhs P4 and P5 were looked at as they were the key pieces of documentary evidence tendered by the prosecution. Exhibits P4 and P5 were photocopies of the original documents and were admitted by the trial judge as evidence pursuant to s 67 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed). The two documents were typed out by Wong Choon Chan (PW2), a former systems executive at Exim until late 1993, on PW3`s instructions. Incidentally, PW2 was PW3`s nephew. PW3 testified that, after the questioning by the CPIB in July 1996, he went back to the office to search for the original documents but to no avail. He said that the originals must have been either mislaid or taken away by PW2. PW2 denied taking any documents. It was admitted by the prosecution that exhs P4 and P5 were only indicative of PW3`s intention to give the `ang pows` but not that he did in fact give them as they were prepared before PW3 approached the various people named on the list.
 10.
 The district judge`s decision
The district judge found the appellant guilty on all three charges. He felt it unnecessary to treat PW3`s evidence with special caution as there was nothing which PW3 gained from hiding the truth. PW3 testified that he was not threatened with prosecution by the CPIB if his evidence in court differed from that in his statement. PW3 admitted that he was the one who offered the `ang pows` and did not in any way try to lessen his own guilt. The judge found him to be an honest and reliable witness. He remarked in his grounds of decision: 
12 Given the lapse of time from the time the events occurred, I accepted that it was not unusual that PW3 only remembered certain things about the events surrounding the giving of the red packets to the accused. When PW3 said he could not remember certain things, he was not concealing evidence but was in fact being truthful. It was highlighted that PW3 in his evidence did not know that the accused was senior purchasing manager in 1989 and materials director in 1992 and 1993. He preferred to tell the truth that he was not sure and that he could not remember. He did not, as he could have done, find out what the accused`s appointment was and tailor his evidence accordingly. 
13 I accepted that PW3`s inability to remember the exact reason for giving the accused $5,000 in 1989 and $1,000 in 1992 and 1993 was a result of the events occurring so long ago. PW3 testified that he would discuss with his staff before deciding who and how much to give. It cannot reasonably be expected that he should remember the conclusions arrived at these discussions.
 11.With regard to exhs P4 and P5, the judge admitted them under s 67(1)(c) of the Evidence Act even though they were only photocopies. Three reasons were given: first, PW3 gave evidence that exhs P4 and P5 were copies of the original; secondly, there was a reasonable and sufficient search for the originals; thirdly, there was no reason for PW3 to conceal the originals from the CPIB. He testified that, when confronted by the CPIB with the two documents, he admitted that they were his. Having admitted this, there was no reason to conceal the originals.
 12.The district judge found that the appellant`s credit had been impeached under s 157 of the Evidence Act as what he said under cross-examination was inconsistent with his statement to the CPIB. He had not given any credible explanation for the inconsistencies. As such, the court relied on the statement as reflecting the truth of the facts.
 13.The appellant`s denials of the receipt of the `ang pows` were disbelieved. With regard to the third occasion in 1993, the judge was of the view that it was possible that PW3 met him over the few days when he was in Singapore. The appellant had not offered any evidence to show that while he was in Singapore, he could not be reached. PW3 said that he contacted the appellant either by telephone or by paging him.
 14.In light of all the evidence, the district judge held that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 15.
 The appeal
In coming to my decision, I considered four issues which were pivotal to the outcome of the appeal: (i). impeachment of the appellant`s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act;
 (ii). admissibility of exhs P4 and P5 as evidence under s 67(1)(c) of the Evidence Act;
 (iii). whether PW3 should be treated with caution as a witness because he was the payor of gratification;
 (iv). the appellant`s conviction under s 6(a) of the Act.
 I dealt with them in turn.
 16.
 Impeachment of the appellant`s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act
At the trial below, the district judge held that the appellant`s credit had been impeached under s 157 of the Evidence Act. The appellant`s previous statement to the CPIB on 11 July 1996 pursuant to s 27 of the Act was used to impeach his credit. The appellant`s counsel, in his lengthy submission as to why his credit was wrongly impeached, raised a few crucial issues on the impeachment proceedings. As such, I felt it necessary to clarify and to lay down the principles on the law on the impeachment of a witness`s credit and the procedure involved.
 17.Our Evidence Act expressly provides for the impeachment of the credit of a witness by the party who calls him if the consent of the court is given or by the opposing party in s 157, which reads: 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him: 
(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they from their knowledge of the witness believe him to be unworthy of credit; 
(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence; 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; 
(d) when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may be shown that the prosecutrix was of generally immoral character.
 Section 157 applies to all witnesses, including the accused (see 
PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
  at first instance where the accused`s credit was impeached pursuant to s 157 (Cap 97, 1990 Ed)). The words, `credit` and `impeachment`, are familiar terms in the litigation process and are frequently and freely used by both the members of the bar and the bench. However, there is a dearth of judicial and legislative exposition as to the definition of these two terms. What does one exactly mean when one says that the credit of a witness has been impeached? What is the significance of the impeachment of a witness`s credit? A clear understanding of these two critical words is required before one can seek to answer these queries.
 18.The Evidence Act does not contain a definition of `credit`. The term is referred to in s 148 which seeks to distinguish between credit and credibility. Section 148 reads: 
When a witness may be cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend - 
(a) to test his accuracy, veracity or 
 credibility 
; 
 
(c) to shake his 
 credit 
 by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture.
 Section 148 associates credibility with accuracy and veracity, while credit is linked with character. Similarly, in s 155, credit is associated with character: 
When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but if he answers falsely he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.
 Nokes, in the fourth edition of 
 An Introduction to Evidence 
 at pp 407-408, sought to define and distinguish between credit and credibility. The learned author stated that credit involves `antecedents, associates, character, impartiality and consistency` while credibility concerns the `opportunities for a power of observation of the witness, his accuracy for recollection, and capacity to explain what he remembers`. It can thus be deduced that the credit of a witness refers to his character and moral reliability whereas the credibility of a witness refers to his mental capacity and power to be a witness of veracity.
 19.There is a close relationship between the credit and credibility of a witness. The credit or discredit of a witness relates to his credibility. This brings us to the question of what it means by impeaching a person`s credit. 
 The Oxford English Dictionary 
 (2nd Ed) defines the word, `impeach`, as `to challenge, cast an imputation upon, attack`. To impeach a witness`s credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of the impeachment of a witness`s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on. The relationship between credit and credibility and the purpose for impeaching a witness`s credit was well brought out by Lawton J in 
R v Sweet-Escott
 
[1971] 55 Cr App R 316
. In that case, the accused had given evidence for the Crown in 1970 at the preliminary investigation into a charge of blackmail. In the course of being cross-examined as to his credit, he was interrogated on previous convictions between 1947 and 1950, which he then denied, but subsequently admitted. He had not been convicted since 1950. He was subsequently charged with perjury relating to his evidence at the preliminary investigation. The main issue was whether the previous convictions affected the credit of the accused in 1970. Lawton J posed this question at p 320: 
How far back is it permissible for advocates when cross-examining as to credit to delve into a man`s past and to drag up such dirt as they can find there? That is the problem which arises in this case, because the solicitor for the alleged blackmailer saw fit to dig up matters which had occurred when this defendant was a young man straight out of the Army after war service, who from 1950 onwards has had no convictions of any kind.
 His Honour held that since the purpose of cross-examination as to credit is to show that the witness ought not to be believed on oath, the matters about which he is questioned must:
 Thus, if a witness`s testimony is inconsistent with a previous statement made by him, that statement may be put to him in cross-examination to challenge his credit if the inconsistency will affect his credibility and likely standing with the trier of fact.
 20.The purpose of the impeachment of the credit of a witness is similarly reflected in s 150 of the Evidence Act, which also defines the ambit of the questions allowed during cross-examination in impeaching the witness`s credit. Section 150 reads: 
(1) If any question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the court shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it does not think fit to compel him to answer the question, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it. 
(2) In exercising its discretion, the court shall have regard to the following considerations:
 
(a) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; 
(b) such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time or of such character that the truth of the imputation would not affect or would affect in a slight degree the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; 
(c) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness`s character and the importance of his evidence; 
(d) the court may, if it sees fit, draw from the witness`s refusal to answer, the inference that the answer, if given, would be unfavourable.
 The first part of s 150(1), which sets out the conditions before the court can exercise its discretion, is ambiguously worded. On one interpretation, the words, `except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness `, seem to suggest that the court can exercise its discretion not to compel the witness to answer the question only in relation to matters not relevant to the suit or proceeding. However, the court will have no such discretion if the question affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character. On an alternative interpretation, it means that the court will have the power of discretion if the question affects only the credit of the witness by injuring his character but does not otherwise relate to a matter relevant to the suit or proceeding. In my view, the second interpretation is the correct one. This can only be so when one considers the rationale behind s 150. The purpose of impeaching a witness`s credit is to undermine his credibility with respect to his evidence in court. During the impeachment proceedings, it is inevitable that counsel will ask the witness questions which seek to attack his character and moral integrity. In order to prevent the witness from having to answer embarrassing or scandalous questions, the judge is given the discretion to prohibit any question which in his opinion are unnecessary, improper or oppressive. Cross-examination, a powerful weapon entrusted to counsel, should be conducted with restraint and with a measure of courtesy and consideration to the witness. Section 150(2) sets out the guidelines to aid the court in exercising its discretion. Sections 150(2)(a)-(d) all deal with the credibility and character of the witness - considerations pertinent to the credit of the witness. The position under the English common law is similar to that under our Evidence Act. In 
Hobbs v Tinling
 
[1929] 2 KB 1
, Sankey LJ stated that s 153 of the Indian Evidence Act (I of 1872), which is pari materia to our s 150, correctly summed up the English law on cross-examination as to credit. His Honour proceeded to list out three considerations which the court should take into account when exercising its discretion. The three factors espoused by Sankey LJ are identical to those stated in s 150(2)(a)-(c). This re-inforces my view that s 150 deals solely with questions affecting the credit of the witness. On this reading, the connection between credit and credibility is brought out. The credit of a witness invariably affects his credibility, as reflected in s 150(2)(a)-(c).
 21.In the present case, the prosecution sought to impeach the appellant`s credit by proof of his former inconsistent statement to the CPIB. In this regard, s 157(c) was applicable. Section 157(c) allows for the impeachment of a witness`s credit by 
 proof 
 of a former statement inconsistent with any part of his evidence in court which is liable to be contradicted. The procedure for the proof of the former inconsistent statement to impeach the witness`s credit has not attracted much attention by our courts. While no explicit reference is made in s 157(c), it is clear that the mechanics for the proof of the former inconsistent statement are found in s 147(1) and (2). It reads: 
(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceedings in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. 
(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such statement.
 The latter portion of s 147(1) refers to the necessity of proving the previous statement if it is used for the purpose of contradicting the witness. This clearly relates back to s 157(c). As referred to earlier, the impeachment proceeding is by way of the cross-examination of the witness whose credit is sought to be impeached. Section 147(1) provides for a witness to be cross-examined as to his previous statements in writing for the purpose of impeaching his credit. The nexus between s 147(1) and s 157(c) was emphasised in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  at p 149: 
While no explicit reference is made, para (c) (of s 157) must point to s 147 which deals with cross-examination on previous statements by a witness.
 The operation of s 147(1) and (2) was laid down by Taylor J in the oft-quoted case of 
Muthusamy v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 57
 and has been approved in numerous cases in Singapore (see 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 850
 , 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 ). The procedure follows a three-step approach. First: 
On the request of either side, the court reads the former statement. If there is no serious discrepancy the court so rules and no time is wasted. The first necessity is to read it with the confident expectation that it will be different from the evidence but looking judicially to see whether the difference really is so serious as to suggest that the witness is unreliable.
 
Differences may be divided into four classes: 
(a) minor differences, not amounting to discrepancies; 
(b) apparent discrepancies; 
(c) serious discrepancies; 
(d) material discrepancies 
(per Taylor J at p 58).
 As held in 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 , it is only the last two classes of differences which are sufficient to invoke the operation of s 147. Secondly, after the judge is of the opinion that the difference is so serious or material as probably to amount to a discrepancy affecting the credit of the witness: 
the court may permit the witness to be asked whether he made the alleged statement. If he denies having made it, then the matter must be dropped or the document must be formally proved, by calling the writer or, if he is not available, by proving in some other way that the witness did make the statement (per Lord Taylor at p 59).
 Thirdly, after the statement is admitted or proved: 
If the witness admits making the former statement, or is proved to have made it, then the two conflicting versions must be carefully explained to him, preferably by the court, and he must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference. If he can, then his credit is saved, though there may still be doubt as to the accuracy of his memory. This procedure is cumbersome and therefore should not be used unless the apparent discrepancy is material to the issue (per Lord Taylor at p 59).
 During the impeachment proceedings, the judge should, of course, have in mind s 150 which gives the court the discretion to warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer a question after having regard to the considerations in s 150(2). At the close of the impeachment proceedings, the judge is not obliged to make a ruling on the matter immediately. As a matter of fact, the impeachment proceedings are part of the cross-examination process and do not call for any special ruling at that stage (ie at the close of the impeachment proceedings). This has been pointed out by the Court of Appeal in 
 Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP 
. In Malaysia, the Federal Court in 
Dato Moktar bin Hashim & Anor v PP
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
 held that the witness`s credit stands to be assessed as a whole together with the rest of the evidence at the appropriate stage, that is to say, at the close of the case for the prosecution or for the defence, as the case may be. Therefore, in my judgment, it is apt for the court to make a ruling on the impeachment proceedings at the close of the case together with the rest of the evidence tendered.
 22.The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved. By virtue of s 147(3), in addition to the impeachment of the witness`s credit, the former statement shall be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein. Section 147(3) reads: 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidnce by him would be admissible.
 There has been some confusion in the past as to whether the previous inconsistent statement was admissible as substantive evidence of the contents thereof. In 
 Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP 
, LP Thean J (as he then was) remarked that the previous inconsistent statement used to impeach the witness`s credit was not admissible as evidence of the contents in it. His Honour stated at p 862 of the judgment: 
We do not think that the principle of law is in any doubt: a previous statement made by an accused which has been used to impeach his credit, is only admissible for that limited purpose, ie to impeach his credit, and not as substantive evidence of the contents thereof.
 In the later case of 
Ukthunthod v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 225
 , LP Thean JA clarified his pronouncement in 
 Somwang 
 quoted above. His Honour made two observations. First, the passage was obiter dictum as the court found that the trial judges did not rely on the content of the statement as substantive evidence. Secondly, in that case, s 147(3) was not cited to and considered by the court, nor did the court have the benefit of any argument on the question whether s 147(3) prevails over or is subject to ss 122(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). His Honour further observed that where a statement was not subject to ss 122(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, there was no impediment to applying s 147(3). This area of law was addressed in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  (and followed in 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
 ) where I approved of the use of prior inconsistent statements for the truth of the facts stated therein. Section 147 contains the general scheme governing cross-examination on previous statements. Section 157 cannot be said to only bring in ss 157(1) and (2). The reasoning behind this was succinctly put in 
 Sng Siew Ngoh 
 at p 150: 
The other subsections also govern the cross-examination of previous statements. They cannot be separated from sub-s(1). Through this reference to s 147, the whole of that section is brought in, including s 147(3). It also has to be noted that s 147(3) explicitly states that it applies `in any proceedings`, and does not purport to be restricted to specific circumstances, which would have to be the case had it been intended that s 147(1) were to operate independently of s 147(3).
 The whole of s 147 applies to cross-examination of previous statements in any proceeding, be it for the impeachment of a witness`s credit, refreshment of memory or otherwise. As held in 
 Sng Siew Ngoh 
, it applies to any previous statement, including statements to the police pursuant to s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 23.Before the 1976 amendments to the Evidence Act introduced s 147(3), the view at common law was that former inconsistent statements could only be used to neutralise the witness`s evidence in court by attacking the consistency and credit of the witness. This was emphasised by Taylor J in 
 Muthusamy v PP 
 at p 58: 
But the magistrate went a great deal further. He completely misunderstood the principle of using the former statement to impeach credit and took the view that the former statement could be `put in` (it was never properly proved) and that the court could then choose whether to accept the unsworn police statement, or whether the witness`s sworn statement in court, as his evidence of the incident. This is utterly illegal. In no case can the former statement become his evidence. If the two are so different on an essential point that the court cannot accept his evidence, then he is discredited. If he is the only witness to that fact, the fact is not proved and the accused may be acquitted in consequence. It is for the Public Prosecutor to decide later whether in such a case the witness should be prosecuted for perjury.
 In 
Jones v R
 
[1948] MLJ 182
 , Murray-Aynsley CJ said at p 182: 
These statements can only be used to impeach the credit of the witnesses. That is to say, when these statements have been proved, they do not become independent evidence of facts contained in them.
 The former position prior to 1976 was akin to that in United Kingdom which is governed by ss 4 and 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865. Section 4 applies to both oral and written statements whereas s 5 applies only to written statements. For the sake of completeness, they will be set out: 
4 If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a former statement made by him relative to the subject matter of the indictment or proceeding, and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he has made such a statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement. 
5 A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing relative to the subject-matter of the indictment or proceeding, without such writing being shown to him; but if it is intended to contradict such witness by the writing, his attention must, before such contradictory proof can be given, be called to those parts of the writing which are to be used for the purpose of so contradicting him; provided always, that it shall be competent for the judge, at any time during the trial, to require the production of the writing for his inspection, and he may thereupon make such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he may think fit.
 It can be seen that the wording in ss 4 and 5 is similar to our ss 147(2) and (1) respectively. In criminal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the previous statement is not admitted as the evidence of the truth of its contents but merely goes to the credit and credibility of the witness. It was held in 
R v Birch
 
[1924] 18 Cr App R 26
 that the last words of s 5, which entitle the judge to make such use of the writing `as he may think fit`, do not allow him, in criminal proceedings, to treat the statement as evidence of the facts contained in it, but mean, for example, that the judge may call attention to other parts of the statement to which no reference has been made. With the enactment of s 147(3) in 1976, the common law position has been departed from. It is clear that, once the previous inconsistent statement is proved by virtue of s 147, s 147(3) comes into play automatically. There are therefore two effects upon the proof of a former statement inconsistent with any part of the witness`s evidence which is liable to be contradicted: first, his credit is impeached under s 157(c); secondly, his former statement is admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein under s 147(3). The weight to be given to the statement is stipulated by the factors in s 147(5).
 24.It should be stressed at this juncture that a successful impeachment of a witness`s credit under s 157 goes only to the weight of his oral testimony in court and not to its admissibility. It does not mean that all his oral testimony will be expunged. As Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) opined in 
 PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng 
 (at first instance) at p 148: 
Having regard to these material discrepancies, we found that the prosecution had successfully impeached the credit of the accused. We would, however, say that the fact that the credit of an accused person or a witness has been impeached does not necessarily mean that all his evidence must be disregarded. The court must carefully scrutinize the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.
 This position has been reinforced recently in 
Yeo Choon Huat v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 217
  and 
PP v Mohammed Faizal Shah
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 333
 .
 25.Coming back to the present situation, there were three inconsistencies between the appellant`s statement to the CPIB and his oral testimony in court. There was no dispute that the former statement was given voluntarily. The appellant admitted that he made the statement. The first inconsistency related to when the first occasion of the alleged bribe was. In his statement to the CPIB at para 6, the appellant stated: 
As far as I could recall, the first occasion was 
 around 1989 before the Chinese New Year period
wheh (sic) he visited me at my office and invited me for lunch.
 Under cross-examination, he claimed not to be able to recall when the first occasion took place (that is, which year) although he said it was 
 after 
 Chinese New Year. During the impeachment proceedings, the appellant gave a very riddled answer when asked to explain this inconsistency: 
Q: Your evidence in court is different? 
A: What I meant by this statement in `P6` is during the festival period ie after the public holidays.
 The second discrepancy related to whether the appellant received the red packet in his hands. In para 6 of his statement, he stated: 
I do not know how much money was contained in the red packet 
 but from the feel of it, it was quite `thick`. I then returned the red packet to him and he accepted it back
.
 At the trial, he testified under cross-examination: 
Q: When the red packets were offered to you on the first and second occasion did you hold it in your hand at any point of time? 
A: I recall I pushed it back. I did not receive it. 
Q: Did you push back PW3`s hand or red packet? 
A: Can`t really recall. May have touched it when I pushed it. 
Q: Are you able to tell us how thick the red packet was the first occasion? 
A: No.
 His explanation during the impeachment proceedings was this: 
Q: With reference to para 6 `P6` you have said, `I do not know how much money was contained in the red packet, but from the feel of it, it was quite thick. I then returned the red packet to him and he accepted it back`. 
A: It was based on my memory that I said that in the statement. 
Q: Which is the correct version? 
A: When I pushed it I may have touched the red packet.
 This explanation was unconvincing. His CPIB statement clearly showed that he held the red packet. Otherwise, how could he have returned it without ever taking it? The third discrepancy related to the number of occasions PW3 offered `ang pows` to the appellant. His statement to the CPIB indicated that there were three occasions, in 1989, 1991 and 1992. However, on cross-examination, he said that there were only two occasions: 
Q: Why are you so sure there was no third occasion when he offered you a red packet? 
A: Because after I rejected the second time there was no other occasion.
 During the impeachment proceedings, the appellant gave a lame explanation: 
Q: Paragraph 9 says there was one other occasion on which you were offered red packets. The cumulative effect of paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 is that you were offered red packets on three occasions. This is different from what you said in court. Any explanation for this? 
A: I don`t really recall. 
Q: Put there were in fact three occasions on which you were offered red packets by PW3? 
A: Disagree.
 26.Counsel for the appellant submitted that the discrepancies were not material and were merely inconsistencies due to the lapse of time from the incidents in 1989 and 1992 and the recording of the statement at the CPIB in 1996. It was argued that the lapse of time may have blurred the appellant`s memory on one or two matters. I could not disagree more. The discrepancies were sufficiently material to call into question the appellant`s credit. The inconsistencies went to the crux of the charges against the appellant. They went to the questions of whether the appellant did accept the `ang pows` and on which occasions they took place. The appellant`s explanations for the three discrepancies were not credible. I found that the appellant`s credit was rightly impeached and the former statement to the CPIB made on 11 July 1996 correctly admitted into evidence. His credit had been severely undermined and his oral testimony in court, although not completely disregarded, should be viewed with caution as his credibility was much lessened.
 27.
 Admissibility of exhs P4 and P5 as evidence under s 67(c) of the Evidence Act
The appellant submitted that exhs P4 and P5 should not have been admitted as secondary evidence under s 67(1)(c) of the Evidence Act and should not have been given the same weight as they were only photocopies. Section 67(1)(c) reads: 
Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document admissible in evidence in the following cases: 
(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect produce it in reasonable time;
 A document may be proved by primary or secondary evidence. Primary evidence is defined in s 64 of the Evidence Act: 
Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the court.
 Secondary evidence is defined in s 65 and includes photocopies: 
Secondary evidence means and includes - 
(b) copies made from the original by electronic, electrochemical, chemical, magnetic, mechanical, optical, telematic or other technical processes, which in themselves ensure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;
 The general rule is that documents must be proved by primary evidence except in situations in s 67. Section 67(1)(c) states that a photocopy can be produced either: 
(1) when the original has been destroyed or lost, 
 or 
 
(2) when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect produce it in reasonable time.
 28.In my view, the district judge did not err in admitting exhs P4 and P5 as secondary evidence. The circumstances indicated that the originals had been lost. PW3 tried to search for them but failed to find them. He was not negligent in failing to produce the originals in reasonable time. There was no reason for him to lie about not being able to find them or that they were lost. He had already admitted to the CPIB that the information in exhs P4 and P5 were accurate and that he offered the people listed therein red packets. Refusing to produce the originals would have brought no advantage in light of this admission. The two alternative requirements in s 67(1)(c) are disjunctive in nature. The element of `default` or `neglect` in the second limb is not a requirement under the first limb. The originals were lost, however they may have been lost. PW3 did not need to show that he was at no default or neglect with regard to the loss of the original documents. I thus found that s 67(1)(c) applied in this case under either of the two limbs. There was also no reason why less weight should be given to the photocopies as compared with the originals. Section s 67 makes it clear that the secondary evidence can be evidence of the contents of the document: 
In cases (a), (c) and (d) any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible.
 29.
 Whether PW3 should be treated with caution as a witness because he was the payor of gratification
The appellant put forth that the district judge erred when he accepted PW3 as a witness of truth and believed his account of the events totally. This was especially so since PW3 was an accomplice and may have had an interest of his own to serve. I rejected this contention. The law as to the treatment of evidence of accomplices is well-settled (see 
Abdul Rashid v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 119
 , 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
 , 
Tan Khee Koon v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
  and 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 ). At common law, it is obligatory for the court to warn itself of the danger of relying on the testimony of an accomplice. In Singapore, the position is changed by virtue of s 135 of the Evidence Act which provides that the corroboration warning is no longer mandatory in law. Section 135 states: 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 The reason for the introduction of s 135, as given by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in its 11th Report (Cmnd 4991) is that the common law rule should not automatically apply every time an accomplice is giving evidence. There might be situations in which the accomplice has no ill-feeling against the accused, and he may be repentant and clearly trying to tell the truth about his own part. Furthermore, illustration (b) to s 116 Evidence Act provides: 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 Illustrations
 
The court may presume - 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution;
 The illustration states that an accomplice `may` be presumed to be unworthy of credit. It is couched in discretionary terms. The combined effect of s 135 and illustration (b) to s 116 is that the court may convict an accused based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should still treat such evidence with caution as the accomplice may be presumed to be unworthy of credit There is thus no requirement for any corroboration warning, but the evidence of an accomplice may, and indeed, generally would, be treated with caution.
 30.In his grounds of decision, the district judge referred to s 25 of the Act and held that there was no necessity for the court to treat PW3`s evidence with special caution as he was a mere payor. This was so held in 
 Tan Khee Koon v PP 
 in relation to s 25 where the court held at p 735-736: 
The position under s 25 is clear in discarding corroboration warnings for accomplice evidence. What is less clear is whether there has to be any additional caution in respect of the evidence of a mere payor. One reason for not requiring it has been noted above. Another lies in the character of the mere payor. As noted by Foster Sutton CJ, the payor is only an accomplice simply because he has made a payment to the accused. He takes no further part in the offence committed by the accused. There is no greater motivation for him to lessen his own involvement or magnify that of the accused than there would be for any other prosecution witness
 
it is not necessary then to apply any greater caution to the evidence of s 25 witnesses beyond that practised normally
 
If, on the other hand, mere payors were treated as full accomplices, and required cautious treatment, it would be difficult to establish the guilt of the accused. The evidence of the person who paid the money to the accused is often the best evidence of an offence being committed. To impose any greater burden than normal on the prosecution in regard to such evidence would be to place an unjustified hindrance on the prosecution.
 Section 25 of the Act reads: 
Notwithstanding any rule of law or written law to the contrary, no witness shall, in any such trial or inquiry as is referred to in section 24, be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only of any payment or delivery by him or on his behalf of any gratification to an agent or member of a public body.
 Section 25 was not applicable in the present case as the appellant was not an agent or member of a public body within the meaning of the Act. Although 
 Tan Khee Koon 
 dealt with gratification to a public servant which was within the ambit of s 25, the principles and rationale stated there are equally relevant to gratification paid to any individual where the witness is a mere payor.
 31.I saw no reason in departing from the district judge`s findings in this regard. Applying s 135 and illustration (b) to s 116 and the principles in 
 Tan Khee Koon 
, there was no need to treat PW3 differently from other prosecution witnesses. He was a mere payor of gratification. In 
PP v Vadivelu
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 105
 , the court on appeal held that the trial judge erred in hesitating to accept the evidence of three Indian overstayers (whom the respondent accused was charged with harbouring illegally). The three overstayers were granted amnesty and the charges against them were withdrawn. They had no reason to be evasive in their evidence for fear of inculpating themselves and they had nothing to gain. In 
Loh Khoon Hai v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 321
 , the court held that even though the witness`s testimony was given in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence, it did not automatically impugn the quality of his testimony or constitute an improper motive. The court would still have to look at the demeanour of the witness, the totality of his evidence and ask itself whether he could be believed. Although the two cases just cited did not deal with accomplice evidence, they illustrated the principle that a witness`s evidence need not be treated with unnecessary caution simply because he has some self-interest in the matter. The whole surrounding circumstances of the situation have to be examined. Here, PW3 had no incentive to lie about giving the `ang pows` as it was not going to alleviate his own guilt in any way as he had admitted that he was the one who offered the `ang pows` to the appellant. In addition, PW3 testified that he was not threatened with prosecution by the CPIB if his evidence in court differed from that in his statement.

 The appellant`s conviction under s 6(a) of the Act
Section 6(a) of the Act reads: 
If - 
(a) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business;
 
he shall be guilty of an offence
 
 guilty knowledge 
The principles for s 6(a) are well-established. In 
Tan Tze Chye v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 134
  (and adopted in 
PP v Har Su Meng
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 332
 ), I highlighted the four elements which the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt before an offence under s 6(a) could be made out. They are: (i). acceptance of gratification
 (ii). as an inducement or reward
 (iii). there was a corrupt element in the transaction
 (iv). the recipient accepted the gratification with a 
 In 
 Tan Tze Chye 
, the fourth element was referred to as `corrupt intent` instead of `guilty knowledge`. In 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
 , a case under s 5 of the Act, the court explained the meaning of `corrupt intent` in the fourth element at pp 433-434: 
22 I turned next to the requirement of a `corrupt intent` on the part of the giver. I realised that by saying that a `corrupt intent` was required, some confusion had resulted over the application of the test laid down in 
 PP v Khoo Yong Hak 
 (supra). This is because, in order to decide whether there is a corrupt element in a transaction, it will be necessary to ask whether the intention behind the transaction is corrupt. Thus, the question is whether there is a corrupt intent. In other words, the requirement of a corrupt intent is already subsumed within the requirement of a corrupt element in the transaction. Why then should there still be two separate requirements? 
23 I should clarify that `corrupt intent` actually refers to whether the accused knew or realised what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. This is a subjective test and a more accurate formulation of what this court meant when it stated in Khoo`s case that `the giving must be accompanied by a corrupt intent`. Thus, guilty knowledge is required.
 Thus, the `corrupt intent` in the fourth element as stated in 
 Tan Tze Chye 
 refers to the subjective guilty knowledge of the accused. In order to prevent confusion in future, when establishing the fourth element, counsel should refer to `guilty knowledge` and not `corrupt intent`. It should be pointed out that the word, `corruptly`, carries a uniform meaning in both ss 5 and 6 of the Act and that the third and fourth elements should be given the same interpretation with respect to both sections. In 
 Chan Wing Seng 
, the court laid down the correct approach with regard to the third and fourth elements (ie the definition of `corruptly`): 
Thus, there must first be a corrupt element in the transaction according to the ordinary and objective standard, followed by the accused`s guilty knowledge that what he was doing was, by that standard, corrupt. Both limbs must be fulfilled beyond a reasonable doubt. And, the question of `corrupt` would be determined on the facts of the individual case.
 Recently, in 
PP v Low Tiong Choon
 (Unreported) , the court clarified that the two limbs espoused in 
 Chan Wing Seng 
 must be taken in turn. It is only after the first limb of `an objectively corrupt element` is satisfied that it becomes necessary to consider the second limb of `guilty knowledge`. It is pointless to tackle the second limb if the first limb cannot even be established.
 33.In my judgement, all the four elements in s 6(a) had been satisfied. With respect to the first element, the district judge was entitled to believe PW3`s evidence over the appellant`s evidence. As I have held above, there was no reason why PW3 did not want to tell the truth. In my opinion, exhs P3 and P4 went no further than to show that PW3 
 intended 
 to give the `ang pows` as opposed to him having in fact given the `ang pows`. The matter boiled down to believing one testimony over another. PW3`s evidence, although uncorroborated, was sufficient evidence to prove that the appellant did accept the `ang pows`. I accepted that the appellant`s CPIB statement contained the truth as to the number of occasions he accepted the `ang pows`. The second element was also satisfied. There was no doubt that the `ang pows` were a reward or inducement. The amount involved was large ($5,000 on the first occasion and $1,000 on each of the other two occasions). It was difficult to believe that they were merely festive gifts. PW3`s testimony on his intention for giving `ang pows` supported this conclusion. The last two elements were similarly satisfied. Applying the objective standard in the first limb of the test in 
 Chan Wing Seng 
, a reasonable man would readily conclude that PW3 gave the `ang pows` as a bribe to ensure continued good business relations with the appellant and Conner. There was a corrupt element involved. The district judge found that the appellant possessed the `guilty knowledge` (the subjective element in the second limb of the test). In my view, it was difficult to believe that the appellant had no guilty knowledge in receiving the `ang pows` when such large sums of money were involved.
 34.The prosecution`s case was essentially based on the evidence of PW3 and the appellant`s statement to the CPIB, supported by exhs P4 and P5. For all the reasons above, I found that the prosecution had established its case beyond reasonable doubt. The testimony of PW3, the payor of gratification, uncorroborated as it may be, together with the appellant`s CPIB statement, provided sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence imposed.",1998-04-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This was an appeal against the district judge`s order that the appellant be given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the following capital charge (PIC No 224/97): 
You, Yen Ching Yan, M/29 yrs
 
NRIC No: S 6833282-F
 
are charged that you, between 29 September 1997 at about 4.07pm and 6 October 1997 at about 1am, in room 1729 at New Park Hotel, Serangoon Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, 2 plastic packets and 24 plastic sachets containing approximately 1072.02g of diamorphine at the aforesaid place without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 2.Counsel for the appellant contended that having regard to the charge and the circumstances that have transpired, it would be unjust to allow the charge to hang over the appellant indefinitely. He therefore appealed for an order that the appellant be acquitted of the charge. I dismissed the appeal without hearing the DPP for the reasons which follow.
 3.
 The facts
The appellant was arrested on 6 October 1997. Two days later, the above-mentioned charge was preferred against him in Court 26. On 15 October 1997, the court was informed by Mr Rahman Salleh that he was acting for the appellant. Subsequently, the prosecution applied on a few occasions for time pending the report from the Department of Scientific Services on the analysis of the drugs. On 10 December 1997, the appellant`s present counsel informed the court of the change of counsel. The prosecution stated that a pre-trial conference in the High Court would be held on 6 January 1998 and in view of this, the next mention was fixed on 21 January 1998. On that day, the court was informed that the next pre- trial conference was on 24 February 1998 and that investigations were still incomplete. The next mention was fixed on 11 March 1998 but was subsequently brought forward at the request of the appellant`s counsel to 3 March 1998. It was on that day that the prosecution preferred a fresh charge of consumption of methylamphetamine (commonly known as ICE) against the appellant and applied for him to be given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal with regard to the capital charge. The appellant`s counsel objected and the matter was adjourned for parties to prepare arguments. On 10 March 1998, after hearing arguments from both sides, the district judge granted the prosecution`s application and ordered that the appellant be given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in respect of the capital charge.
 4.
 The decision below
Two questions were in issue: whether the court, as a mentions court, had the power to order an acquittal in respect of the charge and whether this was a proper case to do so. The district judge answered both questions in the negative.
 5.First, he felt that the court had no power to grant an acquittal in respect of the capital charge. For charges in district arrest cases or magistrate arrest cases, the court had the power, under s 184(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), to grant an order of acquittal. For charges in preliminary inquiry cases however, there is no provision in the CPC empowering the court to grant an acquittal. Proceedings for such charges are not summary trials and the provisions in Ch XIX relating to summary trials by magistrates` courts or district courts, including s 180 and s 184(2), are not applicable.
 6.Secondly, the district judge thought that the present case was not a proper case to grant an order of acquittal, even if he had the power to do so. He accepted the prosecution`s explanations as to why the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) needed more time for investigations. Among the possible leads, one is currently in a drug rehabilitation centre while another, an employee of the hotel in which the drugs were found, was a Filipino. The district judge was assured that the CNB would expedite the matter and that the prosecution intended to proceed with the charge once there was enough evidence against the appellant.
 7.
 The appeal
Counsel for the appellant relied on a few cases in support of his proposition that it was the established practice, where the prosecution decides to withdraw charges, to acquit the accused person unless good cause is otherwise shown: 
PP v Mat Zain
 
[1948-49] MLJ Supp 142
; 
Goh Oon Keow v R
 
[1949] MLJ 35
 ; 
Tan Ah Chan v R
 
[1955] MLJ 218
 ; 
PP v Ng Nam Onn
 
[1964] MLJ 455
 . I did not think these cases were of much assistance to the appellant. They concerned the predecessor or equivalent of s 184 of the CPC which applies to summary trials by magistrates` courts or district courts. This necessarily means that s 184 will only come into play where charges fall within the jurisdiction of the court before which the withdrawal is made.
 8.In the present case however, the charge in respect of which the appellant was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was one which, if made out, carried a mandatory death sentence. It is clear, from s 7 of the CPC and s 34 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), that the district court had no jurisdiction to try the case. The issue was therefore this: what order can a court properly make when a case involving an offence falling within the jurisdiction of a higher court to try is brought before it as a court of first mention with a view to its being transferred to the appropriate court but the prosecution withdraws.
 9.The question has already been considered in regard to a magistrate`s court in 
Ee Yee Hua v PP
 [1969-1971] SLR 238 . There, a summons had been issued against the accused under s 325 of the Penal Code, an offence triable by a district judge. When the summons came on for mention before the magistrate, the DPP informed the court that the prosecution had instructions to withdraw the summons and the court discharged the accused, such discharge amounting to an acquittal. After a careful consideration of the authorities, AV Winslow J altered the order of discharge by expunging the words `amounting to an acquittal`. In his view, while a magistrate had the power to discharge without ordering an acquittal as he undoubtedly had in cases before him during a preliminary inquiry, he had no jurisdiction to acquit. The power to acquit an accused person of an offence triable by a district court is not vested in a magistrate.
 10.The cases cited to me by the appellant`s counsel were similarly cited to AV Winslow J who accepted that, in a number of Malaysian cases, the High Court has held that where the charge is withdrawn by the prosecution, the discharge of the accused should amount to an acquittal unless good cause is otherwise shown. He felt however that the courts intended their observations to apply only to cases falling within the jurisdiction of the relevant court before which the withdrawal is made. With this interpretation, I was in concurrence.
 11.As against these cases, AV Winslow J found the case of 
Mary Shim v PP
 
[1962] MLJ 132
 instructive. There, the accused was charged with an offence punishable under s 314 of the Penal Code which was clearly triable by the High Court. The magistrate at the preliminary inquiry discharged her, such discharge not amounting to an acquittal. A second preliminary inquiry was later held and the accused was subsequently convicted of that offence. In relation to the earlier magistrate`s order discharging the accused, the Court of Appeal stated, inter alia, that: 
It is perhaps as well to observe here that the words `not amounting to acquittal` were surplusage as the magistrate had no power to acquit.
 12.By the same token, the same must be said of a district court. By s 7(3) of the CPC, the district court has, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, all the powers which belong to and are exercised by a magistrate`s court. This must include, as a magistrate has in cases before him during a preliminary inquiry, the power to grant an order of discharge not amounting to an acquittal. The district court however has no jurisdiction or power to acquit an accused person of an offence triable by the High Court alone. To do so would amount to a glaring excess of jurisdiction. The district judge was therefore correct when he held that he had no power to grant an acquittal in respect of PIC No 224/97. For this very reason, the High Court cannot, in the exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction, revise the order of discharge so as to substitute an order of acquittal in its place. The hands of an appellate court are tied to the same extent as those of the lower court. In the exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction, the power of the High Court is limited to doing that which the lower court could and should have done and nothing further:

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This petition arose out of an offence committed by Thameem Rajah bin Thusleem (Thameem) under s 130(1)(c) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 1997 Ed) (the Act) for having in his possession uncustomed goods. He was convicted and fined, and the goods were forfeited. The petitioner claimed to be the owner of the forfeited goods and asked the court to exercise its powers of criminal revision to reverse the forfeiture order. At the end of the hearing I dismissed the petition for the following reasons.
 2.
 The facts
Thameem is a Malaysian citizen and an employee of First Galaxy Enterprise (First Galaxy), a Malaysian registered business. The petitioner is a sole proprietorship registered in Hong Kong. Shaik Kamal, holder of a Hong Kong identity card, is the sole proprietor of the petitioner. On 3 December 1997, the petitioner signed an agreement to sell First Galaxy 143 pieces of gold jewellery (valued at $32,560) and 64 packets of about 0.5kg of diamonds (valued at $447,700) (the goods). Thameem collected the goods from the petitioner in Hong Kong sometime between 15 to 18 December.
 3.On 18 December 1997 at about 1.20am Thameem arrived at Terminal 1 Changi Airport, via a flight from Hong Kong. As he went though the `Green` customs channel he was stopped by a customs officer. He was asked if he had anything to declare. He replied in the negative. Thameem was asked to produce his bag for examination, whereupon 143 pieces of gold jewellery were found in the bag. Another 0.5kg of diamonds were discovered in his jacket pocket. Thameem was then arrested.
 4.Thameem was charged as follows: 
You, Thameen Rajah bin Thusleem, male 42 years old, Malaysian, Passport No A 8763574 are charged that you on or about 18 December 1997 at about 1.50am, at West Wing, Arrival Hall, Terminal 1, Changi Airport, Singapore, did have in your possession uncustomed goods, to wit 143 pcs gold jewellery (valued at $32,560) and one lot of diamonds (weighing aprox. 0.5kg, valued at $447,700), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 130(1)C of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 1995 Ed) punishable under s 130 the same Act, read with the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Legislation Relating to Customs and Excise Duties) Order 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax (Application of Customs Act) (Provision of Trials, Proceedings, Offences and Penalties) Order 1994 and ss 26 and 27 of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 1997 Ed).
 5.Thameem was convicted and fined $72,039. The district judge also ordered that the goods seized valued at $479,560 be forfeited. Thameem appealed against the order for forfeiture. The magistrate`s appeal was heard on 5 March 1998 and dismissed. The petitioner claimed ownership of the forfeited goods and asked the court to exercise its powers of revision under s 266 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) to reverse the order to forfeit the goods.
 6.
 Locus standi of petitioner
The prosecution raised a preliminary objection to the petitioner`s case on the ground that the petitioner was no longer the owner of the goods and as a result did not have locus standi to invoke the court`s revisionary jurisdiction. There were two problems with the prosecution`s submission on this point.
 7.The first problem was that it was not clear whether title in the goods had passed to First Galaxy or had remained with the petitioner. While the sales agreement stated that title was to pass on delivery of the goods, it did not make clear when delivery was deemed to have taken place. Paragraph 4 of the sales agreement stated that delivery of the goods was to be made to the purchaser at the purchaser`s address, which was stated in the sale agreement as being in Kuala Lumpur. On this basis, although Thameem as the purchaser`s employee had collected the goods in Hong Kong, the title arguably remained with the petitioner until Thameem had brought it to First Galaxy in Kuala Lumpur. However, while para 4 stated that delivery was to be made to Kuala Lumpur, it also stated that the purchaser was to make the arrangements to take delivery of the goods whenever they were tended for delivery. It was arguable then that the purchaser had made arrangement to take delivery of the goods in Hong Kong when they sent their employee to collect it in Hong Kong. Delivery in this case would therefore have taken place in Hong Kong and title would have passed to the purchaser. It was therefore not clear whether the petitioner was no longer the owner of the goods as the prosecution claimed.
 8.While the uncertainty of ownership weakened the prosecution`s preliminary objection on the basis of lack of locus standi, the fact that the ownership of the goods was unresolved was a reason for the court to exercise caution in reversing the forfeiture order and restoring possession of the goods to the petitioner.
 9.The second problem with the prosecution`s preliminary objection on the basis of locus standi was that previous cases did not indicate that a person who did not have locus standi in the matter could not invoke the court`s revisionary jurisdiction. In 
R v Abu Kassim bin Babu
 
[1940] MLJ 243
 , Aitken J said: 
My attention was drawn to the matter by a petition which appeared to emanate either from the complainant himself or a member of his family. I have since been informed by learned Crown Counsel and Mr Lim Kheng Kooi that both the complainant and the accused disclaimed all knowledge of this petition, but on that point the view I take is this: that it is my duty to examine the record of any proceedings in an inferior criminal court which may have come to my knowledge and, if necessary, exercise my revisionary powers in reference thereto. I do not know who sent me the petition for revision in this particular case, but it seems to me that anyone might properly have drawn my attention to this matter, and it cannot be contended that the proceedings now before me do not require careful consideration and investigation on my part.
 The wording of s 266(1) of the CPC also makes it clear that the power to call for and examine the record of any criminal proceedings before the subordinate courts is a power that is vested in the High Court and is not dependent on the locus standi of applicants.
 10.The prosecution relied on the judgment of AV Winslow J in 
Ee Yee Hua v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 123
  [1969-1971] SLR 238 , where the learned judge quoted with approval from Sulaiman CJ`s judgment in the case of 
Srimati Sailabala Devi v Emperor
 
[1933] 34 Cr LJ 1117
: 
My answer to the first question, therefore, is that an application filed by a third party, who is a total stranger to the proceedings and had no locus standi to invoke the jurisdiction of the court is merely one for bringing the matter to the knowledge of the court; and that in such a proceeding, his counsel should not expect to be heard.
 AV Winslow J went on to hold that the private complainant in respect of an offence under the Penal Code was not a complete stranger. The above passage however does not say that a person without locus standi cannot invoke the court`s revisionary jurisdiction. Read carefully, what the passage is saying is that, while a person without locus standi can bring a matter to the knowledge of the court, such a person should not have an expectation that his counsel will be heard. The court may however still choose to hear his counsel.
 11.Looking at the judgment, it is clear that what was at issue was not whether the High Court could only exercise its revisionary jurisdiction where the applicant had locus standi in the matter. The context of the passage relied on by the prosecution was that Mr David Marshall, who represented the petitioner, drew AV Winslow J`s attention to a preliminary question as to whether a complainant such as the petitioner should be granted audience at the hearing of the petition for revision in the exercise of the court`s discretion since s 312 of the Criminal Procedure Code (now s 269 of the CPC) did not confer any right to be heard either personally or by an advocate on any party when the High Court is asked to exercise its powers of revision. The proviso to the same section empowered the court, if it thought fit, to hear any party in such circumstances. After consideration of the facts and cases brought before him, AV Winslow J concluded: 
In the present case, the complainant was not in the happy position in which his counterpart in India would have been and there was nothing he could do in the matter except to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this court. He could certainly not have expected the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal against the acquittal because it was the Public Prosecutor himself who withdrew the charge against the accused and even went further to ask for the order of discharge against the accused to be one amounting to an acquittal. This was therefore eminently a case for the exercise of my discretion to hear the complainant or his counsel on his behalf.
 From the above, it is clear that what was at issue was not whether the court could invoke its revisionary jurisdiction but whether the court should have exercised its discretion to hear the complainant or his counsel on his behalf.
 12.With regards to the question whether the court should have exercised its discretion to hear the petitioner in the present case, s 269 of the CPC provides that: 
No party has any right to be heard either personally or by advocate before the High Court when exercising its powers of revision:
 
Provided that the Court may, if it thinks fit, when exercising such powers, hear any party either personally or by advocate, and that nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect section 268(2).
 Although the High Court is not bound to hear any party, it has been the practice to hear them and their counsel. In the present case, I thought it fit to hear the petitioner as represented by its advocate, as the petition raised questions of law regarding the nature of criminal revision under s 266 of the CPC, as well as questions regarding the forfeiture of goods belonging to an innocent third party.
 
 Power of High Court to review its own decision 
 13.Another preliminary issue was whether the High Court had the power to review a decision made by the High Court. Section 266(1) of the CPC provides that: 
The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court.
 The revisionary powers of the High Court as prescribed in s 266(1) of the CPC is limited to `the record of any criminal proceedings before any subordinate court`. Although there is no definition of `subordinate court` in the CPC, s 2 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) defines `subordinate court` as meaning: 
a court constituted under the Subordinate Courts Act and any other court, tribunal or judicial or quasi-judicial body from the decisions of which under any written law there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court.
 The general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court as prescribed in s 27(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act is similarly limited to jurisdiction over the subordinate courts. It states: 
In addition to the powers conferred on the High Court by this Act or any other written law, the High Court shall have general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts, and may in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, if it appears desirable in the interests of justice, either of its own motion or at the instance of any party or person interested, at any stage in any matter or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in any subordinate court, call for the record thereof, and may remove the matter or proceeding into the High Court or may give to the subordinate court such directions as to the further conduct of the matter or proceeding as justice may require.
 14.In the present case, the decision of the district court had already been appealed against and upheld by the High Court. What the petitioner was seeking in effect was for the High Court to exercise its power of revision over a decision made by its own court. From the definition of `subordinate courts` in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the wording of s 266(1) of the CPC, it is clear that the High Court does not have the power to exercise its powers of criminal revision over a decision of the subordinate court which had already been upheld on appeal by the High Court. The petition for revision could have been dismissed on this basis alone.
 15.
 Mandatory forfeiture under Customs Act
The petitioner`s main ground for revision was that there was a discretion not to forfeit under s 123 of the Act and that the district judge should have exercised his discretion not to order forfeiture. Section 123 of the Act provides that: 
(1) An order for the forfeiture or for the release of anything liable to forfeiture under the provisions of this Act shall be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard thereto has been held. 
(2) An order for the forfeiture of goods shall be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that an offence under this Act or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder has been committed and that the goods were the subject-matter of, or were used in the commission of, the offence, notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of the offence.
 16.There has been a series of decisions relating to the issue of mandatory forfeiture under s 123 of the Act. In the case of 
R v Ng Hee Weng
 
[1956] MLJ 85
 , which concerned s 123 of the Customs Ordinance 1952 which was in pari materia with s 123 of the Customs Act, Good J held that, if it has been proved to the satisfaction of the court that the goods was used in the commission of the offence, an order for forfeiture was mandatory. This decision was followed by the High Court in the case of 
PP v Serve You Motor Service
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 669
 . There the court said: 
Though a party may be innocent and have taken all the necessary precautions, forfeiture will have to be ordered once it is clear that an offence had been committed. That may not be totally satisfactory, but the words of the provision are clear.
 This position was re-affirmed in the case of 
Public Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 354
 , a case regarding forfeiture under s 49 of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed) where the court said: 
It is true that the petitioner in this case is an innocent party: there was no way in which the petitioner could have foreseen that the vehicle would be used by Chong Wee Kiong for unlawful purposes and no steps it could have taken to prevent the vehicle being seized. Sadly, however, this is the consequence of forfeiture provisions such as s 49 of the Immigration Act and s 123 of the Customs Act. I have previously highlighted the potential unfairness which such provisions create (see for example p 674 of 
 PP v M/s Serve You Motor Service)
; and, whilst I cannot help but feel some sympathy for the petitioner in the present case, I am once more bound to say that this problem is one which can only be addressed by the legislature.
 The weight of case law therefore is that forfeiture is mandatory under s 123 of the Customs Act once it is proved that the goods were used in the commission of the offence.
 17.The petitioner`s argument was that there should be a two stage process in considering forfeiture. The first stage was for the court to exercise discretion in considering forfeiture under s 386 of the CPC. In exercising this power, pursuant to s 5 of the CPC, the courts should consider the manner in which the power of forfeiture is exercised in England. The second stage was where the court would consider the specific provisions regarding forfeiture in the various enactments. At the second stage, where the special provisions made forfeiture mandatory, the court would order forfeiture. At the first stage, if the court was of the view that the owner was not implicated in the commission of the offence, the consideration on forfeiture ended and the second stage would not be entered into.
 18.The basis of the petitioner`s argument was this. In 
Long Foo Jin v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 663
 , the court held that: 
Section 386 is clearly intended to apply only in a residual role, that is when the offence-creating provisions do not deal with the issue of the disposal of property used or concerned in any offence.
 In 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 , the court said that s 386(2) of the CPC operated as an omnibus provision conferring a general power of forfeiture, complementing specific instances where Parliament may have chosen to expressly provide for the power of forfeiture. The relevant portions of that judgement are as follows: 
I would abide by Willan CJ`s view, as expressed in 
 Lim Poon Pok
, that s 386(2) CPC operates as an omnibus provision conferring a general power of forfeiture. I should mention in passing that Murray-Aynsley CJ expressed similar sentiments, albeit without giving detailed reasons, in 
Tan Lian v R
 
[1947] MLJ 196
 . Thus, s 386(2) CPC is complementary to those specific forfeiture provisions contained within other legislation.
 The petitioner argued that 
 Long Foo Jin v PP 
 contradicted 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
 and that 
 Long Foo Jin v PP 
 was wrong because it proceeded on the basis that s 386 of the CPC would be inapplicable when special provisions were in existence. The petitioner argued that this was wrong because the words of s 386 of the CPC did not permit this interpretation, since they merely said that powers in s 386 are to be exercised bearing in mind that special provision where they do exist.
 19.Looking at the relevant portions of the two cases, there was no contradiction between them. Both acknowledged that where there were specific provisions in other legislation, those provisions would operate, and that s 386 operated when there was no specific provisions in the other legislation dealing with the disposal of property. This was also clear from the wording of s 386(2) of the CPC which states that: 
The power conferred upon the court by this section includes power to make an order for the forfeiture or confiscation or for the destruction or for the delivery to any person of any property regarding which any offence is or was alleged to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence but shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture, confiscation, destruction or delivery contained in the Act under which the conviction was had or in any other Act applicable to the case.
 Section 386(2) of the CPC makes it clear that the power conferred on the court by it shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture contained in the Act under which the conviction was had. In the present case, it would be subject to s 123 of the Customs Act, where forfeiture is mandatory if it has been proved to the satisfaction of the court that the goods was used in the commission of the offence. This was so in the present case.
 20.
 No cause to invoke powers of revision
It has been said in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  that before the court`s powers of criminal revision can be exercised: 
there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
 21.The petitioner argued that there was no complicity on the part of the petitioner and that the petitioner was not responsible for the commission of the offence. As a result the punishment of a loss of the value of goods forfeited was unjust.
 22.I was of the view, however, that it could not be said that there was such serious injustice as to warrant the court`s exercise of its powers of revision. First, it was not clear that the petitioner was the owner of the goods. It was not clear therefore that the injustice was suffered by the petitioner. Secondly, even if there was injustice, the position of the law is clear that forfeiture was mandatory under s 123 of the Act. The district judge was bound to order forfeiture and it cannot be said that his decision was incorrect or that there was impropriety in his decision.
 23.For the reasons given above, the petition was dismissed.",1998-07-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 
Cur Adv Vult
(delivering the judgment of the court): On 30 May 1997 the respondent, an advocate and solicitor, who was jointly tried with his client, one Alloisus Bernard Fernandez (Fernandez), was convicted of an offence of attempted cheating and sentenced to one day`s imprisonment and fined $10,000. Fernandez was also convicted and sentenced to one day`s imprisonment; he was fined $3,000. The respondent`s appeal to the High Court against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the learned Chief Justice on 12 August 1997. The learned Chief Justice`s judgment is reported at 
[1997] 3 SLR 782
.
 2.The charge against the respondent and Fernandez was as follows: 
You, Alloisus Bernard Fernandez,
 
Edmund Nathan
 
are charged that you, between 1 June 1991 and 26 June 1991, in Singapore, and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, attempted to cheat the United Overseas Bank Ltd, Singapore, and in such attempt did deceive the said bank into believing that the intended purchase price for the property at 363A Upper Paya Lebar Road was S$190,000 when you knew that the intended purchase price was S$135,000, and by such deception, you dishonestly attempted to induce the said United Overseas Bank to deliver property to some persons, to wit: to approve a loan of S$110,000 and disburse the said sum to Alloisus Bernard Fernandez and Margaret Angela Fernandez, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with ss 34 and 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.Relying on the conviction referred to in [para ] 1 above and pursuant to s 94A(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed) (the Act), the Law Society of Singapore (the Society) duly applied to the High Court that the respondent show cause why he should not be struck off the roll or suspended from practice or censured. The order to show cause was made on 4 May 1998.
 4.Section 94A(1) of the Act reads as follows: 
Where an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, whether the offence was disclosed as a result of an investigation under section 87(3)(b) or otherwise, the Society shall, without further direction or directions, proceed to make an application in accordance with section 98.
 The relevant sub-section of s 98 is sub-s (1) which we set out below: 
An application that a solicitor be struck off the role or suspended from practice or censured or that he be required to answer allegations contained in an affidavit shall be made by originating summons ex parte for an order calling upon the solicitor to show cause.
 It is also necessary to set out s 83(1) and two paragraphs of s 83(2) which are relevant to the arguments addressed to us at `the show cause proceedings`. They are paras (a) and (b) of s 83(2): 
83 (1) All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause shown to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding 5 years or censured. 
(2) Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor -
 
(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession; 
(b) has been guilty of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty or guilty of such a breach of any usage or rule of conduct made by the Council under the provisions of this Act as amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor.
 5.The show cause proceedings came before us on 29 May 1998. The respondent sought to show cause by invoking the common law principle of 
 autrefois 
. This principle in so far as it applies to professional disciplinary proceedings was accepted in the show cause proceedings in 
Re An Advocate and Solicitor
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 331
  and by the Privy Council in the appeal therefrom, 
Lee Wee Harry v Law Society of Singapore
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 1
  [1984-1985] SLR 41 . Briefly stated the principle is that a man cannot be tried for a crime in respect of which he has previously been acquitted (
 autrefois acquit 
) or convicted (
 autrefois convict 
).
 6.
 autrefois convict 
The respondent`s contention was as follows: (i). Following a complaint to the Society by the Registrar of the Supreme Court on 15 September 1994, an inquiry committee investigated into the complaint under s 86 of the Act. The complaint referred to the very same transaction which formed the subject matter of the charge on which the respondent was convicted. The complaint addressed to the Public Prosecutor and the Society read as follows:
 
Suit No: 2684 of 1992
 
Fernandez Alloisus Bernard v Jansen Priscilla Ann & Tansen Edmund Joseph
 
The above action was heard on 14 September 1994.
 
2 The court observed that in the affidavits filed by the parties, it was disclosed that:
 
(a) the parties, who were the vendors and purchaser of a property, executed two agreements for sale and purchase, one at a price of $135,000 and another at a price of $190,000, intending the real price to be $135,000; 
(b) the contract for the higher price was executed to enable the purchaser to get a higher bank loan; 
(c) a bank loan was applied for and approved on the basis that the sale price was $190,000 (the bank having also valued the property at the price of $190,000); and 
(d) Mr Edmund Nathan, the solicitor acting for both parties and the bank, admitted his knowledge in his affidavit filed on 1 February 1994.
 
3 The court requested that this matter be brought to the attention of the Public Prosecutor (in respect of the vendors, the purchaser and their solicitor) and the Law Society (in respect of the solicitor), so that they might deal with it as they saw fit. 
4 In the premises, this matter is referred to you for your consideration.
 (ii). On 21 April 1995 the inquiry committee reported to the Council of the Society (the Council) vide s 86(7) of the Act that although a formal investigation by a disciplinary committee was not required the respondent`s conduct was improper and warranted the imposition of a penalty. A penalty of $3,000 was recommended.
 (iii). On or about 8 May 1995 the Council accepted and adopted the inquiry committee`s report and acting under s 88 of the Act imposed a fine of $3,000 on the respondent which the respondent duly paid.
 (iv). The findings of the inquiry committee which the Council accepted and adopted, `that the respondent`s conduct was improper and warranted the imposition of a penalty` and the imposition of a fine of $3,000 on the respondent was tantamount to a `conviction` by the Council `of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of the respondent`s professional duty` (s 83(2)(b)) for which he was punished by being fined $3,000.
 (v). The same complaint which gave rise to the inquiry committee`s investigation (see (i) above) also resulted in the respondent being charged together with Fernandez for attempted cheating on 21 June 1996.
 (vi). The criminal conviction for attempted cheating on 30 May 1997 was indisputably on the very same facts on which the Council in May 1995 fined the respondent $3,000 for improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty. Hence, to be called on to show cause based on the conviction of a criminal offence implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession (s 83(2)(a)) is to put the respondent in `double jeopardy`. In other words it enables the respondent to raise the plea of .
 7.Mr Shanmugam`s first argument was that s 94A of the Act should be construed as being a directory provision rather than a mandatory provision. He submitted that if s 94A is treated as a mandatory provision then every conviction of an advocate and solicitor for a criminal offence involving fraud or dishonesty must result in that advocate and solicitor being called on to show cause why he should not be struck off the roll, suspended or censured. This would put the advocate and solicitor in `double jeopardy`. He submitted that the legislature could not have intended to over-ride the principle of 
 autrefois 
.
 8.We do not really understand this argument. If by the section being directory it is suggested that the Society is given a discretion as to which conviction of an advocate and solicitor involving fraud or dishonesty it will require cause to be shown and which it may not and thus the principle of 
 autrefois 
 is somehow preserved, such argument, in our view is fallacious. It is fallacious because this will amount to someone other than the tribunal charged with the duty of controlling the conduct of advocates and solicitors, ie to show cause, deciding whether the plea of 
 autrefois 
 is available in any given case. In the context of the Act that tribunal is the court of three judges of the Supreme Court (see s 83(1) and s 89(7). It is clear from a reading of the whole of Pt VII of the Act that the legislature never intended the show cause proceedings to be heard by a tribunal other than the court of three judges and s 94A requires the Society `to proceed to make an application in accordance with section 98` without further direction or directions, ie to apply to the High Court `for an order calling upon the solicitor to show cause`.
 9.In our view s 94A is free from doubt and ambiquity. Its plain meaning is the correct meaning and that is that it directs the Society to apply under s 98 for a show cause order in any case where an advocate and solicitor has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty without further direction or directions. The direction given to the Society by the legislature is mandatory. It is purely procedural. All it does is to dispense with the first two stages of the disciplinary process, namely the inquiry committee stage and the disciplinary committee stage and directs the Society to go straight to the third stage, the show cause stage, where an advocate and solicitor is convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.
 10.Section 94A, also because it is confined to convictions of offences involving fraud or dishonesty necessarily implies that such convictions are convictions implying a defect of character which makes the advocate and solicitor unfit for his profession - s 83(2)(a). It will be remembered that before the introduction of s 94A into the Act (it was introduced by Act 41/93) it was still possible to rely on a criminal conviction to call on an advocate and solicitor to show cause by proving that such a conviction implied a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession - s 83(2)(a) - but all three stages of the disciplinary process would have to be undertaken.
 11.In our view s 94A does not in any way impinge on the availability of the principle of 
 autrefois 
 in disciplinary proceedings under the Act. Its applicability in professional disciplinary proceedings was accepted, as we have already noted in [para ] 4 above in the 
 Lee Wee Harry 
 show cause proceedings (
 Harry Wee 
`s case) and in the appeal therefrom to the Privy Council (the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case). As his second and in fact his main line of argument, Mr Shanmugam relied heavily on the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case delivered by Lord Bridge of Harwich in support of his submission that we should accept the plea of 
 autrefois convict 
 in the present show cause proceedings before us.
 12.In our judgment the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case is distinguishable in many respects from the show cause proceedings before us. But before we proceed to show this it will be useful to examine in some detail the disciplinary process under the Act and as it was at the time of 
 Harry Wee 
`s case, in so far as it is relevant for present purposes.
 13.As we have already observed the disciplinary process under the Act is a three-stage process, namely the inquiry committee stage, the disciplinary committee stage and the show cause stage.
 14(1).
 The inquiry committee stage
(i) On the receipt of a complaint which in the first place is to be made to the Society, the Council will refer the complaint to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel constituted under the Act (s 85(1)).
 (ii).The Chairman of the Inquiry Panel will then constitute an inquiry committee of two advocates and solicitors, one of whom will be designated the chairman of the inquiry committee, a lay person and a legal officer of not less than 10 years` experience to inquire into the complaint - s 85(6).
 (iii).(a) Where the inquiry committee is satisfied that there are no grounds for disciplinary action on the complaint, it will report accordingly to the Council and state its reasons for its decision - s 86(5).
 (iii).(b) But if the inquiry committee is of the opinion that the allegations contained in the complaint should be answered, the inquiry committee will send a copy of the complaint to the solicitor and invite him to give a written explanation and state whether he wishes to be heard by the inquiry committee - s 86(6).
 (iv).After considering the written explanation and hearing the solicitor, if he wished to be heard, the inquiry committee will report to the Council whether a formal investigation by a disciplinary committee is warranted and if a formal investigation is not warranted, recommend to the Council whether a penalty sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct should be imposed or the complaint be dismissed - s 86(7).
 (v).For the purposes of conducting the inquiry, the inquiry committee has the power to appoint any person to make or assist in making preliminary inquiries; require production of books, documents or papers which bear on the complaint; and to require the solicitor to give all information in relation to such books, documents or papers - s 86(12).
 14(2).The inquiry committee stage in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case is contained in Pt VII of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed). It is the
 mutatis mutandi 
s the same as we have set out above; the only significant difference is that the inquiry committee there consisted of five advocates and solicitors appointed by the Chief Justice of whom three constituted a quorum.
 15.It should be noted that the proceedings under the inquiry committee stage whether under the Act or the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) were not adversarial in nature. The complainant did not appear before the inquiry committee and evidence under oath was not taken. The inquiry committee was not conducting a trial in any sense at all. There are no rules of procedure governing the inquiry. The inquiry committee`s duty, if it had determined that the complaint was not frivolous but that the solicitor should be called upon to answer the complaint, was to examine the complaint in the light of the written explanation and the solicitor`s oral explanations, if any, and assisted by the exercise of the powers the inquiry committee was entrusted with as set out in [para ] 13(1)(v) above, if it chose to employ any of them, and come to a determination whether a formal investigation by a disciplinary committee was warranted. If no formal investigation was warranted then to recommend to the inquiry committee a penalty sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed or that the complaint be dismissed.
 16(1).On the receipt of the inquiry committee`s report the Council will deliberate on it and come to its own determination: (a) that a formal investigation is not necessary; (b) that no cause of sufficient gravity exists for a formal investigation and the imposition of a penalty would suffice; (c) that a formal investigation is necessary; or (d) that the matter be adjourned for consideration or referred back to the inquiry committee for reconsideration and a further report - s 87(1). However if the inquiry committee recommends that a formal investigation is warranted the Council must apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a disciplinary committee and even if the inquiry committee recommends that a formal investigation is not warranted, the Council can disagree with the inquiry committee and apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a disciplinary committee - s 87(2).
 16(2).The position under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) was identical.
 17(1).
 The disciplinary committee stage
The procedure before the disciplinary committee under the Act as well as under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) is the same and is embodied in the rules made by the Rules Committee regulating the hearing and investigation of matters before a disciplinary committee. A charge or charges were framed and served on the solicitor together with a statement of case. The Society is represented by counsel and presents the Society`s case to the disciplinary committee. The solicitor could appear in person or through counsel before the disciplinary committee. The burden is on the Society to call the evidence to support the charge or charges from the complainant and such witnesses the Society chooses to call. After the complainant and his witnesses have given evidence the solicitor gives his evidence and calls his witnesses to answer the charge or charges. All evidence is taken on oath and writs of subpoena ad testificandum and of duces tecum can be sued out. See 91(2) of the Act and s 92(2) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed). The proceedings before the disciplinary committee are truly adversarial.
 17(2).After the conclusion of the hearing before the disciplinary committee, it is required to report its findings to the Council. It is best we set out the particular provision. It is s 93(1) of the Act. It is also s 93(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed) both of which are in identical terms and read as follows: 
After hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary Committee 
 shall record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts
 shall determine - 
(a) that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 (it was section 84 under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217); 
(b) that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under that section the advocate and solicitor should be reprimanded; or 
(c) that cause of sufficient gravity exists under that section.
 
[Emphasis added.]
 18.The next step is for the Council to act on the disciplinary committee`s report. If the report recommends that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists then the Society is required without further ado to apply for an order to show cause but if the report recommends that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists the Society is not required to take any further action unless so directed by the court - s 94(1) and (2) of the Act. This was also the position under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed). However the Act contains an additional provision which was not contained in the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed). It is that where the report recommends that the advocate and solicitor be reprimanded the Council may, if it agrees with the report, reprimand the advocate and solicitor or if it disagrees straight away apply for an order to show cause - s 94(3).
 19.
 The show cause stage
The show cause stage has not changed for as long as our collective or individual memories go. The show cause proceedings have always been heard by a court of three judges of the Supreme Court and since the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council no appeal lies from a decision of that court - see s 98(7). The burden is on the advocate and solicitor, the respondent, to show cause why he should not be struck off the roll, suspended or censured. This he must do on the basis of the findings of fact made by the disciplinary committee except when the show cause proceedings have been initiated under s 94A of the Act.
 20.We should mention that the only discernible difference in the disciplinary process applicable to these show cause proceedings and the one which applied in the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee` 
s case is the presence of s 94A in the Act and the absence of a provision similar to s 94A in the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1970 Ed). This does not distinguish the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee` 
s case from the show cause proceedings now before us.
 21.Having given this summary of the disciplinary process we can now turn our attention to 
 Harry Wee 
`s case and the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case.

 Harry Wee 
The full facts together with a complete record of the disciplinary proceedings in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case are set out in the judgment of Wee Chong Jin CJ at 
[1984] 1 MLJ 331
 at pp 332-335; [1984-1985] SLR 323 at pp 324-328. They may be summarised as follows: (i). Harry Wee, an advocate and solicitor, admitted in 1948, was president of the Law Society of Singapore for three successive years from 1975 to December 1977. During this period and for many years previously he practised under the name of Braddell Brothers of which he was the sole proprietor.
 (ii). He employed a legal assistant named S Santhiran. In February 1976 Harry Wee discovered that Santhiran had misappropriated large sums of money from the firm`s clients` account. He confronted Santhiran who admitted to $298,270.75.
 (iii). Notwithstanding Santhiran`s admission Harry Wee did not report Santhiran to the police or to the Law Society for Santhiran`s misdeeds, but continued to employ him as a legal assistant and entrusted him with the firm`s legal work on the understanding that Santhiran would make total restitution of the misappropriated moneys.
 (iv). By June 1976 Santhiran had made almost total restitution but Harry Wee kept Santhiran in his employment until December 1976, when Santhiran left to set up a practice of his own.
 (v). Only on 30 April 1977 did Harry Wee in a letter marked private and confidential and for the attention of the vice-president of the Society disclosed Santhiran`s misappropriations of Braddell Brothers` moneys. Harry Wee still retained the office of president of the Society. He said a formal complaint would soon be made to the Society.
 (vi). On 26 May 1997 Harry Wee reported Santhiran`s misappropriations to the police and on 27 May 1977 he made a formal complaint to the Law Society.
 (vii). The Council took no action on Harry Wee`s complaint against Santhiran while Harry Wee was still the president of the Society, ie until 31 December 1977.
 (viii). In March 1978 the new president of the Society who was also the Chairman of the inquiry committee appointed by the Council (as the procedure then was) informed Harry Wee that the inquiry committee acting on its own motion had decided to enquire into his delay in reporting Santhiran`s admitted defalcations of clients` moneys to the Society and his offer to Santhiran that his defalcations would not be reported to the police provided Santhiran made full restitution (we will refer to this as `the delay charges`).
 (ix). Whilst the inquiry committee was inquiring into the matter Harry Wee`s report to the police (see (vi) above) had resulted in not only Santhiran being prosecuted for criminal breach of trust but also in Harry Wee being prosecuted under s 212 of the Penal Code for obtaining or attempting to obtain restitution from Santhiran in consideration of concealing Santhiran`s criminal breaches of trust.
 (x). On 7 November 1978 Harry Wee was convicted of nine charges under s 212 of the Penal Code. On appeal the conviction in respect of one charge was set aside and the conviction of the remaining eight charges was confirmed. Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused by the Privy Council.
 (xi). On 13 December 1978 a disciplinary committee was appointed to hear the delay charges. On the same day following Harry Wee`s convictions the Council referred the convictions to the inquiry committee. (We will refer to this as `the conviction charges`.)
 (xii). On 19 November 1980, two things happened. The inquiry committee started enquiring into the conviction charges and the disciplinary committee hearing the delay charges reported to the Council that there was cause of sufficient gravity for show cause proceedings to be taken against Harry Wee.
 (xiii). On 6 January 1981 a disciplinary committee to hear the conviction charges was appointed.
 (xiv). On 16 March 1981 the show cause proceedings in respect of the delay charges came before a court of three judges and on 27 August 1981, the court found that cause was not shown. Harry Wee was suspended from practice for two years (see 
[1981] 2 MLJ 215
; [1980-1981] SLR 568). The appeal to the Privy Council was dismissed on 13 July 1982 (see 
[1982] 2 MLJ 293
).
 (xv). On 26 August 1981 the disciplinary committee hearing the conviction charges reported to the Council that there was cause of sufficient gravity for show cause proceedings to be taken against Harry Wee.
 (xvi). On 17 September 1982 the show cause order in respect of the conviction charges were made and in the due course the show cause proceedings came before the court of three judges. The plea of was raised. We have referred to these show cause proceedings as `s case.
 23.It will be seen how very different 
 Harry Wee 
`s case is from the show cause proceedings before us. In 
 Harry Wee 
`s case the show cause proceedings on the delay charges had gone through all three stages of the disciplinary process we have outlined earlier in this judgment. The show cause proceedings before us referred to in [para ] 6(i) above did not get past the first stage, the inquiry committee stage. There can be no doubt that in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case, having gone through all three stages of the disciplinary process and the court of three judges having found that cause was not shown and accordingly having suspended Harry Wee for two years from practice that he was `convicted` of the charges contained in the amended statement of case that he (Harry Wee) `was guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within section 84(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act` (ie s 83(2)(b) of the Act). (See 
[1981] 2 MLJ 215
 at pp 217-219.) On the other hand, as we have already observed, in the proceedings before the inquiry committee in the show cause proceedings before us, the proceedings were not adversarial, no charge or charges were framed, no evidence was taken but an informal inquiry was made on the complaint to determine whether there was cause of sufficient gravity or not. On the face of the complaint and the explanation given by the respondent the inquiry committee expressed the opinion `that no formal investigation by a disciplinary committee is required` and as required by s 87(7) of the Act, recommended a penalty and supported the recommendation as follows: 
However, we are of the view that although his conduct in drafting the sale and purchase agreement which replaced a higher purchase price than actually agreed upon, was not done fraudulently, we are satisfied that the respondent`s conduct was improper, and warranted the imposition of a penalty.
 24.Mr Shanmugam urged upon us that the inquiry committee`s report is tantamount to a `conviction` that the respondent had been found guilty under s 83(2)(b) of the Act of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty. We cannot agree. We can find nothing in the inquiry committee`s report which suggests a finding of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct. Fraudulent conduct can be ruled out as the inquiry committee has expressly stated that the respondent`s conduct was not fraudulent. The inquiry committee described the respondent`s conduct as `improper` not `grossly improper`. But most important of all the proceedings before the inquiry committee was not a trial. The respondent was not called upon to answer a specific charge. He was only called upon to explain his conduct in relation to the complaint made against him.
 25.In our view the mere imposition of a fine does not mean that the respondent has been guilty of any one of the provisions of s 83(2). The question of a penalty arises only because, prima facie, in the inquiry committee`s opinion, the respondent`s conduct though `improper` was not `fraudulent or grossly improper` in a professional respect. If it was then the inquiry committee could not have expressed the opinion `that no formal investigation by a disciplinary committee is required`. The Council accepted this and went along with the inquiry committee although the Council has the power to disagree and request the Chief Justice to appoint a disciplinary committee. See s 87(2)(b).
 26.In our considered judgment the proceedings before the inquiry committee and the imposition of a penalty of $3,000 by the Council under s 88(1) of the Act does not amount to a `conviction` such that the plea of
 autrefois convict 
 can be raised at the show cause proceedings founded on the respondent`s criminal conviction of attempted cheating, although the facts on which the respondent was convicted of the offence of attempted cheating and the complaint inquired into by the inquiry committee are the same.
 27.Even if by some verbal gymnastics it can be said that the inquiry committee did find the respondent `guilty` of grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) the plea of 
 autrefois convict 
 would still not be available, in our judgment, to ward off the conviction for attempted cheating which comes under s 83(2)(a) on the strength of the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case.
 28.It seems to us from a reading of Lord Bridge`s judgment in the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case that the Board was more concerned with the abuse of the disciplinary process rather than the application of the principle of 
 autrefois 
. Lord Bridges` language was critical of the disciplinary process followed in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case. It seems to us that the Board dealt with the principle of 
 autrefois 
 only because the court of three judges in the show cause proceedings on the conviction charges had based its judgment on this principle. Wee Chong Jin CJ delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to the speeches of Lord Morris and Lord Devlin in 
Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions
 
[1964] AC 1254
 said this at p 335: 
In the present case, on the assumption that the doctrine of 
 autrefois
 is available in disciplinary proceedings against an advocate and solicitor the respondent`s plea of 
 autrefois convict
 must fail. In the first disciplinary proceedings (the delay charge) the complaint was that the respondent had delayed for 13 months in reporting to the Law Society the conduct of a legal assistant employed by him who had confessed to him that he had misappropriated client`s moneys in the clients` account of the respondent`s firm in circumstances amounting to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty (see s 84(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act). In the present disciplinary proceedings the complaint is that the respondent has been convicted of criminal offences implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession (see s 84(1) and (2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act).
 
It is clear that one essential ingredient which is necessary to prove in the present disciplinary proceedings is the respondent`s conviction of one or more criminal offences. This ingredient is unnecessary to support a complaint in the first disciplinary proceedings and it follows that the respondent has not been put to peril of disciplinary punishment for the same complaint or `offence` as that which he is charged. The legal characteristics, to use Lord Devlin`s expression, are not the same in the case of the first disciplinary proceedings as in the present one and, to use Lord Morris` expression, the `offence` alleged in the first disciplinary proceedings is not substantially the same as in the present one.
 29.In giving the reasons for allowing the appeal from 
 Harry Wee 
`s case Lord Bridge in the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee 
`s case at pp 5 and 6 said: 
No one would dispute that the doctrine of 
 autrefois convict
 and 
 acquit
 is applicable to disciplinary proceedings under a statutory code by which any profession is governed. The doctrine was exhaustively considered by the House of Lords in 
Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions
 
[1964] AC 1254
. In a well known passage from his speech in that case Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest set out nine propositions which in his view `both principle and authority establish`. Their Lordships quote only those of most direct relevance to the instant case as follows: 
`(1) that a man cannot be tried for a crime in respect of which he has previously been acquitted or convicted; 
(2) ... 
(3) that the same rule applies if the crime in respect of which he is being charged is in effect the same, or is substantially the same, as either the principal or a different crime in respect of which he has been acquitted or could have been convicted; 
(4) that one test as to whether the rule applies is whether the evidence which is necessary to support the second indictment, or whether the facts which constitute the second offence, would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first indictment either as to the offences charged or as to an offence of which, on the indictment, the accused could have been found guilty; 
(5) ... 
(6) that on a plea of 
 autrefois acquit 
 or 
 autrefois convict 
 a man is not restricted to a comparison between the later indictment and some previous indictment or to the records of the court, but that he may prove by evidence all such questions as to the identity of persons, dates and facts as are necessary to enable him to show that he is being charged with an offence which is either the same, or is substantially the same, as one in respect of which he has been acquitted or convicted or as one in respect of which he could have been convicted.`
 
If the language of these propositions is suitably modified to apply to professional disciplinary proceedings instead of criminal trials on indictment, they are clearly apt to apply to the circumstances under consideration in the instant case and enable the appellant to rely on the order made against him in the delay proceedings as a complete bar to further disciplinary action against him in the conviction proceedings.
 
In 
 Connelly
`s case Lord Devlin expressed a somewhat different view of the scope of the doctrine of 
 autrefois convict
 and 
 aquit
 from that of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest. He said:
 
`For the doctrine of 
 autrefois
 to apply it is necessary that the accused should have been put in peril of conviction for the same offence as that with which he is then charged. The word ""offence"" embraces both the facts which constitute the crime and the legal characteristics which make it an offence. For the doctrine to apply it must be the same offence both in fact and in law
 
My noble and learned friend in his statement of the law, accepting what is suggested in some dicta in the authorities, extends the doctrine to cover offences which are in effect the same or substantially the same I have no difficulty about the idea that one set of facts may be substantially but not exactly the same as another. I have more difficulty with the idea that an offence may be substantially the same as another in its legal characteristics; legal characteristics are precise things and are either the same or not. If I had felt that the doctrine of 
 autrefois
 was the only form of relief available to an accused who has been prosecuted on substantially the same facts, I should be tempted to stretch the doctrine as far as it would go. But, as that is not my view, I am inclined to favour keeping it within limits that are precise.`
 
It is not altogether easy to discover from the speeches of Lord Reid, Lord Hodson and Lord Pearce whether Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest or Lord Devlin should be taken as expressing the majority view on this issue. But it is unnecessary for their Lordships to express any conclusion in that regard.
If the facts here cannot be brought within Lord Devlin`s strict test, they are certainly covered by the alternative form of relief which he favoured as mitigating the rigour of his strict test. The alternative approach is explained at length in the latter part of Lord Devlin`s speech and leads clearly to the conclusion in the present case that the conviction proceedings brought by the Law Society against the appellant following the delay proceedings were an abuse of the disciplinary process.
 30.It is clear to us that faced with the strict test expressed by Lord Devlin and the more liberal test by Lord Morris their Lordships in the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee` 
s case did not find it necessary to say which was the correct test as Lord Devlin himself had provided a way out on which their Lordships rested their judgment. Lord Devlin discusses his alternative approach at p 1346 et seq and it is that the court has a general discretionary power to quash or stay an indictment which to try would be oppressive to the accused. Translated in terms of disciplinary proceeding the court could quash or stay the show cause order if to proceed with the show cause proceedings would be oppressive to the respondent or an abuse of the disciplinary process.
 31.We can find nothing in the disciplinary process in the show cause proceedings before us remotely suggesting an abuse of process or that which would be oppressive to the respondent if the show cause proceedings were proceeded with. So, if in this case we were put in the dilemma their Lordships in the Board`s judgment in 
 Harry Wee` 
s case were put and had to decide whether Lord Morris` test or Lord Devlin`s test was the correct one we would be inclined to favour Lord Devlin`s strict test as in our respectful view his test seems to us to be jurisprudentially correct.
 32.For these reasons we find that the respondent has not shown cause why he should not be struck off the roll, suspended or censured. The order to show cause is made absolute.
 33.Mr Shanmugam has already submitted to us in mitigation in the event we found against the respondent. The respondent is an advocate and solicitor of 24 years` standing. He was admitted to practice in August 1974 and apart for the first 15 years when he was a legal assistant in the firm of Charles Mendis & Partners has been the sole proprietor of his own firm, Edmund Nathan & Co. His field of practice is in civil and criminal litigation. His experience in conveyancing is not vast; he would get assistance from experienced conveyancers whenever he encountered difficulty. We accept that the respondent would not have benefitted from the loan even if it was approved and disbursed. In the event the loan was not disbursed and the bank was not put at risk. We also accept that even if the loan had been disbursed it was unlikely that the bank would have suffered any loss having regard to the property`s real value. Notwithstanding all this a criminal conviction of so senior an advocate and solicitor for an offence of attempted cheating in the context of the facts in this case implies that the respondent is a person of dishonest character. The more senior an advocate and solicitor, the more damage he does to the integrity of the legal profession. The integrity of the legal profession is vitally important to the development of the country`s economy and financial institutions and should never be put at risk. We cannot but take a serious view when an advocate and solicitor has been convicted or an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. A suspension for the maximum period of five years would be wholly inadequate in this case. In the circumstances we order that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. We also order that the respondent pays the taxed costs of these show cause proceedings.",1998-07-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This appeal arises out of the decision of Judith Prakash J in respect of various contractual and tortious claims and counterclaims. The claims, in essence, fell under two broad categories - damages for breach of contract for the sale of goods and damages for the conversion of goods.
 2.The learned judge below made the following orders: (i). With respect to the respondents` claim for the price of goods sold and delivered, namely, inkjet printers and accessories, judgment was given to the respondents. The issue here was the rate of conversion from US dollars to Singapore dollars. It was held that the rate of conversion was that prevailing at the time the respondents obtained judgment and not at the time of execution. The appellants were thus liable to pay the respondents US$45,824.95 converted into Singapore dollars less the sum of S$18,632.95 which the appellants were entitled to set off plus interest.
 (ii). With respect to the respondents` claim for breach of contract to assemble inkjet printers (they alleged that the appellants failed to assemble the printers) and the appellants` counterclaim for breach of the same contract (they alleged that the respondents supplied them with defective printer material kits such that they were incapable of being assembled into working printers), the respondents` claim was dismissed and judgment was given to the appellants in the counterclaim for damages to be assessed.
 (iii). With respect to the respondents` claim in conversion for the abovesaid material kits and other equipment used to assemble the printers, it was held that there was conversion by the appellants of the material kits and 4,500 printer circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) but not the other equipment. Damages for the sum of $101,025 for conversion were awarded.
 (iv). With respect to the appellants` counterclaim for damages for breach of contract to assemble the PCBAs (the appellants alleged that the respondents contracted for the assembly of 24,000 PCBAs but failed to pay for them), judgment was given to the appellants for the supply of 17,000 PCBAs for damages to be assessed.
 3.There was an appeal only as against findings (iii) and (iv) above. The appeal came up for hearing before us on 25 May 1998. After hearing detailed submissions from both parties, we allowed the appeal in part. We will now set out the grounds of our decision.
 4.
 The facts
Both the appellants and respondents were manufacturers of computer products, including inkjet printers. The appellants are a member of the Singapore Technologies group of companies. The respondents have ceased operations since 1995. The respondents lodged three claims against the appellants, two for breach of contract and one for conversion, and the latter had two counterclaims against the respondents for breach of contract.
 5.First, the respondents claimed the price of inkjet printers and accessories sold and delivered to the appellants. The only substantive issue raised by the appellants was with regards to the respondents` use of the exchange rate of S$1.51 to US$1. The accuracy of the figures used hinged on whether the sum claimed ought to have been converted to Singapore dollars only at the time of execution or at the time of judgment, which was an earlier date. Secondly, the respondents claimed damages against the appellants for breach of contract in that the latter failed to assemble and deliver the requisite number of inkjet printers (2,500 units) as required under the contract. The appellants counterclaimed, contending that the respondents were in breach of the express terms of the agreement by supplying material kits that were incomplete and/or defective and were of such poor quality that it was practically impossible to assemble the printers. They argued that, as the printer material kits supplied by the respondents were unsuitable for mass assembly as a result of numerous defects, they were unable to comply with the contract and earn the profits they would otherwise have made. Under the contract, the respondents were responsible for shipping the printer material kits to the appellants` Indonesian company (PT Surya Teknologi) and to provide all dedicated presses, jig/fixtures, testing equipment (CPU, monitor, keyboard, power supply) and accessories required for the assembly of the printers. Thirdly, the respondents claimed for the conversion of the material kits and the other additional equipment necessary for the assembly of printers (including the computer system, production fixtures, test jigs and vortec packing boxes). Fourthly, the appellants counterclaimed for damages arising out of a contract in which the appellants were to supply 24,000 units of PCBAs to the respondents. We examined the circumstances arising out of the claim in conversion (the third claim) and the contractual claim in relation to the sale of the PCBAs (the fourth claim) in further detail.
 6.With respect to the claim in conversion, in the original statement of claim, the respondents claimed only for the conversion of the 2,500 printer material kits. In the amended statement of claim, they included the additional equipment in their claim for conversion. According to Ben Ang (Ang), the appellants` head of offshore operations, he informed the respondents sometime in October 1994 that they should remove and retake possession of their material kits as they were occupying too much space on the appellants` factory floor. Ang further informed the respondents that the appellants were going to renovate the factory premises and would therefore need to remove the materials. On 9 December 1994, Ang wrote to the respondents setting out the same. It added that, should the appellants not hear from the respondents, they would dispose of or scrap the material kits on the latters` behalf: 
We have informed you that we shall be carrying out a major factory renovation this month and have requested the (sic) you to make arrangement to receive these materials which we shall be returning to you. You have told us that you do not have enough warehouse space in Singapore at that time and will inform us immediately once you have other alternatives. However, we have not heard from you till today. We have now no choice but to give you our final notice that if we do not hear from you concerning any arrangement to receive these materials by December 16, 1994, we shall assume that you longer (sic) need these materials and we shall take the liberty to dispose/scrap it on your behalf.
 On 14 December 1994, the respondents` solicitors replied, denying that the respondents had ever been informed by the appellants in October 1994 about taking back possession of the kits and warned the appellants against disposing of or scrapping the materials lest they be made liable for the consequences. On 4 January 1995, the respondents` solicitors wrote to the appellants again, stating that they would take delivery of the material kits but would require reasonable time to do so. On 13 January 1995, Singapore Technologies wrote to the respondents` solicitors on the appellants` behalf, seeking the respondents` advice as soon as possible as to when they could take delivery of the defective printer material kits as the appellants were unable to store them at their Batam premises for very much longer. The respondents wrote back on 17 and 24 January 1995 with regards to the loading of the material kits onto the containers in order for them to be shipped back to Singapore. However, on 2 February 1995, the appellants had a change of heart and decided that they would want to retain the material kits. Singapore Technologies wrote to the respondents` solicitors, stating this: 
Material Kits in Batam
 
CEI`s position is that the material kits delivered by ComTech are in fact defective. As ComTech has now asserted that the kits are not defective, CEI intends to retain the material kits to support its assertion.
 In October 1996, after they obtained a report by one Dr Chew Chye Heng of the National University of Singapore which stated that the kits were indeed defective, the appellants offered to return the material kits but the respondents refused to accept them. In their amended statement of claim, the respondents claimed $244,655.67 for the value of the kits. Together with the value of the additional equipment and loss of profits, the respondents sought damages set at $390,297.67 for the conversion of the printer kits and the additional items.
 7.We turn next to the facts with regards to the counterclaim in respect of the sale of the PCBAs. In April 1993, the parties entered into the sale contract which was evidenced by two documents, the appellants` quotation dated 14 April 1993 and the respondents` purchase order No 1108 dated 15 April 1993. The relevant part of the quotation stated: 
We are pleased to quote the turnkey supply of the above board assembly basing a (sic) order quantity of 4,000 pcs/mth starting from July to December 1993 (total of 24,000 pcs).
 
 
Comtech shall place an order for the full 24,000 pcs of which 8,000 pcs are firm order (non-cancellable). Comtech shall confirm order for the remaining 16,000 pcs at least 12 weeks prior to the desired delivery dates.
 The pertinent part of the purchase order states: 
COMTECH JM2692-2 PRINTER BOARD ASSEMBLY
 
8,000 pcs firm order
 
16,000 pcs subject to confirmation
 Another crucial document is highlighted. On 14 May 1993, the respondents sent a letter to the appellants with a production schedule, the contents of which were set out in their entirety: 
Please note following expected delivery schedule (July-Sept).
 
We reserve the right to make changes provided CEI is informed of the changes at least two weeks in advance.

 The appellants claimed that the respondents had placed a firm order for 24,000 units and that the latter had orally confirmed the order for the remaining 16,000 units. In any case, the appellants delivered 5,000 units to the respondents in July 1993 and another 5,000 units in September 1993. However, 128 units were found to be defective and were returned. The respondents thus accepted 9,872 pieces in total. The appellants billed the respondents for 10,000 pieces, but as only 9,872 were accepted, the respondents paid for the 9,872 pieces. The appellants claimed damages for the remaining 14,128 units. We ought to mention that the appellants were able to deliver only 10,000 units of PCBAs as the respondents stopped supplying them with any more ASIC chips (the ASIC chips were necessary for the production of the PCBAs. The chips were to be supplied by the respondents under the contract).
 8.As an unhappy result of the various disagreements, the respondents instituted the present action on 5 April 1995.
 9.
 The trial judge`s decision
Judith Prakash J gave a very detailed and well-reasoned judgment. Only those parts of her judgment which relate to the two claims which are the subject of this appeal will be dealt with.
 10.In giving judgment to the respondents in the claim for conversion, her Honour held that there was conversion of the material kits but not the additional items. With regards to the material kits, it was held that a clear demand was made but the appellants refused to comply with the demand unconditionally. The learned judge elaborated at [para ] 52 of her judgment: 
In my judgment, the defendants` prolonged retention of the kits was not justified. On 2 February 1995 their refusal to return the kits was unconditional. It would be recalled that a refusal is not conditional if the defendant simply claims time to do something to the goods apart from taking steps to return them. Even if at the start, their refusal to return the kits could perhaps have been considered a qualified refusal, the effect of this was that it would become their duty, after having had reasonable opportunity to examine the kits, to return them. The plaintiffs could very well have obtained an expert`s report on the kits in February 1995 itself and could have returned them to the plaintiffs at the latest in April 1995. They cannot justify keeping the kits right up to October 1996 when they finally offered to return them. I therefore hold that the plaintiffs have made out their claim in conversion in respect of the kits.
 With regards to the additional items, it was held that there was no conversion as there was no specific demand for the return of these items. Her Honour reasoned at [para ] 50 of her judgment: 
The law is clear. The demand must be specific and must identify the items which are to be returned. It must be made before the writ is issued. In this case, the plaintiffs apparently overlooked the additional items and they cannot rely on the defendants` intention to return the same to make up for their own deficiency. Accordingly, I hold that the defendants did not convert the computer system, production fixtures, test jigs and packing boxes.
 11.As for the amount of damages payable, the learned judge set it at $80,709.50 (the cost of the material kits) as that was the only amount of damages the respondents could prove. They were unable to prove loss of profits. Her Honour derived this figure in the following manner at [para ] 55 of her judgment: 
The only evidence that the plaintiffs led on the cost of the kits was a seven page bill of materials that had been compiled by Mr Seow. This contained a list of the parts making up each printer and indicated the cost of each such part. The total cost of the printer was stated to be S$91.5966. This figure included, however, S$13.20 being the defendants` price for assembling the unit and S$3.61 being the cost of spray painting the printer on completion. The actual material cost was therefore approximately S$74.49. The problem, however, is that Mr Seow did not give any evidence of how the costs of the individual components were derived nor provide any documents upon which the figures were based except for an invoice from Ngai Keung Metal and Plastic Manufacturing Ltd of Hong Kong showing that this company had sold the plaintiffs 3,000 pieces of `inkjet printer full port kit` at the price of US$21.38 per kit. This meant that 2,500 kits cost the plaintiffs US$53,450 or S$80,709.50 using the plaintiffs` rate of US$1 = S$1.51. The plaintiffs were also able to produce a copy of the letter of credit established to pay this invoice. The plaintiffs have, therefore, only been able to establish a cost of S$80,709.50 for the kits.
 Thus, the damages awarded were derived from the cost of the material kits which the respondents purchased from the Hong Kong company at the cost of US$53,450 or S$80,709.50 (2,500 x US$21.38).
 12.That was not the end of the matter. The respondents` solicitors wrote in to request for further arguments on the assessment of damages with respect to the material kits. They contended that the value of the kits should include the 4,500 PCBAs which were sold to them by the appellants for $101,025 and the 1,500 PCBAs which they also bought from the appellants at a cost of $1,950. Judith Prakash J varied her judgment to include the value of the 4,500 PCBAs ($101,025), making the total amount of damages payable at $181,734.50. Her Honour reasoned that when the respondents made a demand for the return of the kits, it included the PCBAs, which was a component making up the kit.
 13.As for the appellants` counterclaim, Judith Prakash J held that they were entitled to damages (to be assessed) with respect to the extra 9,000 units of PCBAs (over and above the 8,000 units confirmed initially). It was held that the contract provided for the purchase of at least 8,000 units (ie confirmed orders) with an option of ordering up to 16,000 more units. It was further held that the respondents did confirm an order for 9,000 more units over and above the initial 8,000 units. This was evidenced by the letter of 14 May 1993. The learned judge found no evidence that the respondents confirmed their order for the last 7,000 units other than the appellants` assertion of an oral confirmation for 24,000 units. Her Honour stated her reasons at [para ] 71 and 72 of the judgment: 
71 In their counterclaim, the defendants have pleaded that the plaintiffs confirmed orally on or about May 1993 and by letters dated 14 May 1993 and 15 May 1993, the order for the remaining 16,000 PCBAs. The defendants were not, however, able to substantiate their assertion of an oral confirmation. Their witness, Mr Lim Piak Hwa, the recipient of this confirmation, could not remember the relevant conversation. Thus, the defendants have to fall back on the two letters. 
72 In court, Mr Ang agreed that the defendants did not regard the letter of 15 May as a confirmation of the plaintiffs` order. It was simply a forecast of production because the plaintiffs wanted to know to what extent the defendants would be able to push up production. That leaves the letter of 14 May 1993. In my opinion, that letter was a confirmation that the plaintiffs wanted 17,000 pieces in total. They specified not only the expected delivery dates but also the exact quantities to be given on those dates. It was not qualified in the same way as the letter of 15 May and cannot be read as an enquiry as to whether the defendants would be able to provide the quantities mentioned on the dates mentioned. The factual matrix at the time of the letter was that the plaintiffs had earlier indicated that they mostly probably wanted at least 24,000 pieces if not more and they knew that in order that the production schedule not be disrupted, they had to give their confirmation of the additional amounts fairly quickly. They must have sent the letter of 14 May knowing that the defendants would regard it as confirmation of the additional 9,000 pieces mentioned therein and with the intention that the defendants should do so.

 The appeal
In arriving at our decision to allow this appeal in part, we looked at the following three issues which were, in our opinion, pertinent to the outcome of the appeal: (i). whether the quantum of damages for the conversion of the material kits had been correctly assessed;
 (ii). whether there was conversion of the 4,500 PCBAs; and
 (iii). whether there was a confirmed order for 17,000 units of PCBAs or more.
 Whether the quantum of damages for the conversion of the material kits had been correctly assessed
 15.The appellants accepted Judith Prakash J`s finding that there was conversion of the material kits. They appealed only as against the learned judge`s quantification of damages, which her Honour held was the cost incurred by the respondents in purchasing the kits from the Hong Kong company. This was calculated to be $80,709.50. The appellants submitted that the respondents should have been awarded only nominal damages as the latter did not incur any actual loss since minimal value should be attributed to the defective and badly manufactured kits.
 16.The object of an award of damages is to give the plaintiff compensation for the damage he has suffered. The 
 locus classicus 
 in resolving a problem as to the measure of damages can be found in Lord Blackburn`s seminal statement in 
Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co
 
[1880] 5 App Cas 25
 where his Lordship defined the measure of damages at p 39 as: 
that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.
 That pronouncement provides a good starting point in determining the amount of damages when tortious liability has been proved. The general principle in the quantification of tortious damages is 
 restitutio in integrum 
: the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount which will put him in the position he would have been in had the tort never been committed. Of course, there are exceptions and limitations engrafted to this general principle where the plaintiff is entitled to less than the full compensation, for example, where there is contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff or where he fails to mitigate his losses.
 17.The fundamental rule in the assessment of damages is that the plaintiff cannot recover more than the loss actually sustained by him. Any actual loss which the plaintiff claims to have suffered must be proved. The measure of damages in conversion is the value of the goods, together with any consequential damage flowing from the conversion which is not too remote to be recoverable in law. The value of the goods is usually taken as at the time of conversion. This has been laid down by the House of Lords in 
Caxton Publishing Co v Sutherland Publishing Co
 
[1939] AC 178
 where Lord Porter unequivocally stated at p 203: 
there is no dispute as to the principle on which in general the measure of damages of conversion is calculated. It is the value of the thing converted at the date of the conversion
 There is some judicial dicta in the United Kingdom which indicate that a time subsequent to the time of the conversion may be relevant, especially in cases where there has been fluctuations in the market price of the goods (see 
Greening v Wilkinson
 
[1825] 1 C & P 625
 at p 626 , 
Sachs v Miklos
 
[1948] 2 KB 23
, 
Munro v Willmott
 
[1949] 1 KB 295
). However, we found it unnecessary to deal with this issue since it had no bearing on the present appeal. The computation of the measure of damages necessitated further consideration.
 18.There is no universal rule for the assessment of damages. The value of the goods is the basic criterion. The normal measure of damages for conversion is the market value of the goods converted, it being the simplest and most convenient way of calculating the value of the goods. This is a well-settled principle which is based on the premise that: 
where you are dealing with goods which can be readily bought in the market, a man whose rights have been interfered with is never entitled to more than what he would have to pay to buy a similar article in the market
 per Greer LJ in 
J & E Hall Ltd v Barclay
 
[1937] 3 All ER 620
 at p 623. With much respect, it may be too strong to say that the person aggrieved is `never` entitled to more than the market value of the goods, since there may be consequential losses flowing from the act of conversion, as will be discussed below. However, the rationale espoused in Greer LJ`s statement holds: the value of goods which are available in the market should be determined by their market price. The calculation of the value of the goods becomes more difficult where there is no market value. In such a situation, the general rule is that the value is assessed by the cost of replacing the goods (see 
J & E Hall Ltd v Barclay
 
[1937] 3 All ER 620
); evidence of the cost of replacement is usually given by the price at which the goods were bought, or the price at which they were sold under a sub-contract. Where no market exists in which to replace the goods, their value is to be fixed at what the plaintiff could get by sale to a solvent buyer (see 
The Arpad
 
[1934] P 189
).
 19.Besides the value of the goods, the plaintiff may be entitled to damages for consequential losses as a result of the act of conversion. Consequential losses include loss of profits and loss incurred through being deprived of the use of the goods. Whether the plaintiff can recover for such consequential loss turns on the principles of remoteness of damage - the consequential loss must not be too remote a consequence of the act of conversion.
 20.Applying the principles set out above, we came to the conclusion that the respondents were entitled only to nominal damages for the conversion of the material kits and that Judith Prakash J`s award of S$80,709.50 be set aside.
 21.In coming to our opinion, we were of the view that the learned judge`s findings that the material kits supplied by the respondents were so defective such that they were incapable of being assembled into working printers had a significant bearing on the amount of damages to be awarded for the conversion of the same kits. This part of the judge`s findings was not challenged on appeal. Judith Prakash J held at [para ] 29 and 30 of her judgment: 
29 It is my finding that it was a condition of the contract between the parties that the plaintiffs were to provide material of sufficient quality to enable mass assembly of the printers The defendants were, as the plaintiffs must have known, expecting to receive material kits that were suitable for mass production on an assembly line. 
30 The material kits supplied by the plaintiffs were not suitable for such mass assembly because of the numerous defects in the gears and other parts which required painstaking re-working.
 Her Honour accepted the evidence of the appellants` expert witness, Dr Chew, as to the numerous defects in the printer kits. The evidence of Dr Chew established that: -. the problems found by appellants` employees as reflected in Mr Seow`s (the respondents` witness) list of defects, were consistent with those found by him and his team (save for the electrical problems and some additional problems which Dr Chew did not review);
 -. the material kits were not well manufactured and were not suitable for assembly into working printers, whether mass or otherwise;
 -. there were flaws in the design of the printer
 It was thus evident that the material kits delivered by the respondents were so defective that the appellants were not able to carry out their part of the contract of assembling the kits into working printers. The judge accepted evidence that the printers required major re-working on a printer-by-printer basis before they could be put into a working condition.
 22.Next, we had to look at what value could be placed on these badly manufactured and defective kits which were the subject of the conversion by the appellants. First and foremost, it must be remembered that the onus is on the plaintiffs to adduce proof as to any actual loss alleged by them. This, we found that the respondents were unable to do.
 23.Based on the principles espoused above with respect to the calculation of the measure of damages, there were three alternatives in determining the value of the defective kits: (i). first, the market value for defective printer kits that could not be assembled into working printers; or
 (ii). secondly, if no market existed, the cost of replacing such defective kits; or
 (iii). thirdly, if no such market existed to replace the kits, the value would be determined by what the respondents could obtain through a sale to a solvent buyer.
 Alternative (i) was not a practical one since it was most unlikely that there would be a market in which someone would be willing to purchase defective and unworkable material kits. Alternative (ii) was similarly unfeasible since, on a similar vein, there would not be a market in which one could purchase defective kits to replace the converted ones. That left us with the last alternative. The respondents did not provide any evidence to suggest that there were other buyers who were able and willing to purchase such badly manufactured and defective kits. One could hazard an intelligent guess that nobody would be willing to purchase unworkable kits at any price other than a very nominal price. Unfortunately, the respondents did not adduce any other evidence to show that there was an alternative basis by which the court could value the defective kits. As such, we had to take it that there was no such other basis.
 24.We could not agree with the learned judge`s valuation of the kits which was based on the price at which the respondents themselves purchased the kits from the Hong Kong company. The figure of S$80,709.50 was arrived at on the premise that the respondents purchased working and non-defective printer kits which were suitable for mass production. The value of S$80,709.50 was not the value of unworkable and defective kits. The goods which the appellants were held to have converted were in fact defective kits, not working kits. The value which we were concerned with was the value of defective kits. With great respect, the learned judge had misdirected herself when she took the cost of purchasing the kits as the value of the kits. That cost might have been the value of non-defective kits (we made no ruling on this), but it was incorrect to impute that same value to defective kits.
 25.In our judgment, in the absence of concrete evidence as to the value of the kits, we had no hesitation in finding that no or nominal value should be given to the kits. Even if some value was to be given to them, the value would be heavily discounted to take into account the fact that the kits were defective and essentially non-functional for the purpose of mass assembly.
 26.The respondents had also failed to show that they suffered any consequential loss as a result of the conversion. No evidence was raised to suggest that the respondents were deprived of the use of kits. In our opinion, the kits were so defective that they would not be of use to the respondents in any event. As such, we concluded that they had not suffered any actual loss as a result of the conversion of the defective kits. Thus, the award of damages was stipulated at the nominal sum of $100.
 Whether there was conversion of the 4,500 PCBAs
 27.The only question which arose in this regards was whether the term, `material kits`, comprised the 4,500 PCBAs. These PCBAs were manufactured by the appellants and sold to the respondents. They made up one of the components for the assembly of the printers.
 28.The law with regards to the tort of conversion was succinctly summarised in the learned judge`s judgment at [para ] 40 to 42 and would not be rehashed here. Essentially, to amount to conversion, there must be detention of the chattel which is consciously adverse to the rights of the owner. The usual mode of proof of conversion is by showing that the owner made a specific and unconditional demand for the return of the goods and the person in possession of the goods unconditionally refused to do so. The demand must be both specific and unconditional. The refusal to return must be unconditional.
 29.On the evidence before us, we found that when the demand for the printer material kits was made, this did not include the 4,500 PCBAs. We therefore set aside Judith Prakash J`s holding in including the costs of the 4,500 PCBAs as part of the damages for conversion. Our reasoning was this.
 30.From the various correspondence between the appellants and the respondents with regards to the return of the material kits, it was clear that the parties were referring to the 2,500 kits which the respondents had shipped to the appellants` factory at Batam and nothing else. The contents of two letters shed some light as to what the parties were contemplating when they discussed the removal of the kits from the appellants` premises. By a letter dated 13 January 1995 written by Singapore Technologies on behalf of the appellants to the respondents` solicitors, this was stated: 
Please also advise as soon as possible when your clients are able to take delivery of the 
 defective inkjet printer kits
 as CEI is unable to store the kits at its Batam premises for much longer. [Emphasis added.]
 The parties were referring only to the defective material kits supplied by the respondents and not all the components which made up the printer, including the 4,500 PCBAs. A later letter written on 2 February 1995 by Singapore Technologies re-affirmed the fact that the parties were talking about the return of defective kits only and not all the materials making up the printer which belonged to the respondents, as was alleged by the respondents: 
CEI`s position is that the 
 material kits delivered by ComTech are in fact defective. As ComTech has now asserted that the kits are not defective, CEI intends to retain the material kits to support its assertion
. [Emphasis added.]
 Furthermore, in their original statement of claim, the respondents claimed for the conversion of 2,500 material kits. They quantified their claim for conversion at US$21.38 per kit or S$80,709.90 for 2,500 kits. This was the price at which the respondents purchased the kits from the Hong Kong company which were then forwarded by the respondents to the appellants for assembly into printers. Subsequently, on the first day of the trial, the respondents amended their statement of claim to include a claim for the conversion of the additional materials (this part of the claim was dismissed by the learned trial judge and was not a subject of appeal). Thus, it could be seen that, up to the time of the issue of the writ of summons, the intention of the respondents themselves was to seek the recovery of the defective kits which they purchased from the Hong Kong company only. The logical inference from this was that both parties were concerned with the conversion of the defective printer kits and not other materials such as the 4,500 PCBAs.
 31.In addition, it was clear that the learned judge herself was of the view that the demand for the return of the material kits related only to the 
 defective 
 kits. This was reflected at [para ] 51 and 52 of the judgment: 
The position in relation to the kits is different. A clear demand was made. 
 The defendants refused to comply with this demand because they wanted to retain the kits in order to prove that they were defective so as to defend any claim which the plaintiffs might bring against them.
 The defendants have submitted that it was reasonable for them to temporarily retain the kits as they were the only evidence the defendants had of the defective nature of the kits In my judgment, the defendants` prolonged retention of the kits was not justified. On 2 February 1995 their refusal to return the kits was unconditional. [Emphasis added.]
 With respect, the learned judge erred when she decided that the 4,500 PCBAs fell within the definition of `material kits`. Her Honour had rejected the respondents` contention that when the respondents were seeking the return of the material kits from the appellants, they were seeking the return of everything in the appellants` possession. The learned judge held that the specific demand made by the respondents related only to the kits which the appellants retained to prove that they were defective. The PCBAs were not defective in any way. The judge had in mind only the defective material kits which the respondents had shipped to the appellants for assembly. To hold that the 4,500 PCBAs were subject to the specific demand would be inconsistent with the finding that the demand was made only with regard to the defective kits and nothing more.
 Whether there was a confirmed order for 17,000 units of PCBAs or more
 32.This was essentially a question of fact. The learned trial judge was entitled to come to her own conclusion as to what the parties in fact bargained for in light of the evidence. Unless it was manifestly wrong, the appellate court would not and should not disturb the finding of fact. We were of the view that Judith Prakash J came to a very sound finding based on the available evidence. Her Honour listened to both parties and chose not to believe Mr Lim`s testimony that there was oral confirmation for 24,000 and decided, instead, to lend heavier weight to the document of 14 May 1993 evidencing a firm order of 17,000 units. In our opinion, this finding could not be faulted in any sense. We thus dismissed the appeal on this issue.
 33.For all the reasons above, we allowed the appeal to the following extent: -. that the quantification of damages payable by the appellants for conversion of the material kits be set aside and the nominal sum of $100 be awarded to the respondents;
 -. that the variation of the judgment dated 29 October 1997 to include the costs of the 4,500 PCBAs as part of the damages for conversion be set aside.",1998-07-20 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 The charges
On 6 March 1998, the respondent pleaded guilty in the court below to two charges. One charge was for drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1997 Ed) (RTA), and the second was for speeding under s 63(4) and punishable under s 131(1)(a) of the RTA.
 2.The prosecution appealed only in respect of the sentence imposed under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, for which the respondent was fined $6,000 (in default three months` imprisonment) and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for four years.
 3.At the end of the hearing before me on 30 June 1998, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal. I now give my reasons.
 4.
 The facts
The facts of this case were straightforward. On 17 October 1997 at about 8.40pm, one VSC 1370 Roger Chua (VSC Chua) was patrolling along the Tampines Expressway towards the direction of the Seletar Expressway. VSC Chua then spotted the respondent driving his vehicle in a zigzag manner and overtaking twice from the left-hand side at a speed of about 108 km/h when the speed limit was 80 km/h. VSC Chua managed to stop the respondent, and he noted that the latter`s breath smelled of alcohol. The respondent was subsequently brought to the traffic police station where he was subjected to a breath evidential analyser test. The test revealed that the respondent had 38 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, thus exceeding the legal limit by 3 micrograms.
 5.Further investigations revealed that the respondent had been charged and convicted of drink driving in 1991, for which he was fined $1,500 and disqualified from driving class 3 vehicles for one year.
 6.In the court below, after the respondent pleaded guilty, the prosecution urged the district judge to impose an imprisonment term since this was the respondent`s second conviction for drink driving under s 67 of the RTA. The submission was that an imprisonment term was mandatory for a repeat offender.
 7.The defence, however, relied on the recent case of 
Seah Swee Hock v PP
 (Unreported) which I presided over to contend that the district judge could exercise her discretion not to impose an imprisonment term.
 8.
 The decision below
After reference to ss 67 and 68 of the RTA as well as the facts in 
 Seah 
`s case, the district judge concluded as follows: 
10 In setting aside the custodial sentence in 
 Seah Swee Hock 
`s case, the Honourable Chief Justice clearly took the view that imprisonment was not mandatory under s 68. The punishment prescribed for a subsequent offence under s[s] 68(1) and 67(1) were worded similarly. The interpretation taken by the Honourable Chief Justice in 
 Seah Swee Hock 
`s case was thus applicable to the case before me. It followed that imprisonment was also not mandatory for subsequent offenders under s 67.
 9.In passing sentence, the district judge took into account that the respondent`s previous drink driving offence was committed some time ago. She also considered the fact that the respondent had on this occasion exceeded the legal limit by only 3 micrograms and aggravating factors such as an accident were absent. Hence, on the authority of 
 Seah 
`s case, she concluded that an imprisonment term was inappropriate. Accordingly, she imposed a hefty fine and disqualification order instead.
 10.
 Issue in the appeal
The central issue in this appeal was simply whether, under s 67 of the RTA, an imprisonment term was mandatory for a repeat offender who was driving under the influence of drinks. The answer to the question depended largely on the proper construction to be given to the phrase `shall be liable` and the word `and` as found in the section which I shall allude to shortly.
 
 The appeal
`Shall be liable`
 11.Evidently, the crux of this appeal focused on my decision in 
 Seah Swee Hock v PP 
 (supra). That case was an appeal against sentence by a repeat offender under the RTA, although the relevant provision there was s 68, which deals with `being in charge of a motor vehicle when under the influence of drinks or drugs`. The significance, however, is that s 68 employs the same phraseology as s 67. Thus, having decided in 
 Seah 
`s case that an imprisonment term was 
 not 
 mandatory for a repeat offender, it was obvious that that decision would also directly apply to the proper construction of s 67.
 12.Having read the eloquent arguments of the prosecution submitted before me, I was convinced that my decision in 
 Seah 
`s case was wrong and should be rectified to prevent setting an unwelcome precedent. However, I thought I should at least explain how I reached my decision in 
 Seah 
`s case.
 13.That case involved a consideration of s 68(1) of the RTA which reads: 
Any person who when in charge of a motor vehicle which is on a road or other public place but not driving the vehicle - 
(a) is unfit to drive in that he is under the influence of drink or of a drug or an intoxicating substance to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle; or 
(b) has so much alcohol in his body that the proportion of it in his breath or blood exceeds the prescribed limit,
 
shall be guilty of an offence and 
 shall be liable on conviction
 to a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. [Emphasis added.]
 14.In my view, prima facie, the phrase `shall be liable` (as opposed to `shall be punished`) contained no obligation or mandatory connotation. In 
Ng Chwee Puan v R
 
[1953] MLJ 86
 , Brown J had said that: 
[T]he word `liable` contains no obligatory or mandatory connotation. Sitting in this court, with a table fan blowing directly on to me, I am `liable` to catch a cold. But it does not follow that I shall.
 15.Turning to s 344 of our Penal Code (Cap 224) for an example, the provision states: 
Whoever wrongfully confines any person for 10 days or more, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, and 
 shall also be liable to fine
. [Emphasis added.]
 It was clear to me that the fine in s 344 would not be mandatory, and the court retained a discretion to impose a fine up to its jurisdictional limit or not at all. Indeed, if one looked at the Penal Code, it would be apparent that the draftsman had been very careful in using the phrase `shall be punished` to prescribe a mandatory penalty, and using `shall be liable` only when the penalty was dependent on the court`s discretion. So, in s 344 above, the court had discretion whether or not to pass the additional punishment of a fine at all.
 16.
 Seah Swee Hock v PP
It was against this backdrop of considerations that guided me in my approach in 
 Seah 
`s case whereby I decided that an imprisonment term was 
 not 
 mandatory for a repeat offender under s 68(1) of the RTA.
 17.Section 68(1) of the RTA classifies punishment of offenders into two limbs (see [para ] 13 above): 
(a) For first offenders, the punishment is a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $2,000 
 or 
 to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months; 
(b) For subsequent offenders, the punishment is to a fine not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 
 and 
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.
 18.One possible view was that, for first offenders, the court had a choice between a fine or imprisonment but not both. For repeat offenders, however, the court must impose a fine 
 and 
 an imprisonment term. The imprisonment term being 
 mandatory 
 because of the word `and` (as opposed to `or` under the first limb) which imputed conjunction with the fine for repeat offenders. So, there was no discretion over the type of punishment; the court only had discretion over the amount of the fine and the length of the imprisonment.
 19.At the onset, I should just state that I had no difficulty with the construction given to the prescribed punishment for 
 first offenders 
.
 20.However, reading s 68(1) 
 on its own 
 without the benefit of further submissions from either side, I did not initially think that imprisonment was mandatory for 
 repeat offenders 
, and I was persuaded to reach that view on the two following cases.
 21.First, there was the case of 
PP v Lee Ah Sam
 
[1949] MLJ 236
 in which the court had to construe the effect of the word `and` found in the punishment prescribed under reg 5(I) of the Emergency Regulations 1948: 
 shall be liable
 to be punished with death, 
 or
 with penal servitude for life 
 and
 whipping. [Emphasis added.]
 22.Willan CJ, in delivering judgment, stated as follows at p 238: 
The penal provision of that Regulation can be read, without altering the sense, as follows:
 
`shall be liable to be punished 
(a) with death, or 
(b) with penal servitude for life and whipping.`
 
The Deputy Public Prosecutor contended that the use of the word `and` implies that the whipping is mandatory; that having discarded the first alternative, death, one is left with the second alternative, namely penal servitude for life 
 and
whipping, and therefore both must be imposed. It must be pointed out, however, that it would have been absurd in the context to use the word `or` instead of `and`. 
 In our view the word `and` is used simply to show that the whipping can be imposed in addition to a sentence of penal servitude. Moreover the Deputy Public Prosecutor`s argument ignores the words `shall be liable` which, quite apart from the provisions of 5I, indicate that the maximum extent of the liability is penal servitude for life and whipping
. Finally, a comparison with the rather stronger wording of section 396 of the Penal Code confirms our view that the whipping under reg 5(I) is discretionary. The relevant words of s 396 are `shall be punished with death or penal servitude for life and with whipping with a cat-o`-nine tails`. It has never been suggested that the whipping under that section is mandatory and in our opinion it is not. [Emphasis added.]
 23.Similarly, in 
PP v Phua Keng Tong
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 279
  
[1986] SLR 168
 , the court had to deal with ss 5 and 17(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213). Section 17(2), which uses a formula similar to that in s 68(1) of the RTA, states: 
A person who is guilty of an offence under this Act by reason of section 5,6,8 or 11 
 shall be liable
 on conviction before a District Court to a fine not exceeding $2,000 
 and
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. [Emphasis added.]
 24.Although LP Thean J (as he then was) did not expound on the scope of s 17(2), he clearly took the view that an imprisonment term was 
 not 
mandatory despite the use of the word `and` in the prescribed punishment. Therefore, a fine of $1,500 and in default one month`s imprisonment was imposed by the court. A priori, the learned judge must also have thought that his powers of sentencing were alternative or cumulative in that he could give a fine or imprisonment or both - that surely must have been the case to give effect to the word `and` in s 17(2). It would have been absurd if the sentences were only in the alternative since this would have directly contradicted the word `and`.
 25.Therefore, just reading s 68(1) of the RTA, I was inclined to construe the word `and` in the second limb of punishment as being qualified by the earlier phrase, `shall be liable`, in the section. The second limb of punishment in s 68(1) could thus be read as: `
 shall be liable on conviction to a fine and imprisonment 
`; and this would have fallen squarely within the construction given by the court in 
 Lee Ah Sam 
 (supra). Consequently, the imprisonment term could be in addition to a fine if the court so wished, provided it did not exceed six months. This construction, I thought, was entirely consistent with the view that the word `and` in the second limb of punishment was meant to create a distinction from the first limb of punishment. Further, the court would retain discretion over the extent of the prescribed punishment (ie the length of imprisonment) as apparent from the wording of the section.
 26.
 or 
 and 
In the circumstances, I thought the punishment under s 68(1) (if taken on its own) could be read as though it were as follows: (a). For first offenders, the convicted person shall be liable to a fine shall be liable to imprisonment. The punishment is thus alternative; it is either one or the other.
 (b). For subsequent offenders, the convicted person shall be liable to a fine imprisonment, the punishments being alternative or cumulative. In other words, the court can impose a fine or an imprisonment term or both. It is up to the court to choose one of the three options.
 27.Of course, I was then referred to full arguments by the prosecution in the instant case which convinced me to reach a contrary conclusion. But bearing in mind the general usage of the words `shall be liable` and taking into account their usual effect, I would have thought that to avoid confusion, future provisions might be worded differently if a mandatory effect was so desired. The court does not always have the benefit of the full legislative history of a provision. It must frequently simply rely on the wording of relevant sections as they appear in the statutes for the regular disposal of its cases, but I shall leave the matter entirely in the hands of the legislative draftsmen.
 28.
 The instant appeal
Reverting to the instant appeal, s 67(1) of the RTA reads: 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more that $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and,
 in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months
. [Emphasis added.]
 29.Before me, the prosecution had presented a thorough account of the law in respect of the RTA. I need do no more that to set out their persuasive submissions which I found myself in entire agreement with.
 30.My attention was drawn first to the case of 
PP v Tan Teck Hin
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 504
  
[1991] SLR 514
 whereby FA Chua J said as follows at p 505( MLJ) and p 516 (SLR): 
Although the elements of the offence created by the re-enacted s 67(1) are substantially the same as the elements of the offence under the repealed s 67(1), the punishment for the offence is not the same: the re-enacted section provides for a heavier punishment.
 
 
For a second offender, the punishment under the repealed section was `a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both`. Whereas under the re-enacted section the punishment is a mandatory `fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months`.
 
Now is this a second conviction of the respondent under s 67(1)? Under the repealed section, the court had a discretion as to the punishment. Under the re-enacted section [the present s 67(1)], the court has no discretion as to the punishment.
 31.Subsequently, the prosecution applied under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) for a question of law to be considered by the Court of Appeal. The question was whether a court, for the purposes of sentencing an accused convicted under the newly amended s 67(1) of the RTA, should take into account the accused`s previous conviction under the same section before the amendment and impose the minimum sentence provided for: see 
PP v Tan Teck Hin
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 841
 .
 32.In its deliberations in that case, the Court of Appeal had to consider the minimum punishment for a repeat offender under s 67 of the RTA, and the following was stated at pp 843-844, 847: 
The punishment introduced by the amendment can be summarized as follows. Before the amendment, for first offenders, it was either a fine or imprisonment. For repeat offenders, the punishment was a fine or imprisonment, or both, although, as to be expected, the limits prescribed were higher for repeat offenders than for first offenders. There was no provision for a minimum fine or imprisonment for either first or repeat offenders, although the maximum, of course, was provided.
 
The position after the amendment is that for first offenders, there is still the alternative of a fine or imprisonment, but a minimum is imposed for the fine, though not for the imprisonment. 
 For repeat offenders, the penalty has been drastically enhanced. They are now subject to both a minimum fine and a mandatory term of imprisonment.
 
 
The dispute is whether in sentencing him the court should consider [the accused] to be a repeat offender or a first offender. If his previous conviction under the section before it was amended could properly be taken into account, then he was liable to a fine with a minimum of $3,000 and a maximum of $10,000 and a mandatory term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.
 
 
We have no doubt at all that what Parliament intended to do was simply to enhance the punishment for persons found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The offence dealt with by the amended subsection is the same as that under the old subsection. What was changed was the punishment prescribed for persons convicted of the offence. The legislature was particularly intent on dealing severely with repeat offenders. 
 Rather than prescribing a maximum fine and imprisonment term and leaving it to the courts to impose an appropriate punishment up to the maximum, Parliament prescribed the minimum as well
. This indicates beyond doubt an intention to see that such criminal conduct is treated with the required degree of seriousness by the courts. [Emphasis added.]
 33.Next, there was the case of 
Chua Ben Cheong v PP
 (Unreported) whereby Karthigesu J (as he then was) held as follows: 
The sentencing policy to be adopted by the courts for this type of offence, that is, driving while under the influence of alcohol should in my view be in line with the stated policy of Parliament when enacting the particular law, in this case, the amendment to s 67 of the Road Traffic Act. Looking at the amendments that have been effected one can see that the punishment for first time offenders has been changed only in respect of the quantum of the fine that is to be imposed. It is now to be not less than $1,000 whereas previously I think it was not exceeding $1,000, and there is an upper limit which the legislature has sought to impose which is not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months which is the same as before. It is noted, and pointed out by counsel, that these are the two alternatives, there may not be a combination. 
 The intention of Parliament in effecting these amendments was clearly aimed at second or repeat offenders where not only was the quantum of fine increased substantially but it also made a term
 of imprisonment mandatory, that is, a combined sentence of fine and imprisonment. So it is clear what the intention of Parliament was and from that we might discern the intended policy that Parliament was intending to state and the courts must take cognizance of that sentencing policy. [Emphasis added.]
 34.Moreover, it has always been an undoubted canon of construction that an Act must be read as a whole. In this respect, s 64(1) of the same Act which deals with reckless or dangerous driving, states: 
If any person drives a motor vehicle on a road recklessly, or at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both 
 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both
. [Emphasis added.]
 35.The difference between ss 64(1) and 67(1) of the RTA is obvious (see underlined portion above), and it is this. Under s 64(1), the punishment for repeat offenders is alternative or cumulative, and the formula used is `
 a fine or to imprisonment or to both 
`: see also ss 65 and 65A(1)(b). Hence, if Parliament had intended the punishment for repeat offenders under s 67(1) to be alternative and cumulative, it would also have employed the words `
 or to both 
`, just as it did in s 64(1). Instead, in s 67(1), Parliament simply used the word `and`. Therefore, there was at least an argument that the word `and` was intended to make an imprisonment term mandatory.
 36.Similarly, under the old s 67(1) of the RTA (Cap 276), it was stated that a repeat offender `shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 
 or 
 to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months 
 or 
to both`. The punishment then was already alternative and cumulative. Hence, this suggested that Parliament would not have altered the wording by inserting the word `and` if no change was intended by the amendment.
 37.Reference to the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill by the Minister for Home Affairs would also immediately reveal that the amendment was to effect a drastic change (see Parliamentary Debates, 28 March 1990, cl 960): 
Sir, at present, a person driving under the influence of alcohol is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000 or imprisoned for 12 months, or both. 
 The amendments seek to enhance this penalty by increasing the fine and imposing mandatory imprisonment for repeat offenders. For a repeat offender, the fine will be between $3,000 and $10,000, but this repeat offender will be subject to mandatory imprisonment, the period of which will not exceed 12 months. The court will decide on the period of imprisonment
. [Emphasis added.]
 38.Thus, on the weight of the authorities submitted before me and with the benefit of the parliamentary debates, it was clear that imprisonment must be mandatory for repeat offenders convicted under s 67(1) of the RTA. By parity of reasoning, the same would also apply to repeat offenders under s 68(1) of the RTA.
 39.
 Sentence
With regard to sentencing for this sort of traffic offences, I took into account that the respondent had exceeded the legal limit by only three micrograms, that his previous drink driving offence was some seven years ago, that he pleaded guilty to the present offence and had co-operated with the police when stopped.
 40.In view that an imprisonment term is mandatory under our law for repeat offenders, I therefore sentenced the respondent to two weeks` imprisonment in addition to the fine of $6,000 and four years disqualification for all classes of vehicles. Accordingly, the prosecution`s appeal was allowed.",1998-08-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 These two criminal revisions were related. The respondent in Criminal Revision 13/98, Ramlee @Andi bin Arsad (Ramlee), and the respondent in Criminal Revision 14/98, Salleh, were jointly charged with six offences under s 57(1)(c) Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Ed). They pleaded guilty and were dealt with separately. Ramlee was sentenced to three years` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane in respect of each of the six charges. Two of the sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively so that his total sentence was six years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. Salleh was sentenced to three years` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane in respect of each offence. Two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively so that the total sentence was six years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. On the application of the DPP, I revised the sentence imposed on the two respondents. I now set out my reasons.
 2.
 Brief facts
The two respondents were engaged by one Jumhan@ Permata (Jumhan) to assist him in conveying into Singapore six Indonesian nationals who were prohibited immigrants. He was paid 250,000 rupiah (S$100) by the six prohibited immigrants to convey them from Batam into Singapore using a motorised sampan. Jumhan promised each respondent a sum of S$40 on successful completion of the operation. Both the respondents and Jumhan were Indonesian nationals. All of them were arrested by the police coast guards when they unloaded the prohibited immigrants in Singapore.
 3.Jumhan pleaded guilty and was convicted in the subordinate courts of six charges of engaging in the business or trade of conveying into Singapore Indonesian nationals, whom he knew or had reason to believe were prohibited immigrants, contrary to s 57(1)(c), punishable under s 57(1)(iii) of the Immigration Act. The prosecution pressed for a deterrent sentence. He was sentenced to undergo five years` imprisonment and ordered to receive four strokes of the cane on each of the six charges. Two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, so that the total sentence imposed was ten years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. On appeal heard on 28 May 1998, the High Court allowed his appeal on the ground that the maximum terms of imprisonment imposed by the district court were manifestly excessive and reduced the sentence of imprisonment to two years on each charge. Two of the terms were ordered to run consecutively, so the total sentence was four years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
 4.
 The criminal revision
The DPP brought to the attention of the High Court in the course of the appeal that the sentences ordered to be imposed on the respondents were more severe than the sentences imposed on Jumhan, and applied for the sentences on the respondents to be revised.
 5.The prescribed punishment in relation to s 57(1)(iii) is imprisonment for a term of not less than two years and not more than five years and, additionally, with not less than three strokes of the cane.
 6.Under s 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), the High Court may exercise inter alia any of the powers conferred by s 256. Section 256 provides that in an appeal as to sentence, the court may reduce, enhance the sentence or alter the nature of the sentence. It is well established that the High Court would exercise its powers of revision in circumstances where there is some serious injustice. It must be shown `that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below`: 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  at p 330.
 7.Where two or more offenders are to be sentenced for participation in the same offence, the sentences passed on them should be the same, unless there is a relevant difference in their responsibility for the offence or their personal circumstances: see 
 Archbold 
 (1998), para 5-153. An offender who has received a sentence that is significantly more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there being no reason for the differentiation, is a ground of appeal if the disparity is serious. This is even where the sentences viewed in isolation are not considered manifestly excessive: see 
 R v Walsh 
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 224. In 
 R v Fawcett 
 (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 158, Lawton LJ held that the test was whether `right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, learning of this sentence consider that something had gone wrong with the administration of justice?` The same should apply by analogy when the court is exercising its revisionary powers. Right-thinking members of the public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, would consider that something had gone wrong since the offenders whose culpability are not significantly different, should receive the same sentence.
 8.Reverting to the facts of this case, the culpability of Jumhan was greater than that of his co-offenders and he would have expected to receive a sentence more severe than that imposed on the co-offenders, rather than less. The statement of facts indicated that Jumhan was the main culprit and principal conspirator of the offence and did the trafficking simply for the money. He was the owner of the motorised boat which was used to facilitate the entry of the prohibited immigrants, showing that he was deeply involved in the offence. He received the S$100 directly from each of the illegal immigrants and engaged the co-offenders to assist him. The co-offenders were only promised S$ 40 each from him on the successful completion of the entire operation.
 9.Moreover Jumhan had a previous conviction in 1993 when he was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The two co-offenders did not have such antecedents, and would expect to be dealt with less severely. There were no mitigating factors which were peculiar to only to him.
 10.These factors showed that, if there was to be any difference in the length of sentence, Jumhan should be given a longer sentence than the co-offenders. Instead he was sentenced to a lesser term of imprisonment than his co-offenders. The disparity was serious enough for the court to exercise its revisionary powers. Given that Jumhan`s term of imprisonment was reduced to two years` imprisonment which was the mandatory minimum, I sentenced each of the respondents to the mandatory minimum of two years` imprisonment on each of the charges. Two of the sentences should run consecutively, and hence the total term of imprisonment for each of them would be four years. The sentence in respect of caning was ordered to remain the same.
 11.I noted that the position would be different if the court sentencing the offender was of the view that the sentence imposed on the accomplice was unduly lenient. In such a case, it would not be demonstrated that the offender had any justified sense of grievance: see 
 R v Butcher 
 (1989) 11 Cr App R (S) 104. However I was of the view that this was not such a case. At this juncture, I thought it appropriate to set out my reasons for my view.
 12.There is no doubt that traffickers of prohibited immigrants are punished more severely than illegal immigrants and overstayers under the Immigration Act. This is clear from the legislative development of the punishment of immigration offences relating to trafficking of prohibited immigrants. The Malaysian Immigration Ordinance 1959 was first made applicable to Singapore in 1966 via Act 1 of 1996, and subsequently re-enacted as Act 12 of 1970. In Act 12 of 1970, the offence of trafficking in prohibited immigrants carried a term of imprisonment of two years and to a fine not exceeding $4,000. In 1974 (via Act 60 of 1973), the Act was amended to increase the term of imprisonment to not exceeding two years and not more than five years, plus liability to a fine not exceeding $10,000, and to caning. This was the first time caning was introduced. Subsequently, the courts interpreted the words `shall be liable` as not necessarily meaning mandatory caning. In 1989 (via Act 34 of 1989), the provision was amended to include mandatory caning with not less than three strokes.
 13.In 1989, in introducing the Amendment Bill in Parliament, the Minister for Home Affairs stated that the fines and jail terms were clearly not adequate deterrents for many of these traffickers and they should be dealt with seriously: 
 Singapore Parliamentary Debates 
, 31 August 1989 at col 512-514. Traffickers were considered to be mercenaries of human misery and had to be dealt with severely. For those reasons, the Immigration Act was amended to provide for mandatory caning for traffickers of prohibited immigrants where it was previously optional. At the same time, mandatory caning was provided for employers who employed illegal workers. A strong signal had to be sent out that the penalties were severe.
 14.The history behind the amendment of s 57(1) shows that it is the legislative intention to deter traffickers of prohibited immigrants by caning, rather than by a lengthy imprisonment. This explains why the term of imprisonment has remained unchanged since 1974. The maximum term of imprisonment should only be reserved for the worst possible examples of the offence likely to be encountered, for instance where large numbers of immigrants are being smuggled into the country. In this case, Jumhan was not a case. He was not involved in a large-scale syndicate operation and the amounts involved were not so large as to suggest that there was exploitation of the illegal immigrants on a substantial scale. The sentence imposed on him of two years` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on each charge was appropriate and not unduly lenient.
 15.In the premises, I exercised my powers of revision and sentenced the respondents as follows. In respect of the respondent in Criminal Revision 13/98, he was to serve two years` imprisonment on each of the six charges, namely DAC 6199/98, and DAC 6968/98 to 6972/98, and the sentence of four strokes of the cane imposed on each charge was to remain. The terms of imprisonment on the charges DAC 67199/98 and DAC 6968/98 were to run consecutively, and the terms of imprisonment on the remaining charges were to run concurrently. The total sentence was therefore four years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. In respect of the respondent in Criminal Revision 14/98, his sentence was reduced to two years` imprisonment on each of the six charges, namely DAC 6202/98, and DAC 6978/98 to 6981/98 and the sentence of three strokes of the cane imposed on each charge was to remain. The terms of imprisonment for the charges DAC 6202/98 and DAC 6978/98 were to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore four years` imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.",1998-08-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The original criminal revision, which arose on the application of the trial judge in the court below as a result of his omission to impose a mandatory disqualification on the three convictions of the respondent under s 379A of the Penal Code (Cap 224), was scheduled for hearing on 3 March 1998. The respondent had pleaded guilty to the charges in the court below. Before the hearing, I adjourned the revision for further submissions. On 2 April 1998, I heard the revision. During the hearing, counsel for the respondent raised several new matters which the prosecution was unable to address. As a result, I further adjourned the revision for written submissions and replies on those same matters. On 19 May 1998, I heard both the DPP and counsel for the respondent again. I allowed the prosecution`s appeal for criminal revision and imposed a disqualification of seven years on each of the convictions under s 379A which the respondent faced. I now give my reasons. In addition, I deal with the issues raised by counsel for the respondent.
 2.
 The facts
The facts from which this revision arose could not have been simpler. The respondent was a 17 year old male. Sometime in the early morning of 8 September 1997, he was spotted by the owner of a van trying to break into his van. Consequently, the police were alerted and arrested the respondent just as he was about to leave the scene of the crime.
 3.After his arrest, the respondent admitted to his crime as well as to stealing three motorcycles on three other previous occasions. On each of these occasion, he used his house key to start the motorcycle and after riding the motorcycle to his destination, he abandoned it.
 4.Further investigations by the police then revealed that he had committed several sexual offences with an underaged girl. The prosecution therefore brought a total of six charges against him, one of stealing from the said van under s 379 of the Penal Code, three of stealing motorcycles under s 379A of the Penal Code, and two of having carnal intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 under s 140(1)(i) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353).
 5.The respondent pleaded guilty to all the charges. In addition, 13 other charges under s 379A and two other charges under s 379, read with s 511, of the Penal Code were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to reformative training. However, the trial judge failed to pass the manadatory disqualification order on the respondent required under s 379A(2) of the Penal Code. This led to the present criminal revision under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
 6.
 The criminal revision
When this revision was originally set for hearing, I had some doubts as to the number of disqualification terms which a court could impose on the respondent, or the length each of these disqualification terms ought to be, especially since the respondent was convicted of three counts of stealing motor vehicles under s 379A of the Penal Code. Both parties to the revision did not provide full submissions on this point. The general impression which I formed, upon a literal reading of s 379A(2), was that each conviction attracted a mandatory term of disqualification, since under s 379A(2), the imposition of a disqualification term for an offence under that section started with the phrase `a person convicted of 
 an 
 offence under this section ` (emphasis added). On this basis, prima facie the respondent was liable to three disqualification terms, one for each of his convictions. As to the length of the disqualification terms, s 379A(2) only provided a general guide that it should be a minimum of three years in the absence of any good reasons.
 7.There was also the question of whether the disqualification terms ought to run consecutively or concurrently with each other as, unlike the principles governing sentences under s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code, no such similar guidance was given within the same Act or other related legislation. I made it very clear in my previous case of 
PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 186
  that, for purposes of s 13 and s 379A of the Criminal Procedure Code applied together, a disqualification order was not a sentence within the Criminal Procedure Code. For those who need any reminder, s 13 was the section governing reformative training. 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
, if one recalled, was a case where two teenagers were sentenced, one to probation and the other to reformative training, after convictions under s 379A of the Penal Code. The trial judge also disqualified them for a period of five years each. Consequently, concerns were expressed as to the legality of the disqualification orders. As a result, a criminal revision was brought to determine whether it was appropriate to impose disqualification on offenders who had been sentenced to either probation or reformative training.
 8.At the hearing, I accepted the prosecution`s admission, in view of s 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252), that the disqualification imposed on the teenager who was sentenced to probation was wrong in law. However, I went on and held that there was nothing incorrect with the disqualification imposed on the teenager who was sentenced to reformative training. I came to the conclusion that a disqualification, although at times referred to as a sentence (at [para ] 14), was not a sentence within the context of s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The part of my judgment which stated this was from [para ] 22 to 24: 
22 A more fruitful approach would be to examine the purpose and intent of s 13. That section is triggered whenever an offender is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment; in such a situation, reformative training may be imposed in lieu of another sentence. In such a context, while the section is not expressly limited to be in lieu of sentences of imprisonment, as is s 12 CPC (which deals with corrective training and preventive detention), it does indicate that the purpose of reformative training is to take the place of such imprisonment. In character, reformative training is a form of incarceration or deprivation of liberty. It corresponds to imprisonment. The substitution of reformative training for imprisonment is thus understandable for it would otherwise render the offender liable to double punishment of the same type. Whether a fine may be imposed together with reformative training is not in issue in the present case, but this court is, as presently advised, inclined to the view that that is permissible. Section 13 should therefore be read such that reformative training is to be in lieu of imprisonment only. On this purposive approach, the imposition of a disqualification order alongside a sentence of reformative training is correct at law. 
23 It may be contended though that, if there is an ambiguity in s 13, the court should not interpret it in a way that is prejudicial to the offender. This contention could perhaps be made by relying on the principle against doubtful penalisation: see s 271, Francis Bennion, 
 Statutory Interpretation 
 (2nd Ed, 1992). On this argument, s 13 should be interpreted in such a way that it causes the least prejudice to the offender by precluding disqualification. This court is of the view that the principle is not an obstacle to the interpretation adopted here. There are two related bases for the principle against doubtful penalisation: the predictability of the law, and that, in the common law world, everything that is not forbidden is permitted. In essence, the hypothetical citizen who knows all the legal rules should be in a position to order his actions without fear that he is unwittingly breaking the law. Here, the purpose of s 13 is manifestly clear. In any event, this court is not convinced that the principle against doubtful penalisation has any application where the court is construing provisions of sanction; by the time such provisions have to be construed, the offence would already have been committed. The hypothetical citizen in ordering his affairs would have been concerned solely with determining whether his actions constitute an offence or not; the punishment that he would be liable for if he was committing an offence would have been irrelevant in his considerations. Those who order their affairs by a process of calculating the punishment that they would be liable for if they were to take a particular course of action do not deserve the sympathy of the courts. 
24 
 For these reasons, I am of the view that a disqualification order is not a sentence for the purposes of s 13, and the court is not precluded from imposing both reformative training and disqualification orders by virtue of the wording of s 13 itself 
. [Emphasis added.]
 9.Returning back to the appeal proper, I therefore directed that both parties submit their arguments on the abovestated issues I set out (see [para ] 6 and 7 above). I also directed that they should submit on the question of when the disqualification order should start to run for the respondent, since there was a suggestion that it ought to run from the date of his conviction, while he was still serving his punishment at reformative training, despite the fact that I had rejected this argument in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
.
 10.Neither parties disputed my reading of s 379A(2) that each conviction under the section attracted a disqualification term. Section 379A, for convenient reference (and I set out only the relevant parts), reads: 
397A (1) Whoever commits theft of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. 
(2) A person convicted of an offence under this section shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification, be disqualified for a period of not less than 3 years from the date of his release from imprisonment from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act. 
 
 11.Counsel on both sides agreed that, on a plain reading of s 379A(2), there was to be imposed a disqualification term per conviction. Otherwise, it would go against the very wording of s 379A(2) as well as the concept of punishment for offenders for their crimes, which was one punishment one crime unless otherwise statutorily legislated. On that basis, I answered my first question that the respondent ought to be given three disqualification terms for his three convictions. It might seem trivial to some that I had brought up this issue, but I took the view that I should settle the working and application of s 379A once and for all, since, despite this being a relatively new section, it has been more commonly relied upon in recent times.
 12.The next concern which I addressed was when the disqualification term imposed, or terms in cases of multiple convictions, should start running once it was imposed. There were a few English authorities on disqualification (see 
 R 
 
v Bain
 
[1973] RTR 213
 at p 215; 
R v Higgins
 
[1973] RTR 216
; 
R v Meese
 
[1973] 2 All ER 1103
), none of which were considered in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
, which suggested that they should run from the date of conviction. In 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
, I expressed the opinion that it should run from the time the offender was released from his prison, or from the period of incarceration, in order that the disqualification achieved maximum effect. The prosecution`s contentions on this issue which I accepted at [para ] 25 to 28 of the judgment was this (at [para ] 7): 
That purpose [of disqualification under s 379A(2)] was to provide for heavier penalties against theft of motor vehicles: 44 
 Parliamentary Debates
 col 1862, 1869, 1878 (1984). Those who commit such offences invariably drive on the roads without adequate insurance coverage, endangering others. The disqualification would have to run after the period of incarceration to ensure that it is not rendered ineffective because it ceases before the offender is released from prison.
 13.My views were reinforced by the prosecution`s concession on this issue, which I think was right. Under s 379A(2), it was expressly stated that the disqualification was to take effect `from the date of [the offender`s] release from imprisonment`. I found this a clear and unambiguous pronouncement on this issue.
 14.In fact, from [para ] 25 to 28 in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul 
, I clarified several matters pertaining to this issue, in particular the conciliation in what appeared to be inconsistent subsections under ss 379A(1) and (2). I found it useful to repeat what I had stated there: 
25 But that is not the end of the matter. Even if disqualification orders are not precluded by reformative training sentences imposed under s 13, the operation of s 379A(2) has to be considered. That subsection raises another possible bar against the imposition of a disqualification order concurrently with reformative training: it stipulates that the disqualification order is to commence at the point when the offender is released from his imprisonment. The district judge was concerned that this meant, firstly, that disqualification can only be ordered when a sentence of imprisonment is passed, and that otherwise there can be no ascertainment of the commencement of the period of disqualification. 
26 At first glance, the use of the term `imprisonment` in both sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 379A would lead one to the conclusion that it must be used in the same sense. While this would be the normal approach to take, it cannot lead to an absurd interpretation. If the sense of `imprisonment` in sub-s (1) were allowed to control the meaning in sub-s (2), as the DPP points out, the court would be precluded from ordering disqualification except where the offender is sentenced to prison; those given reformative or corrective training, or preventive detention orders could not be disqualified. This is manifestly absurd, particularly as the period of preventive detention in particular could be far longer than that of imprisonment. 
27 The DPP contends that the reference to `imprisonment` in sub-s (2) is only to ensure that disqualification is not rendered a nullity by overlapping with the period of imprisonment. Once that objective is recognised, nothing stands in the way of interpreting the reference to `imprisonment` as one to either any form of detention or of remand. I am in agreement with that submission. 
28 This interpretation ignores the literal reading of the words used in the statutory provision. But any departure from such literal readings is justified where the result would otherwise be absurd. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) reads:
 
`In the interpretation of a provision of written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.`
 
That section was used in 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 . In that case, the Court of Appeal had to consider the meaning of the phrase `having reference to the charge` as used in s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). Faced with a choice between a strict, literal approach, and one that promoted the object of s 24, the court, utilising s 9A, opted for the latter. And so here. Where some other form of remand or detention is ordered, s 379A(2) should be read to require that the disqualification order should commence after that period of remand or detention.
 15.Upon considered reflection, there was nothing erroneous with what I stated and I adopted them in toto for the purposes of this revision. In this regard, I should also mention that the English cases which were referred to me on this issue were inapplicable. They were based on a completely different legislative intent and by s 379A(2), disqualification in Singapore was not intended to be the same as that in England.
 16.I then addressed what I thought was a grey area in the application of s 379A(2). Having come to the conclusion that three terms of disqualification ought to be given for the respondent`s three convictions, there arose the issue of the treatment of these three disqualification terms together. As I mentioned earlier, unlike the situation with sentences, where it was provided under s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code that for cases of three or more sentences two of those sentences shall run consecutively, there was no such equivalent provision which provided for disqualification terms. Likewise, no guidance could be obtained from the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). How should one treat multiple disqualification terms then?
 17.The prosecution urged me to take a literal reading of s 379A(2), and conceded that multiple disqualification terms could only run concurrently, and not consecutively. They derived this from the fact that s 379A(2) expressly stated that there should be a disqualification for each single offence and that such a disqualification must run from the offender`s release from incarceration. In such a situation, the overall effect of multiple disqualifications under s 379A(2) was that they should all run from the date of the offender`s release from imprisonment. The result was that the disqualification terms had to run concurrently.
 18.The prosecution thereafter referred to the English position which appeared to be consistent with this view. Under English law, the previous provision which governed disqualification was s 93 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 before it was repealed by s 19 of the Transport Act 1981 and subsequently by the penalty points disqualification under s 35 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. Insofar as the courts` application of the law was concerned, they took the view that a period of disqualification ran concurrently with any other period of disqualification ordered by the same court at the same hearing or by the same or another court on a previous occasion unless the `totting-up` provisions of ss 93(3) and 93(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1972 applied. The `totting-up` provisions referred to specific legislation which gave courts the powers to impose consecutive disqualifications. As a result, the courts generally accepted that unless expressly provided for by legislation, there was no authority upon them to impose consecutive disqualification terms.
 19.In the English Court of Appeal decision in
 R v Meese 
, Bean J, delivering the judgement of the court, held (at p 1104c): 
Disqualification starts to run as soon as it is ordered, save where section 5 (5) of the Road Traffic Act 1962, now replaced by section 93(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1972, applies. 
 Thus, except where the `totting-up` procedure under s 93(3) of the Act of 1972 (formerly s 5(3) of the Act of 1962) applies, disqualifications run concurrently both with those ordered by the same court at the same hearing and with those previously ordered by the same or another court on another occasion
. In 1969, when the orders being considered were made, the position under s 5(5) of the Act of 1962 was that a consecutive period of disqualification could also be ordered on conviction for driving while disqualified - but that provision was repealed by s 1 of the Road Traffic (Disqualification) Act 1970. 
Apart from the exceptions referred to, there was no power to make a sentence of disqualification consecutive on another period of disqualification: see R v Higgins (Note)
 
[1973] RTR 216
. The two offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty, namely, causing death by dangerous driving contrary to section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 and driving a motor car with excess alcohol in his blood contrary to s 1 of the Road Safety Act 1967, did not fall within the exceptions under s 5(5) of the Act of 1962. 
It follows that consecutive orders of disqualification could not be imposed, there being no power, apart from statutory authority, to make a sentence of disqualification consecutive with another period of disqualification: see R v Graham
 
[1955] Crim LR 319
, 
R v Johnson
 (Unreported) , CA and 
R v Bain
 
[1973] RTR 213
. [Emphasis added.]
 20.In this case, Meese pleaded guilty to two offences, one of causing death by dangerous driving contrary to s 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 and another to driving with a blood-alcohol proportion above the prescribed limit contrary to s 1 of the Road Safety Act 1967. Both offences allowed for disqualification. In the court of first instance, the trial judge sentenced him to nine months` imprisonment concurrent on each count and disqualified him for two and a half years consecutive on each count, making it in total five years disqualification in all. On appeal, the Court of Appeal quashed the order on consecutive disqualification for the abovestated reason, and substituted it with a concurrent one.
 21.Similarly, in the case of 
 R v Bain, 
 Cantley J held, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal based on the Road Traffic Act 1962 (at [para ] 215F): 
Under s 5(5) of the Road Traffic Act 1962 there was formerly power to make a period of disqualification consecutive where it was imposed under what is called the `totting up` procedure in s 5(3), or where it was imposed for an offence of driving while disqualified. 
 But there was no other statutory authority for making a period of disqualification consecutive, and it has been laid down on a number of occasions by this court that there is no power apart from statutory authority to make a sentence of disqualification consecutive to another period of disqualification
; the sentence of disqualification must run from the date of conviction. It is sufficient to recite the authorities for that proposition; they are 
R v Graham
 
[1955] Crim LR 319
; 
Taylor v Kenyon
 
[1952] 2 All ER 726
; 
R v Phillips
 
[1955] 1 WLR 1103
, and 
R v Higgins (Note)
 
[1973] RTR 216
 to the same effect. It is absolutely clear that, except in the cases referred to in s 5(5) of the Act of 1962, disqualifications must date from the date of conviction. [Emphasis added.]
 22.This was a case where the accused, while under a period of disqualification expiring on 23 September 1973, committed three separate offences of driving while disqualified, taking a conveyance without authority and causing death by dangerous driving on the same day of 29 January 1972. He was sentenced to consecutive periods of imprisonment of four years in total. In addition, he was disqualified for twelve months to run consecutively after the current disqualification term which he was subject to expired. On appeal, the court quashed the consecutive disqualification order and replaced it with a concurrent order.
 23.While I accepted that the position in England supported the view that multiple disqualifications could only be concurrent, I found them inapplicable in the context of s 379A(2), which governed the position in Singapore. If one examined the English cases cited clearly, they were governed solely by specific UK legislation. The thinking behind those cases was that since Parliament expressly legislated for the treatment of consecutive disqualification terms in specific instances, therefore in all other cases, the legislature being silent on that point, disqualifications must be implied to be concurrent (see also 
R v Johnson
 
[1973] RTR 403
 and 
R v Kent
 
[1983] 2 WLR 794
). However, the position in Singapore was quite the opposite and based on a completely different Parliamentary intent. To follow the English position blindly would result in reading their legislature`s intention into our law, which was based on totally different considerations.
 24.That brought me to the question of what the Singapore position should be. I formed the view, having regard to the wording of s 379A(2) and Parliament`s intention when enacting this section, that multiple disqualification terms imposed could only be concurrent. The reason for this, as the prosecution argued, was simple. Each period of disqualification, regardless of how many periods in total there were and for how long each of these periods was, had to start from `the date of [the offender`s] release from imprisonment`. On this reading, there was no scope for arguing that multiple disqualification terms could be consecutive, because those terms which started later would 
 not 
 be from the date of release of the offender`s incarceration. Of course the effect of this conclusion was the same as that of the English position, but it was arrived at using a different approach, and with respect the English authorities were unhelpful and inapplicable.
 25.In view of what I set out above, I allowed the criminal revision and imposed three disqualification terms of seven years each, all to run concurrently and to take effect after the respondent`s release from reformative training. The disqualification served, as Parliament intended, as additional punishment for the multiple crimes which the respondent committed. I found a seven year disqualification for each offence under s 379A(1) justified, having taken into account the fact that the respondent, a young boy barely 18 years of age, committed numerous offences, many of those involving theft of motor vehicles. A three year minimum disqualification, suggested as a benchmark under s 379A(2), was wholly inadequate in the present case. The respondent was a habitual offender who seemed unrepentant of his crimes, judging from the various offences which he committed one after another. His actions could not be condoned. This punishment given out should also serve as a warning to all potential young offenders who think that stealing motor vehicles is not a serious offence which neither the law enforcement agencies nor the courts take seriously.
 26.Finally, I deal with the issues raised by counsel for the respondent which, though not all relating directly to the criminal revision, were nevertheless important in the context of the application of s 379A. Counsel urged me to reject my own decision in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 that reformative training was `in lieu of imprisonment only` (see [para ] 22 of the judgment) and to take the broad view that reformative training under s 13 (of the Criminal Procedure Code) included not only imprisonment, but also caning, fine and disqualification as well. He sought to derive support from a previous. decision of mine in 
Ng Kwok Fai v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 568
  where I allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of imprisonment and caning with an order of reformative training. In the course of the judgment, I made the following observation which counsel relied heavily on (at p 310): 
It seems quite apparent that a lengthy prison term after the appellant is released from reformative training would run counter to the aim of reformative training, as it could well undo what the reformative training is meant to do. 
 The same is even more true of caning
. In addition, it would be unfair to the appellant as the prospect of caning would hang heavily on his mind during the entire period of reformative training. The prospect of a lengthy prison term after release would be detrimental to reformative training. For this reason, I was of the view that the sentence was inappropriate [Emphasis added.]
 27.
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
 was not cited or considered in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
. In 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
, which was an appeal against sentence only, the appellant was sentenced to undergo reformative training together with an imprisonment term of 18 months and six strokes of the cane, the latter of which was to commence after the reformative training had finished. I took the view that such a combination of sentences was inappropriate as it ran counter to the view that the appellant could be reformed through reformative training. Sending the appellant subsequently to imprisonment and caning defeated the whole purpose of reformative training which the appellant would undergo first, since it `would undo whatever value was obtained from the [reformative training]`. As a result, I held (at p 312): 
However, in view of the appellant`s youth, I was minded to give him one last chance at reform. In the circumstances, I substituted an order for reformative training under s 13 of the CPC for the 18 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the offence for which he had been given probation. As consecutive terms of reformative training are not desirable, I ordered the second reformative training sentence to commence on the same date as the first. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.
 28.Counsel for the respondent argued that based on 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
, which appeared inconsistent with 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
, there was clear authority that reformative training under s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code was meant to cover imprisonment 
 and 
 caning and, by analogy, any other punishments given out, including fines and disqualifications as well.
 29.Further, he referred to s 12 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provided that corrective training and preventative detention were to be `in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment`. The fact that such a phrase was missing in s 13 (s 13 only provided for reformative training `in lieu of any other sentence`) necessarily indicated that the ambit which reformative training under s 13 was meant to cover was wider than that of s 12. Accordingly, whilst corrective training and preventative detention in s 12 did not cover caning, fines and disqualifications, there was no such restriction for reformative training.
 30.Finally, counsel contended that s 13 was enacted, from the relevant Parliamentary Debates, with two objectives in mind. First, that reformative training was for the reformation of the offender and, secondly, that it was not to be regarded as a prison. Hence, to sentence an offender, in this case the respondent, to reformative training and at the same time maintaining that he was still liable for other sentences (other than imprisonment) for the offence that he was charged and convicted, would be detrimental to reformative training and contrary to the express intention of Parliament.
 31.In dealing with counsel for the respondent`s submissions, I was of the opinion that I had already settled in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
that disqualification under s 379A(2) (of the Penal Code) was not a sentence for the purposes of s 13 (of the Criminal Procedure Code). On this basis, there was no restriction in law which prevented a disqualification from being imposed with reformative training. Counsel for the respondent could not show me that I had erred on this in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
, save for repeating what I had already rejected in that case. Accordingly, there was no dispute that reformative training did not cover an order for disqualification under s 379A(2). This issue was well settled. As was clearly intended by Parliament when enacting s 379A(2), disqualification was 
 in addition 
 to any other punishment which the offender under the subsection received. It was not 
 in substitution 
 for any punishment which the offender otherwise received. In the present case, the disqualification terms were to prevent the respondent from committing any further offences of the same nature in the future. This was quite apart from the fact that he had already been sentenced to reformative training. To hold otherwise led to an absurdity in that orders by the court, be it disqualification or compensation orders, were precluded once reformative training under s 13 was invoked. I found it a gross injustice that a victim of an offence could not be awarded, for example, compensation should the court decide that the offender deserved reformation rather than imprisonment. In any event, as I stated, Parliament was entitled to attach additional forms of penalisation for crimes which offenders committed and s 379A(2) was an example of such additional penalisation.
 32.However, my answer in the preceding paragraph failed to answer the question of whether s 13 covered not only imprisonment but also caning or fines. There was no dispute that both caning and fines were construed as different forms of sentences under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (see ss 224 and 227). At first sight, there therefore appeared to be some inconsistency in the two decisions of 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 and 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
. On the one hand, the former case held that reformative training substituted only a term of imprisonment (see [para ] 26 above), but on the other hand, the latter case seemed to take a much wider approach than that.
 33.Accordingly, I reviewed both cases and came to the opinion that there was nothing inherently contradictory with my reasoning and decision in both cases. Let me explain. Insofar as my decision in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 was to the effect that reformative training was to be in lieu of imprisonment
 only 
, that statement was made in the context of the case itself alone. It was not to be construed as a general statement. In other words, I meant in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 only that reformative training was to be in lieu of imprisonment, since that was all that I had to consider in that case. It could well be that in other cases (for example in 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
), imprisonment and other sentences could be substituted by reformative training only. Accordingly, I would like to point out that my decision in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 that reformative training was to be in lieu of imprisonment 
 only 
 should be restricted solely to the facts of that case.
 34.That brought me to what I thought was the correct position in law in this area of the law. For convenient reference, it was necessary to set out s 13(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the principal subsection governing reformative training. Section 13(1) read: 
Where a male person is convicted by the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment, then if on the day of his conviction he is not less than 16 but under 21 years of age, and the Court is satisfied having regard to his character and previous conduct, and to the circumstances of the offence, that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may, 
 in lieu of any other sentence
, pass a sentence of reformative training. [Emphasis added.]
 35.In general, the application of this section had been quite straightforward. The difficulty came in the italicised phrase. The question which one had to answer was: what in effect was reformative training meant to be in lieu of? Asked another way, what was reformative training meant to substitute? A prima facie reading of the phrase gave the impression that if an offender was sentenced to several punishments, reformative training could only substitute one of those punishments.
 36.In 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
, I formed the view that it was meant to substitute both imprisonment and caning. Having had considerable thought on this matter, I was of the opinion that I was right. In my judgment, the term `sentence` in the phrase `in lieu of any other sentence` could be read either as a singular or plural term. In other words, the term `sentence` included not only imprisonment but also other forms of sentences including fines or caning. Reformative training could substitute imprisonment, caning and/or fine or any such combination which a sentencing court thought fit. I arrived at this conclusion using a purposive approach in construing s 13(1). With such an approach, relying on s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1), a trial court had the discretion to use reformative training and substitute any of the punishments which an offender received.
 37.One could of course argue that since the term `sentence` was used in its singular form, consequently it was only meant to substitute only one of the punishments which an offender otherwise received for a crime. I found this an argument wholly without any merit. If one ascribed to that view, then taking the facts in 
 Ng Kwok Fai v PP 
 as an example, the appellant would receive reformative training with caning, or imprisonment with reformative training. Such a combination of sentences, if one had any common sense, was wholly inappropriate. Caning and imprisonment were 
 retributive 
 in purpose, and inconsistent with the purpose of reformative training, which was 
 rehabilitative 
. Therefore, if one took the view which I have set out above, a sentencing court would then have at its discretion what reformative training was meant to substitute. However, as a matter of pure practicality, balancing the rationale behind imprisonment and caning which were retributive, reformative training should at its bare minimum substitute both forms, if any, of punishment if s 13 was invoked.
 38.Having said that, the above views may not necessarily be applicable to a situation where fines are also imposed together with imprisonment and/or caning. Fines are imposed for a variety of reasons, some of which are meant to be compensatory. If so, there is no reason why they cannot be imposed together with reformative training. I was not referred to any case to the contrary, nor did I manage to find one to that effect. In that circumstance, I was prepared to stand by my preliminary view in 
 PP v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman 
 that fines could, and where appropriate should, be imposed with reformative training, and s 13 did not prevent such a combination from being meted out.
 39.For the reasons abovestated, I allowed the criminal revision.",1998-08-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This is an appeal against the decision of Rubin J convicting the first and second appellants of the charges they stood accused of. Briefly stated, the charge against the first appellant was for delivering ten packets of drugs containing not less than 290.4g of diamorphine to the second appellant at about 7.55pm on 9 June 1997, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1997 Ed) (the Act) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. The charge against the second appellant was for having the drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Act and punishable under s 33 of the Act.
 2.
 The brief facts
The facts leading up to the arrest of the appellants for their offences were quite straightforward. On 9 June 1997, Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers kept surveillance at various locations near the car park in front of Block 603 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 as well as along the nearby Serenade Walk to observe the movements of the second appellant from about 2pm.
 3.At about 7.50pm, the second appellant emerged from a flat on the seventh level in the block and was seen descending the staircase to the car park below. He was later observed close to a red Malaysian motor vehicle (identified subsequently as bearing registration No JDW 4231). At about 7.55pm, the Malaysian vehicle left the car park and the second appellant was seen carrying a dark coloured bag and returning to the flat on the seventh level via the staircase.
 4.Meanwhile, another team of CNB officers trailed the Malaysian vehicle along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Yio Chu Kang Road and thence to Mandai Road. At Mandai Road, the driver of the vehicle (later identified as the first appellant) alighted to make a telephone call at a public telephone booth. He was arrested.
 5.Whilst the arrest of the first appellant at Mandai Road was in train, the surveillance of the second appellant at Block 603 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 was also in full swing. At 9.10pm, CNB officers observed the second appellant leaving the flat at the seventh level and making his way down carrying a dark-coloured bag. Upon seeing the officers, the second appellant threw away the bag and tried to run away. He was arrested. Inside the bag hastily abandoned by the second appellant were the drugs specified in the charge.
 6.Both the appellants claimed trial to their respective charges.
 7.
 The defence
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the trial judge concluded that a case had been made out against both the first and second appellants. The first appellant elected to remain silent throughout the trial. He relied on the statements made to the CNB and called an expert witness to support his defence that he was a person of borderline intelligence and was an innocent courier. The prosecution called another expert witness to testify in rebuttal.
 8.The second appellant elected to give evidence from the witness box. He admitted that he collected the drugs from the first appellant but claimed that he did not know that the bag contained so much more heroin than he had been prepared to receive.
 9.The court rejected the defences of both of them and they were convicted on their respective charges and sentenced to suffer death.
 10.
 The appeal
The appellants appealed against the decision of the trial judge. For the sake of clarity, both the appellants` appeals will be taken separately, as counsel for both appellants raised quite separate and distinct issues in relation to each appellant.
 
 The first appellant`s appeal
(i) Expert evidence on the mental state of the first appellant
 11.The gist of the first appellant`s defence was that he was an innocent courier. As such, an expert witness was called by the defence (DW1) to give evidence on the mental state of the first appellant at the time of the offence. The crux of DW1`s evidence was that an IQ of 79 predisposed the first appellant to be `
 simple minded, nave of people`s motives, and shallow in critical thinking 
` and as a result `
 he followed instructions accordingly thinking all along that he was not transporting any illegal drugs 
`. The first appellant `
 did not feel suspicious all along that he was transporting illegal drugs to Singapore 
`.
 12.This defence was rejected by the trial judge. In our view, the learned trial judge was right in doing so. It has been held by the Court of Appeal in 
PP v Rozman bin Jusoh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 317
 , in dealing with the culpability of an accused person possessing an IQ of 72, at pp 328 and 329: 
low or subnormal intellect is not unsoundness of mind and is not a defence to a criminal charge, and an educationally subnormal person can be criminally culpable for his actions. `low intellect` and his disposition of being easily susceptible to manipulation by others is not a defence to a criminal charge. Nor can such low intellect and malleable disposition diminish or eradicate the presence of mens rea.
 13.Further, it can be seen that the first appellant had the ability to cope with every day living. The trial judge noted, for instance, that he possessed sufficient intelligence to have passed the Highway Code and obtained a Singapore driving licence. He was also able to hold down a job as a marble grinder, earning about $70 a day for the skills that he possessed. This led the trial judge to conclude that the first appellant `was capable of leading a normal life and deal with life`s routine responsibilities like any other ordinary man`.
 14.There was also the evidence of the prosecution`s rebuttal witness, PW 32, which contradicted DW 1`s evidence on three material points. Firstly, PW32 was of the opinion that neither a clinical psychologist like herself nor a general psychologist like DW1 was in a position to arrive at the conclusion that the first appellant did not feel suspicious all along that he was transporting illegal drugs to Singapore. Secondly, it was PW 32`s opinion that the first appellant would have known what he was doing and would have considered the outcomes of his behaviour before embarking on it. Thirdly, she found the first appellant to have an IQ of between 80 and 90 placing him in the `low average intelligence` bracket while DW1 had found the IQ to be 79 which placed him in the `borderline intelligence` bracket.
 15.In our opinion, the trial judge did not err in rejecting DW1`s evidence of the mental state of the first appellant at the time of the offence. The trial judge had noted that DW1 had acknowledged that the first appellant knew the value of money. Also, some of the answers provided by him when he was tested by DW1 seemed to suggest that he was quite capable of reason. For instance: 
Q: Why do some people prefer to borrow money from a bank rather than from a friend? 
A: We don`t have to owe people a favour like our relatives as opposed to a friend. 
Q: What should you do if while in the movies you are the first person to see smoke and fire? 
A: Immediately alert the movie attendant.
 16.Further, it is well established that expert opinion is only admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge. If, on the proven facts, a judge can form his own conclusions without help, the opinion of an expert is unnecessary: 
R v Turner
 
[1975] QB 834
. Thus, a psychiatrist`s evidence was held inadmissible where its purpose was, in effect, to tell a jury how an ordinary person, not suffering from any mental illness, was likely to react to the strains and stresses of life: 
R v Weightman
 
[1991] 92 Cr App R 291
. In 
R v Masih
 
[1986] Crim LR 395
, the court expressed the view that in the case of an IQ which, though low, was within the range of normality as understood by psychologists, the adducing of expert evidence was not justified.
 17.In the present case, the question was whether the first appellant knew or at least suspected that he was carrying drugs. This could only be inferred from the surrounding circumstances by the trier of fact, and was a matter entirely within the trial judge`s purview. A chief and justified concern of the courts is that the fact-finding process should not be surrendered to professionals such as psychiatrists, but should remain the province of the courts. As such, we were of the view that the trial judge was entitled to reject the evidence of DW1 and to come to his own conclusions from the surrounding circumstances.
 (ii) First appellant`s defence that he had no knowledge of the contents inside the bag
 18.The first appellant did not dispute that he had possession of the bag, that drugs had been found inside the bag and that he had delivered the bag to the second appellant. As a result, the presumption in s 18(2) of Act operated and he was presumed to know the nature of the drugs which he delivered to the second appellant. Hence, the burden lay on him to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.
 19.In the case of 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
, Lord Pearce observed at p 307: 
A man who accepts possession of a parcel normally accepts possession of the contents.
 
But that inference can be disproved or shaken by evidence that, although a man was in possession of a parcel, he was completely mistaken as to its contents and would not have accepted possession had he known what kind of thing the contents were. A mistake as to the qualities of the contents, however, does not negative possession
 20.Ignorance can only be a defence where there was no reason for suspicion. In the circumstances, the first appellant should have been alerted to the fact that he was carrying something illegal. He was being given a substantial sum of money just to deliver a bag to someone in Singapore. As such, his failure to inspect the contents of the bag when he received them or at any time until the bag was delivered to the second appellant amounted to wilful blindness to the obvious truth of the matter: 
PP v Hla Win
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
 .
 21.Further, he was instructed to leave his car unlocked in the carpark and to go away for sometime. When he returned, a bag had been left in his car. The circumstances of his receipt of the bag were so suspect that any reasonable man would have taken steps to ascertain its contents. His failure to do so led to the irresistible inference that he knew all along that the bag contained drugs: 
Teoh Kah Lin v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 213
 .
 (iii) Adverse inference against the first appellant for his failure to testify
 22.The trial judge found that the circumstances under which the first appellant was made to transport the drugs from Johor Bahru to Singapore called for an explanation. He found that the first appellant`s failure to take the witness stand, purportedly on account of some fear that he might be subjected to cross-examination resulting thus in confused answers, tended to undermine his defence substantially.
 23.The trial judge also found that the burden upon the first appellant to show why he did not suspect that the bag contained drugs was not discharged merely by the evidence of DW1 that he was of low intellect. In view of the surrounding circumstances, it was imperative and vital that he provide an explanation.
 24.In 
Van Damme Johannes v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 246
 , the appellant raised the defence that he was an innocent courier and had not known about the drugs concealed in the suitcase. The court observed that the circumstances of the drug transaction were such as to have raised the suspicions of the appellant, making the task of rebutting the presumption on a balance of probabilities extremely difficult.
 25.In the present case, where the first appellant remained silent, the above observation should apply with even greater force. From his silence, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that he had failed to rebut the presumption: 
Loo Koon Seng v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 57
 . The trial judge had found that the circumstances surrounding his delivery of the bag to the second appellant were suspicious and warranted his checking of the contents of the bag. Since he failed to do so, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that he had failed to rebut the presumption.
 26.As such, on the facts of the case, we were of the view that the first appellant`s appeal should be dismissed, and it was dismissed.
 27.
 The second appellant`s appeal
The second appellant admitted that he delivered drugs for one `Ah Joe` and that `Ah Joe` had told him to accept delivery of a consignment of drugs on the day in question from another person. He thus accepted delivery of the bag from the first appellant knowing that it contained drugs. Thus, it was evident that the second appellant clearly had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.
 28.The second appellant`s defence was that he did not know that the bag contained more than half a pound of heroin. This seemed a little far fetched considering that the bag actually contained several times the weight which he claimed that he was expecting to receive. Further, after collecting the bag, he had gone back to his flat and kept the bag in his custody for an hour and ten minutes. There was more than enough time and opportunity for him to examine the contents of the bag.
 29.Further, this defence was only raised at trial. He failed to mention that he thought that the bag contained only half a pound of heroin. For instance, in the statement recorded under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) by Insp Chow on 11 June 1997 at about 3.25pm, he admitted that he `was aware that the plastic bag contained a large amount of heroin`. He also said that he `could feel of (sic) the weight of the plastic bag. I guessed the bag contained at least five ""liap"" in it.` He later claimed that he had used the term liap although he had never known it before his arrest. However, he said that it meant either 1 kg or 1 pound. The trial judge disbelieved the second appellant`s claim that he had not said this sentence. He also accepted the evidence of Insp Chow that in the drug world liap meant `one pound of heroin`.
 30.In 
Thongbai Naklangdon v PP
 
[1996] 1 CLAS News 235
, the Chief Justice ruled: 
The appellant failed to mention the incident with the deceased in any of his statements, including the s 122(6) cautioned statement. Given that this was part of an entire different narration of events from what was contained in the statements the judicial commissioner would have been justified in drawing an adverse inference under s 123(1) from his failure to mention this matter
 The second appellant`s failure to mention a material part of his defence at an earlier stage meant that it was less likely to be believed. As such, the trial judge did not err in disbelieving the second appellant`s defence that he thought that the bag contained only half a pound of heroin.
 31.In our view, the appeal by the second appellant should also be dismissed, and it was dismissed.",1998-08-24 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LP THEAN JA
 
Cur Adv Vult
(delivering the judgment of the court): Before Warren LH Khoo J there were five actions for libel. Three of these were brought by the Central Christian Church (`CCC`) against the following persons respectively: (i) the editor, publisher and printer of the 
 Impact 
 magazine in respect of the publication of an article in the issue of the magazine for October/November 1991; (ii) the editor and publisher of 
 The New Paper 
 in respect of the publication of an article in the newspaper on 23 November 1991; and (iii) the editor and publisher of 
 Lianhe Wanbao 
 in respect of the publication of a similar article in the newspaper on 23 November 1991. The other two actions were brought by John Philip Louis (`JL`) against (i) the editor, publisher and printer of the 
 Impact 
 magazine, and (ii) the editor and publisher of TNP respectively, in respect of the same publications. All the five actions were heard together before the learned judge and were dealt with together.
 2.Arising from his decision six appeals have been brought. As all the appeals are interrelated, they were heard together and will be dealt with in this judgment. For convenience and easy reference, we shall refer to CCC as the plaintiffs, which expression, where the context so admits, includes JL. We shall refer to the editor, publisher and printer of the 
 Impact 
 collectively as `
 Impact 
`; the editor and publishers of 
 The New Paper 
 as `TNP`; and the editor and publishers of 
 Lianhe Wanbao 
 as Wanbao and, where appropriate, all the defendants in the five actions collectively as the defendants.
 3.
 Impact publication
The 
 Impact 
 magazine is published bi-monthly and is a religious publication associated with the main Protestant body of Christian faith in Singapore. In the Oct/Nov 1991 issue 
 Impact 
 published an article about two religious groups: the Army of God (`AOG`) and CCC. On the front cover of the magazine, there is a picture of a figure in red with a white hood and on the front of the figure are the words `HOLY BIBLE`. The figure is holding a shepherd`s crook with the tip bearing a cross and leading a couple of sheep. Next to it are, among others, the words `AOG & CCC - Are they Cults?`. Inside the magazine are, inter alia, three articles. The first is headed `Satan`s Wily Schemes` with a pair of hooded figures, one holding a lighted candle, appearing below the heading. On the third page of the same article is another hooded figure holding a lighted candle. Two pages on, there appears the second article with the heading in very bold print `AOG & CCC` in a specially shaded box, below which are the words `They`re Not What You Think`. In this article, there is a photograph of two hooded figures facing a young lady, against the background of an MRT station and the young lady is shown to be extending her hand to one of the hooded figures. The contents of this page and the next three pages concern only AOG. Immediately following this part of the article there appears another photograph of the two hooded figures and the young lady, and here the young lady is shown to be receiving something from the same hooded figure. Above the photograph are the three letters `CCC` and the ensuing content of this article concerns CCC. We shall call this part of the article as the `CCC article`. The CCC article covers substantially three pages. On the second page is a box containing a short article headed in bold print `Why People Join Cults`, and on the third page there appears the same pictorial representation as that appearing on the cover but in much reduced size and in black and white. Two pages further on, there appears the third article, headed `Who Cares About Heresies Anyway?` with two hooded figures, each holding a lighted candle appearing at the end of the article.
 4.The plaintiffs complained that pictorial representation and the words `AOG & CCC - Are They Cults` appearing on the front cover of the magazine, the heading `AOG & CCC` and `They`re Not What You Think` in the second article and certain words in the CCC article are defamatory of them. We now quote below verbatim only those words in the CCC article which the plaintiffs complained were defamatory of them.
 5.The CCC article begins with the statement: `You may meet them at MRT stations, inviting you to their home meetings` and would be told that CCC are part of the Church of Christ and that they, CCC, do everything exactly as the Bible says. In the midst of this paragraph is the photograph of the two hooded figures talking to a young lady who is shown to be receiving something from one of them. The article then goes on to give an account of the history and origins of the CCC, and says: 
The Singapore group is led by `evangelist` John Luis [sic]. John was a Malaysian who was studying in London. After his conversion in London, he was trained by the group. Later he was sent to start the work in Singapore.
 6.Below these words are the heading `What CCC Believes` and a sub-heading `Their Special Calling` and following that the article lists the various statements of the beliefs, teachings and practices of CCC. Under the heading of `What CCC believes`, it says: 
1 
2 Other churches are not true congregations until they are `reconstructed`.
 and under the heading of `Their Teachings` the article says: 
1 The group teaches baptismal regeneration and practices rebaptism. Only those baptised by the group are truly baptised. 
2 The movement has a pyramid-type organisation, and expects total commitment to the leadership. One of their leaders was reported to have said: `Leadership is to be imitated, not evaluated`. 
3 Members are to confess their sins to one another. All sins including sinful thoughts are to be confessed. 
4 
5 Members are encouraged to leave their homes and live communally. Boyfriend and girlfriend relationships tend to be guided, if not determined by the group and its leaders.
 Immediately following is another section of the article under the heading: `Group Characteristics`, which asserts: 
 
4 Control is very tight. The disciple has to report to the discipler exactly how he spent his time and who he was with.
 7.Juxtaposed with the CCC article in the middle of the second page is a short article in a box entitled `Why People Join Cults` in which the author attempts to explain the reasons for cult membership. Essentially, the author`s view is that people join cults to satisfy certain `spiritual and psychological vacuums crying to be filled`. These needs, the author argues, are basically that of `Identity, Community and Significance`.
 8.The article then recounted the experiences of two former members of the group. Both of them told much the same story. They were both from more mainstream churches. They decided to convert to CCC members, as they were persuaded by the warmth, openness and sincerity of their members. However, they found that they could not reconcile their own beliefs with the group`s teachings, beliefs and doctrines. This was especially so in the area of baptism as well as the group`s assertion that theirs was the only true church. Both also revealed that they had experienced some emotional difficulty in leaving the group. The article ends with the following in a slightly bold print: 
Attempts to interview the leaders of both the Army of God and the Central Christian Church were not successful.
 9.The plaintiffs further complained that the heading of the second article bearing the words: `AOG & CCC` in bold prints and the words below: `They`re not what you think` and the two photographs with the two hooded figures and the young lady were defamatory of them. Finally, they complained that (i) the first article bearing the title: `Satan`s Wily Schemes` with the two hooded figures and the photograph on the next page with the hooded figure, and (ii) the third article bearing the title: `Who cares about HERESIES ANYWAY?` with the two hooded figures at the end, by reason of their juxtaposition with the CCC article, refer to them and are defamatory of them.
 10.The article in the 
 Impact 
 magazine was picked up by TNP and Wanbao and they each published an article concerning AOG and CCC in their respective issues on 23 November 1991. Only the words which the plaintiffs complained of are set out below verbatim.
 11.
 The New Paper publication
On the front page of TNP is the headline in 2-inch bold type `2 CULTS EXPOSED`, above which are the words in a quarter inch bold type `THE ARMY OF GOD` and `THE CENTRAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH` and below the headline appears the following statement: 
Christian groups warn of two new cults in Singapore. The Army of God and the Central Christian Church tend to `stretch the truth` and have `exclusive` practices, says one Reverend. One of them is known for practising war cries [aelig ] members are told to shout and not talk softly to the devil/ Page 11.
 All these took up more than half the space of the front page.
 12.Inside the newspaper at p 11 there appears the article with the title `Concern Over Two Cult Groups`. Next to it is a drawing of a man holding a mask with a book under his arm. He appears to be teaching a group of three persons. The man`s face exhibits a fierce expression while the mask that he holds out in front of him has a benign and kind countenance. The plaintiffs say that this drawing refers to CCC.
 13.The article starts with the following paragraphs: 
Two new Christian groups described as cult groups have sprung up in Singapore, say a few Christian organisations
 
The groups in question are the Army of God (AOG) and The Central Christian Church (CCC).
 It then goes on to state that TNP`s interviews with pastors from three mainstream churches confirmed the concern expressed in the two magazines, the 
 Impact 
 and 
 Methodist Messages 
. It quotes one reverend saying that he was concerned because of the AOG`s and CCC`s ideological differences with more established churches and the following: 
The AOG and CCC tend to `stretch the truth` and have `exclusive practices`. In addition `they imply that they are the TRUE believers and the other churches are not`.
 A few paragraphs further down, under the heading: `CCC TRAITS`, the article says: 
Tight control: A disciple must tell the group exactly how he spent his time and who he was with.
 Under the heading: `WHAT THE MAGAZINES SAY`, it reports the following in respect of CCC: 
[middot] Other churches are not true churches until they are `reconstructed`. 
[middot] The movement expects members to be wholly committed to the leadership. One of its leaders was reported to have said: `Leadership is to be imitated, not evaluated. 
[middot] Members are encouraged to be totally transparent with one another. Members have to confess their sins to each other, including sinful thoughts. 
[middot] Members are encouraged to leave their homes and live together in a group. Boyfriend and girlfriend relationships tend to be guided, if not set, by the group and its leaders.`
 14.In a box, in the middle of the page under the heading: `LEADERS OF THE CULTS`, is the following: 
LEADER OF CCC
 
 
John Luis, [sic] a Malaysian, was converted and trained by the group while he was studying in England. He was later sent to Singapore to start the group here said Impact.
 15.
 Wanbao publication
The Wanbao in their issue of 23 November 1991 contained an abbreviated version of what was published by TNP. A translated version of the article reads as follows: 
Two more religious cults have recently been discovered in Singapore. Local Christian churches have warned their members to be wary. The two cult organisations are the Army of God (AOG) and the Central Christian Church (CCC). Local Christian publications, 
 Impact
 and the 
 Methodist Messages
, have uncovered their existence and activities. Christian church sources in interviews have expressed worries about new cults engaging in harmful activities here.
 
One reverend said he was concerned because of the differences of the cults` beliefs from those of the more established churches. They always emphasise that they are the `true believers` and that others are not. They always regard themselves highly, they have extreme views and they reject others
 
These two cult organisations not only have an impact on some of the churches in Singapore; it is also possible that they have influence in some mission schools
 
According to reports, the new cults have these characteristics.
 
CCC:
 
[middot] Strict control. Members must disclose frankly who they are with, how they spend their time. 
[middot] Express with gusto. Show great zeal in prayer, no accompaniment of musical instruments in hymn singing.
 16.In respect of these publications CCC instituted three actions for libel against 
 Impact 
, TNP and Wanbao respectively. John Louis (`JL`) the leader of CCC who was referred to as the leader of the cult in the 
 Impact 
 magazine and the TNP newspaper instituted two separate actions against 
 Impact 
 and TNP respectively. The claims were resisted by the defendants and they raised three defences: (i) justification, (ii) fair comment on a matter of public interest, and (iii) qualified privilege.
 17.
 The decision below
Warren LH Khoo J held that the word `cult` is a pejorative term and that the references to CCC as a cult were defamatory of them. Turning to the defences he held that all the defendants failed in their defence of justification. As for fair comment, he held that all the defendants succeeded, except the headline appearing on the front page of the TNP publication. Regarding the defence of qualified privilege, he held that 
 Impact 
 succeeded, while TNP and Wanbao failed.
 18.
 The appeals
Against the decision of the learned judge CCC, JL, TNP and Wanbao have now appealed. Essentially CCC and JL appeal (in CA 248, 249, 250, 251 and 252 of 1997) against that part of the decision of the learned judge which decided the words complained of in the three publications were fair comment made on a matter of public interest and that the publication of the article in the 
 Impact 
 magazine was made on a privileged occasion. TNP and Wanbao appeal (in CA 247 of 1997) against that part of the decision of the learned judge which held that their defences of justification and qualified privilege failed.
 19.
 Meaning of the words
We turn first to the meaning of the words complained of. Although in their statements of claim the plaintiffs pleaded various alleged defamatory meanings of the words complained of, before us as it was before the learned judge, the meaning that they attributed to the words which they say are defamatory of them is that CCC are a cult and that JL is the leader of that cult. It is this meaning that the plaintiffs contend is the sting of the libel, and it is also this meaning that the defendants seek to justify. However, as the learned judge found and we agree entirely with him, the plaintiffs did not in their statements of claim plead the meaning of the word `cult` as understood by the ordinary reasonable reader. They ought to have pleaded such meaning and give particulars in support.
 20.In 
Allsop v Church of England Newspaper Ltd
 
[1972] 2 QB 161
, where the words complained of as defamatory of the plaintiff were that the plaintiff had `preoccupation with the bent`. It was held by the Court of Appeal in England that the plaintiff ought to give particulars as to the meaning of those words. Lord Denning MR said at p 168: 
In this case we have the words `pre-occupation with the bent.` What does the word `bent` mean in this context? It is not used in any of the ordinary meanings attributed to it. If you look at a dictionary you will not get any help. The word `bent` is there given in the sense of a person having a `bent` towards science or literature. That is not the meaning here. It is sometimes used as `bent,` meaning curved or crooked, like a `bent` stick. That is not the meaning here. Another meaning given by the dictionary to `bent` is a name given to a grass of a reedy habit. That does not fit either. No dictionary meaning fits into this sentence. `Bent` is used here as a piece of slang. It has no precise meaning. It has no meaning which is commonly understood. It may have acquired a particular meaning among some group or other of persons. But, if so, what is it? It may mean only something unusual, something out of the ordinary, or out of line - which would not be defamatory. It may mean something crooked or perverted in a sexual sense, or in a financial sense, or it may be an even worse sense - which would be defamatory. I do not know what meaning a jury would attribute to it. Each of them might have a different view.
 
Seeing that the words may be grossly defamatory, or only slightly defamatory, or not defamatory at all, I am clearly of opinion that the plaintiff should give particulars saying what is, or are, the meaning, or meanings, which he says that the words bear.
 21.The defendants in their pleadings relied on the definition of the word `cult` as found in 
 Longman`s Dictionary of Contemporary English 
: 
A group of people believing in a particular system of religious worship, with its special customs and ceremonies.
 and sought to set out the various characteristics of a `cult` as understood by them which justified their reference to CCC as a cult and JL as the leader of that cult.
 22.For completeness, we should also mention the following dictionary meanings. The 
 Shorter Oxford Dictionary 
 gives, inter alia, the following meanings of the word, cult: 
1 Worship; reverential homage rendered to a divine being. 
2 A system of religious worship, esp as expressed in ceremonies, ritual, etc.
 The 
 Webster`s New World Dictionary 
 (3rd College Ed) at p 337 gives the following meanings: 
(1) `a system of religious worship or ritual, 
(2) a quasi-religious group, often living in a colony, with a charismatic leader who indoctrinates members with unorthodox or extremist views, practices, or beliefs`.
 However, in this case, as in 
 Allsop 
`s case, the dictionary meanings of the word are of no assistance. What is in issue here is the meaning of the word `cult` in the context of the articles as understood by the ordinary reasonable man in Singapore.
 23.Defining the word `cult` is fraught with much difficulty because the word `cult` is such a value loaded word. What is a cult to a Christian may not be a cult to a Muslim; and indeed to an atheist, any religion could be a cult, because to someone who disbelieves in the existence of any God, worshipping a supernatural being and believing that that supernatural being is omniscient and omnipotent is or may be an `extreme doctrine and practice`. In this connection we agree with the observation of the learned judge at [para ] 25 of his judgment: 
unlike a word like `thief` or `murderer`, the word `cult` is not susceptible of one generally accepted meaning. A scholar might classify Christian or pseudo-Christian religious groups - in a sort of church-sect-cult continuum, and reserve the term `cult` to the extreme end of a scale of deviation from the mainstream. A person in an orthodox Christian faith might consider almost any group outside his religious orthodoxy as a cult. And then there are also the most notorious violent and destructive groups, such as the ones that led to the Jonestown and Waco tragedies. Probably everyone, Christian or not, would regard them as cults.
 24.The learned judge defined cult as `a group with such extreme doctrine and practice that it should be shunned by right-thinking members of society`. He said at [para ] 36: 
Mr Tan, for the defence, as a back-up position as it were, submitted that a group could also be a cult if its doctrine and practice deviate to an extreme degree from the orthodox mainstream religion. It seems to me that this alternative meaning, although not spot on, is closer to the meaning that one should attribute to the word as used in the context of the article. Doing the best I can, I find that the imputation of the word `cult` in the context is that the CCC is a group with such extreme doctrine and practice that it should be shunned by right-thinking members of society.
 25.As stated in 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) (at [para ] 3.26), the law has to take into account that English words have different meanings in different places. What is not considered or considered as a `cult` in The United Kingdom, United States of America and Australia may not be the same here. So the question is what is the meaning of the word `cult` in Singapore. In ascertaining the meaning of the word `cult` it is important to bear in mind that Singapore is a secular state with divers religions and there is a very high degree of religious tolerance.
 26.In the law of defamation, the meaning of the words in question is that understood by the ordinary man - the ordinary man in Singapore society. The ordinary man is fair-minded and has a reasonably open mind and tolerant view on religion. Every latitude would be allowed by him for differences in beliefs and doctrines in various religions. The ordinary man does not regard any group a cult merely because its beliefs and doctrines deviate to an extreme degree from the so-called orthodox or mainstream religion or faith. To him, terms like `orthodox` and `mainstream` are relative; so also is such deviation. Hence, to his mind a group with deviant religious beliefs or doctrines even to an extreme degree - and this, as we say is relative - from the so-called `orthodox` or `mainstream` religion would not be regarded a cult. Mere deviance of beliefs and doctrines would not be sufficient.
 27.The starting point in our consideration as to the meaning of the word `cult` is that in Singapore society the word `cult` has a sinister connotation. The ordinary man on hearing that his son or daughter has joined a cult, whatever the religious persuasion of that cult may be, would feel very perturbed and alarmed. The question is then what is it in such group called a `cult` that raises such grave concern? Given that Singaporean society is multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-religious with very high degree of religious tolerance, any deviant religious beliefs or doctrines alone would, in our opinion, probably not cause such grave concern and anxiety. What really worries the ordinary man is the teachings and practices of the group rather than their religious beliefs and doctrines. The next question is: `What kind of teachings and practices would alarm the ordinary man?` The answer must be those teachings and practices that are abhorrent or harmful to society, and our conclusion is that to the ordinary man the word `cult` means a religious group with teachings and practices that are abhorrent or harmful to society.
 28.We agree with the learned judge that the word `cult` is a pejorative term and any reference to a religious group as a cult is clearly defamatory of that group. Such description of that group would tend to lower the group and its members in the estimation of the right-thinking members of the society generally. Such a group would be shunned and looked upon with contempt.
 29.
 Justification
We now turn to the defence of justification. The defendants relied on various facts and matters relating to the beliefs, teachings and practices of CCC in support of their defence. The learned judge found that most of the facts and matters relied on had been proved. The principal ones are as follows: 
(1) CCC believe and teach their members that their church is the only true church and that they do everything exactly as the Bible says. The other churches do not follow and teach what the Bible teaches and their adherents are not true Christians. These churches are spiritually dead and have to follow CCC`s ways to be `reconstructed`. 
(2) The essential teaching of CCC is that in order to be saved and to become a true Christian a person must be baptised by CCC or churches within their group. Baptism by any other church is invalid. Thus CCC rebaptise any person who wishes to become a member, even if he or she was baptised elsewhere other than by a church within their group. 
(3) In CCC every member has a discipler and the discipler himself has his own discipler and so on up the hierarchy. The discipler is a tutor, counsellor and a friend, all rolled into one; he meets his disciple or disciples on a regular basis and monitors and guides them on every aspect of his or their lives. Normally they meet once a week, studying bible and discussing what the disciple has done and what he intends to do with reference to his commitment to God and the church. 
(4) A disciple is taught to confess his sin or personal weakness and private thoughts to his discipler. His discipler might even ask about any other sins he has committed and whether he has overcome them. Where a discipler has more than one disciple, topics such as sins committed by one disciple may be discussed openly in the company of the other disciples. A disciple is taught to be open and share his life and thought with others. 
(5) Sharing of faith is an important thing for the church and the discipler would be likely to ask his disciples what they have been doing in that area and how many people they have contacted and how many they would be likely to bring to the meeting. 
(6) If a disciple has difficulty fitting his church commitments with his own commitments in other areas of his life, such as family, work, business or education, his discipler would help him to plan his times so as to fit in everything within the time frame, and if there is difficulty in so doing, the commitment to the church takes priority. 
(7) The members of CCC who are unmarried are encouraged to meet members of opposite sex and to date and marry them. A member is not encouraged to form a relationship with a member of the opposite sex who is not a member of the church, unless the latter is encouraged to join the church, and failing that the member will be pressurized to break that relationship. 
(8) Submission to the leadership is a norm in CCC. A disciple is expected to submit to the authority of disciplers and the leaders of the CCC. There is a pyramid type of leadership based on a hierarchical organizational structure, progressing from members upwards through various ranks of leaders to the leader evangelist at the top of the pyramid. Every leader down to the lowest level is directly answerable to another leader higher up in the pyramid until the top. 
(9) Recruitment activity is the most important commitment of every CCC member at every level. A member does it wherever and whenever there is an opportunity to do so: everyone who is not a member is a potential target, eg relatives, friends, business acquaintance. Once a week is set aside for members to do recruitment publicly, eg at MRT stations or on the streets. They usually approach people in their late teens and early thirties and primarily English educated. Members of the CCC are constantly expected to contact and convert others. 
(10) The evenings of most of the week of a member are taken up by church activities. He has `family night` in which he spends time explaining to his family the new found faith or attempting to convert members of the family who are not members of the church. As for the other evenings of the week, the member goes out evangelising, attends bible studies and prayer meetings, and meets his discipler. The whole weekend is virtually taken up with `relationship building`, such as group outings, group datings, group fun on Saturday and with bible study, fellowship and dinner on Sunday. In addition, there is a service in the afternoon, and there is also a service on Wednesday which a member must attend. Missing such service would cause great concern. With all these commitments, a member hardly has any time for himself. Where the requirements or demands of his job conflict with the commitments of the church, the member is required to adjust his working requirements to fit in with his commitments to the church. Members of CCC are expected to put their involvement in the CCC`s activities above their work. Because of such heavy commitments, members become isolated from their families, relatives and friends. 
(11) When a member either for reasons that he cannot meet the constant demands of the church or for other reason decides to leave the church, his discipler and friends would try to dissuade him from so doing, and the member would then be told that leaving the CCC is like leaving and rejecting God and going over to Satan.
 30.The learned judge having found these facts then proceeded to consider the defence of justification. He dealt with this by stating that in a system of trial by jury, the jury would decide this issue. In Singapore, where the judge performs both the function of the judge and jury, the judge must place himself in the position of a hypothetical or notional jury and try to come to an educated guess as to what such a jury would have decided. Such a notional jury would have some Christians and Christian sympathisers. However, they would only form the minority. He then decided that while the abovementioned minority jury members would certainly be convinced that CCC was a cult, they would have difficulty persuading their fellow jurors as they would not be unduly troubled by CCC`s teachings and practices. This is especially so given Singapore`s national creed of tolerance in our multi-religious society. He thus came to the conclusion that the notional jury would not find CCC to be a cult, and held that the defence of justification failed.
 31.With respect, we do not think that it is helpful to adopt such an approach. We have no jury system. All cases are decided by a judge alone without a jury and he decides all issues, whether of fact or law; and on issues of fact he decides them by examining the facts objectively and making the necessary findings for the purpose of his judgment. He does not place himself in the position of a hypothetical or notional jury and try to come to an educated guess as to what such a jury or a majority of them would have decided.
 32.Reverting to the facts here, what we need to do is to examine them and consider whether on those facts the defendants have justified the meaning of the word `cult` as defined by us. Looking at the facts as proved we find that all that has been established is this. CCC are a very religious group - indeed extremely religious - making very heavy demands on their members in terms of time and commitments, and through the system of discipleship retain a firm hold on or control over their members, jealously guarding them against any outside influence. As a result of the heavy commitments, the members would inevitably be isolated from their families, relatives and friends. CCC carry out very intensive recruitment exercises at every turn with their members evangelizing, making contact with people, inviting them to join their church and seeking to convert them. They are somewhat bigoted in their beliefs and doctrines, and consider that their church is the only true one and their way is the only way to salvation. For that reason they refuse to recognize baptism conducted by other churches, except those churches within their own group. We find that none of their teachings and practices could or would be considered by the ordinary man in Singapore as abhorrent or harmful to society. The ordinary man may find that some of their teachings and practices rather disagreeable and would probably not commend them to anyone but would not consider that they are abhorrent or harmful to society. In our judgment, the defendants have failed in the defence of justification.
 33.
 Fair comment
Next, we turn to the defence of fair comment. There are four elements which the defendants must establish in order to succeed on the plea of fair comment: (i). the words complained of are comments, though they may consist of or include inference of facts;
 (ii). the comment is on a matter of public interest;
 (iii). the comment is based on facts; and
 (iv). the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.

Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd v Wright Norman & Ors
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 760
  at p 770.
 Distinction between fact and comment
 34.The difficulty here is to distinguish between an assertion of fact and a comment. In dealing with this issue the learned judge held summarily (at [para ] 99) that a statement that a group is a cult is essentially a comment. That, with respect, is an over-simplification. Such a statement may be a statement of fact or a comment, depending on the manner in which the statement is made and the context in which it is made, and in determining this issue the whole of the article or passage in question has to be read and considered. 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) in [para ] 12.6-12.10 provides various propositions as guides in ascertaining whether a statement is one of fact or comment, but all of them, though helpful, are by no means decisive or conclusive. The learned editors say: 
12.6 The distinction. it has been said that the sense of comment is `something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, remark, observation, etc`. 
12.7 Fact and comment: the significance of supporting facts If a defamatory allegation is to be defended as fair comment it must be recognisable by the ordinary, reasonable reader as comment and the key to this is whether it is supported by facts, stated or indicated, upon which, as comment, it may be based 
12.8 Construction. While some indication of the supporting facts is necessary the ultimate question is how the words would strike the ordinary, reasonable reader and it is unlikely that any attempt to formulate general principles of construction will be much help 
12.9 Context. In order to determine whether the words are fact or comment the judge or jury is confined to the context of the publication in respect of which the action is brought What is necessary is that language must be used which conveys to the reader that the defendant is commenting on what the writer of the article has said 
12.10 Inferences of fact as comment. It is clear that a comment may consist of an inference or deduction of fact; that is, an author can assert, as his comment on facts stated or referred to in what he publishes, some other fact the existence of which he infers or deduces from those facts. Thus, if the author sets out facts in relation to the plaintiff`s conduct and states that his inference from those facts is that the plaintiff must have been bribed so to act, his statement will fall within the defence, though it is possible in this situation that mere honesty on his part will not suffice.
 35.At the end of the day much depends on how the defamatory statement is expressed, the context in which it is set out and the content of the entire article or passage in question. One should adopt a common sense approach and consider how the statement would strike the ordinary reasonable reader, ie whether it would be recognizable by the ordinary reader as a comment or a statement of fact. In this connection, it is helpful to look at some pronouncements made in decided cases to see how the courts have approached this vexing issue.
 36.In 
Hunt v The Star Newspaper Co, Ltd
 
[1908] 2 KB 309
, 319-320 Fletcher Moulton LJ said: 
In the first place, comment in order to be justifiable as fair comment must appear as comment and must not be so mixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish between what is report and what is comment: see
 Andrews v Chapma
n (1853) 3 C & K 286. The justice of this rule is obvious. If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the unfavourable inference is based. But if fact and comment be intermingled so that it is not reasonably clear what portion purports to be inference, he will naturally suppose that the injurious statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer though not necessarily set out by him. In the one case the insufficiency of the facts to support the inference will lead fair-minded men to reject the inference. In the other case it merely points to the existence of extrinsic facts which the writer considers to warrant the language he uses. In this relation I must express my disagreement with the view apparently taken by the Court of Queen`s Bench in Ireland in the case of 
 Lefroy v Burnside
 4 LR Ir CL 556, where the imputation was that the plaintiffs dishonestly and corruptly supplied to a newspaper certain information. The court treated the qualifications `dishonestly` or `corruptly` as clearly comment. In my opinion they are not comment, but constitute allegations of fact. It would have startled a pleader of the old school if he had been told that, in alleging that the defendant `fraudulently represented,` he was indulging in comment. By the use of the word `fraudulently` he was probably making the most important allegation of fact in the whole case. Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment.
 37.In the Australian case of 
Smith Newspapers Ltd & Anor v Becker
 
[1932] 
47 CLR 279
, the plaintiff sued the defendants for libel in respect of an article published in the defendant`s newspaper which defamed the plaintiff by calling him, inter alia, a `German quack`. The High Court held, inter alia, that the libellous statement was an assertion of fact. Evatt J said at p 302: 
In order to substantiate such a defence [ie defence of fair comment], the defendants had to show that their description of the plaintiff as a `German Quack` was published as and for an expression of their opinion about him. But I am satisfied that, seen in their true relation to the article, the words `German Quack runs riot on the Murray Flats` would be understood by a reader of the article as meaning, not that 
 Smith`s Weekly
 were merely expressing their opinion that Becker was a `quack` but that 
 Smith`s Weekly
 asserted that such was a correct description of him; in other words, asserted as a fact that he was a `German Quack`. No doubt, the reader of the article would also gather that the writer was of opinion that Becker was a quack. But it would appear to him also that the writer did not regard such characterization as a matter open to any debate, but as a perfectly accurate portrayal of a fact.
 38.Another clear pronouncement on statements recognizable as comment is found in the following passage of the judgment of Jordan CJ of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 
Goldsbrough v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd & Anor
 
[1934] 34 SR 542
, 531: 
For the defence [of fair comment] to succeed, it is essential that the whole of the words in respect of which it is relied on should be comment, that they should be fair, and that they should be on a matter of public interest. It must be indicated with reasonable clearness by the words themselves, taking them in the context and the circumstances in which they were published, that they purport to be comment and not statements of fact; because statements of fact, however fair, are not protected by this defence. In other words, it must appear that they are opinions stated by the writer or speaker about facts, which are at the same time presented to, or are in fact present to, the minds of the readers or listeners, as things distinct from the opinions, so that it can be seen whether the opinions are such that they can fairly be formed upon the facts:

 39.In 
London Artists Ltd v Littler
 
[1969] 2 QB 375
, the defendant produced a play, The Honourable Gentleman, at Her Majesty`s Theatre, London, and over the last few months the weekly takings had fallen rather considerably. He received from the lessee of the theatre, who had given him a licence to stage the play, a letter stating that in view of the poor takings the licence granted to him to stage the play at the theatre might have to be terminated. Immediately after receipt of that letter he also received letters from four artists giving the required notices terminating their appearances at the play. He replied to each of the four artists suggesting that there was a plot to close the run of his play. The actual words used in the letter was that the addressee was `a party to what [appeared] to be a plan to close the run of The Right Honourable Gentleman`. He was sued for libel by those whom he accused of being involved in the plot, and he raised, inter alia, the defence of fair comment. The trial judge held that the defence of fair comment was not available, as the matter was not a matter of public interest. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that although the matter was one of public interest, the defence of fair comment, nonetheless, failed, as the defamatory statement was not a comment but an assertion of fact. Edmund Davies LJ in rejecting the argument that the defamatory part of the letter was a comment said at p 398: 
[T]he effect of Mr Duncan`s detailed analysis of the offending letter was to invite this court to bring to its interpretation a subtlety and perspicacity well beyond that reasonably to be expected of the ordinary reader whom the defendant was obviously aiming at by holding his Press conference, and to ignore the obviously fair and commonsense test propounded by Fletcher-Moulton LJ in 
Hunt v Star Newspaper Co Ltd
 
[1908] 2 KB 309
, 319. And whatever degree of subtlety be applied in its interpretation, in my judgment the words complained of were clear assertions of facts and the judge should have so ruled
 40.We now revert to the publications before us. We need to consider separately the publication in the 
 Impact 
 magazine and those in the newspapers of TNP and Wanbao. Although the publications by TNP and Wanbao in their respective newspapers were derived from what was published in the 
 Impact 
 magazine, the manner in which those articles were written was different. What appears in one publication as a comment may well appear in another or a subsequent publication dealing with the same subject matter as an assertion of fact.
 41.In the 
 Impact 
 magazine the only direct reference to CCC as a cult is found on the front cover where the following question is posed `AOG & CCC - Are They Cults?` next to the pictorial representation which we have described. Nowhere in the CCC article is there any statement that CCC are a cult. The contents of the article and in particular, that part of the article which the plaintiffs complained of, set out the beliefs and teachings of CCC. Juxtaposed with the CCC article is a short article in a box with the heading `Why People Join Cults`, but the content of the article makes no reference to CCC. The inference drawn from the front cover, the content of the CCC article and the juxtaposition of the article `Why People Join Cults` with the CCC article is clearly that CCC are a cult and that JL is the leader of that cult. In our judgment, looking at the article as a whole (including the front cover) the reference to CCC as a cult and JL as the leader of that cult is a comment and not an assertion of fact.
 Publication in TNP
 42.The publications by TNP and Wanbao in their newspapers pose some difficulty. We consider first the publication of TNP. On the front page of the newspaper are the words in big bold print: `2 CULTS EXPOSED`. On top of these bold prints are the names of the two groups in lesser print: `THE ARMY OF GOD` and `THE CENTRAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH` and immediately below the big bold print are the words: `Christian groups warn of two new cults in Singapore. The Army of God and the Central Christian Church tend to ""stretch the truth"" and have ""exclusive"" practices, says one Reverend.` The article at p 11 of the newspaper has the heading in bold print: `Concern over two cult groups` and next to it is a pictorial representation consisting a man holding a mask depicting a benign and kind face and behind the mask is a hard and fierce looking face. The man is shown to be teaching or instructing three persons. The article commences with the following paragraphs: 
TWO new Christian groups described as cult groups have sprung up in Singapore, say a few Christian organisations. And these organisations have warned their members about it.
 
The groups in question are The Army of God (AOG) and The Central Christian Church (CCC). Their existence and activities were highlighted in two Christian magazines, Impact and Methodist Messages.
 On the same page there also appears a short article contained in a box with the heading: `LEADERS OF THE CULTS` and that article states that JL is the leader of CCC and that he was converted and trained while he was studying in London and was sent to Singapore to start the group. The rest of the article is, in substance, a republication what has been published in the Impact.
 43.These several statements must be read in the context of the entire article including the front page, and the article must be read as a whole. No doubt the statements we have quoted are supported by facts and matters stated in the article; but the question is whether these facts and matters support the statements as assertions of facts or as comments. That obviously must depend on the nature of those statements and the manner in which the statements are expressed. Reading the statements in their proper context, we have difficulty in accepting that they are comments and not assertions of fact. To the ordinary reasonable reader, who is fair-minded, these statements are not recognisable as comments. In our judgment, the severed defamatory statements in TNP referring to CCC as a cult and JL as a leader of that cult are plain assertions of fact and not comments.
 Wanbao publication
 44.The Wanbao publication contains equally clear statements of fact to the effect that CCC are a cult. At the risk of repetition, we set out again the publication which is as follows: (1). Two more religious cults discovered recently. Christian churches urge members to be wary. The two cults are the Army of God and Central Christian Church
 (2). One reverend said he was concerned because of the cults` ideological differences with the more established churches. They always emphasize that they are the `true believers` and that others are not
 (3). These two cult organisations not only have an impact on some of the churches in Singapore but it is also possible that they have influence in some mission schools.
 What is even more obvious is that Wanbao hardly set out any facts in support of the statements. In our judgment, the statements in Wanbao are, a fortiori, assertions of fact and not comments.
 45.It follows from what we have decided that the defence of fair comment is not available to TNP and Wanbao. Their defence of fair comment therefore fails.
 46.We now revert to the defence of fair comment in relation to the 
 Impact 
 publication, and consider whether the remaining three elements have been established. On the second element, ie the matter commented on is one of public interest, it is not in dispute that the subject matter of publication is a matter of public interest. The learned judge held that it is a matter of public interest, and we agree with him entirely.
 47.Turning to the facts or matters pleaded in support of the comment the learned judge found that they had been proved, with only one or two exceptions. In our opinion, those facts or matters that had been proved are sufficient for the purpose. For a defence of fair comment to succeed it is not necessary to prove each of the facts pleaded in support; all that is needed is to prove such of the facts as are sufficient to form the basis of a fair comment. Lord Porter in 
Kemsley v Foot
 
[1952] A C 345
, 358 said: 
In the present case, for instance, the substratum of fact upon which comment is based is that Lord Kemsley is the active proprietor of and responsible for the Kemsley Press. The criticism is that that press is a low one. As I hold, any facts sufficient to justify that statement would entitle the defendants to succeed in a plea of fair comment. Twenty facts might be given in the particulars and only one justified, yet if that one fact were sufficient to support the comment so as to make it fair, a failure to prove the other nineteen would not of necessity defeat the defendants` plea. The protection of the plaintiff in such a case would, in my opinion, be, as it often is in cases of the like kind, the effect which an allegation of a number of facts which cannot be substantiated would have upon the minds of a jury who would be unlikely to believe that the comment was made upon the one fact or was honestly founded upon it and accordingly would find it unfair.
 In our opinion, the third element has been established by Impact.
 48.We now turn to the question whether on the facts as proved a fair-minded person could honestly express the comment as was expressed by 
 Impact 
. The test is an objective one. In 
Merivale v Carson
 
[1888] 20 QBD 275
, 280-281 Lord Esher MR said: 
What is the meaning of a `fair comment`? I think the meaning is this: is the article in the opinion of the jury beyond that which any fair man, however prejudiced or however strong his opinion may be, would say of the work in question? Every latitude must be given to opinion and to prejudice, and then an ordinary set of men with ordinary judgment must say whether any fair man would have made such a comment on the work. It is very easy to say what would be clearly beyond that limit; if, for instance, the writer attacked the private character of the author Mere exaggeration, or even gross exaggeration, would not make the comment unfair. However wrong the opinion expressed may be in point of truth, or however prejudiced the writer, it may still be within that prescribed limit. The question which the jury must consider is this - would any fair man, however prejudiced he may be, however exaggerated or obstinate his views, have said that which this criticism has said of the work which is criticised? If it goes beyond that, then you must find for the plaintiff; If you are not satisfied that it does, then it falls within the allowed limit, and there is no libel at all.
 49.In 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 at p 650, this court said: 
We refer to the very concise and oft-quoted passage of Diplock J`s direction to the jury in 
Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd
 
[1958] 1 WLR 743
, at p 749:
 
` I will remind you of the test once more. Could a fair-minded man, holding a strong view, holding perhaps an obstinate view, holding perhaps a prejudiced view - could a fair-minded man have been capable of writing this? That is a totally different question from the question: Do you agree with what he said?`
 
The essential thing is the honest opinion of a fair-minded person and in this connection every allowance or latitude must be given for any prejudice and exaggeration entertained by such a fair-minded person.
 50.On the facts proved, we are of the opinion that a fair-minded person could honestly express the comments made in the 
 Impact 
 magazine.
 51.Before us, counsel for CCC argues that Mrs Carpenter (the writer of the article in the 
 Impact 
 magazine) did not honestly believe what she wrote and that the fourth element required by the defence of fair comment has not been established. However, the word `honestly` here is used in an objective sense. The fourth element requires the comment to be one that, objectively speaking, a fair-minded person can honestly make given the proven facts, unless in making such statement the author is actuated by malice. In this case, the plaintiffs have not pleaded or relied on express malice on the part of Impact.
 52.We are reinforced in our views by the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in 
Telnikoff v Matusevitch
 
[1991] 1 QB 102
. There, it was contended before the court that no comment could be fair, unless it is the honest opinion of the person making the comment. It is not enough for the view expressed to be one which an honest man could hold; the defendant must hold the view himself. As such, since the burden is on the defendant to prove fair comment, there must be some evidence that the comment represents his own honest view. After considering extensive authorities, Lloyd LJ held at p 119 that: 
My conclusion is that the law is correctly stated in 
 Duncan & Neil on Defamation
 (2nd Ed, 1983) p 57, para 12.02:
 
(a) the comment must be on a matter of public interest; (b) the comment must be based on fact; (c) the comment, though it can consist of or include inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment; (d) the comment must satisfy the following objective test: could any fair-minded man honestly express that opinion on the proved facts? (e) even though the comment satisfies the objective test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was actuated by malice.
 
In the light of the present case I would add a rider, already implicit in paragraphs (a) to (e), that the absence of honest belief in the truth of the comment is relevant to paragraph (e), and not otherwise. Thus the burden of proof in the present case that the letter did not represent the defendant`s genuine views lay on the plaintiff. It was not incumbent on the defendant to give evidence as to his state of mind.
 53.In this case, as the plaintiffs have not pleaded express malice, they are precluded from raising any such arguments. In our judgment, the defence of fair comment by Impact succeeds.
 54.We should mention that 
 Telnikoff 
 went on appeal to the House of Lords and the decision of the Court of Appeal was reversed, but on another point, and what was said by Lloyd LJ (which we have quoted above) remain intact: 
Telnikoff v Matusevitch
 
[1992] 2 AC 343
.
 55.The plaintiffs also rely on the hooded figures in the magazine. We agree with the learned judge that one must look at the pictures in the context of the articles in which they appear as a reasonable reader would do and bear in mind that this is a publication to the religious community. The learned judge held that they are exaggerations and dramatisations of the view of Impact that CCC are a cult and may mislead people. We agree.
 56.
 Qualified privilege
We consider first the defence of qualified privilege raised by 
 Impact 
. Warren LH Khoo J held that in order for the defence of qualified privilege to succeed, it has to be shown that the maker of the comment had a legal, social or moral duty to publish to another person who had a corresponding interest to receive it. The learned judge was clearly right. In 
Adam v Ward
 
[1971] AC 309
, 334 Lord Atkinson said: 
A privileged occasion is an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest, or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.
 Turning to the case at hand Warren LH Khoo J held that the publication by 
 Impact 
 fulfilled the requirements for the defence. 
 Impact 
 had the requisite duty to publish comments on the plaintiffs as it was a publication of the evangelical community, and was circulated among members of that community. Its general readership had the requisite interest. He said at [para ] 154: 
The 
 Impact
 magazine, a publication of the evangelical community, is targeted at people who attend churches. It is distributed mainly at churches and Christian book rooms. Non-Christians would not come into contact with it, unless they are receptive to the faith and perhaps get the magazine from friends. At the time of the publication of the issue complained of, it had a print run of about 6,000 copies, 3,000 of which were for subscribers and the balance sold at churches and book rooms, the actual sale being about 1,000 copies. So, in short, it is a publication of the evangelical community; it is intended to be circulated, and is circulated, among members of that community.
 57.This finding is challenged by the plaintiffs. Their contention is that the mere fact that members of the public have access to the magazine, however small in number, destroys 
 Impact 
`s privilege and they rely on the following passage in [para ] 14.65 of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed): 
14.65 Publication to uninterested persons. It follows from the fundamental requirement of reciprocity of duty and interest that publication to a person who does not share in this reciprocity is not generally privileged. As a general rule therefore the defendant should be careful to make his communication only to those persons who have a legitimate interest or duty in relation to the subject-matter. The fact that a communication between A and B is privileged does not justify A in making the communication in a manner, or at a time, which would necessarily involve its publication to other persons who have no such interest or duty, and no privilege would prima facie attach to any such publication.
 There is no dispute on the correctness of this passage but only on the application thereof to the facts of this case. We agree with the finding of the learned judge. In the words of the learned judge, the magazine is a publication of the evangelical community and is circulated and distributed to members of that community and to churches. In these circumstances there is a duty on the part of the writer and publisher to publish that article and there is a corresponding interest on the part of the members of that community to receive it. The mere fact that persons who are not members of such community could have access to the publication does not ipso facto destroy that privilege. Where a libel is published on a privileged occasion and the publication does not go beyond the exigency of the occasion, the mere fact that the defamatory matter is communicated to persons who have no legitimate interest in the subject matter will not avoid that privilege: see [para ] 14.73 of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed).
 58.Counsel for the plaintiffs refer to the case of 
De Buse & Anor v McCarthy & Anor
 
[1942] 1 KB 156
; but the facts there were vastly different. There, the clerk of a borough council sent out notices convening a meeting of the council to consider, inter alia, the report regarding the loss of petrol from one of the council`s depot which was defamatory of the plaintiffs. Included in the notice was a long agenda and a copy of the report. Not only was the notice posted at or near the door of the town hall where the meeting was to take place, but under the direction of the council and in accordance with long established practice it was also sent to various libraries in the borough where they were available for perusal by ratepayers and other frequenters of the libraries. The clerk and the council were sued for defamation and it was held by the Court of Appeal that the defence of qualified privilege failed, as the council had no duty or interest to communicate the report to the ratepayers; nor had the ratepayers any duty or interest to receive the communication. In our opinion, that case has no application here.
 59.Turning to the defence of qualified privilege raised by TNP and Wanbao, Warren LH Khoo J held that the mass media`s right to make fair comment on a matter of public interest or the professional duty of journalists and editors to report on matters of public interest is insufficient to constitute the requisite duty of the commentator for the purposes of the defence. Furthermore, the newspaper-reader relationship is also not enough to form the relationship required by the defence. The learned judge could not find any special duty on the part of TNP and Wanbao to publish comments on CCC outside their normal professional duty as news reporters. Accordingly, he held that they failed on that defence. He said at [para ] 160: 
In respect of 
 The New Paper
 and the 
 Wanbao
, I do not think, therefore, that there are special circumstances giving rise to a duty for the purpose of the defence of qualified privilege. The defence fails on qualified privilege.
 60.TNP and Wanbao`s submission is simply that they have the requisite duty to publish on the CCC because of the following characteristics: (a). CCC were a controversial group.
 (b). They practised deception in order to conceal their identity so as to obtain registration with the Registry of Societies.
 (c). They carried out aggressive recruitment programme in public.
 61.The law regarding the defence of qualified privilege concerning newspapers has been set out in 
Aaron v Cheong Yip Seng
 
[1996] 1 SLR 623
 at pp 651C- 652A-B where this court said: 
Generally, qualified privilege is available to newspapers as much as to any other person. Privilege for publication in the press of information of general public interest is limited to cases where the publisher has a legal, social or moral duty to communicate. The law does not recognize an interest in the public strong enough to give rise generally to a duty to communicate in the press; such a duty has been held to exist on special facts, and there is no general `media privilege at common law`
 
In 
London Artists Ltd v Littler
 
[1968] 1 WLR 607
, Cantley J said, at p 619:
 
`The cases to which I have referred show a uniformity of approach. In my view the privilege for publication in the press of information of general public interest is confined to cases where the defendant has a legal, social or moral duty to communicate it to the general public, or does so in reasonable self-defence to a public charge, or in the special circumstances exemplified by 
Adam v Ward
 
[1971] AC 309
.
 
A duty will thus arise where it is in the interests of the public that the publication should be made and will not arise simply because the information appears to be of legitimate public interest.`
 
Along with the duty to communicate is a corresponding interest to receive such information on the part of the public
 
In addition, the duty must be a duty to publish to the public at large and the interest must exist in the public at large to receive the publication. It is insufficient if only a section of the public is concerned with the subject matter of the publication. In 
Blackshaw v Lord & Anor
 
[1984] QB 1
 Stephenson LJ said, at p 26:
 
` There must be a duty to publish to the public at large and an interest in the public at large to receive the publication; and a section of the public is not enough.
 
The subject matter must be of public interest; its publication must be in the public interest. That nature of the matter published and its source and the position or status of the publisher distributing the information must be such as to create the duty to publish the information to the intended recipients, in this case the readers of the 
 Daily Telegraph
.`
 
And Dunn LJ said, at p 35:
 
` The public must have a legitimate interest in receiving the information contained in it, and there must be a correlative duty in the publisher to publish, which depends also on the status of the information which he receives, at any rate where the information is being made public for the first time `
 The court further elaborated on the relevant factors at p 652: 
by whom and to whom, when, why and in what circumstances the publication is made, and whether these things establish a relation between the parties which gives rise to a social or moral duty, and the consideration of these things may involve the consideration of questions of public policy. It does not follow that publication of all matters of public interest is in the public interest such that it would give rise to a duty to publish them. The right of a publisher of a newspaper to report truthfully and comment fairly on matters of public interest must not be confused with a duty of the sort that gives rise to an occasion of qualified privilege: per Cartwright J in 
 The Globe And Mail Ltd v Boland
 (1960) 22 DLR (2d) 277 at 280-281.
 62.So it is patently clear that TNP and Wanbao cannot show that they have the required duty to publish their articles on CCC solely on the basis that CCC`s activities were a matter of public interest and that it was their duty to report on such matters of interest. The burden is on them to show that there were circumstances that gave rise to the duty, and they have not discharged that burden.
 63.While it is rather unclear what `special facts` must be shown in order for a newspaper publication to succeed on the defence of qualified privilege, the requisite standard or test for such special facts is an onerous one. Stephenson LJ in 
Blackshaw v Lord
 
[1984] QB 1
 at p 27, [1983] 2 All ER 311 at p 327 said that the cases where the defence was established for newspaper publications were those: 
extreme cases where the urgency of communicating a warning is so great, or the source of the information so reliable, that publication of a suspicion or speculation is justified; for example where there is danger to the public from a suspected terrorist or the distribution of contaminated food or drugs.
 And indeed the decided cases where the defence was successfully pleaded do bear this out. In 
Allbut v General Council of Medical Education and Registration
 
[1889] 23 QBD 400
 it was held that the Medical Council had a social or moral duty to publish the name of a doctor who had been taken off the medical register. In 
 Camporese v Parton 
 (1983) 150 DLR (3d) 208, it was held that a published warning of possible food contamination from canning lids in a newspaper article fell within the ambit of the defence. In 
Perera v Peiris
 
[1949] AC 1
, it was held that the newspaper publication of an extract from a government report on bribery which accused the plaintiff of lack of candour was held to be privileged.
 64.We find that, given the alleged teachings and practices of CCC at the time of publication, the situation was not such as to meet the onerous standard required for the defence. 
 Allbut v General Council of Medical Education and Registration 
 and 
 Camporese v Parton 
 were cases where the public was rightly warned of the risk of receiving medical treatment from a doctor who had been struck off the medical register and of consuming contaminated food respectively. 
 Perera v Peiris 
 concerned the alleged corruption by a government official. Accordingly TNP`s and Wanbao`s defence of qualified privilege fails.
 65.
 Damages
On the basis of what we have decided, it follows that TNP and Wanbao are liable in damages for the libel, and we now turn to the assessment of damages. On this exercise we have to bear in mind the following considerations. First, TNP and Wanbao did not in any way aggravate the hurt to the plaintiffs and there were no aggravating factors present which we should take into account. Secondly, both TNP and Wanbao are liable to CCC and there will be two awards of damages, and the totality of these awards will have to be taken into account. We also have to take into account that although TNP and Wanbao separately in their newspapers defamed CCC, the two publications are, in substance, similar and the stings in both the libel are the same. These considerations are relevant in assessing damages: see 
Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 97
 , 145-146 and 153-154. Damages are compensatory and the amounts to be awarded to CCC and JL should be fair and reasonable: not too much, nor too little. Taking into account all the relevant circumstances, we think that a sum of $20,000 to CCC from each of the defendants, TNP and Wanbao, and a sum of $30,000 to JL from TNP would be adequate damages.
 66.
 Conclusion
In the result, we dismiss CA 247, 249 and 251 of 1997 and allow CA 248, 250 and 252 of 1997. We order TNP and Wanbao each to pay to CCC damages in the sum of $20,000 making a total of $40,000, and TNP to pay to JL damages in the sum of $30,000, and affirm the order below dismissing CCC`s and JL`s claims against Impact.
 67.On the question of costs, 
 Impact 
 should have their costs here and below. They succeeded in resisting the claim below and the appeals, CA 249 and 251 of 1997. Accordingly, we order CCC and JL to pay the costs of 
 Impact 
 here and below; however, only one set of costs for getting up and attendance in courts should be allowed. The deposits in court as security for costs in these two appeals are to be paid to them or their solicitors to account of costs.
 68.We now turn to the remaining four appeals, namely, CA 247 of 1997 brought by TNP and Wanbao in which the respondents are CCC and JL; CA 248 and 250 of 1997 brought by CCC in which the respondents are TNP and Wanbao respectively, and CA 252 of 1997 brought by JL in which the respondents are TNP. As CCC and JL succeeded in their claims below and in their appeals, they should be entitled to costs here and below. Accordingly, we order TNP and Wanbao to pay the costs of CCC here and below and TNP to pay the costs of JL here and below; but there should be only one set of costs to both CCC and JL for getting up and attendance in courts. Further, for avoidance of any doubt, in so far as costs below are concerned, O 59 r 27(5) of the Rules of Court would apply. The deposits as security for costs in CA 248, 250 and 252 of 1997 are to be refunded to the appellants respectively or their solicitors and the deposit in court as security for costs in CA 247 of 1997 is to be paid to CCC and JL or their solicitors to account of costs.",1998-08-28 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit the offence of armed robbery with hurt. He was convicted by the district court and was sentenced to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. At the end of the appeal, I directed the charge to be amended to one of conspiracy to commit the offence of robbery with hurt and convicted the appellant of the charge. The appeal against sentence was dismissed. I now set out my grounds.
 2.The charge against the appellant was as follows: 
You, Ang Ser Kuang M/37 years, NRIC No S1366315G are charged that you, between end 1995 and December 1996, did engage with one Nga Song Pou, Teo Beng Chuan, Tan Chin Poh and Tan Choon Huat in a conspiracy to commit robbery of one Yeo Song Care, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 17 December 1996 at about 1.42pm, inside the lift at the 10th floor of Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1, Singapore, to wit, the said Tan Chin Poh and Tan Choon Huat committed robbery on Yeo Song Care of the following:
 
(a) one travelling bag valued at $25 
(b) one briefcase valued at $55 
(c) an assortment of gold jewellery weighed at about 12 kg valued at $180,000 
(d) one Rolex watch valued at $700
 
Total $180,780
 
in possession of the said Yeo Song Care, and at the time of the robbery the said Tan Chin Poh and Tan Choon Huat were each armed with a deadly weapon, to wit a knife with a 31 cm blade, and in the course of the robbery one of them caused hurt to the said Yeo Song Care`s fingers with a knife and you have thereby abetted the offence of armed robbery with hurt, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 397 and s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.
 The prosecution`s case
The crux of the prosecution`s case was that the appellant and PW7 (Nga Song Pou, also referred to as `David` by the prosecution witnesses), conspired to rob PW1 (Yeo Song Care) on 17 December 1996. The appellant supplied all the information on PW1 to PW7 so as to enable the latter to execute the robbery. PW7 then recruited PW4 (Teo Beng Chuan) who in turn recruited PW2 (Tan Chin Poh) and PW3 (Tan Choon Huat, also referred to as `Koo` by the prosecution witnesses), to commit the robbery.
 4.On 1 April 1997, PW7 pleaded guilty to the offence of engaging in a conspiracy to commit armed robbery contrary to s 109 read with s 392 and s 397 Penal Code. He was sentenced to four years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. PW2 and PW3 pleaded guilty and were convicted on 2 May 1997 of the offence of armed robbery under s 392 and s 397 Penal Code. On the same day, PW4 pleaded guilty to the offence of engaging in a conspiracy to commit armed robbery under s 109 read with s 392 and s 397 Penal Code. PW2 and PW4 were each sentenced to four years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. PW3 was sentenced to serve a term of 52 months` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
 The evidence of PW7 (Nga Song Pou)
 5.The main witness for the prosecution was PW7 who was the only witness who implicated the appellant directly. Prior to his arrest, PW7 was servicing air-conditioners for the last seven to eight years. The appellant helped out at his family`s retail business in a jewellery shop known as Yong Heng Goldsmith and Jewellery. PW7 had known the appellant since 1988 when he installed air-conditioners in the jewellery shop. They later became good friends.
 6.Between the end of 1995 and early 1996, the appellant suggested to PW7 that they rob a person whom the appellant knew had a lot of gold. PW7 agreed. This conversation took place in the appellant`s car. PW7 explained that the conversation actually began in a coffee-shop but, because it was not convenient to talk in the coffee-shop, the conversation was continued in the appellant`s car. The original plan was for PW7 to look for someone to rob the victim and escape on a motorcycle. PW7 would wait for him in the appellant`s car. The appellant would wait nearby until the loot was placed in the car and he would then get in the car and drive to the jewellery shop for the loot to be melted. It was also agreed that within an hour after melting the gold, the appellant would give 30% to the robbers. The appellant and PW7 would take the rest equally and PW7 would get his share only after the melted gold was disposed of.
 7.The following morning after the discussion of the proposed robbery first took place, the appellant drove PW7 to Block 341, Ubi Avenue 1 where the intended victim resided. Whilst they were on their way, the appellant described the victim as a person between 40 and 50 years of age who would be carrying two bags of gold items between 12 noon to 2pm from his flat to his Toyota car registration number SBZ 5105 which would be parked near the lift landing. On that occasion, however, they did not see the victim. A few days later, they went a second time and this time they saw the victim`s car. The appellant instructed PW7 to go there again later to see for himself whether the victim corresponded to the appellant`s earlier description. PW7 returned to the vicinity subsequently in January or February 1996 and noticed a man matching the description of the man carrying two bags which were placed in the said car. He told the appellant about what he had seen. The appellant told him to continue looking for accomplices who could commit the robbery.
 8.In March 1996, PW7 contacted PW4, his friend, who expressed an interest in the robbery. PW7 described the victim and other details of the robbery. He mentioned that someone was behind him but did not disclose the appellant`s identity as the appellant had instructed him not to do so. However the appellant was kept up to date by PW7 as to the search for an accomplice to carry out the plan.
 9.Around June or July 1996, PW7 was told by the appellant not to contact him after the robbery was committed. The appellant had become impatient with him for his constant paging and told him of the change of plans. The appellant would not be waiting in his car after the robbery. Instead the loot was to be kept by PW7 and the robbers, and the appellant was only to be contacted later.
 10.Meanwhile PW4 recruited PW2 to assist the robbery and PW2 in turn recruited PW3. PW2 and 3 decided to commit the robbery at the end of November or early December 1996. After the robbery was committed, on the same day, PW4 informed PW7 of this. PW7 tried to contact the appellant but was unsuccessful in his attempts to do so. PW7 was arrested when he went to PW4`s flat to collect his share of the stolen loot.
 The evidence of PW4 (Teo Beng Chuan)
 11.PW4 was a hawker stall assistant and a friend of PW7. PW7 contacted him on the possibility of robbing a victim. PW7 said that he had an unnamed friend who knew a subject who carried gold items from his home. PW4 agreed to look for an accomplice and discussed with him the details of the plan. Before they parted, PW4 saw PW7 paging for his friend. PW7 returned shortly to say that his friend had confirmed that the information on the target was still good. PW4 did not know the identity of PW7`s friend.
 12.In May 1996, PW4 recruited PW2 and arranged for PW2 to meet PW7. The initial agreement between PW7, PW4 and PW7`s unnamed friend was that one of the robbers, after snatching the gold during the robbery would put the loot in a car and escape by motorcycle. PW7 would then be waiting in the car for the bag of jewellery. The jewellery would then be handed over by PW7 to PW7`s unnamed friend for disposal. The friend would dispose of the gold and, within an hour, PW4 and the robbers would each be given his share of the loot. Subsequently PW4 did not hear of the robbery until 17 December 1996 when PW2 contacted him to inform him that the robbery had been committed.
 The evidence of PW2 (Tan Chin Poh) and PW3 (Tan Choon Huat)
 13.PW2 testified that he met PW4 in May 1996 and PW4 informed him of his plan to commit robbery with PW7 and PW7`s unnamed friend. PW2 agreed readily to join in the robbery as he was in financial difficulties. He met PW7 and PW4 to discuss the plan. The discussion was substantially the same as that recounted by PW4.
 14.In November 1996, PW2, 4 and 7 went to the vicinity of Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1 to conduct observations. On that occasion they only saw a Chinese woman driving PW1`s Toyota car and PW7 said that she was PW1`s younger daughter. PW2 returned to conduct further observations himself. On one occasion, he saw PW1 with his elder daughter, each carrying a bag, approaching PW1`s car. PW2 contacted PW3 and asked him to assist in the robbery. PW3 agreed. They agreed between themselves that they would each take 40% of the loot and give the remainder to PW7 and PW4. Instead of the gold items being passed to PW7 in a waiting car, PW7 would not be present at all. PW2 and 3 would escape by driving off in the victim`s car and dispose of the jewellery themselves.
 15.PW2 and 3 decided to commit the robbery on 12 December 1996. However, their attempt to rob the victim on that day was called off when the victim did not turn up. A similar attempt on 16 December 1996 was unsuccessful for the same reason. Later PW2 contacted PW7 to complain about their futile efforts. PW7 said that the victim would turn up on every Monday and Thursday. On 17 December 1996, they went down again, armed with knives which they had purchased. This time they were successful. Instead of attacking the victim at the void deck, to avoid attention, they ambushed him instead in the lift when it was at the landing on the 10th floor and robbed him. In the course of the robbery, PW1`s fingers were cut by the knife which the robbers carried with them. PW2 and 3 tried to escape by driving off in the victim`s car but the car alarm was activated and PW3 could not start the vehicle. They escaped on foot. PW2 then contacted PW3 who told him to meet the next day at about 1pm at Block 7, Eunos Crescent. PW2 then informed PW4 that PW3 and he had committed the robbery.
 16.The next day PW2 and 3 weighed all the jewellery and it totalled about 11.2kg. They decided to sell the jewellery to a second hand dealer at People`s Park Centre. Over the course of the next two weeks, they disposed of the jewellery and shared the proceeds with each other. On 13 February 1997, PW2 was arrested by the police officers when he tried to sell some jewellery. PW3 and PW4 were also subsequently arrested.
 The evidence of PW1 (Yeo Song Care)
 17.PW1 was the victim of the robbery. He was the sole proprietor of Hong Goy Jewellery dealing with the distribution of an assortment of jewellery to about 23 goldsmith shops in Singapore. He knew the appellant and his family since he used to supply jewellery to the appellant`s jewellery shop. The appellant used to place orders with him until the appellant`s brother and wife took over the orders. He testified that there were occasions when the appellant would go over to his flat at Ubi Avenue 1 to collect urgent orders for customers. PW1 testified that he had known the appellant`s family for a long time and found the appellant to be a straight-forward, honest and trustworthy man, and did not suspect the appellant to be involved in the robbery.
 18.PW1 said that he would normally be carrying a dark blue travelling bag and a black briefcase. He would leave home alone, from Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1 at about 900 hrs to 1000 hrs for the goldsmith shops in a Toyota car registration number SBZ 5105 Z. He would purchase gold and bring it home with him for lunch at about 11am. He would then leave his home with the gold for delivery to the jewellery shops after lunch at about 1pm.
 19.On 17 December 1996, he was leaving his flat at 1.42pm, carrying jewellery valued at $180,000 in two bags. PW1 and 3 surprised him in the lift and he was robbed of the jewellery, his Rolex watch, a travelling bag and a briefcase. He was hurt on his fingers by the robbers in the course of the robbery.
 The evidence of PW5 (Nga Song Kiang) and PW6 (Chua Hong Piow)
 20.PW5 is PW7`s brother. He testified that he saw PW7 alighting from a Toyota car driven by the appellant in early 1996 but he could not remember the exact date. PW6 was a mutual friend of PW7 and testified that in early 1995, he invited the appellant for dinner but the appellant did not mention anything about PW7 offering to sell stolen property to the appellant. On 16 January 1997, when he spoke to the appellant, there was no mention that PW7 had offered to sell stolen property to him. In cross-examination, he said that the appellant had told him towards the end of 1995 that PW7 had pestered him for a $3,000 loan and that PW7 was not happy that the appellant would not lend him the sum. However he was not aware that PW7 had not contacted or met the appellant since late 1995.
 21.At the close of the prosecution`s case, the district court found that there was a case against the appellant for his defence to be called. The appellant elected to give evidence and called two witnesses to testify on his behalf.
 22.
 The defence
The defence was essentially a total denial or any complicity or involvement in the commission of the robbery. The appellant`s evidence was as follows. He was the joint owner of Yong Heng Goldsmith and Jewellery with his brother, Ang Ser Khim (DW2). He had known PW7 since 1988 when the latter installed air-conditioning in his jewellery shop. He testified that their friendship soured after 8 December 1995 when PW7 called him to borrow $3,000 to pay for his HDB flat and the appellant refused him. In addition, in the middle of 1995, PW7 had approached him to buy stolen gold and the appellant had decided that it was best to dissociate himself from him. He produced the Telecoms call details of the calls from May 1995 to January 1997 to illustrate the down-scaling of his relationship with PW7.
 23.The appellant claimed that he did not engage in any conspiracy to commit robbery. He did not know PW2, 3 and 4. He claimed that that sometime in 1998, PW1 came to his shop to deliver gold jewellery whilst PW7 was repairing air-conditioners in the shop. PW1 brought out the jewellery to show the appellant and his brother. After PW1 left, he recalled that PW7 wanted to know from him the background of PW1.
 The evidence of DW2 (Ang Ser Khim) and DW3 (Lau Kar Choe)
 24.DW2 is the appellant`s brother. He testified that he was aware that the appellant refused the request by PW7 for a loan of $3,000 and the latter slammed the telephone on the appellant. He was in the vicinity when this happened. His account in this regard was supported by DW3, his mother. DW3 testified that the appellant had mentioned to her that PW7 approached him (the appellant) regarding `old gold`.
 25.
 The decision below
The district judge found that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was engaged with others in the conspiracy to commit armed robbery and the armed robbery was carried out in pursuance of the conspiracy. He believed the evidence of PW7 that it was the appellant who was the mastermind behind the plot to rob PW1 of his gold items that he was carrying on the day of the robbery. He disbelieved the appellant and found him to be an evasive witness who also contradicted himself in material aspects. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
 26.
 The appeal
There was no dispute that PW2 and PW3 committed the robbery on PW1 on 17 December 1996 in the lift when it was at the landing on the 10th floor of Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1. The only question was whether the appellant was engaged in the conspiracy to commit the robbery with hurt. The main arguments raised by Mr Shanmugam, counsel for the appellant, were: (1) the prosecution`s case, at the highest, only suggested that the armed robbery against PW1 that was actually carried out was pursuant to a conspiracy separately evolved by PW2, 3 and 4; (2) the appellant could not have committed the offence when he had not met PW2, 3 and 4; (3) there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant agreed that the robbers should be armed with knives and cause hurt to PW1; and (4) the conviction was against the weight of evidence.
 27.I considered Mr Shanmugam`s first two arguments together in determining whether the prosecution had made out a prima facie case in respect of the charge against the appellant. Mr Shanmugam argued that there was no prima facie case because the armed robbery against PW1 that was actually carried out was pursuant to a conspiracy in which the appellant played no part, and the appellant could not have committed the offence when he did not meet PW2, 3 and 4.
 28.The charge against the appellant was that of abetment by conspiracy. The relevant provision is s 107(b) Penal Code. It reads as follows: 
A person abets the doing of a thing who -
 
 
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing
 29.The ingredients that the prosecution had to prove were the existence of a conspiracy to commit armed robbery and that an armed robbery was actually carried out. The second limb was undoubtedly fulfilled. The question before me was whether the evidence led by the prosecution, if believed, showed that the armed robbery carried out was pursuant to a separate conspiracy in which the appellant was not a party.
 30.In 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , it was held that the essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. There is no requirement in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other`s company throughout or at all. There need not be communication between each conspirator and every other, provided that there be a common design, common to each of them. One method of proving conspiracy is to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been coordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
 31.The primary facts raised by the prosecution were that PW7 and the appellant conspired to commit robbery on PW1, whom the appellant knew carried a lot of gold items periodically. PW7 then recruited PW4 who in turn recruited PW2 and PW3. PW2 and PW3 were the persons who actually committed the robbery. There was no communication between the appellant on the one hand, and PW2, 3 and 4, on the other. However, communication between each conspirator is not required: 
 PP v Yeo Choon Poh 
; 
 Yash Pal Mital v State of Punjab 
 AIR 1977 SC 2433. What is essential is that there must be knowledge of a common design, and it is not necessary that all the co-conspirators should be equally informed as to the details. They must at least be aware of the general purpose of the plot and the plot must be unlawful: 
Nomura Taiji & Ors v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 173
 . This is fortified by Explanation 5 to s 108 which provides that: 
It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.
 
Illustration
 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C, mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A`s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section, and is liable to the punishment for murder.
 32.The essence of the conspiracy was to rob PW1 of gold items that he was carrying. This was the general criminal purpose that was in common between the appellant, PW2, 3, 4 and 7. There may not be an agreement as to how the loot was to be eventually distributed but this was not material to the illegal act. Eventually the illegal act that was carried out was the robbery of PW1. The change in the plans as to how the robbers were to get away was slight and did not deviate materially from the original conspiracy, which was a simple snatch robbery. There was no basis for saying that there were separate conspiracies.
 33.In this respect, 
R v Griffiths
 
[1965] 2 All ER 448
 was distinguishable from the present case. In that case, B (G`s book-keeper) , G and other farmers were charged with conspiracy to obtain by false pretences subsidies from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and Food. The farmers had each contracted separately with G for the supply of lime and the farmer would then obtain a subsidy from the ministry. The prosecution conceded that there was no evidence of a conspiracy between all farmers, as distinct from a number of conspiracies between G, B and one or other of the farmers. The farmers were not in contact with each other. At the highest, it only showed that there was evidence proving that each farmer agreed to perpetrate a fraud with G and B, and that B took part with G in perpetrating the different frauds. In such a case, the court held that the prosecution did not show there was a common agreement by G, B and the rest of the farmers to cheat the Ministry.
 34.On the facts here as adduced by the prosecution, there was indeed a common purpose to rob PW7. It was not simply a case of all conspirators agreeing to a plan and all of them executing it but one where a conspirator would in turn recruit another to commit robbery. In this respect, this is the scenario envisaged in the illustration to Explanation 5, s 108. The appellant brought PW7 to the scene of the robbery for the survey. What is important is that the appellant was kept informed of the developments in the plans to commit robbery up to June 1996. PW7 also testified that it was the appellant who changed the plan. It was only when the appellant told PW7 that he did not want the latter to contact him until after the robbery that PW7 stopped contacting him about changes to plans. After PW7 found PW4 in March 1996, the appellant told PW7 to continue with the plan. When PW4 located PW2, PW7 kept the appellant updated. The appellant then told PW7 not to contact him until after the robbery was committed. The robbery would not have been committed if not for the appellant`s informing PW7 of the particulars of the victim. The robbery that was eventually committed was one which was envisaged all along by the appellant: the victim was the same and the time and manner in which the robbery was carried out did not differ substantially from what was agreed by the appellant.
 35.The third argument raised by Mr Shanmugam was that, even if there was a conspiracy to rob PW1, the charge as framed was inappropriate where there was no evidence to show that there was a conspiracy to use a knife in the course of the robbery, and thereby causing hurt to the victim. The prosecution argued that, even if the discussion to commit the robbery between the appellant and PW7 did not raise the use of knives or the inadvertent possibility of causing hurt, s 111 Penal code would apply since any injury to the victim was a probable consequence of the abetment.
 36.Section 111 Penal Code reads as follows: 
When an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if he had directly abetted it:
 
Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
 
Illustration
 
 
(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the punishment provided for murder.
 37.There were two aspects here: first, whether using the deadly weapon and, second, causing hurt to the victim, were probable consequences of the abetment. There is some debate in the authorities as to whether the test for `probable consequence` should be a subjective or objective one. In 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 , this issue was briefly alluded to but it was not necessary for the Court of Appeal to determine the question.
 38.In 
Sinniah Pillay v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 225
 , the appellant was charged with abetment of conspiracy to cause grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and means. The appellant argued that while he had procured the services of others to injure the victim, he did not have any knowledge that the acid would be used to cause grievous hurt. The Court of Appeal rejected the argument, holding that the evidence showed that the appellant clearly wanted the victim to be injured to the extent that he would be sent to the hospital. He did not specify the means to be adopted to cause the grievous hurt but left it entirely to the discretion of the co-conspirators. What was done by the co-conspirators was within the scope of his instructions to cause grievous hurt to the victim so that he would be sent to the hospital.
 39.However in this case, a perusal of the notes of evidence showed that PW7 did not give evidence that there was any discussion of the use of any deadly weapons or causing any hurt to the victim. Whether applying an objective or subjective test, it was within the contemplation of all the conspirators that hurt may be inadvertently caused to the victim if he had struggled in the course of the robbery. However, it was too much to say that the use of a knife or a sharp weapon to facilitate the robbery was a probable consequence in order to carry out the appellant`s instructions. Telling an accomplice to commit robbery did not necessarily imply that a deadly weapon would have to be used as well as to threaten the victim. This was distinguishable from 
 Sinniah Pillay 
 where the accused instructed the co-conspirators to injure the victim seriously but the means of the injury were not specified.
 40.A more analogous case is 
Queen Empress v Mathura Das
 
[1884] 6 AIR 491
 where B and C instigated A to rob the deceased on his way home after receiving a sum of money and A killed the deceased in the process. A was convicted of murder and B and C of abetment of murder. The court held that the test was whether, having regard to the immediate object of the instigation or conspiracy, the act done by the principal was one which, according to ordinary experience and common sense, the abettor must have foreseen as probable. In that case, B and C could not be presumed to have foreseen that such excessive violence likely to result in death as was used was probable, although they must have known that some force would be resorted to. The court altered the conviction to one under s 109 read with s 392 (abetment of the offence of simple robbery). Unfortunately no explanation was given as to why the charge was changed to one of abetment of the offence of simple robbery, rather than one of robbery with hurt.
 41.Reverting to the facts here, there was no evidence from PW7 to show that the use of a deadly weapon was even contemplated when he hatched the conspiracy with the appellant. Throughout the time when the appellant was kept informed of any changes in the plans, there was no evidence that PW7 told the appellant that a weapon would be used. The use of a deadly weapon was a distinct act and not a probable consequence of the robbery.
 42.Accordingly I directed that the charge be amended to one under s 394 (robbery with hurt) read with s 109 Penal Code, in the light of the evidence adduced by the prosecution. A charge can be amended on appeal pursuant to s 256 Criminal Procedure Code as long as it causes no prejudice to the appellant: 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
 . The amendment here could not possibly prejudice the appellant`s defence at the trial since it was an amendment for a less serious charge and the evidence would not be different had the appellant been tried on the amended charge. The amended charge read as follows: 
You, Ang Ser Kuang M/37 years, NRIC No S1366315G are charged that you, between end 1995 and December 1996, did engage with one Nga Song Pou, Teo Beng Chuan, Tan Chin Poh and Tan Choon Huat in a conspiracy to commit robbery of one Yeo Song Care, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 17 December 1996 at about 1.42pm, inside the lift at the 10th floor of Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1, Singapore, to wit, the said Tan Chin Poh and Tan Choon Huat committed robbery on Yeo Song Care of the following:
 
(a) one travelling bag valued at $25 
(b) one briefcase valued at $55 
(c) an assortment of gold jewellery weighed at about 12kg valued at $180,000 
(d) one Rolex watch valued at $700
 
Total $180,780
 
in possession of the said Yeo Song Care, and in the course of the robbery, one of them caused hurt to the said Yeo Song Care`s fingers and you have thereby abetted the offence of robbery with hurt, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 43.
 Assessment of the evidence
I then had to consider whether the appellant should be convicted on the amended charge. The crux of the prosecution`s case rested on the evidence of PW7. Mr Shanmugam argued that the evidence of PW7 was not sufficiently reliable to convict the appellant because it was riddled with inconsistencies and improbabilities. The main discrepancies were as follows: (1). the dates on which the conspiracy took place: PW7 testified in court that the conspiracy took place between end 1995 and early 1996 when he went to see PW7 for help to ease his financial difficulty. This was inconsistent with the charge and statement of facts which he pleaded guilty to and which stated that the agreement took place between April 1996 to June 1996, and with the evidence of DW4 (Danker G Sylvester) who said that, on the basis of PW7`s statement, the original charge against PW7 reflected the period between June 1996 and December 1996. Also PW7`s testimony was that he did not meet the appellant after December 1995;
 (2). the venue in which the discussions on the robbery between the appellant and PW7 took place: PW7 said that they took place in the appellant`s car and this was inconsistent with the statement of facts that they took place at a coffee-shop;
 (3). the model of the car which the appellant drove him to the scene of the crime: The appellant claimed that it was a red Subaru but later said that he could not remember the model of the car when it was put to him the appellant did not have such a car in December 1995;
 (4). the appellant was alleged to be the mastermind: However, the actual robbery carried out after a year was different from that which was allegedly discussed by the appellant. There was no explanation why there was no contact between the appellant and PW7 between end of 1995 and December 1996 except for one contact in July 1996. The appellant did not get anything out of the loot which was improbable in a robbery;
 (5). the details PW7 was able to give of the victim: PW7 testified that the only information which the appellant gave him was the description of the victim and that he would carry two bags out of his house between 12 noon and 2pm and this was contrary to his earlier statement made to PW2 that he could describe the victim`s younger daughter and that the victim carried jewellery on Mondays and Thursdays;
 (6). the times at which the victim would leave the house: The appellant said that the victim would leave the house between 12 noon and 2pm. In the statement of facts, it was stated that the appellant told him that the victim would leave the house between 12 noon and 1pm; and
 (7). PW7 said that the appellant told him that he would be contacted only after the robbery not long after the initial plan was made and that he would not drive his car to the scene but PW2 testified that he was told by PW7 that the plan involved a car and a motorcycle.
 44.The district judge held that the discrepancies raised by the defence were not material and did not affect the substratum of PW7`s testimony. He noted that most of the discrepancies arose when the evidence in court was compared with the statement of facts to which he pleaded guilty to. The district judge noted that the statement of facts was an important document but was not a witness`s statement and should not be treated as such. This view is consistent with 
PP v Liew Kim Choo
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 699
  where I noted that the statement of facts was not prepared by the accused but was made by the investigating officer or the DPP based on the evidence they had against the accused. A statement of facts is not to be accorded the same weight as a statement made to the police. When the statement of facts was admitted by PW7, it did not follow that he admitted to every fact contained in the statement since, so long as the major elements comprising the offence were not disputed, it did not matter that he did not agree with immaterial particulars: 
Chota bin Abdul Razak
 
[1991] SLR 675
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 77
 ; 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
 .
 45.Hence it followed that the statement of facts had to be treated with circumspection. The crux of what PW7 admitted in the statement of facts when he pleaded guilty was that he, together with the appellant, PW2, 3 and 4, were engaged in a conspiracy to rob the victim. In this respect, PW7`s evidence was consistent with the statement of facts. The other particulars were immaterial and, if the immaterial particulars were relied upon in subsequent proceedings, whether as evidential value or to impeach PW7, the evidential value of the statement of facts had to be diminished. The discrepancy was to the dates at which the conspiracy took place. However, given that the conspiracy was a continuing one which took place over a period of a year, the district judge held that this discrepancy was due to his confusion and failure to notice the dates referred to in the statement of facts. He held that the date or period in which the alleged discussions took place was only one aspect of whether there was such a meeting between PW7 and the appellant in which the subject of robbery was raised. What was important was that there was the undisputed evidence of PW2 and 4 that there was another conspirator, whose identity PW7 did not disclose, who was involved in the plan to rob PW1.
 46.As to the discrepancy of the venue where the discussion with the appellant about the robbery had taken place, PW7 explained in cross-examination that the discussion in the coffee shop preceded the discussion in the car. Counsel argued that PW7 was demonstrably lying when he said that the appellant was at that time driving a red Subaru when it was not disputed that the appellant did not have such a car but only a black Rover. The district judge held that it was not disputed that the appellant had driven a red Subaru at one time which he changed to a black Rover. The appellant had given lifts to PW7 in different cars and it was possible that PW7 made a genuine mistake. There was no reason to disturb the district judge`s finding.
 47.On the whole, there was ample evidence to support the district judge`s assessment of the evidence of PW7. It is settled law that an appellant court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge has seen and observed when giving evidence, unless the findings are clearly against the weight of evidence and unsupportable: 
PP v Hla Win
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
 . The appellant court will also usually defer to the trial judge`s conclusion on findings of fact based on the credibility of witnesses. Here the district judge considered that PW7 was an accomplice and treated his evidence with caution under s 116 illustration (b) Evidence Act. He also took into account that PW7 had already been convicted and sentenced prior to his testimony at the appellant`s trial. There was no reason for him to tailor his evidence to implicate the appellant, whether in the hope of absolving himself from liability or of obtaining a lighter sentence. He found that the inconsistencies and discrepancies in PW7`s evidence were not material. In this respect there was no reason for me to differ from the district judge that PW7 had given an account that was coherent and logical.
 48.Mr Shanmugam argued that, if the appellant was the mastermind, there was no reason why he was not to have a share in the loot, there was no communication between him and the appellant in 1996 save for a telephone call in July 1996 as stated by PW7 and the appellant did not assist in the disposal of the loot. The district judge found that the appellant was indeed the mastermind behind the robbery who tried to distance himself from the robbers as much as he could by altering the plans as originally envisaged, by not having his car used as a getaway car, and by informing PW7 that he was not to be contacted until after the robbery. He was still interested in the robbery and the conspiracy continued over a year. The robbery was carried out a year after the conspiracy only because accomplices had to be found and they had to wait for an opportunity to commit the robbery.
 49.In relation to the assessment of the evidence of the appellant, the district judge disbelieved him and found that he was an evasive witness. He found that there were numerous inconsistencies in his evidence. The appellant`s case was that there was no discussion with PW7 to rob PW1 and the only illegal discussion raised by PW7 was in the middle of 1995 when PW7 asked the appellant whether the latter was willing to buy old jewellery or stolen goods. The appellant had rejected PW7`s suggestion.
 50.The district judge found that the appellant was an untruthful witness. The appellant was evasive when he was cross-examined on the actual term used by PW7 on the subject of stolen goods. The appellant at first said that what was discussed was `stolen gold` and he later used the term `old gold`, and subsequently claimed that the two terms were the same when the DPP pointed out to him that there was no reason to get upset if only gold purchased from others was sold to him. After all DW2 testified that `old gold` meant second hand gold.
 51.The appellant tried to demonstrate his declining contact with PW7 by exhibiting Telecom records from July 1995 onwards which showed a decline in the number of calls to PW7. However, he conceded on cross-examination that he could have made calls using a telephone in the jewellery shop which would not be reflected in the records. Also, the appellant claimed that he was trying to avoid PW7 from July 1995 after PW7 suggested to him that he purchase illicit gold. Yet the telephone records (D2A) showed that there were no less than 40 times after that date when the appellant paged for PW7 or called him at home. Also, there was the evidence of PW 5 and 6 which demonstrated that there was contact between the appellant and PW7 after middle of 1995.
 52.In addition, it was not challenged that PW2, 3 and 4 knew the intimate details of PW1`s movements only through PW7. It was improbable that PW7 knew such details from sources other than from the appellant. The appellant knew PW1 and his movements. PW1 testified that the appellant had come to his house at Block 341 Ubi Avenue 1 to collect gold items, signifying that he knew where PW1 resided. Whenever he delivered gold items to Yong Heng Goldsmith, he would invariably carry them in two bags. When he left the jewellery shop after his deliveries, either the appellant or his brother (DW2) would escort him to his car parked near the shop.
 53.It was perhaps unfortunate that the district judge reasoned that PW7 was a less intelligent witness than the appellant because he did not even complete his Chinese Primary School leaving examination whilst the appellant had `O` levels. The educational standard of a person does not necessarily correlate to how intelligent a criminal may turn out to be. Nevertheless, from his demeanour in the witness box, the district judge found that he was not intelligent. He was not capable of conceiving and executing the plan without the appellant`s assistance. He would not have had detailed information on the victim other than through the appellant.
 54.The appellant needed only to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case. Nevertheless the appellant gave as an explanation why PW7 would have known the details of the movements of PW1. He said in the cautioned statement that PW7 noticed the victim as far back as in 1988 when PW1 visited the appellant`s jewellery shop. However, his explanation could not be accepted. It was wholly implausible that PW7 would wait ten years before robbing the victim.
 55.The district judge did not place any weight on the evidence of DW2 and 3. The evidence of the two defence witnesses was not crucial to the main issue, and the two witnesses were not impartial witnesses as they were close to appellant. It was most improbable for DW2 and 3 to remember the details of how, after PW7 had slammed down the telephone on the appellant, the appellant decided to sever contacts with PW7.
 56.I convicted therefore the appellant on the amended charge under s 394 read with s 109 Penal Code.
 57.
 Appeal against sentence
Since the charge was amended and the conviction was substituted to one of abetment by conspiracy of the offence of robbery causing hurt, the High Court sitting in its appellant capacity would have to consider the appropriate sentence under the amended charge. A charge under s 394 Penal Code carries a minimum sentence of five years and a maximum sentence of 20 years` imprisonment with mandatory caning of 12 strokes. The appellant was originally sentenced to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane under s 394 read with ss 397 and 109 Penal Code. That offence carried a mandatory minimum of imprisonment of five years and mandatory caning of 24 strokes. However s 11(3) CPC provides that a district court can only impose a maximum caning of 12 strokes of the cane.
 58.The mandatory minimum punishment for the offence under s 394 read with s 109 Penal Code is five years` imprisonment and at least 12 strokes of the cane. Under the reduced charge, the sentence of six years` imprisonment was appropriate, given the seriousness of the offence of robbery and the hurt which was in fact caused to the victim, and the fact that the appellant was the mastermind behind the offence. I also bore in mind that the appellant did not have any previous convictions. The result was that, whilst I directed the charge to be amended by deleting all references to the use of the knife, the sentence of six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane would not be disturbed. The appellant was convicted of the amended charge and the appeal against sentence was dismissed.",1998-09-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 On 24 April 1998, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges, first robbery in the furtherance of a common intention punishable under s 392 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224); secondly, the consumption of a Class `A` controlled drug, an offence under s 8(b) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). After conviction, a third charge was taken into consideration for sentencing, namely, the use of criminal force on a public servant with intent to deter the public servant from discharging his duty, an offence under s 353 of the Penal Code. On 6 June 1998, he was ordered to undergo reformative training in the Reformative Training Centre. Both the Public Prosecutor and the accused appealed against the sentence. After hearing arguments from both sides, I dismissed both appeals and now set out my reasons.

 4.
 The facts
With respect to DAC 27831/97, on 20 November 1997, at about 2.40am, the accused and his accomplices, Chai Tze Chiat and Lim Tong Lee Ramsis, boarded a taxi driven by Kok Siew Cheong in front of Jurong Entertainment Centre, along Jurong East Street 13. They then directed the driver to proceed to Jurong East Street 24. All three of them sat in the rear, with Chai Tze Chiat directly behind the driver. When they reached Jurong East Street 24, they further directed him to turn into the car park of Block 260, Jurong East Street 24. At about 2.50am, the accused alighted from the taxi. Chai Tze Chiat immediately took out a chopper, placed it on the right side of the driver`s neck, shouted ""robbery"" in Hokkien, and demanded money. The driver handed over $80 to Lim Tong Lee Ramsis. In an ensuing struggle, the driver injured his hands. He had lacerations on both his index fingers. The three accomplices ran from the scene and the accused was later given $30 as his share.
 5.At about 4.45 pm that day, the police arrested Chia Tze Chiat outside the Food Court, Jurong East Central, and seized $13 from him. On the next day, 21 November 1997, the police arrested the accused at his house and recovered his $30. At about 3.30 pm the following day, Lim Tong Lee Ramsis surrendered himself.
 6.As to MAC 13582/97, on 5 November 1997, at about 5.20pm, the accused was arrested on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug. He was then taken to Jurong Police Division HQ where a urine sample was taken . On analysis, the Department of Scientific Services stated that the sample contained a cannabinol derivate, a Class `A` controlled drug under the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 7.From the probation officer`s report, the accused had no previous convictions, but received a police caution in July 1997. He was then a member of the 24 Gi Hai Kim group, and had been arrested when he shouted the gang`s name several times during a funeral procession.
 8.The accused attended Yuhua Primary School, then Clementi Town Secondary School. He completed his `N` Levels in 1996. From his form teacher and principal`s reports, the accused first showed disinterest in his studies after his `N` Level examinations. In 1997, his behaviour was a cause of concern and he expressed a desire to leave school. The principal felt that this could be due to his mixing with bad company.
 9.Chia Tze Chiat (19 at the time of the offence) was sentenced to six years` jail and 24 strokes. Lim Tong Lee Ramsis (17 at the time of the offence) was granted 30 months` probation with conditions of residence at Teen Challenge, a time restriction from 10pm to 6am, 100 hours of community service, and a bond by each of his parents of $5,000.
 10.
 The decision below
Before passing sentence, the court called for a pre-sentence report and a reformative training centre report on the accused.
 11.In the pre-sentence report, the probation officer considered the accused`s circumstances and recommended 30 months` intensive probation with the following conditions: (a). voluntary residence at the hiding place for 18 months;
 (b). parents to be bonded to ensure his good behaviour;
 (c). time restriction from 10pm to 6am; and
 (d). 180 hours of community service after his discharge from the hiding place.
 12.In the reformative training centre report, the Director of Prisons found the accused suitable for reformative training.
 13.In determining the sentence, the following mitigating factors were considered. The accused pleaded guilty to the charges against him and he had no previous convictions. In respect of the charge of robbery, the accused was 18 years old, did not play a major role and did not hurt the taxi driver. He also co-operated with the police in their investigations and had been in remand since 3 December 1997. The probation officer`s report noted that the accused`s arrest, court appearances and time spent in remand seemed to have shaken him and he had resolved to change for the better.
 14.On the other hand, the court was of the view that the offence committed by the accused was serious. With respect to the robbery, the court recognised that taxi drivers were easy targets, especially when they ply the roads at night. Statistics provided by the prosecution showed a noticeable increase in such robberies last year (34 cases) as compared to 1996 (26 cases). Hence, it was imperative that such offences were dealt with severely to deter the accused and like-minded persons.
 15.The court was mindful of the sentences imposed on the accomplices of the accused to the robbery charge. A probation order was felt inappropriate in light of the factors above, the accused`s character, the nature and circumstances of the offence, as well as public interest. However, reformative training in the RTC was felt expedient.
 16.
 The appeal against sentence
The DPP urged that a deterrent sentence be imposed. The sentence imposed by the district judge was manifestly inadequate in light of the gravity of the offence, the character of the accused and the decision in 
 Lee Keng Lim v PP 
 (MAC 90/98/01, unreported). Counsel for the accused sought a lighter sentence.
 Principles of sentencing
 17.For the charge of robbery, s 392 of the Penal Code reads: 
if the robbery is committed after 7pm and before 7am the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years and not more than 14 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.
 18.Section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act refers to the Second Schedule where the sentence for a s 8(b) offence of consumption of a controlled drug is a maximum of ten years or $20,000 or both.
 19.The charge under s 353 of the Penal Code, of using criminal force on a public servant, was taken into consideration. Section 178(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) states: 
the accused shall not, unless the conviction which has been had is set aside, be liable to be charged or tried in respect of any such offence so taken into consideration.
 The effect of taking into consideration outstanding offences is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be awarded. The accused merely admits to these offences and must not be convicted of them. However, in doing so, the accused also saves the court time and trouble in determining his complicity in these offences. Ultimately, it is the court`s discretion whether to consider the offence or not.
 20.The provision on reformative training, s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code, reads: 
(1) Where a male person is convicted by the High Court or District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment, then if on the day of his conviction he is not less than 16 but under 21 years of age, and the Court is satisfied having regard to his character and previous conduct, and to the circumstances of the offence, that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may, in lieu of any other sentence, pass a sentence of reformative training.
 21.Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better. The corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young `don`t know any better` and they may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led and less controlled in their behaviour. However, there is no doubt that some young people can be calculating in their offences. Hence the court will need to assess the facts in every case.
 22.The judicial practice has been to require a probation report before sentencing a young offender. As per Ambrose J in 
Tan Kah Eng v PP
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 272
 : 
It is desirable that, as far as possible, the first offender under the age of 21 years should be kept out of prison, unless the offence is so serious that a sentence of imprisonment has to be imposed.
 23.In 
Teo Siew Peng v PP
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 125
 , some four young appellants, none of whom was above the age of 19 at the time of the offence, were first offenders who pleaded guilty to a sentence of gang robbery and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. On appeal, the court held that the appellate court would not alter the sentence imposed by the lower court unless it had erred in principle or that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In this instance, the appellate court did interfere for it was felt that the reformative factors involved in sentencing, the probation reports, the character and antecedents of the appellants had not been adequately considered. Quoting from 
R v Smith
 
[1964] Crim LR 70
: 
In the case of a young offender there can hardly ever be any conflict between the public interest and that of the offender. The public have no greater interest than that he should become a good citizen. The difficult task of the court is to determine what treatment gives the best chance of realizing that object. That realization is the first and by far the most important consideration.
 The sentence of imprisonment was thus set aside and substituted with binding-over orders.
 24.Tan Yock Lin, in his book 
 Criminal Procedure 
 (1997 Ed), at paras [2555]-[2600] states that judicial discretion should be exercised in favour of reformative training in cases where the offender, if let loose, will continue to mix with bad company, having in the first place been led to commit this offence as a result of the members of this company.
 25.There is a need to strike a balance between public interest and the interest of the offender.
 26.The DPP referred me to the decision in 
 R v Richardson & Ors 
 The Times, 10 February 1998, which held that some crimes were so heinous that a plea of youth, a plea that the crime was a first offence or that the offender had never been to prison before were of little relevance. The DPP then raised my decision in 
Yong Siew Soon v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 933
  in seeking a deterrent sentence similar to that imposed on Lee Keng Lim. There, I held that consistency in sentencing was a desirable goal, but it was not an overriding consideration, since the sentences in similar cases may have been either too high or too low.
 27.One of the accused`s accomplices, Lim Tong Lee Ramsis, 17 at the time of the offence, was convicted under s 392 read with s 397 (robbery when armed or with attempt to cause death or grevious hurt) and s 34 of the Penal Code. This offence was commited on 18 November 1997, and his accomplice was Lim Zhigang. A taxi driver was robbed of $104, a knife having been used to threaten the victim. On 20 November 1997, Lim committed an offence punishable under s 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Penal Code. This latter offence was taken into consideration in sentencing under the first offence. On 25 March 1998, Lim was allowed 30 months` probation. The district judge appears to have been influenced by the probation officer`s report and the fact that Lim had admitted himself at Teen Challenge. No appeal was made against this decision.
 28.Lee Keng Lim, 17 at the time of the offence, was convicted under s 392 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. His offence was committed on 20 November 1997, together with Lim Zhigang and Goh Tze Wei, Lim being 16 years of age while Goh was of the same age. A taxi driver was robbed of $280, a taxi vocational licence, a `Motorola` pager worth $200, a wrist watch valued at $70 and an identity card. On 18 March 1998, the district judge sentenced him to three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The accused lodged an appeal, but this was dismissed on 28 May 1998.
 29.The accused was not that young. He was now 18, fit for National Service. Probation is rarely granted in such a situation, which was why I queried Ramsis Lim`s order. The main factor in favour of the accused here was that he stepped out of the taxi before the injury occurred. This might have been done to facilitate the commission of the crime, with more space in the taxi. The accused`s parents had now come forth to take some blame. However, his school records were shameful, and he had been a member of a secret society. Also, there was the charge of consumption of a Class `A` controlled drug. He was clearly incorrigible. His counsel argued that he should not be sent to prison for fear that he would become a hard core criminal. However, he was already a confirmed criminal. Probation was clearly out of the question.
 30.On the issue of consistency of sentencing, in April and May 1998, two others who were in the same taxi as Lee Keng Lim, one of the same age, were in fact given reformative training. Chai Tze Chiat, the accused`s other accomplice, who was 19 at the time of the offence, was sentenced to six years` jail and 24 strokes of the cane. His sentence was the most harsh of the three as he had previous convictions.
 31.

In light of the above factors, I dismissed both appeals and upheld the decision below.",1998-09-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

 (delivering the grounds of decision of the court): 
 Background facts 
 1.The first appellant (Hong Lam) is a company incorporated in Singapore. The second appellant (Lim) is a director of Hong Lam and holds all but one of the shares in Hong Lam. He is also a director of a company, Wyno Marine Pte Ltd (Wyno), and holds 60% of the shares in that company. The respondent was at all material times the managing director of Wyno. On 1 November 1991, the respondent convened a meeting of Wyno`s creditors (the creditors` meeting), at which he informed the creditors that Wyno was insolvent. He promised them that he would do his best to help the creditors to recover their debts from Lim expeditiously, as several of them had helped him in the past and he found it unfair to them if they did not get paid. He further told the creditors that Hong Lam`s directors had received `kick-backs` from Wyno and that the payments were unlikely to be reflected in Wyno`s accounts. What he said was recorded in the minutes of the meeting, which were confirmed and signed by the creditors as well as by the respondent himself
 2.The creditors subsequently by a letter dated 12 November 1991 promised the respondent that in consideration of his co-operation with them in recovering their claims against Wyno, they would not commence any civil proceedings against him. They also undertook to draw the attention of the relevant prosecuting authorities to the assistance he had rendered them, should criminal proceedings be brought against him.
 3.On 22 November 1991, Wyno`s largest single creditor, Chong Lee Leong Seng Co Ltd (CLLS), petitioned for the winding up of Wyno in Companies Winding Up No 244 of 1991 (CWU No 244). CLLS also applied at the same time for appointment of provisional liquidators. In support of the application, one Lai Chong Meng (Lai), a director of CLLS, filed an affidavit alleging, inter alia, `highly irregular dealings` on the part of Lim and he produced a copy of the minutes of the creditors` meeting. The application was allowed and provisional liquidators were appointed on the same day pending the making of a winding up order. On 24 January 1992, the winding up order against Wyno was made and liquidators were appointed.
 4.Subsequently, Wyno (in liquidation) commenced an action against Hong Lam and Lim in Suit No 2274 of 1993 (Suit No 2274) claiming damages for all losses incurred by Wyno. The respondent was brought in as a first third party in that suit, and on discovery the document containing the minutes of the creditors` meeting was disclosed in the list of documents available for inspection.
 5.On 28 August 1996, Hong Lam and Lim (jointly referred to as `the appellants`) commenced this defamation action against the respondent. In their statement of claim, they averred that the respondent wrote and published or caused to be written and published the minutes of the creditors` meeting on 1 November 1991, and that the following words therein were defamatory of them: 
7 The following were mentioned verbally by Mr Koh in the present [sic] of the creditors. 
7.1 WM 102 & WM 103 
Akasaka Engine - approximately $70,000 as kick-back per engine was paid to Hong Lam`s directors. 
7.2 WM 102 
Contract between Hong Lam and Wyno was signed five months later after WM 102 was being built. 
(It is within Mr Koh`s acknowledge [sic] that Hong Lam in turn contracted with Asian Eternal Shipping to build the vessel for $13.1m.) 
8 Mr Koh said that he did ask for a set of Wyno`s accounts but he did not get it. There was also a payment of approximately $700,000 paid back to Hong Lam. Mr Koh further expressed that he did not think the kick-back and other payments to Hong Lam from Wyno would be reflected in the accounts anyway.
 They sought damages, as well as an injunction restraining the respondent from further publishing or causing to be published the words complained of. The claim was resisted, and in the defence filed the respondent raised the defences of justification, absolute privilege and qualified privilege.
 6.On 9 September 1997, the respondent by way of summons for further directions applied for an order that the statement of claim be struck out under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court and/or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court on the ground, inter alia, that the action was an abuse of the process of the court. The assistant registrar dismissed the respondent`s application. The respondent appealed to a judge in chambers. The appeal was allowed and the statement of claim was struck out and the action dismissed.
 7.
 The appeal
Against the decision of the learned judge in chambers this appeal was brought. We allowed the appeal and restored the order of the assistant registrar. We now give our reasons.
 8.There were two issues in this appeal. The first was whether the publication of the words complained of was made on an occasion of absolute privilege. This was one of the defences to the claim for defamation raised by the respondent, which if made good, was a complete defence to the claim. The second issue was entirely different and had nothing to do with any of the defences to the claim. It arose in this way. The appellants obtained the minutes of the creditors` meeting from a copy thereof exhibited in the affidavit of Lai that was filed in support of the application for the appointment of provisional liquidators in CWU No 244. The question was whether it was an abuse of the court process for the appellants to make use of this document which came to their knowledge as a result of that disclosure in those proceedings.
 9.On the first issue, counsel for the appellants submitted that no question of absolute privilege arose in respect of the respondent`s statements contained in the minutes of the creditors` meeting. He pointed out that the defamatory statements complained of were not made by the respondent in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. The creditors` meeting of 1 November 1991 was a meeting held by the creditors to decide what action should be taken against Wyno and the appellants. It was not even a meeting held in connection with any judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings.
 10.Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that the scope of absolute privilege should be extended to cover the statements contained in the minutes of the creditors` meeting. Counsel conceded that if the appellants had based their action on the words spoken by the respondent at the creditors` meeting and had pleaded slander, no defence of absolute privilege could arise. It was emphasised, however, that the appellants had based their action on the statements of the respondent as reduced into a written form, ie the minutes of the meeting, which was referred to in the affidavit of Lai filed in support of the application for the appointment of provisional liquidators. Thus, in the light of the rationale underlying the defence of absolute privilege in respect of statements made in judicial proceedings, namely, that witnesses should give evidence, whether orally or by way of affidavit, without fear of consequences to themselves or to others, it was submitted that this defence should be extended to the makers of statements relied upon by witnesses in their affidavits, as in this case by Lai in his affidavit.
 11.We were unable to accept the arguments of the respondents. The appellants based their claim on the alleged defamatory statements made by the respondent as recorded in the minutes at the meeting of creditors of Wyno. In their statement of claim, the appellants averred that on or about 1 November 1991 the respondent attended the creditors` meeting and there he `wrote and published or caused to be written and published` the words complained of. Those words were attributed to the respondent and they were reduced into the form of minutes of the meeting and he was one of the signatories of the minutes. Thus the appellants are relying on the publication of the defamatory words in those circumstances. The learned judge in his grounds of judgment said at [para ] 22: 
Applying these principles, the first point to be made is that the defendant was obviously not speaking in the course of proceedings before a court or tribunal when he made those statements at the creditors` meeting convened by himself. Since the liquidators, provisional or otherwise, were not yet on the scene, it could not be said also that the creditors` meeting was a matter incidental to judicial proceedings. The defendant therefore could not claim absolute privilege in making the statements at the creditors` meeting.
 In our opinion, the learned judge was right in his conclusion that there could not be any claim of absolute privilege in respect of the statements made by the respondent at the creditors` meeting.
 12.However, the learned judge went on further and referred to Lai`s affidavit filed in CWU No 244, which referred to the minutes of the creditors` meeting, and he held that the absolute privilege extended to the respondent as the maker of the statements in the minutes relied upon by Lai in his affidavit. With respect, the appellants were not basing their claim on the publication of the words complained of on that occasion. Their claim was founded on an earlier publication, ie on 1 November 1991 or thereabouts. In our judgment, no question of absolute privilege arose in respect of the publication relied upon by the appellants.
 13.We now turn to the second issue. It was not in dispute that the appellants came to know of the minutes from the copy thereof exhibited by Lai in his affidavit that was filed in the winding up proceedings. Arising from this disclosure the appellants initiated this action, and the question was whether it was an abuse of court process for the appellants to found an action of defamation on the alleged defamatory statements which they discovered in those proceedings. The learned judge held that it was. He applied the case of 
Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd
 
[1977] QB 881
 (which we shall discuss in a moment) with regard to the minutes disclosed in the affidavit of Lai, on the ground that Lim was very much involved in the winding up proceedings as he was a director of Wyno. Accordingly, he found that the document did not come to the appellants through a `wholly independent source`. Further, he rejected the appellants` argument that the disclosure of the minutes in question was through the affidavit of Lai filed voluntarily and not as a result of a disclosure in the process of discovery. He said at [para ] 31-33: 
31 The second plaintiff was also a director and majority shareholder of Wyno. Lai`s affidavit was filed in winding up proceedings commenced by a creditor of Wyno against the company. The second plaintiff was therefore very much involved in the proceedings which gave rise to the occasion for Lai`s affidavit. The second plaintiff was also a director and majority shareholder of the first plaintiff. In these circumstances, the first plaintiff cannot be said to be a total stranger to the winding up proceedings and Lai a wholly independent source. Similarly, the defendant here was the managing director of Wyno and was equally involved in the winding up proceedings. 
32 
33 The plaintiffs also raise the argument that disclosure by way of an affidavit is not disclosure by the process of discovery. I see no sensible distinction between documents disclosed generally as part of the process of discovery and those disclosed specifically by incorporation in affidavits. It is true, as the plaintiffs contend, that documents exhibited in affidavits are there due to a conscious choice to use them. However, the Riddick principle is premised not on whether a document is relied upon but on what comes to light as a result of the litigation between the parties. It need not be confined to discovery pursuant to O 24. What is so relevant as to find its way into an affidavit must surely be found in the list of documents exchanged in discovery anyway.
 He came to this conclusion after considering the following cases: 
Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd
 
[1977] QB 881
; 
Sony Corporation & Anor v Time Electronics
 
[1981] 3 All ER 376
; 
Sybron Corporation & Anor v Barclays Bank plc
 
[1985] Ch 299
; and the Singapore case of 
Sim Leng Chua v JE Manghardt
 
[1987] SLR 205
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 153
 . It is necessary to consider whether these cases are applicable to the affidavit of Lai filed in the companies winding up proceedings.
 14.In 
 Riddick 
, the plaintiff was dismissed from his employment in the defendant company. Two of the officers of the defendants treated the plaintiff very offensively in the dismissal. After informing the plaintiff that he was summarily dismissed, the two officers escorted him to a company`s car and there accompanied by a security officer he was driven to his own car. The plaintiff and his solicitor complained to the company about the dismissal and the manner in which it was effected. The chief personnel manager at the company`s head office then asked a colleague to ascertain the facts concerning the dismissal. That colleague made enquiries and gave a report in the memorandum to the chief personnel manager who read it and then filed it. The plaintiff sued the company for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. In the course of discovery in that action, the memorandum was disclosed. The action was eventually settled. Subsequently, the plaintiff commenced another action against the company for defamation based on the contents of the memorandum and obtained judgment in his favour at first instance. The company successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal. The court held that a party who had disclosed a document on discovery was entitled to the protection of the court against any use of it otherwise than in the action in which it was disclosed and that the plaintiff therefore could not use the memorandum disclosed in the first action as the basis for the subsequent defamation action. Lord Denning MR said at pp 895-896: 
Discovery of documents is a most valuable aid in the doing of justice. The court orders the parties to a suit - both of them - to disclose on oath all documents in their possession or power relating to the matters in issue in the action
 
The reason for compelling discovery of documents in this way lies in the public interest in discovering the truth so that justice may be done between the parties. That public interest is to be put into the scales against the public interest in preserving privacy and protecting confidential information. The balance comes down in the ordinary way in favour of the public interest of discovering the truth, ie in making full disclosure
 
I proceed to hold the balance in the present case. On the one hand discovery has been had in the first action. It enabled that action to be disposed of. The public interest there has served its purpose. Should it go further so as to enable the memorandum of 16 April 1969, to be used for this libel action? I think not. The memorandum was obtained by compulsion. Compulsion is an invasion of a private right to keep one`s documents to oneself. The public interest in privacy and confidence demands that this compulsion should not be pressed further than the course of justice requires. The courts should, therefore, not allow the other party - or anyone else - to use the documents for any ulterior or alien purpose. Otherwise the courts themselves would be doing injustice. Very often a party may disclose documents, such as inter-departmental memoranda, containing criticisms of other people or suggestions of negligence or misconduct. If these were permitted to found actions of libel, you would find that an order for discovery would be counter-productive. The inter-departmental memoranda would be lost or destroyed or said never to have existed. In order to encourage openness and fairness, the public interest requires that documents disclosed on discovery are not to be made use of except for the purposes of the action in which they are disclosed. They are not to be made a ground for comments in the newspapers, nor for bringing a libel action, or for any other alien purpose
 15.In 
 Sony Corporation v Time Electronics 
 (supra), the plaintiffs obtained an ex parte order against the defendants for delivery up of counterfeit goods. While executing the order, the plaintiffs` solicitor discovered goods of another type on the defendants` premises which were also similar to those manufactured by the plaintiffs. He instructed one of his employees to make a test purchase of those goods, and the purchase was made. Having examined those goods, the plaintiffs then initiated another action seeking ex parte an order to restrain the defendants from trading in the second type of goods. Goulding J allowed the application and held that the new action was not founded on something disclosed as a result of the earlier order but on the evidence obtained on the test purchase, which was an independent source. He said at pp 377-378: 
It is well established that a party who makes disclosure on discovery is entitled to the protection of the court against the facts or documents disclosed being used, otherwise than in the action in which disclosure took place, without special leave of the court given on proper grounds: see 
Riddick v Thames Board Mills Ltd
 
[1977] 3 All ER 677
[1977] QB 881
 
The new action is not founded on something that the court ordered to be disclosed in the earlier order. The real foundation of the present action is the evidence obtained on the test purchase. The observation by the solicitor of suspect goods, of the second class was merely a collateral matter in the execution of the order of 12 March and did not depend on that order for its justification. In other words a solicitor saw something that was there but it was not something that the court had ordered to be disclosed. He then obtained the evidence, which is sufficient in itself, by a test purchase.
 16.In 
 Sybron Corporation v Barclays Bank plc 
 (supra), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 1981 against the defendant bank (the 1981 action). After discovery had taken place, the plaintiffs decided to add other parties as defendants. In view of possible difficulties which might arise in relation to limitation, if those parties were added to the 1981 action, the plaintiffs decided to commence another action in 1983. The plaintiffs applied for leave in the 1983 action to refer to the documents discovered in the 1981 action. Scott J held that the plaintiffs could not make use of those documents or any information contained therein in any other proceedings without leave of the court having been first obtained, unless such information was from a wholly independent source. The learned judge said, at p 315: 
It is a rule established by several recent cases, to which I must later refer, that documents disclosed by a party under compulsion of court process, such as discovery, cannot be used by the party to whom they are thereby disclosed for any improper purpose. An implied undertaking not to use the documents for an improper purpose is imposed by the court on that party. Breach of that undertaking would represent a contempt of court: see 
Home Office v Harman
 
[1983] 1 AC 280
.
 The learned judge later said at p 318: 
The rule established by the authorities is usually expressed as a rule relating to documents and the use of documents. The rule must however apply to protect not only the documents themselves but also the contents of those documents Plainly, in my judgment, the undertaking must apply to the information derived from the discovered documents whether it be information embodied in a copy or stored in the mind. Accordingly, references in this judgment to use of documents should be taken to include use of information derived from the documents.
 However, the learned judge found that the causes of action in both sets of proceedings were the same and the new action was nothing more than a joinder of additional parties, although such joinder arose from the discovery made in the earlier action. In the unusual circumstances, the learned judge granted leave to the plaintiffs to use the documents for the purposes of the 1983 action.
 17.
 Riddick 
 was followed and applied by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in 
 Sim Leng Chua v JE Manghardt 
 (supra). In that case, the plaintiff sued a company for breach of contract and for inducing another party to breach a contract. On discovery the plaintiff came across a letter signed by the defendant, who was then an officer of the company, written to a third party. The plaintiff then commenced an action against the defendant for defamation. The defendant applied to strike out the action on the ground that it was an abuse of the process of the court. He relied on the 
 Riddick 
 principle which, it was contended, was equally applicable, notwithstanding that he was not a party to the earlier action. After considering at length 
 Riddick 
 and several other cases, the learned judge applied the 
 Riddick 
 principle to the case before him and held that the action against the defendant was an abuse of the process of the court, and he struck it out.
 18.
 Sim Leng Chua 
 was approved by this court in 
Stansfield Business International Pte Ltd & Anor v VCS Vardan
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 641
 . In that case, a solicitor, V, sued the defendant company and one of its directors for defamation. In the course of the proceedings on discovery various documents, including a letter of complaint against V to the Law Society of Singapore written by one of the directors of the defendant company, were disclosed. After the conclusion of that action, in which V obtained judgment against the defendant and its director, V applied by way of originating summons for discovery of all documents relating to the complaint to the Law Society under O 24 r 7A of the Rules of Court. The purpose of the application was to ascertain whether the defendant and its director had defamed V in their complaint to the Law Society. In opposing the application the defendant company by its director deposed to the fact that all the relevant documents V sought were already disclosed in the earlier action in the course of discovery, and invoked the 
 Riddick 
 principle. This was rejected and the application was allowed by the District Court, and on appeal, the High Court dismissed the appeal. The defendant and its director further appealed and this court allowed the appeal. It was held, inter alia, that the documents sought to be discovered were all the documents already discovered in the earlier action, and as the stated object of the application was to make use of those documents to sue the defendant and its director for defamation, the 
 Riddick 
 principle would prevent V from using the documents for that purpose. The intended use of those documents was for an `ulterior and improper purpose` and was not permissible. Delivering the judgment of the court, Karthigesu JA said: 
20 In our judgment, too, the learned district judge and the learned judge erred in holding that the rule in 
 Riddick 
`s case did not apply; see [para ] 16 above. With respect they both seem to have missed the point of appellants` counsel`s submission. The rule in 
 Riddick 
`s case is founded on public interest. It is that `Public interest requires that documents disclosed on discovery are not to be made use of except for the purpose of the action in which they are disclosed` the rule in 
 Riddick 
`s case prevents the respondent for using those documents to sue the appellants for defamation. Thus, obtaining the order for discovery, to use the words of Lord Denning in 
 Riddick 
`s case, was for an `ulterior and improper purpose`. The rule should not be used for such a purpose. It is an abuse of process.
 19.In each of these cases, namely, 
 Riddick 
, 
 Sybron Corporation 
, 
 Sim Leng Chua 
 and 
 Stansfield Business 
, the document in question was disclosed on discovery in the course of legal proceedings, ie under compulsion of court process, and the party to whom the document was disclosed was held to be subject to an implied undertaking to court not to use the document for any purpose otherwise than in the proceedings in which the document was disclosed. Such undertaking was held to extend to information derived from the disclosed document. The rationale for this rule was recently stated by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in 
 Derby & Co Ltd v Weldon (No 2) 
 The Times, 20 October 1988 as follows: 
[D]iscovery in the course of an action is an interference with the right of privacy which an individual would otherwise enjoy in relation to his own documents. As a result of the public interest in ensuring that all relevant information is before the court in adjudicating on the claim in the action, that right of privacy is invaded and the litigant is forced, under compulsion by the process of discovery, to disclose his private documents. But, such invasion of privacy being only for the purpose of enabling a proper trial of the action in which the discovery is given, the court is astute to prevent a document so obtained from being used for any other purpose. As a result the law is well established that the recipient of documents disclosed under compulsion of court proceedings holds those documents subject to an implied undertaking not, without the consent of the court, to disclose such documents to any third party or use the documents for any purpose other than the action in which they were disclosed. I will refer to that undertaking as `the implied undertaking`. A breach of the implied undertaking is a contempt of court.
 20.More recently, in 
Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Fountain Page Ltd & Ors
 
[1991] 1 WLR 756
[1991] 3 All ER 878
, Hobhouse J said, at p 765: 
The rational basis for the rule is that where one party compels another, either by the enforcement of a rule of court or a specific order of the court, to disclose documents or information whether that other wishes to or not, the party obtaining the disclosure is given this power because the invasion of the other party`s rights has to give way to the need to do justice between those parties in the pending litigation between them; it follows from this that the results of such compulsion should likewise be limited to the purpose for which the order was made, namely, the purposes of that litigation then before the court between those parties and not for any other litigation or matter or any collateral purpose
 21.In our opinion, the 
 Riddick 
 principle applies to documents disclosed under compulsion of court process, whether by virtue of the enforcement of the rules of the court or by a specific court order. It has no application to documents voluntarily disclosed in legal proceedings; the implied undertaking does not apply to such documents. In 
 Derby & Co Ltd v Weldon (No 2) 
 (supra), Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C said: 
The voluntary disclosure of documents in the course of interlocutory proceedings by a party does not come within the rationale which is the basis of the implied undertaking relating to documents disclosed on discovery. In relation to documents voluntarily disclosed the court has not invaded the privacy of the party. The party has, for his own purposes in defending a case, decided himself to use the documents rather than maintain his privacy. It is the party who has destroyed the privacy of the document, not the plaintiff or the court it is an unavoidable consequence of all litigation that a party who chooses to put in evidence, necessarily risks that such evidence becomes available to others. In my judgment the special protection given to documents disclosed under compulsion of discovery procedures does not apply to any wider class of documents.
 22.In 
Hasselblad (GB) Ltd v Orbinson
 
[1985] QB 475
, the plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant for defamation contained in a letter written by the latter on behalf of his company to the Commission of the European Communities at the invitation of the Commission. The Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that since the letter was not written to the Commission under any compulsion or on any implied condition that it should be used for the purposes of the proceedings before the Commission the 
 Riddick 
 principle had no application.
 23.In 
 Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Fountain Page Ltd & Ors 
, the plaintiffs instituted proceedings (the London proceedings) against four defendants in the High Court. Pursuant to directions of the court made under O 38 rr 2A and 37 of the Rules of Supreme Court, the plaintiffs were required to serve on the defendants witness statements and experts` reports. The action was eventually settled before trial, but the defendants retained the witness statements and the experts` reports. Subsequently, two insurance companies in Texas initiated proceedings against the fourth defendants claiming damages for, inter alia, tortious interference with contract and prospective business relations and negligent misrepresentation. Pursuant to letters of request issued by the Texan court witnesses were examined in London for the Texan proceedings. During the examination it was found that documents, which came into existence in the London proceedings, were being used and these included the witness statements and the experts` reports. The examiner then required the fourth defendants to apply to court for release of the implied undertaking not to use those documents. The fourth defendants applied to court for determination as to whether the witness statements and the experts` reports were subject to any restriction on their use other than in the London proceedings.
 24.Hobhouse J held that as parties were at liberty to decide what material they wished to adduce in evidence, the witness statements and experts` reports could not be said to be served under any compulsion and were therefore not subject to the restriction as to use on the basis of an implied undertaking not to use the documents other than for the purpose of those proceedings in which they were disclosed. The learned judge said, at p 769: 
From these authorities it is clear that there is no blanket restriction on the use of documents and information acquired in the course of litigation. Prima facie there is no restriction. The compulsion exception is confined to documents and information which a party is compelled, without any choice, to disclose. Where a party has a right to choose the extent to which he will adduce evidence or deploy other material, then there is no compulsion even though a consequence of such choice is that he will have to disclose material to other parties. On the authority of the 
 Comfort Hotels
 case and 
 Derby & Co Ltd v Weldon (No 9)
, witness statements and experts` reports served pursuant to the provisions of O 38 or directions given thereunder are not served under compulsion and are not protected by the duties or undertakings which the court implies where there is compulsion.
 25.The learned judge further held that such an obligation would be implied where, on a true construction of the rules of court under which a document was served, any rights of confidentiality or privilege in the document had been reserved. Reverting to the case before him, the learned judge held that there was no confidentiality attached to the experts` reports since under the rules once they had been served on the other party, that party was at liberty to use them; but as for the witness statements, under the rules they remained privileged until the party serving them decided to use them in court, and hence the party who had been served with the witness statements was subject to the implied duty owed to court not to use them for any purpose save at the trial of the action in which the statements were served.
 26.In the case at hand, the appellants came to know of the minutes of the creditors` meeting through the affidavit of Lai in the winding up proceedings against Wyno, and Lim being a director and a shareholder of Wyno was not a `total stranger` to the proceedings. The minutes therefore did not come to the appellants from an independent source. But the fact remained that the document did not come to light as a result of any compulsion of court process, such as discovery. It was voluntarily produced by Lai in support of the application by CLLS for the appointment of provisional liquidators in the winding up proceedings. The appellants are not subject to any obligation to court, express or implied, not to use the document for any purpose save in the winding up proceedings against Wyno. Nor has the document any rights of confidentiality or privilege attached to it. The use of that document by the appellants for the purpose of this action was not an abuse of court process.",1998-09-23 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 (delivering the grounds of decision of the court): There were originally two accused persons jointly tried in the High Court. The first accused, Bryan Yeo Sin Rong (`the first accused`), was charged under s 7 read with s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Misuse of Drugs Act`) with attempting to export not less than 2,109g of diamorphine from Singapore to Taipei. The charge against the second accused, Chai Chien Wei Kelvin, read as follows: 
That you, Chai Chien Wei Kelvin, on 13 January 1998, at Changi Airport Terminal 2, Singapore, did engage with one Bryan Yeo Sin Rong, male aged 26 years, NRIC No S7144064H, in a conspiracy to do a certain thing, namely, to export a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, thirty-six (36) blocks of compressed substance containing not less than 2,109 grams of diamorphine from Singapore to Taipei by the said Bryan Yeo Sin Rong, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and in pursuance of the said conspiracy and in order for the doing of that thing, an act took place in the shower room of Transit Hotel, Changi Airport namely, you strapped the said drugs, which you transported into Singapore, onto the body of the said Bryan Yeo Sin Rong using masking tape and other tapes in order to enable him to transport the said drugs out of Singapore, and you have thereby abetted the commission of the offence by the said Bryan Yeo Sin Rong of attempting to export the said drugs from Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 Both accused were convicted of the respective charges against them. Only the second accused (`the appellant`) appealed against his conviction and sentence. We dismissed the appeal at the conclusion of the hearing and now give our reasons. It is necessary to set out and deal in detail with the evidence adduced in the court below as one of the principal grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant was that, at the close of its case against the appellant, the prosecution had not made out a case against him which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. We begin with the background facts to the case.
 2.
 The background facts
The first accused was arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) at 4.54pm on 13 January 1998 at the Boarding Room at Gate E11, Terminal 2, Changi International Airport (`Changi Airport`). The arresting officers were W/ASP Diong Bee Chu (`W/ASP Diong`), Sgt Eddy Razali, Sgt Xavier Dawes and Sgt Heng Chin Kok. The first accused was brought to the Search Room at Gate E11 where more CNB officers later arrived. They were Sgt Ting Ming Ling, S/Sgt Lee Chai Hwa and Sgt Tan Teck Hoe. W/ASP Diong asked the first accused whether he had anything to surrender and the first accused took off his sweater and shirt and revealed numerous brown blocks strapped to his body under his T-shirt. At the Search Room, five blocks fell off the first accused`s body and were retrieved by W/ASP Diong. Shortly thereafter, the CNB officers brought the first accused to the CNB office in the North Wing. Along the way, another two blocks fell off the first accused`s body when the party was outside Gate E5 and another block fell off outside Gate E1. At the CNB North Wing office, nine more blocks fell off. All of these blocks were retrieved by W/ASP Diong. A total of 36 blocks were recovered from the first accused`s body. They were sent for analysis and were found to contain not less than 2,109g of diamorphine. The first accused was accordingly charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act with attempting to export the said diamorphine.
 3.W/ASP Diong questioned the first accused at the CNB North Wing office and recorded her questions together with his answers on a piece of paper which the first accused signed. This evidence which was not challenged by the defence was as follows: 
Q1: What do you have inside your shirt? 
A1: I don`t know. 
Q2: Where did you get these things? 
A2: Now I know I get arrested, I rather die one person. 
Q3: Where did you get it? 
A3: Inside the airport. 
Q4: So you got it today? 
A4: Yes. 
Q5: Do you want to say who gave it to you? 
A5: I don`t want to be a hero but I don`t want to be a bastard. [Pause.] I don`t know what to say. 
Q6: Do you have anything else to say regarding the things on your body? 
A6: No.
 4.Insp S Krishnan (`Insp Krishnan`), the investigating officer, arrived at the CNB North Wing Office at 5.50pm and took over from W/ASP Diong. At 7.15pm three members of the Scene of Crime Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department arrived at the CNB North Wing office and the blocks of taped matter strapped to the torso of the first accused were photographed. Of the 36 blocks that were recovered from the first accused, 17 had fallen off his body en route from the Boarding Room at Gate E11 to the CNB North Wing office. Nineteen were still strapped to the first accused`s body. Photography of the first accused and the exhibits ended at 8.25pm and five minutes later Insp Krishnan took the accused back to CNB headquarters, arriving there at about 9pm. Insp Krishnan weighed the drugs and then took them to the CNB`s Major Investigation Branch (`MIB`) at Outram Road at 9.40pm.
 5.The appellant arrived at Changi Airport at 2.50pm on the same day from Bangkok. He was later spotted by Sgt David Ng at 4.15pm at the Transit Lounge where he was seen talking to the first accused. The first accused and the appellant parted company at 4.25pm. The first accused headed toward Gate E11 and the appellant headed toward the immigration counters for clearance. At 8.10pm that evening, the appellant was arrested in his flat at Lengkok Bahru by a party of CNB officers led by Insp Francis Jeyaraje (`Insp Jeyaraje`). A search was conducted and nothing incriminating was found but the arresting party seized a number of articles belonging to the appellant including a blue carrier bag, a long-sleeved shirt, a black T-shirt and a black pair of jeans. Insp Jeyaraje then handed over the seized items and custody of the appellant to ASP William Chew (`ASP Chew`) who arrived as a second party together with Sgt Quek Hock Hoe and Sgt Chan Poh Huat. ASP Chew and his party left the appellant`s flat at 8.50pm and arrived at the CNB`s MIB at 9pm. A urine sample was taken from the appellant and sent for analysis. No trace of drug substances was found. A brown pullover was subsequently handed over by Insp Chow Toong Chee (`Insp Chow`) to Insp Krishnan. This pullover was reported to have been seized from the appellant at his flat. The significance of this pullover was that it was the prosecution`s case that it was worn by the first accused when he went to the airport, but subsequently exchanged it for the black sweater worn by the appellant when the latter arrived from Bangkok.
 6.
 The first accused`s statements
The first accused made a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) on 14 January 1998 to Insp Krishnan (P34). This statement was recorded from 4.12am to 4.25am on 14 January 1998 after the first accused had been sent for a pre-statement medical examination. The first accused also made a much longer statement under s 121 of the CPC which was recorded in two parts, the first being completed by 2.10am on 14 January 1998 and the second by 8pm on 15 January 1998. The two parts of this statement were collectively marked as P36. At trial counsel for the first accused challenged the admissibility of these statements on the ground that they were not made voluntarily. The first accused`s statement given to W/ASP Diong (P32) was not challenged.
 7.
 The first accused`s voir dire
The first accused alleged that he had made these statements under duress and inducement. He complained that, in the course of the initial interrogation by DSP S Vijakumar (`DSP Vijakumar`), he was told that `the rope was round his neck` and that he was to tell the truth because DSP Vijakumar could tell if he was lying merely by looking at his eyes. He was also told that if he did not tell the truth DSP Vijakumar would damage his face. The first accused was knocked on the head by DSP Vijakumar when he gave an answer which DSP Vijakumar was not satisfied with. According to the first accused, this occurred only once. He testified that at the end of the interview, he thought that the officers would help take the rope off his neck, by which he meant that he thought that he would face a lesser charge. Counsel for the first accused submitted that this threat, inducement or promise remained impressed in the mind of the first accused when he gave his statements to Insp Krishnan, though there were no complaints against Insp Krishnan himself in so far as any threat, inducement or promise was concerned. These allegations against DSP Vijakumar were denied by him and SS/Sgt Wong Wah Yan (`SS/Sgt Wong`) who was present during the interview by DSP Vijakumar.
 8.The learned judicial commissioner was not sufficiently convinced, bearing in mind that the onus of proof was on the defence to raise a reasonable doubt, that DSP Vijakumar and SS/Sgt Wong had told the first accused that they would help take the rope off his neck or that he had been knocked on the head, albeit that this occurred only once. In any event, the learned judicial commissioner did not think that a knock on the head in the manner described by the first accused was sufficient duress. Nor could a call to co-operate be regarded as a threat or inducement even if it was accompanied, as in this case, by a remark that the first accused would be allowed to call his wife if he co-operated. Similarly, a statement to the first accused not to lie because DSP Vijakumar could tell whether or not he was lying merely by looking at his eyes could not be considered a threat, inducement or promise. After considering the evidence, the learned judicial commissioner was satisfied that the statements of the first accused had been made without any threat, inducement or promise from the CNB officers. Accordingly, the learned judicial commissioner admitted the statements in evidence.
 9.
 The first accused`s statements - P36 and P34
From the first accused`s statements recorded on 14 and 15 January 1998 and admitted collectively as P36 emerged the following version of the events leading to his arrest. On 13 January 1998 at about 9am, the first accused received a paging call from the appellant who called from Thailand. The first accused called the appellant from a public telephone. The latter asked if the first accused`s visa to Taiwan was ready. The first accused answered in the affirmative but said that he did not have enough money to travel. The appellant then instructed the first accused to go to his (the appellant) grandmother`s house at Yung An Road and collect $300 from her to purchase the air ticket to Taiwan. The appellant also told the first accused to meet him at the Transit Lounge of Terminal 2, Changi Airport around 3pm. The appellant said that he would be arriving on board a Singapore Airlines plane from Bangkok around 3pm. The first accused agreed to meet the appellant as discussed. The first accused duly collected the money from the appellant`s grandmother, one Lim Say Ma (`Lim`), at her flat at Yung An Road at about 10am and used it in partial payment of a return ticket to Taiwan (which cost $990). Lim gave evidence that between 10am and 10.30am on 13 January 1998 she gave $300 to a friend (the first accused) of her grandson (the appellant). She identified the first accused as the person who came to her house and collected the $300 from her from a photograph of the first accused shown to her by a CNB officer at about 11.10am on 15 January 1998. She also testified that the appellant had telephoned her earlier that morning and told her to prepare $300 and give it to his friend. There was no other evidence as to why Lim handed $300 to the first accused other than the reason set out in his statement.
 10.The first accused arrived at Terminal 2, Changi Airport at about 3.20pm. After clearing immigration he made his way to the Transit Lounge where he saw the appellant waiting for him. The appellant asked the first accused to follow him to the Transit Hotel so that he (the appellant) could pass the `things` to the first accused as they were still strapped to his body. The first accused paid the cashier at the shower room of the Transit Hotel $10.30 for the use of the shower room by two persons. The cashier who gave evidence confirmed that the price for the use of the shower room was $5.15 per person and that when a receipt for $10.30 was issued that meant that 2 persons had paid to use the shower room. In his statement made on 15 January 1998 (P36), the first accused identified the signature on a receipt (P53) acknowledging payment for the use of the shower room as his.
 11.The first accused then gave a detailed account of how the appellant removed several blocks of substance wrapped in masking tape from his body and strapped them to the first accused`s body. This is what he said: 
Both of us then entered a shower room and closed the door. Kelvin [the appellant] removed his black pullover and his white shirt which he was wearing inside. I noticed that he had several blocks wrapped in masking tape strapped to his body by strips of bandages and blue sticky tape. When I saw it, I suspected it to be heroin and I became angry because there were so many blocks. I then told Kelvin that I did not want to do the job. Kelvin then told [sic] that it was too late to back out as he was already with the heroin [sic] for me to carry to Taiwan. Kelvin then took out all the blocks of heroin from his body. I saw him throw the used blue sticky tapes into the dustbin. He then used the same three strips of bandages which he had earlier used and strapped the blocks of heroin to my body. I saw him take a blue roll of sticky tape and a roll of brown masking tape from his bag and used it to tape the heroin blocks in two rows over my abdomen and back. I did not notice what Kelvin did with the balance of the two rolls of blue tape and brown tape. After this, I put on my white T-shirt, white long-sleeved shirt and Kelvin lent me his black pullover which he was earlier wearing. We both then walked out of the shower room to the Transit Lounge. He then gave me 9,300NT (Taiwanese currency) for my expenses. This is worth about a few hundred S`pore dollars. He then told me to call him on his handphone for further instructions once I reach Taiwan. Kelvin confirmed that I would be paid $8,000 to $9,000 upon my return to S`pore if I successfully completed the trip.
 In the second part of P36, the first accused added that he in turn handed his sweater to the appellant before he proceeded to the Boarding Room where he was arrested. The first accused later identified a brown sweater (P54) seized from the appellant`s flat as the sweater he handed to the appellant at the shower room. There was no other evidence or explanation as to why the two accused persons exchanged sweaters.
 12.In his further statement recorded on 15 January 1998, the first accused elaborated as follows. About a month previously, a former colleague of his, one Jeffrey Goh Keng Siong @ Ah Keng (`Goh`) asked him if he would like to earn some quick money simply by carrying some things from Singapore to Taiwan. Goh did not specify what these `things` were but promised that the first accused would be paid $8,000 to $9,000 if he succeeded in carrying the things to Taiwan. The first accused agreed and gave Goh his pager number. Goh went to Bangkok on 9 January 1998. On 10 January 1998, the first accused collected his visa to Taiwan. On either 10 or 11 January 1998, Goh telephoned the first accused and told him that his (Goh`s) boss would contact him using a handphone (number 8256580) with a code (825).
 13.Sometime in the morning of 13 January 1998, the first accused saw the number `825` appear on his pager. He telephoned Goh`s boss who passed the call to the appellant. The first accused was surprised to hear the voice of the appellant as he did not know that the latter knew Goh or Goh`s boss. (The first accused and the appellant first met a few months ago at a brothel in Geylang and became friends. Both had wives in Thailand and had subsequently met up in Bangkok where they partied together in discotheques with their respective Thai wives.) The first accused stated that the appellant did not bother to tell him how he knew Goh`s boss or how he was involved in the deal. The appellant merely wanted to know whether the first accused`s visa to Taiwan was ready.
 14.The first accused reiterated that he only suspected the blocks he was arrested with to be heroin when he saw them strapped round the appellant`s body. Goh had never told him what the `things` he was to carry were but he suspected that they were ecstasy pills because he had heard that demand in Taiwan for ecstasy pills was high. He expressed his reluctance to carry the blocks but the appellant said that he had already done his part and it was the first accused accused`s turn to carry on. The first accused concluded his statement by saying that he would never have done it if he had known it was heroin.
 15.The first accused`s cautioned statement (P34) was as follows: 
I plead for leniency. Let fate decide the consequences. I didn`t know the consequences was [sic] so serious. Actually, I have not intention of doing it. I was afraid that if I turned down my friend Kelvin Chai who already brought down the drugs from Bangkok, my boss in Bangkok would cause harm to my wife who is a Thai.
 16.
 The appellant`s statements
The appellant made three statements. The first was a CPC s 121 statement recorded by ASP Chew from 1.20am to 3.25am on 14 January 1998 (P33). The second was a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the CPC and was recorded by Insp Krishnan from 5.40am to 6am on 14 January 1998 (P35). On 16 January 1998, Insp Krishnan recorded two more statements from the appellant (also under s 121 of the CPC) which are collectively referred to as P37. Counsel for the appellant challenged the admissibility of these statements on the ground of involuntariness.
 17.
 The appellant`s voir dire
The thrust of the challenge was that the appellant had been induced to make those statements. The inducement was substantially in the form of what SS/Sgt Wong and DSP Vijakumar had said to the appellant when they interviewed him at 12.10am on 14 January 1998 in the conference room of the MIB. It was alleged that SS/Sgt Wong showed the appellant a photocopy of a newspaper report from The Straits Times on 9 July 1996 (D3), the title of which was `Drug trafficker escapes death sentence narrowly: helped with CNB investigations, so charge reduced.` It was alleged that after showing him this article, SS/Sgt Wong and DSP Vijakumar told the appellant that if he co-operated he would not get the death penalty. The appellant testified that he was shown D3 three times during the interview. At first he merely glanced at it, but on the last occasion he read it and realised that the trafficker in the story co-operated and was not charged with a capital charge.
 18.Counsel for the appellant submitted that the inducement from the use of D3 operated in the mind of the appellant throughout. There was also the evidence of the appellant that in the course of recording his statements ASP Chew and Insp Krishnan had told him to co-operate (although D3 was no longer brandished before him) and that he had been promised a lesser charge. Counsel also alleged that the statements recorded by ASP Chew and Insp Krishnan were never read back to the appellant. Reference was made to the fact that the acknowledgment in P33 that the statement had been read over was recorded by hand whereas the rest of the statement was in typed form. Coupled with the fact that the hand-written part was numbered as para 11 when the continuing statement P37 also commenced with a para 11, this supported the appellant`s allegation that the statements were not read over to him. Thus the defence case was that the statements were recorded by a recital of the events by the recording officer and the appellant agreed to them because he had been told to co-operate, and he did so because of the hope offered to him in the form of D3.
 19.The learned judicial commissioner found that the appellant had raised a reasonable doubt over the question of whether or not D3 was shown to him. He also found that all three statements, P33, P35 and P37, were equally tarnished as the hope offered to the appellant in the form of D3 could have influenced the appellant for a few days after D3 was shown to him. The nature of the inducement from the showing of D3 was the creation of the thought that as long as the appellant co-operated with the CNB he would receive the benefit accorded to the accused in the D3 case. In the circumstances, it was not safe to admit the appellant`s statements. If the appellant believed that he might get his charge reduced so long as he co-operated, then the mere fact that he was actually charged with a capital charge instead of a lesser charge may not have sufficiently dispelled his belief unless there was evidence that the appellant clearly knew that the hope held out to him was false or had been withdrawn by the time his statements were recorded.
 
 Other evidence
Goh`s statement
 20.The prosecution called Goh. There was evidence that Goh had been arrested on 16 April 1998 on a trafficking charge but dealt with by a separate unit of the CNB which deals with persons detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) (`CLTPA`). Leave was granted to the prosecution for his evidence to be given orally, but at the end of Goh`s testimony which (other than acknowledging his friendship with the first accused) was rather innocuous, the DPP applied to treat Goh as a hostile witness and have his previous written statement admitted under s 147 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (`the Evidence Act`). The recording officer and Goh were called to give evidence of the voluntariness of this statement. The learned judicial commissioner was satisfied that the statement was given voluntarily and admitted the statement as P78.
 21.In his statement, Goh stated that he was a security guard at the Jurong Country Club and identified both accused persons from photographs shown to him by Insp Krishnan. He went to Bangkok on 9 January 1998 and met the appellant and one Simon, who told Goh to stay at the appellant`s apartment instead of the cheap hotel he had initially checked into. Sometime in the morning of 13 January 1998, Simon went to the appellant`s apartment. He told Goh to wait outside for a while before calling him back in. When Goh returned, he saw Simon about to finish strapping several blocks to the appellant`s body. The blocks which were wrapped in masking tape were strapped to the front and back of the appellant`s body and were supported by tape. Goh also noticed several rolls of masking tape, plastic sheets, a pair of scissors and a knife lying around a white paper bag on the bed. This was the same paper bag which the appellant had collected the day before from a male Thai. Goh then heard the appellant and Simon say that the first accused would be meeting the appellant at Changi Airport for the transfer of the drugs.
 The shower room receipt, brown sweater and the first accused`s competence in the English language
 22.In addition to Goh`s statement, evidence was adduced of a receipt issued for the use of the shower room at the Transit Hotel by two persons. The receipt was issued on 13 January 1998 at 3.49pm and bore the signature of the first accused. In his statement made on 15 January 1998 (P36), the first accused identified the signature on the receipt acknowledging payment for the use of the shower room (P53) as his.
 23.The prosecution also called Insp Chow to prove that the brown sweater (P54) was seized by him from the appellant`s flat on 15 January 1998 on the instructions of Insp Krishnan.
 24.Lastly, the learned DPP called Wu Nan Yong (Wu), an interpreter at the CNB, who was asked by Insp Krishnan to act as interpreter for the first accused when his statement P36 was being recorded. Wu testified that he never had a chance to do his job because the first accused would answer Insp Krishnan in English as soon as the questions were asked. After half an hour, the first accused went to the toilet and Wu took the opportunity of asking Insp Krishnan to dispense with his services. When the first accused returned, he agreed that he did not require an interpreter and signed a short statement to that effect in Insp Krishnan`s field book.
 
 Close of the prosecution case
The first accused
 25.Counsel for the first accused declined to make any submissions at the close of the prosecution case. The learned judicial commissioner held that the elements constituting the charge against the first accused had, prima facie, been established. The first accused was arrested with heroin strapped to his body. When he was questioned by W/ASP Diong after his arrest, he said that he did not know what he was carrying but he obviously knew he was carrying something illegal because he said `Now I know I get arrested I rather die one person` when he was asked where he had obtained the `things` strapped to his body. However, in his statement P36, he stated that he thought he was carrying ecstasy tablets. Even if that were true, the first accused had to explain to the satisfaction of the court that he believed that ecstasy tablets were not illegal substances and that he had no reasonable opportunity to examine the contents of what he was carrying. The first accused was therefore called to enter upon his defence. He elected to remain silent and offered no evidence in his defence.
 The appellant
 26.Counsel for the appellant made a submission of no case to answer. Essentially, this was that the entire evidence of the prosecution must be examined at that stage so that inconsistencies which were fundamental and sufficient to nullify the charge could be taken into account. Counsel then set out a list of primary facts from which, in his submission, the irresistible inference must be drawn that the appellant was not involved in abetting the first accused in his attempt to export the drugs. In other words, counsel`s submission was that there was no evidence of conspiracy.
 27.The learned judicial commissioner found that there was evidence of conspiracy. In his statement P36, the first accused stated that he received a telephone call from the appellant on the morning of 13 January 1998. The latter asked if his visa to Taiwan was ready. The first accused was instructed to collect $300 from the appellant`s grandmother to help him pay for his airfare to Taipei and to meet the appellant at the Transit Lounge of Terminal 2, Changi Airport at 3pm. In the shower room of the Transit Hotel, the first accused took over the drugs from the appellant and strapped them to his body. There was also the evidence of Goh, who was in Bangkok on the morning of 13 January 1998 where he met the appellant, that he heard the appellant telling Simon that he (the appellant) would be meeting the first accused at Changi Airport to transfer the drugs. Counsel strenuously argued that Goh`s statement was unreliable because Goh had disavowed it in court. The learned judicial commissioner held, however, that: 
at this stage of the proceedings, the court need not make a final evaluation of the worth of the evidence. The test is whether there is some evidence of conspiracy, and if so, whether that evidence is inherently incredible. The evidence from the statements of the first accused and Goh indicate that there was communication of a plan and from the acts that followed one must infer that the plan was to transport the drugs from Bangkok to Singapore to Taipei. The mere meeting between the two accused persons at Changi Airport may not give rise to any special inference, nor would the mere handing over of money by the appellant`s grandmother to the first accused be cause for suspicion. The exchange of pullovers between the two accused at the airport by itself is innocuous. However, all these events must be considered in the context of what the first accused said in his statement.
 In the circumstances, the learned judicial commissioner found that the prosecution had established sufficient evidence for him to call upon the defence of the appellant. In the event, the appellant elected to remain silent and offered no evidence in his defence.
 
 Final submissions and conclusions in the court below
The first accused
 28.Counsel for the first accused submitted that the first accused`s defence was that he had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles strapped to his body. He accepted that the presumption under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act applied, but argued that the presumption could be rebutted by the evidence from the prosecution itself. In particular, he referred to the part of the statement P32 made by the first accused where the first accused said he did not know, when asked by W/ASP Diong, what was inside his shirt. Counsel further submitted that the bundles were so tightly wrapped (that even the police photographer had to cut them open) that the first accused could not have had the opportunity to inspect their contents. Counsel explained that the bundles were strapped to the first accused because that was the only way he could carry them as he did not have a carrier bag with him at that time. This explanation was offered to refute the natural inference that the manner in which the bundles were strapped in itself suggested that the first accused knew or ought to have known that he was carrying illegal substances. The learned judicial commissioner rejected this and held that, without any evidence from the first accused (as opposed to statements from the Bar), the presumption against the first accused was not rebutted.
 29.Counsel also argued that no weight should be given to the first accused`s statements given to the CNB officers. These arguments were similar to those made by counsel for the appellant and the learned judicial commissioner dealt with them in due course. In the circumstances, there being no further evidence, the learned judicial commissioner found that the first accused had failed to raise a reasonable doubt against the prosecution evidence and convicted him accordingly.
 The appellant
 30.The thrust of counsel`s submissions was that there was no direct evidence connecting the appellant to any element of the charge against him. It was submitted that the only evidence against the appellant was circumstantial and tenuous, and that the case against the appellant could be rebutted from the prosecution evidence itself.
 31.In response to the first part of counsel`s submissions, the learned judicial commissioner held that it was not correct to say that there was no direct evidence against the appellant. The fact that the appellant was at the airport on the same afternoon that the first accused was arrested was circumstantial, as was the fact that both accused were seen talking to each other and the fact that the first accused`s pullover was found in the appellant`s flat. However, the evidence from the statements of Goh and of the first accused stating that he was asked by the appellant to meet the latter at 3pm at the Transit Lounge of Terminal 2, Changi Airport, and the subsequent transfer of the drugs from the body of the appellant to the first accused, were clearly direct evidence against the appellant.
 32.It was therefore necessary for counsel to attack these statements, particularly those of the appellant. The learned judicial commissioner was invited not to give any weight to those statements for four reasons. First, the appellant did not have any opportunity to cross-examine the first accused in his voir dire. Second, it was submitted that the learned judicial commissioner ought to consider the other evidence adduced by the prosecution and only after that could he refer to the statements of the first accused. In other words, counsel urged the learned judicial commissioner to adopt the approach to s 30 of the Evidence Act as enunciated in 
Tan Siew Chay v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 . Third, what counsel termed the `special procedure` of DSP Vijakumar and SS/Sgt Wong, interviewing the accused before their statements were taken, was tantamount to oppressive conduct and, on the authority of 
Burut v PP of Brunei
 
[1995] 4 All ER 300
, the confession in the statements of the first accused ought to be excluded. Fourth, there were material discrepancies and contradictions in the statements of the first accused which rendered it unsafe to rely on them.
 33.In relation to the first reason, the learned judicial commissioner held that it was well established that an accused had no business in the voir dire of his co-accused. The accused was entitled to cross-examine his co-accused in the main trial or to call him as his own witness. The co-accused, though competent, was not compellable. If he declined to testify for the accused, it remained the duty of the court to assess the totality of the evidence without the benefit of the co-accused`s testimony, but the court would not speculate as to what evidence the co-accused might have given had he chosen to testify. The inferences or conclusions that the court might draw necessarily depended on the facts of each case. Here, the first accused`s defence was that he did not know what he was carrying. It was reasonable to infer that, had he testified, he might have jeopardised his own defence. Thus, in considering the evidence against the appellant, the approach was to focus on the evidence which the prosecution had adduced and then to consider the prejudice which the appellant would suffer, if the first accused chose not to give evidence. In that event, the learned judicial commissioner had to consider whether the detriment caused by the silence of the first accused could be ameliorated in any way. To this end, it appeared to the learned judicial commissioner that the lacuna from the first accused`s failure to testify could be filled by testimony from the appellant himself. If he chose to remain silent (as he was entitled to do), then he must bear the consequences, namely, that the court would not have the benefit of such evidence as might contradict the evidence already adduced. It might also be that more incriminating evidence might have been extracted under cross-examination had he chosen to testify.
 34.In relation to the second reason, 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
 had been overruled by a subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 . Consequently, s 30 of the Evidence Act had since then been accorded a wider application and the 
 Tan Siew Chay 
 approach was no longer applicable.
 35.As for the third reason, the `special procedure` in the 
 Burut 
 case involved hooding the accused while he was manacled, clothed only in his underwear for long hours. This could hardly be compared with DSP Vijakumar`s and SS/Sgt Wong`s interview. There was nothing similar save the description `special procedure` which was a phrase borrowed by counsel from the 
 Burut 
 case.
 36.The fourth reason was the alleged `material discrepancies and contradictions` in the statements of the first accused. These were as follows. First, the conditioned statement of one Chia Ah Lui, the housekeeping attendant at the shower room of the Transit Hotel, referred to `a guest` and not, as counsel submitted, `two guests`. However, there was no dispute that the receipt (P53) indicated that two persons had paid to use the shower room. Therefore, the learned judicial commissioner did not think that this was a real or material discrepancy. Second, it was submitted that the evidence of the CNB officers holding a stakeout at the airport was that the first accused was seen talking to the appellant at 4.15pm when the shower room receipt showed that it was used at 3.39pm. The learned judicial commissioner found that it was clear from the evidence that, although the CNB officers were trailing the first accused on that day, they lost sight of him for some time and were only alerted at 3.40pm that he had checked through customs. Third, it was pointed out that the first accused stated that he received a telephone call from the appellant on the morning of 13 January 1998, but, in his statement made the next day, he said that it was Goh`s boss who called and then passed the telephone to the appellant. Again, the learned judicial commissioner did not think that was at all material. Fourth, it was also submitted that there was a discrepancy as to who the boss was or how many bosses there were because the first accused`s statement P36 referred to more than one boss. The learned judicial commissioner had no doubt that this was not at all material. Lastly, there were references to other alleged discrepancies, such as whether it was Goh or the appellant who had promised to pay the first accused. The learned judicial commissioner saw no need to set these out as they were rated, in his view, even less materially than the ones set out above. In the event, the learned judicial commissioner was satisfied, in considering the totality of the alleged discrepancies, that they did not affect the relevant evidence incriminating both accused persons.
 37.In conclusion, the learned judicial commissioner found that the evidence of the first accused clearly implicated himself and the appellant. The incriminating parts were unambiguous and the defence adduced no evidence to impugn that evidence. As both accused elected not to call any evidence, the confession of the first accused was not out-weighed by any other evidence. The confession of the first accused included the statement that the first accused told the appellant on the morning of 13 January 1998 that he had his visa to Taiwan but he did not have sufficient money for the airfare. He was then told by the appellant to go to the latter`s grandmother who would lend him $300. The first accused did so and after collecting the money proceeded to pay for his airfare. This was not disputed, nor was an alternative answer offered as to why the appellant`s grandmother lent $300 to the first accused. The learned judicial commissioner noted counsel`s submission that it was not for the defence to offer answers and that it was for the prosecution to do so. In this case, the prosecution had done so. It adduced evidence that the money was for the purpose of enabling the first accused to pay for his airfare to Taiwan and that was what the first accused did. It therefore became incumbent upon the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt by raising the possibility that there was an innocuous reason for the loan. The learned judicial commissioner could only infer from his omission that there was no other reason.
 38.Turning to the evidence of Goh, no statements were recorded from him under s 371 of the CPC but the learned DPP was given leave to adduce oral evidence from him. However, he turned hostile by refusing to implicate the two accused. The learned DPP then sought to admit (under s 147 of the Evidence Act) a statement recorded from him under s 121 of the CPC. Leave was granted and that statement was admitted as P78. Counsel for the appellant submitted that that statement ought not to have been admitted because the requirements under s 371(2) of the CPC had not been complied with, in particular, it did not have a declaration under s 371(2)(b). On this point, the learned judicial commissioner held that s 371 CPC was intended to allow a written statement of a witness to be used as evidence in lieu of oral testimony from that witness. The declaration accompanying such a statement was to mark clearly the awareness of the deponent in respect of the purpose of his statement and to serve as an acknowledgment of the consequences of making a false statement. However, P78 was being admitted as a previous inconsistent statement and was intended to be used to challenge the witness`s testimony in court. If a declaration under s 371(2)(b) were required, it would be nearly impossible to impeach a witness with any prior inconsistent statement made by that witness as he was unlikely to sign such a declaration, thereby confessing to perjury. Evidence was led as to how the statement P78 came to be recorded because Goh claimed that he had made that statement under a threat of being charged with a capital offence if he did not make it. The learned judicial commissioner was satisfied, at the conclusion of the testimony of Insp Krishnan (who recorded the statement) and Goh, that the statement was made voluntarily. Further, the learned judicial commissioner was aware of the need to be cautious when considering the probative value of P78, but where Goh said that he had met the appellant in Bangkok on 13 January 1998 and had heard the latter tell Simon that he would be transferring the drugs to the first accused in Singapore, that part of his evidence fit the overall evidence of the prosecution in a way which required some explanation from the appellant if he wanted to deny or dispute it. The appellant`s failure to do so led to the inference that Goh`s statement concerning him was true.
 39.For the above reasons, the learned judicial commissioner was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against both accused. He thus found them guilty as charged and convicted them accordingly, passing the mandatory sentence of death.
 40.
 Grounds of appeal
In his petition of appeal, the appellant contended, first, that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in not applying the correct approach of taking the confession of the first accused together with the rest of the evidence in deciding whether, on the totality of the evidence, the prosecution had proven its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt at the end of the trial. The statements of the first accused and of Goh considered together with the other evidence adduced by the prosecution did not establish the essential elements of the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Second, the appellant contended that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in relying on the `weak evidence` of the statements of the first accused and of Goh in assessing the guilt of the appellant without taking into consideration the other `primary evidence which cross-infected the [p]rosecution`s case` against the appellant. Further or in the alternative, the learned judicial commissioner had erred in relying on the contents of the statements of the first accused and Goh as `""true"" primary facts` to convict the appellant without taking into consideration the `serious conflict between the direct evidence and the evidence contained in the [statements] of the first accused` and when the accuracy of those statements remained doubtful. In particular, the discrepancies between the three statements of the first accused were such as to entirely nullify the evidential value of those statements to the extent that none of them was prima facie reliable. Third, the learned judicial commissioner had also erred in relying on the statements of the first accused when their admissibility was clearly impugned by reason of the allegations advanced by the first accused at his voir dire, which seriously called into question the integrity of the whole recording process. In particular, the statements of the first accused had been obtained by oppression and were therefore involuntary. The oppression was that the first accused was subjected to intensive questioning at a special procedure just before the statements were recorded, such that his will was sapped. Fourth, the learned judicial commissioner had erred in law and in fact in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant for electing to remain silent without first satisfying himself that the prosecution had made out a case that was coherent and convincing, such that the charge if unrebutted would have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, by reason of the foregoing, the learned judicial commissioner could not have been satisfied on the facts that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
 41.
 The appeal
The thrust of the attack on the decision of the learned judicial commissioner, therefore, was that he ought not to have relied on the statements of the first accused and of Goh when they were inconsistent with the other evidence. In relation to the statements of the first accused, in particular, there were discrepancies inter se sufficient to nullify their evidential value so that they should be given little or no weight at all. Further the admissibility of those statements was again challenged on the ground of involuntariness. Before us, counsel for the appellant, Mr Pala Krishnan, also sought to argue that the first accused`s statements were not `confessions` within the meaning of s 17 sub-s (2) of the Evidence Act and that they thus could not be used against the appellant under s 30 of the same Act. At the most, they were an admission of the facts in issue - that there was a plan to export drugs as opposed to heroin. Counsel relied for this proposition on para 21 of the first accused`s statement P36 where the first accused stated that he only suspected the bundles which he was arrested with to be heroin when he saw them strapped round the appellant`s body. As P36 was not a `confession` and the presumption under s 18 sub-s (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act was not applicable to the appellant, the inference could not be drawn that the appellant knew the nature of the drugs he was carrying.
 Whether P36 was a `confession`
 42.We found ourselves unable to accept this contention. The argument appeared to be that the first accused`s statement P36 was not a confession because it did not state or suggest the inference that the first accused committed the offence with which he was charged as one of the essential elements of the offence, mens rea (knowledge), was absent. Indeed it will be recalled that the first accused`s defence in the court below was that he had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles strapped to his body. The learned judicial commissioner found, however, that the first accused had not rebutted the presumption under s 18 sub-s (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. In any event we had no doubt that P36 was a confession. All that is required to constitute a statement a confession is that it states or suggests the inference that the accused committed the offence. In the Privy Council decision in 
Anandagoda v The Queen
 [1962] MLJ 289 , Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 291: 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. 
 If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession although the accused at the same time protests his innocence.
 The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt? [Emphasis added.]
 This test was adopted in 
Lemanit v PP
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 26
 , a decision of the Federal Court on appeal from the High Court in Singapore. It was also approved and applied by this court in 
Chin Seow Noi v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 . Applying the 
 Anandagoda 
 test to P36, we found that it unambiguously implicated both the first accused and the appellant. It was a confession in no less clear terms than these - in the first accused`s own words: 
6 After clearing the Immigration Counter, I proceed [sic] to the Transit Lounge. I saw Kelvin [the appellant] waiting for me. He then asked me to follow him to the Transit Hotel shower room so that he can pass the `things` to me as it [sic] was still strapped to his body. Both of us then proceeded to the shower room. There was a counter leading to the shower room and a Chinese lady who was a cashier was on duty. We were told to pay $10.30 for the two of us to use the shower room. I then paid the cashier the money and I was given a receipt which I signed for. We then went to the shower room where I gave the receipt to another Chinese lady who was on duty. 
7 Both of us then entered a shower room and closed the door. Kelvin removed his black pullover and his white shirt which he was wearing inside. I noticed that he had several blocks wrapped in masking tape strapped to his body by strips of bandages and blue sticky tape. When I saw it, I suspected it to be heroin and I became angry because there were so many blocks. I then told Kelvin that I did not want to do the job. Kelvin then told [sic] that it was too late to back out as he was already with the heroin [sic] for me to carry to Taiwan. Kelvin then took out all the blocks of heroin from his body. I saw him throw the used blue sticky tapes into the dustbin. He then used the same three strips of bandages which he had earlier used and strapped the blocks of heroin to my body. I saw him take a blue roll of sticky tape and a roll of brown masking tape from his bag and used it to tape the heroin blocks in two rows over my abdomen and back. I did not notice what Kelvin did with the balance of the two rolls of blue tape and brown tape. After this, I put on my white T-shirt, white long-sleeved shirt and Kelvin lent me his black pullover which he was earlier wearing. We both then walked out of the shower room to the Transit Lounge. He then gave me 9,300NT (Taiwanese currency) for my expenses. This is worth about a few hundred S`pore dollars. He then told me to call him on his handphone for further instructions once I reach Taiwan. Kelvin confirmed that I would be paid $8,000 to $9,000 upon my return to S`pore if I successfully completed the trip.
 It was immaterial that P36 may have contained exculpatory material - in para 21 the first accused stated that he had no knowledge of the contents of the bundles and that he thought the `things` he carried were ecstasy tablets. This court has recently held in 
Tong Chee Kong v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 843
  that for a statement to amount to a confession, it need not be of a plenary or unqualified nature; it can also be of a non-plenary nature so long as the statement connected the accused in some way with the offence. See also 
PP v Tan Aik Heng
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 244
 . Accordingly there was no doubt that P36 was a confession. We saw no merit in counsel`s submissions to us on this point.
 Whether P36 was a `mixed statement`: the approach of the trial judge
 43.Counsel also took issue with what he called the `wrong approach` of the learned judicial commissioner in considering the effect of P36. As P36 was a mixed statement, the learned judicial commissioner ought to have considered both the incriminating and the exculpatory parts of the statement and not only the incriminating parts. This, said counsel, was a misdirection in law and in fact. Counsel relied for this proposition on the following passage from the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Duncan
 
[1981] 73 Cr App R 359
 at p 365: 
Where a `mixed` statement is under consideration by the jury in a case where the defendant has not given evidence, it seems to us that the simplest, and, therefore, the method most likely to produce a just result, is for the jury to be told that the whole statement, both the incriminating parts and the excuses or explanations, must be considered by them in deciding where the truth lies. It is, to say the least, not helpful to try to explain to the jury that the exculpatory parts of the statement are something less than evidence of the facts they state.
 However counsel omitted to quote the second part of the passage which reads: 
Equally, where appropriate, as it usually will be, the judge may, and should, point out that the incriminating parts are likely to be true (otherwise why say them?), whereas the excuses do not have the same weight. Nor is there any reason why, again where appropriate, the judge should not comment in relation to the exculpatory remarks upon the election of the accused not to give evidence.
 The approach enunciated in 
 Duncan 
 was approved and applied by the House of Lords in 
R v Sharp
 
[1981] 1 All ER 65
 and by this court in 
Chan Kim Choi v PP
 
[1991] SLR 34
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
 . In the latter case, this court added the rider that in Singapore the deciders of fact in a criminal trial are judges and judicial officers who are professionally trained to apply the rules of evidence under the Evidence Act. Whether or not P36 was a mixed statement, we were unable to see how the learned judicial commissioner had misdirected himself by giving more weight to the incriminating parts of P36 than the exculpatory parts. We also saw no merit in counsel`s submissions to us on this point.
 Admissibility of the first accused`s statements
 44.It will be logical to deal first with the question of the admissibility of the first accused`s statements before proceeding to the more substantive consideration of their weight or probative value. As we have said earlier, the voluntariness of the first accused`s statement given to W/ASP Diong (P32) was not challenged. Thus only the first accused`s two other statements P36 and P34 and the circumstances under which they were made would be examined.
 Inducement, threat or promise
 45.As s 122 CPC is not applicable to narcotics officers (see, eg 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
[1991] SLR 150
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  and 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
), the admissibility of the first accused`s statements fall to be tested under s 24 of the Evidence Act. The test for determining admissibility under s 24 is, first, whether the confession was made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise, and second, whether in making that confession, the accused did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are questions of fact and are matters of judicial evaluation: see 
Seow Choon Meng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 853
  and 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 1
 , following 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1976] AC 574
. The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: 
Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
 and 
Mohd Desa bin Hashim v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 MLJ 350
 . It is also established that where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily and not for the defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the confession was not made voluntarily: 
Koh Aik Siew v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 599
 . However, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words, it is only necessary for the prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: 
Panya Martmontree v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 .
 46.In the present case, the first accused complained that he had been told to `tell the truth` because DSP Vijakumar could tell if he was lying merely by looking at his eyes. He was also told that if he did not tell the truth DSP Vijakumar would damage his face, and he was knocked on the head by DSP Vijakumar when he gave an answer which DSP Vijakumar was not satisfied with, albeit that this occurred only once. It was also alleged that he had been told that `the rope was round his neck`, and he testified that he thought that the officers would help take the rope off his neck, by which he meant that he thought he would face a lesser charge. In 
Lim Kim Tjok v PP
 [1978- 1979] SLR 306 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 94
 , it was held that the words `you had better tell the truth` or equivalent expressions had always been held to import a threat or inducement. More recently, however, it has been held that the question whether words to the effect of `you had better tell the truth` import a threat or inducement should be approached in a common sense way and in the context of the individual case: 
Osman bin Din v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 129
 . The facts of each case must be looked at individually, and thus where a police officer reminded a witness that he should tell the truth and not tell lies, that did not constitute a threat or inducement: 
PP v Ramasamy a/l Sebastian
 
[1990] SLR 875
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 75
 . In 
 Osman bin Din 
, the appellant was alleged to have been told that, if he admitted to the offence, he would receive a lighter sentence. He was also warned to tell the truth, otherwise he would be beaten up and sent to the gallows. It was held that, even if the allegation were true, the expression did not amount to a threat or inducement in the circumstances. Although those words were coupled with further statements to the effect that the appellant would be beaten up and sent to the gallows and verbal abuse, it was not sufficient to give the appellant any reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the statements.
 47.We were of the view that the approach of the Court of Appeal in 
 Osman bin Din 
 should be applied to our facts. To begin with, the learned judicial commissioner was not convinced that DSP Vijakumar and SS/Sgt Wong had told the first accused that they would help take the rope off his neck or that he had been knocked on the head. This was a finding of fact. It followed that the purported inducement was self-perceived, and a self-perceived inducement cannot in law amount to an inducement: 
Lu Lai Heng v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 251
 . In any event, we agreed with the learned judicial commissioner that a knock on the head in the manner described by the first accused did not constitute sufficient duress, nor could a call to co-operate be regarded as a threat or inducement even if it was accompanied, as in this case, by a remark that the first accused would be allowed to call his wife if he co-operated. We would add that this was not a `promise having reference to the charge` against the first accused, even if one gives a liberal interpretation to the notion of `having reference to the charge` as `relevant or relating to the charge`: 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 . The result was that the first accused had not raised a reasonable doubt of the existence of a threat, inducement or promise. After considering the evidence, the learned judicial commissioner was convinced that P36 and P34 were made voluntarily and admitted them in evidence. In the event, counsel failed to persuade us that the decision of the learned judicial commissioner was erroneous and we would uphold his determination.
 Oppression
 48.Oppression is a circumstance which may render a confession involuntary and thus inadmissible, and whether the accused has been subjected to oppression is a question of fact: 
 Seow Choon Meng v PP 
. In 
R v Priestley
 
[1967] 51 Cr App R 1
, Sachs LJ, as he then was, said: 
[T]his word [oppression] imports something which tends to sap, and has sapped, that free will which must exist before a confession is voluntary. Whether or not there is oppression in an individual case depends upon many elements. They include such things as the length of time of any individual period of questioning, the length of time intervening between periods of questioning, whether the accused person has been given proper refreshment or not, and the characteristics of the person who makes the statement. What may be oppressive as regards a child, an invalid or an old man or somebody inexperienced in the ways of this world may turn out not to be oppressive when one finds that the accused person is of a tough character and an experienced man of the world.
 In other words, a statement would not be extracted by oppression unless the accused was in such a state that his will was `sapped` and he could not resist making a statement which he would otherwise not have made: 
PP v Tan Boon Tat
 
[1990] SLR 375
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 . In that case, the accused sought to show that the circumstances in which he had made the statement were so oppressive that his will was sapped or broken with the result that the statement was not one made with his own free will. On the facts, the accused was not given any food or drink at all from the time of his arrest at about 3.30pm to about 1am the following morning. He was therefore very tired and hungry and was in a daze and a state of confusion when the statement was given. It was accepted that the accused was tired, hungry and thirsty, and that he was under great stress. But the court was not convinced that the accused was in such a state of shock, exhaustion or fatigue that he had no will to resist making any statement which he did not wish to make, and found that the statement had been made voluntarily. In this regard, it is not realistic to take the sweeping stand that every failure to offer an accused sustenance constitutes a threat or an inducement of such gravity as to render any statement made involuntary: 
Fung Yuk Shing v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 421
 . The facts were that the appellant had not been given any food or drink after his arrest and up to the time his CPC s 122(6) statement was recorded, a period of about seven hours. This was held at first instance to have sapped his free will. On appeal, the court remarked that it is a question of fact as to whether the failure to offer an accused food and drink constitutes a `threat` or an `inducement` which might render any statement he makes involuntary, there are varying degrees of seriousness as far as such failures are concerned. In the circumstances, the court was not convinced that the omission was so serious that the appellant`s will might have been overborne.
 49.In contrast, the inherent unreliability of a confession, given the evidence of intensive interrogation for 18 hours, may point to its involuntary character: 
PP v Lim Kian Tat
 
[1990] SLR 364
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 154
 . In 
Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 232
 , for example, the court cited the prolonged periods and extremely odd hours of interrogation ranging into the early hours of the morning as being suggestive of oppression. In addition, the appellant was old (he was 54) and had been deprived of prayer time. Similarly, where the accused was interrogated intensively and denied rest and lunch, was kept ignorant of the charges against him, and the prescribed formalities were breached, the overall impression would be one of doubt as to the voluntariness of the accused`s statements: 
Tan Choon Huat v PP
 
[1991] SLR 805
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 230
 . Handcuffing of the accused throughout the recording of the statement was a form of restraint and was oppressive as to cast doubts on the voluntariness of the statement: 
PP v Mohd Fuzi bin Wan Teh & Anor
 
[1989] 2 CLJ 652
.
 50.In the present case, the first accused`s CPC s 121 statement (P36) was recorded in two parts, the first being recorded from 12.30am to 2.10am on 14 January 1998 and the second from 5pm to 8pm on 15 January 1998. His cautioned statement (P34) was recorded from 4.12am to 4.25am on 14 January 1998 after he was sent for a pre-statement medical examination. Although P34 and the first part of P36 were recorded in the early hours of the morning of 14 January 1998 (bearing in mind also that the first accused had been arrested at 4.54pm the previous day and had, presumably, not been given any rest since that time), it is clear that the circumstances under which the statements were recorded fell far short of the standard required for a finding of oppression to be made: cf 
PP v Tan Boon Tat
 
[1990] SLR 375
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 . Here, a fortiori, it cannot be said that the first accused was in such a state that his will was sapped and he could not resist making the statements which he would otherwise not have made.
 Weight of the first accused`s statements
 51.We now turn to consider the learned judicial commissioner`s treatment of the first accused`s statements, in particular his CPC s 121 statement (P36). As we have noted, counsel for the appellant contended that P36 was inconsistent with the other evidence and that it contained discrepancies sufficient to nullify its evidential value. First, with regard to the alleged discrepancies, in particular, the first accused seemed to suggest in the first part of P36 that it was the appellant who played a leading role in the conspiracy, as it were, whereas in the second part of P36 the first accused had substituted Goh for the appellant. Second, according to the first part of P36, the conspiracy to export the drugs, if any, took place on 13 January 1998 but the first accused had no prior knowledge of his role in the plan to export the drugs to Taiwan as evidenced by the fact that he merely followed the appellant into the shower room and his surprise at the number of bundles he saw on the appellant. In contrast, the second part of P36 pointed to a conspiracy between the first accused and Goh sometime in December 1997 to export the drugs to Taiwan. The question was, with whom did the first accused conspire? Was it the appellant or Goh? Third, was it the appellant (first part of P36) or Goh (second part of P36) who agreed to pay the first accused $8,000 to $9,000 if he carried the `things` to Taiwan? All this, said counsel, showed the first accused`s willingness to prevaricate and implicate the appellant without regard to the truth. Counsel also made much of the fact that no fingerprints were found on the masking tape and other tapes which the appellant used to strap the bundles onto the body of the first accused. Counsel strenuously argued that this was a `critical piece of evidence` which went against the weight of the prosecution`s case. Finally, counsel contended, by reference to illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act, that the evidence of the first accused must be treated with caution as he was an accomplice.
 52.Taking the alleged inconsistencies and discrepancies first, it was the considered opinion of this court that they were insufficient to affect either the credibility of the first accused or the weight of his statements. None of them were real or material. We did not think it necessary to set out the reasons for our conclusion but would adopt the finding of the learned judicial commissioner in this respect. The absence of fingerprints was also not material in the light of the other evidence which pointed clearly to the role of the appellant in abetting the first accused by conspiring with him to export the drugs. It was at most a neutral factor. Lastly, illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act provides that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and that his evidence needs to be treated with caution, not that it must. The presumption is not mandatory but permissive or discretionary and depends on all the circumstances: 
Chua Keem Leong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
 . It replaces the former presumption that an accomplice is unworthy of credit `unless corroborated in material particulars` and must be read with s 135 of the Evidence Act which provides that any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is hereby abrogated. As I pointed out in 
Tan Khee Koon v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
  at p 731, the rationale for this caution is the same as that underlying the former practice of requiring a corroboration warning, namely, that `the accomplice is an interested party, who would have reasons of his own to exaggerate the culpability of or implicate the accused, while reducing the magnitude or importance of his own involvement in the matter`. Whether or not the court should believe the evidence of the accomplice would depend on all the circumstances of the case and the evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as the inherent probabilities and improbabilities; but where the court did not discern any attempt by the accomplice materially to minimise his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused and his evidence was found to be consistent as a whole and reliable on a review of the whole evidence, there was no reason why the evidence should be treated as unreliable. We were satisfied that this was the case on the facts. The statement of the first accused (P36) taken together with the other evidence implicated both himself and the appellant in material particulars and was coherent and convincing. We therefore did not agree with counsel for the appellant that the evidence of the first accused contained in P36 must be treated with caution.
 Goh`s statement P78
 53.This was impugned on the following grounds. First, it was accomplice evidence. Second, Goh had retracted his statement in court. Third, the prosecution should have applied to impeach his credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act when he turned hostile in court rather than cross-examine him under s 147 of the same Act. Fourth, the learned judicial commissioner had failed to give any or sufficient consideration to the factors in s 147 sub-s (6) in determining the weight to be given to Goh`s statement. If the circumstances in which Goh had made the statement were taken into account, it was clear that it should be given little or no weight. Specifically, it was not made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, the statement was made on 30 April 1998 whereas the events in question took place on 13 January 1998. Further, Goh had made the statement under threat of a capital charge in lieu of detention under the CLTPA, was told by CNB officers to implicate the first accused and the appellant as they had implicated him, and details such as dates and times were given to him by Insp Krishnan. In particular, Goh denied that he had heard the appellant and one Simon say that the first accused would be meeting the appellant at Changi Airport for the transfer of the drugs.
 54.To begin with, we did not think that Goh was an accomplice within the meaning of that term as defined by Lord Simonds in the locus classicus, 
Davies v DPP
 
[1954] AC 378
 at p 400, a case which has been followed locally. In that case, Lord Simonds defined accomplices as 
persons who are participes criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing, procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanours).
 Lord Simonds later explained (at p 402) that a witness would be participes criminis if he confessed to participation in the crime in question either by pleading guilty to it or by being convicted of it although it was indisputable that there were witnesses outside these straightforward categories, in respect of whom the answer has to be sought elsewhere. The witness concerned may never have confessed or may never have been put on trial. Such cases fell into two classes. In the first, the judge could properly rule that there was no evidence that the witness was a participant. In the second, there was evidence on which it could reasonably be said that the witness was a participant. In the present case, Goh has neither confessed or pleaded guilty to or been convicted of the crime with which the appellant was charged, nor was there sufficient evidence from which the inference could reasonably be drawn that he was a participant therein. The only evidence against him was paras 16 and 17 of the first accused`s statement P36 in which the first accused stated that Goh had (sometime in December 1997) asked the first accused whether he wanted to earn some quick money simply by carrying some `things` from Singapore to Taiwan, and that Goh had subsequently paged for the first accused from Thailand informing him of the necessary arrangements. This did not constitute participation in the crime with which the appellant was charged, namely, abetting the first accused by conspiring with him to export the drugs. Accordingly we did not see why Goh`s evidence had to be handled with caution on this ground alone.
 55.As for Goh`s retraction of his statement in court, we were of the view that that was something which went only to the weight of the statement which was in turn to be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding it at the time it was made. Counsel`s next complaint was that the proper procedure should have been for the learned judicial commissioner to impeach Goh`s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act instead of admitting his previous inconsistent statement in evidence under s 147 of the same Act. Our short answer to this was that it was unsupported by the scheme of the Act. The impeachment of the credit of a witness is governed by s 157 of the Evidence Act, which provides: 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they from their knowledge of the witness believe him to be unworthy of credit; 
(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence; 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted; 
(d) when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may be shown that the prosecutrix was of generally immoral character.
 As said in 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
  at p 602, to impeach a witness`s credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth. The purpose of the impeachment of a witness`s credit is to undermine his credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on. In the present case, the prosecution sought to impeach Goh`s credit by proof of his former inconsistent statement P78. In this regard, s 157 sub-s (c) was applicable. Section 157(c) allows for the impeachment of a witness`s credit by proof of a former statement inconsistent with any part of his evidence in court which is liable to be contradicted. While no explicit reference is made in s 157(c), it is clear that the procedure for the proof of the former inconsistent statement is to be found in s 147. The nexus between these two sections was emphasised in 
PP v Sng Siew Ngoh
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 143
  at p 149: 
While no explicit reference is made [in s 157], para (c) must point to s 147 which deals with cross-examination on previous statements made by a witness.
 The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved. By virtue of s 147 sub-s (3), in addition to the impeachment of the witness`s credit, the former statement shall be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein. Section 147(3) reads: 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 We did not see any controversy as to the effect of s 147(3). Section 157(c) provides for the impeachment of a witness`s credit by proof of former inconsistent statements. Section 147 contains the general scheme governing cross-examination on previous inconsistent statements. Section 157 could not be said to bring in only s 147(1) and (2). This point had already been dealt with in 
 Sng Siew Ngoh 
 at pp 149-150 as follows: 
It is clear then that there is a general scheme governing cross-examination on previous statements. Section 157 of the Evidence Act cannot be said to only bring in sub-s (1) [of s 147]. The other subsections also govern the cross-examination of previous statements. They cannot be separated from sub-s (1). Through this reference to s 147, the whole of that section is brought in, including s 147(3). It also has to be noted that s 147(3) explicitly states that it applies `in any proceedings`, and does not purport to be restricted to specific circumstances, which would have to be the case had it been intended that s 147(1) were to operate independently of s 147(3).
 Therefore, the consequences that follow upon the proof of a former statement inconsistent with any part of the witness`s evidence which is liable to be contradicted are first, that his credit is impeached under s 157(c) and second, that his former statement is admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein under s 147(3). The weight to be attached to the statement is determined by the factors stipulated in s 147(6). Thus the learned judicial commissioner was perfectly entitled to admit Goh`s statement P78 as evidence of the facts stated therein under s 147(3) and counsel`s complaint was misplaced.
 56.We now addressed our minds to the factors set out in s 147 sub-s (6) of the Evidence Act. Under that subsection, the court is directed as follows: 
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 In 
 Sng Siew Ngoh 
, the `dangers of falsification and inaccuracy` were recognised and highlighted (at p 157). In 
PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 158
  at pp 167-168, the court gave some guidance as to the factors to be considered in according weight to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of s 147(3). First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in question. The recollection of the details of particular events, particularly where these occur quickly, is easily susceptible to error with time but the recollection of the existence of a relationship is not so malleable. Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be astute in spotting such instances. Third, in addition to the above matters, the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts. Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. Subsection (6) does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined. Reliance cannot be placed on a portion of the statement that is taken out of context. Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts to be relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.
 57.Applying the above factors to Goh`s statement P78, a most pertinent consideration must be Goh`s allegation that it was made under threat of a capital charge in lieu of detention under the CLTPA and that he had been told to implicate the appellant and the first accused as they had implicated him. The reliability of this statement must therefore be thrown in doubt as Goh obviously had a motive to conceal or misrepresent the facts. Apart from that, however, the absence of contemporaneity, a factor which counsel stressed, did not really affect the weight of the statement. As pointed out in 
 PP v Tan Kim Seng Construction 
, the degree of contemporaneity must vary with the circumstances. On the facts, we were not convinced that Goh`s recollection of the events in question would have been significantly eroded with the passage of a mere three and a half months. Another factor was the cogency and coherence of the statement. The parts which incriminated the appellant and the first accused were unambiguous and left us in no doubt as to their respective roles in the conspiracy to export the drugs to Taiwan. Having said that, we were mindful of the fact that the probative value of P78 must have been somewhat dented by the revelation of the circumstances in which it was made, if true. However it was not the law that we had to reject Goh`s evidence in toto. On this point, we found the dicta of Raja Azlan Shah FJ (as he then was) in 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Hj Idris (No 2)

  instructive. He said (at p 19): 
There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court if fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other. It is therefore necessary to scrutinise each evidence very carefully as this involves the question of weight to be given to certain evidence in particular circumstances.
 Thus where Goh stated that he had heard the appellant and one Simon say that the appellant would be meeting the first accused at Changi Airport for the transfer of the drugs, that part of his evidence, as the learned judicial commissioner noted, fit into the evidence of prosecution as a whole in a way which demanded some explanation from the appellant, if only to deny or dispute it. We need only add that we found ourselves in agreement with this.
 58.
 Incriminating the appellant
The appellant was charged with abetting the first accused by conspiring with him to export not less than 2,109g of diamorphine (a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act), an offence under s 7 read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Section 2 sub-s (1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) provides that `the word ""abet"", with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, has the same meaning as in the Penal Code`. The offence of abetment by conspiracy appears in s 107(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Penal Code`) as follows: 
107 A person abets the doing of a thing who - 
 
(b) engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing. 
 The distinction between abetment by conspiracy under s 107(b) of the Penal Code and criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code was pointed out by the Supreme Court of India in 
NMMY Momin v The State of Maharashtra
 
[1971] Cr LJ 793
 at p 796: 
Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal means. It differs from other offences in that mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is taken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with incitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat wider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated by s 107, IPC.
 Unlike criminal conspiracy under s 120A of the Penal Code, abetment by conspiracy requires some further act to be done pursuant to the conspiracy. (See also explanation 5 to s 108 of the Penal Code.) According to 
Koh Clarkson and Morgan`s Criminal Law in Singapore and Malaysia
 
[1989] at pp 311
-312, the essential elements of abetment by conspiracy are: first, the person abetting must engage, with one or more other persons in a conspiracy; second, the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing abetted; and third, an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that thing.
 In 
Lai Kam Loy & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 787
  at p 795, the court observed, in relation to the offence of abetment by conspiracy: 
The essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the agreement will take place in private such that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. A frequent method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. these acts do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
 59.On the facts of our case, there was no reasonable doubt that the appellant had abetted the first accused by conspiring with the latter to export the drugs. The evidence of the first accused taken together with the statement of Goh and the other evidence adduced by the prosecution, were unambiguous and clearly implicated himself and the appellant. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence in this case alone more than justified the inference that the appellant had committed the offence with which he was charged. In a case such as the present, the question that the court must ask itself was stated succinctly by Huggins J in 
R v Chau Sau Tai & Ors
 
[1969] HKLR 214
, which is whether, in respect of each alleged conspirator, the court is satisfied that, on the evidence as a whole, he must have conspired with one or more of the others. The answer, in the present case, must be in the affirmative.
 60.
 Section 30 of the Evidence Act
Counsel for the appellant had sought to argue in the court below that the learned judicial commissioner should adopt the approach to s 30 of the Evidence Act as enunciated in 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
. This approach, which was also followed by the court in 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  and 
Ramachandran & Anor v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 671
 , was that the confession of a co-accused could only play a supportive role in a criminal prosecution and could not by itself form the basis of a conviction. It was therefore submitted that the learned judicial commissioner should consider the other evidence adduced by the prosecution and only after that could he refer to the statements of the first accused. This line of cases (of which 
 Ramachandran 
 was the most recent) has, however, been overruled by the Court of Appeal decision in 
 Chin Seow Noi v PP. 
 The position now is that s 30 allows the conviction of an accused to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided that the evidence emanating from that confession satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused`s guilt. Although counsel for the appellant did not seek to advance the pre-
 Chin Seow Noi 
 approach again before this court, we felt compelled to reaffirm that the correct approach to the application of s 30 was as stated by this court in 
 Chin Seow Noi 
. In any event, s 30 was not of immediate importance in the present case. Although the confession of the first accused was crucial in implicating and convicting the appellant, it was not the only evidence relied upon by the prosecution. There was also the statement of Goh and the circumstantial evidence, all of which when taken together were more than sufficient to justify the finding of the learned judicial commissioner that the prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction.
 61.
 Effect of appellant`s silence in court
Jeremy Bentham wrote that `innocence claims the right of speaking as guilt invokes the privilege of silence.` These words could not be more true than in the present case, and this brought us to our next point. Section 189(1) of the CPC provides: 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 In other words, the court in deciding whether a case has been made out warranting the conviction of the accused will act on the presumptions that: (a) all evidence of primary facts is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused that would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation: see the landmark case of 
Haw Tua Tau & Ors v PP
 [1980-1981] SLR 73 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 . LP Thean J (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  at pp 358-359, referred to 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 and thereafter clarified as follows: 
Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau
 said, at p 51:
 
`The crucial words in s [189(1)] are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by section [189(1)] the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.`
 
At that stage, what the court has to decide is whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If the court so decides that each essential element in the alleged offence has been established he must call for the defence. At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence. After the defence has been called and evidence, if any, of the accused and other witnesses had been tendered and counsel for both sides have made their respective closing submissions, the court must, at that stage, proceed to examine the evidence adduced, assess the veracity and accuracy thereof and consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
 62.This was done in the present case. There was ample evidence at the close of the prosecution case to warrant the learned judicial commissioner calling for the defence of the appellant. The appellant having elected to remain silent, however, the court was entitled to `draw such inferences from the refusal [to give evidence] as appear[ed] proper`: CPC s 196(2). This included, in an appropriate case, the drawing of an inference that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was charged: 
Murray v DPP
 
[1994] 1 WLR 1
. In that case, Lord Slynn of Hadley amplified as follows (at p 11): 
This does not mean that the court can conclude simply because the accused does not give evidence that he is guilty. In the first place the prosecutor must establish a prima facie case - a case for him to answer. In the second place in determining whether the accused is guilty the judge or jury can draw only `such inferences from the refusal as appear proper`. As Lord Diplock said in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
[1982] AC 136
, 153:
 
`What inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused`s refusal to give evidence depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense.`
 
There must thus be some basis derived from the circumstances which justify the inference.
 
If there is no prima facie case shown by the prosecution there is no case to answer. Equally, if parts of the prosecution case had so little evidential value that they called for no answer, a failure to deal with those specific matters cannot justify an inference of guilt.
 
 On the other hand, if aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty
. [Emphasis added.]
 In the premises, counsel`s submission that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in drawing an adverse inference against the appellant for electing to remain silent without first satisfying himself that the prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the appellant`s conviction was simply unsustainable. The failure of the appellant to call any evidence had the result that the confession of the first accused and the statement of Goh were not out-weighed by any other evidence in favour of the appellant capable of raising a reasonable doubt. Accordingly we dismissed this appeal.",1998-10-16 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
LAI KEW CHAI J
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The respondent pleaded guilty in the High Court to the following charge: 
That you, Tan Kei Loon Allan, on or about 25 October 1997, at about 9pm, in front of Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, Singapore, did cause the death of one Png Hock Seng with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, to wit, by stabbing the said Png Hock Seng with a knife, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 2.His plea of guilt was accepted and he was duly convicted. Under s 304(a), a person convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder may be sentenced to imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to a fine or caning. Tay Yong Kwang JC sentenced the respondent to seven years` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. The Public Prosecutor appealed against that decision. We allowed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to one of ten years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. We now give our reasons.
 3.The respondent admitted to a statement of facts prepared by the prosecution. According to the statement, the respondent is a member of the `Sio Koon Tong` Secret Society. At about 7.30pm on 25 October 1997, the respondent and his friends were assaulted at Bugis Junction, Singapore, by a group of youths who claimed to be members of the `Sio Gi Ho` Secret Society. As they were outnumbered, the respondent and his friends dispersed and ran.
 4.The respondent proceeded to Takashimaya Shopping Centre, which is the base of operations for the `Sio Koon Tong` Secret Society, and there met one Stanley Chin Jia Chun and one Andy Ng Guo Hua, amongst others. The respondent was contacted by the other group members who had been assaulted, and it was agreed that they would reconvene at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.
 5.On the way to Dhoby Ghaut, the respondent purchased two knives from the Metro Department Store at Paragon Shopping Centre. He retained one knife and gave the other to Andy Ng.
 6.Meanwhile, at around 9pm, four of the members of the group assaulted at Bugis Junction, namely, Yeo Hsi Tsung, Benedict Koh Lian Teck, Ong Kiang Heng and Martin Koh Boon Wei, arrived at Parklane Shopping Centre, which is adjacent to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.
 7.The deceased and two friends arrived at the pedestrian mall outside Parklane Shopping Centre in a taxi. Benedict, Kiang Heng and Martin confronted the deceased and asked him what gang he belonged to. The deceased replied he was a `Sio Gi Ho` SS member. Thereupon, Benedict, Kiang Heng and Martin started to assault the deceased. Hsi Tsung stood guard and warned the deceased`s two friends not to interfere. They obliged and were not harmed. The same, however, could not be said for the deceased.
 8.At this point, Stanley Chin Jia Chun and Andy Ng Guo Hua arrived on the scene and joined in the others in assaulting the deceased. The deceased fell to the ground and covered his head.
 9.The respondent, armed with a knife, then came running and called to the others to clear a way for him. He rushed in and stabbed the deceased once in his lower back, inflicting a deep wound which penetrated the spleen, left kidney, liver and several veins and arteries. The deceased died from the injury en route to the hospital.
 10.There was no evidence that the deceased had participated in the earlier attack on the respondent and his friends at Bugis Junction.
 11.
 The sentence in the court below 
 
In the court below, the DPP asked for a deterrent sentence on the grounds that (1) the injuries were very serious (2) there was no provocation by the deceased (3) the attack took place in public, (4) the deceased was outnumbered and defenceless, (5) the respondent was an SS member, (6) he had been armed with a dangerous weapon and (7) though he had pleaded guilty, the protection of the public was an important exception to the one-third discount rule. Accordingly, the DPP urged the learned judicial commissioner to impose the maximum permissible sentence, ie life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
 12.In mitigation, it was said that the respondent had dropped out of school after his father had died of throat cancer in 1995. That same year he failed his `N` Level examinations, and was too depressed to complete the repeat year (1996). In July 1997 his mother lost her job as a hawker and his younger brother was now dependent on his relatives. He skipped between jobs and settled as a waiter in Boat Quay where he made friends and was persuaded to join the gang so he could be `protected`.
 13.The learned judicial commissioner took the view that a life sentence was too lengthy in view of the Court of Appeal`s ruling in 
Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 643
 . Before that decision, a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment would serve a sentence of 20 years, with the possibility that his sentence might be commuted by one-third for good behaviour. In 
 Abdul Nasir 
, we ruled that a sentence of life imprisonment was not properly subject to Prisons Regulations relating to the remission of sentences. We said that: 
It was not possible to pay lip service to life imprisonment as meaning the remaining natural life of the prisoner, and yet maintain that it was purely an administrative discretion to equate it with 20 years for purposes of remission in the absence of some clear law empowering the executive to do so. To allow that would be going against the will of Parliament.
 14.Accordingly, we held that a sentence of life imprisonment condemns a prisoner to incarceration for the remainder of his natural life. The learned judicial commissioner was impressed with the argument that, assuming the 18-year-old respondent lived to the age of 74 (which we take to be the average life expectancy of a Singaporean male), this would have meant that the accused would have effectively received a sentence of some 56 years.
 15.The learned judicial commissioner took into account the absence of antecedents, the fact that the accused had surrendered himself to the police (albeit three months after the offence) and his plea of guilt. His accomplices were charged with rioting and were sentenced to between 18 and 30 months` imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. He also reasoned (at [para ] 19 of his grounds of decision) that: 
...it was essentially a gangland settlement of scores. This is demonstrated by the fact that the deceased`s two friends, presumably not members of the gangs in question, were told to keep out of the conflict and were apparently not harmed. I do not say for one moment that gangland vengeance attacks are justified in any way. Such senseless, internecine warfare by one gang against another can only lead to tragedy ... [and] must also meet with severe disapproval but they should not be equated with situations where hoodlums loot and shoot completely innocent bystanders without giving a hoot.
 16.He considered a sentence of life imprisonment too out of proportion with the seriousness of the crime committed and, having considered the factors we have stated, sentenced him to seven years` imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane accordingly.
 17.
 The appeal against sentence 
 
The PP urged us to enhance the sentence to imprisonment for life and 24 strokes of the cane. The first argument put forth was that a benchmark ought to be set for culpable homicide cases, and the maximum sentence (bar life) of ten years, together with 12 strokes of the cane, was suggested. It was submitted that a benchmark of ten years was suitable because this was the same benchmark adopted for cases of simple rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code in 
Chan Kim Heng Frederick v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 361
 . It was argued that the `tariff` for culpable homicide not amounting to murder ought not to be less than that as culpable homicide was an offence equally, if not more, serious than rape. The present case, it was said, should be treated more seriously than a `benchmark` case because it involved secret society activities, use of a dangerous weapon and a crime committed in a public place. It was therefore said to be a case in which the protection of the public was an important consideration, and where the maximum sentence ought to be imposed.
 18.Secondly, it was argued that the learned judicial commissioner erred in failing to take into account R119A of the Prisons Regulations, which was passed after our decision in 
 Abdul Nasir 
`s case. Under R119A, the Life Imprisonment Review Board reviews the suitability of release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment after the prisoner has served 20 years of his sentence, and at intervals of 12 months thereafter. It was therefore said that had the learned judicial commissioner been apprised of R119A, he would not have viewed a sentence of life imprisonment so harshly.
 19.
 The sentencing benchmark 
 
To start with, we think it useful to use this opportunity to summarise the sentences imposed in recent years in cases of culpable homicide. The cases have attracted varying sentences. Amongst reported cases, sentences have never dipped below six years, whilst the life sentence (equivalent to sentences of 20, or, with remission, slightly more than 13 years) has been meted out in a number of instances.
 20.In 
Neo Man Lee v PP
 
[1991] SLR 146
 , Yong Pung How CJ, delivering judgment for the Court of Appeal, stated that life imprisonment was justified if (1) the offence was itself grave enough (2) it appeared from the nature of the offence or the defendant`s history that he was a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future and (3) where the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in sexual offences or crimes of violence. In that case, accused was convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and failed in his appeal against a sentence of life imprisonment. The court found that his history of mental instability rendered him `a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public`. Yong Pung How CJ noted specifically, however, that `with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years`. That logic is now obviously negated in light of our decision in 
 Abdul Nasir 
, and all the cases in which the life sentence was imposed must be viewed in that context.
 21.In 
PP v Kwan Cin Cheng
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 345
 , the Court of Appeal enhanced the respondent`s sentence from ten years to life imprisonment. In that case, the respondent had killed his girlfriend after she rejected him for another man. He claimed trial to murder and was convicted of culpable homicide. As the offence in 
 Kwan 
`s case was committed before our ruling in 
 Abdul Nasir 
 on 20 August 1997, the old definition of `life imprisonment` applied.
 22.Life imprisonment was also imposed by Rubin JC and KS Rajah JC where the accused had gone to a friend`s flat in his absence on the pretext of looking for his friend. Instead he found only his daughter. He was caught by her robbing from her father`s bedroom. He thereafter suffocated her to death. It was found that he lacked the intention to kill her. Convicting him of culpable homicide, the court found that he had set up the robbery as a deception and then burnt the victim. In view of those facts, life imprisonment was appropriate: 
PP v Ow Ah Cheng
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 797
 .
 23.Punch Cooramaswamy J sentenced an accused to ten years` imprisonment where he was suffering from depression, and, being asked by his room-mates to turn down the television volume, assaulted them, inflicting serious injuries. He pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide: 
PP v Chot Saik Kam
 
[1990] SLR 756
 .
 24.Ten years` imprisonment was also meted out where the accused was accosted by the deceased`s gang and the deceased had thrown a punch at him. For stabbing the deceased and causing his death, the appellant was charged with murder. He was convicted, but his conviction reduced before the Court of Appeal to one of culpable homicide, their honours having accepted his defence of sudden fight: 
Chan Kim Choi v PP
 
[1991] SLR 34
 .
 25.
PP v Tan Swee Hoon
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 758
  was cited in Tay Yong Kwang JC`s grounds of judgment. This was the decision in which Rubin JC applied the principle that a plea of guilt would not attract a discount if a longer sentence was necessary to protect the public. A sentence of ten years` imprisonment and 12 strokes was imposed where the accused had gone to a hotel to avenge a wrong done to his friend, and had killed and robbed the victim.
 26.Ten years` imprisonment was handed down in 
Roshdi v PP
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 282
 , a case in which the appellant killed a CNB officer who refused to pay up on his gambling debts. He had assaulted the officer after he failed to pay up. The officer resisted. In the fight that followed, he fractured the deceased`s skull with a mortar. It was found that he had either exceeded his right of private defence, or was entitled to the defence of sudden fight. The killing was not premeditated.
 27.Nine years` imprisonment was the sentence given to the appellant in 
Soosay v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 272
 . The accused`s friend had been robbed after having sex with a transvestite prostitute. The accused and one Kuppiah went to confront the prostitute. In an ensuing struggle, the accused stabbed the prostitute in the stomach, causing his death. After his conviction for murder, the defence of sudden fight was successfully argued in the appellate court, and a conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder substituted.
 28.In 
PP v Tay Chuan Beng
 
[1989] SLR 161
 , Punch Cooramaswamy J sentenced two accused to eight years` imprisonment. The first accused, a pimp, and the second accused, a prostitute, set upon the deceased when he refused to pay for the latter`s services and instead stole her handbag and punched her in the face. The first accused attacked him with an iron pipe whilst the second accused punched him with her fists. Both accused suffered from mental illness.
 29.The same sentence of eight years was imposed in 
PP v Teo Heng Chye
 
[1989] SLR 659
 in which the accused was intoxicated (but not to the point where it constituted a defence) and murdered two persons in a fight with a bearing scraper. It was held that he had intended to cause an injury likely to cause death, but had not intended to cause death. He was sentenced to eight and six years` respectively, to run consecutively. Multiple wounds had been inflicted on the victim in respect of which the heavier sentence was handed down.
 30.
Tan Chee Hwee & Anor v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 657
  was the case involving a bungled robbery of one of the perpetrators` parents` house, resulting in the death of the family maid, who returned early to the house to discover the robbery in progress. The participants who strangled the maid were convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to eight years each, whilst the accomplice who acted as a lookout was sentenced for five years for abetting housebreaking:

[1994] 3 SLR 140
 .
 31.
PP v Banphanuk & Anor
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 225
  involved four Thai construction workers who killed a fellow worker over money matters. They pleaded guilty to hitting him, throwing him out of a third storey window, kicking him, hitting him with a stick, dragging him through a wooden fence, drowning him in a muddy stream and cutting his throat with a knife. They were sentenced to eight years` imprisonment.
 32.A police inspector who suffocated his wife to death after suspecting her of adultery, in the context of there having been a prior history of unfaithfulness, was also sentenced to eight years` imprisonment: 
PP v Selvraj Subramaniam
 [1984-85] SLR 488 .
 33.
 The merits of the appeal 
 
We were of the view that it is not desirable, unlike simple rape, to set a benchmark for culpable homicide. The range of circumstances in which such offences are committed is extremely varied, as our brief survey of the reported cases demonstrates. They are not easily classified, and there is no such thing as a `typical` homicide. Similarly, to classify all culpable homicides as more serious than all rapes is overly simplistic. As counsel for the respondent pointed out, there is a co-relation between the offender`s culpability and his mens rea. Whereas the rapist intends to violate the victim without her consent, the perpetrator in a culpable homicide case lacks the intention to cause death. Sentencing for culpable homicide should remain a matter within the trial judge`s discretion (subject to our power to review a decision made in error, or which is manifestly excessive or inadequate), and should be determined on the facts of each particular case.
 34.As the Public Prosecutor rightly pointed out, this is a serious case. No doubt counsel for the respondent was right to point out that the case did not involve true secret societies, in the sense that those words were used 30 or 40 years ago. There is no evidence of involvement in racketeering, prostitution, gambling rings or drug smuggling. We accepted the argument that the `secret society` element was not present, but rather, that the respondent and victim were members of juvenile street gangs. Nonetheless, the present case served as a tragic reminder that juvenile delinquency is an increasingly serious problem on Singapore streets. We felt it necessary to address the fact that the offence could take place at a wide open public place in the heart of the city centre.
 35.Notwithstanding that the attack was directed solely at the deceased, and that overt action had been taken to exclude the deceased`s companions, and also notwithstanding that the respondent had surrendered himself after fleeing, that he had pleaded guilty to the charge, and that he was a youthful offender, we felt it necessary and in the public interest to impose a sentence which would send out a clear signal to potential offenders that these activities will not be treated lightly in the courts.
 36.On the question whether a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate, we were naturally impressed by the implications of our decision in 
 Abdul Nasir 
. Certainly, even with R119A, a sentence of life is now much harsher than it was before our ruling in 
 Abdul Nasir 
. Whereas an accused person previously would serve a maximum sentence of 20 years, with a potential remission commuting his sentence to one of 13 years and 4 months, he must now serve a minimum of 20 years` imprisonment, at which point his release would be within the discretion of a Life Imprisonment Review Board. So, the minimum period of incarceration is now six years and eight months longer, whilst the maximum period of incarceration, previously 20 years, is now the remainder of the prisoner`s natural life. In this context it is equally important to note that under the old position, his release after 20 years would have been guaranteed, but a prisoner sentenced for life in respect of a crime committed after 
 Abdul Nasir 
 has no such peace of mind.
 37.In that respect, we are of the view that the courts must now exercise caution before committing a young offender to life imprisonment. Contrary to traditional reasoning, in similar cases involving a youthful offender on the one hand and an older offender in the other, the youthful offender sentenced to life imprisonment would now be subject to a longer period of incarceration than an older offender, assuming they both lived to the same age.
 38.This case highlights one consequence of our decision in 
 Abdul Nasir 
 where youthful offenders are concerned. With the life sentence now being a sentence for the remainder of the convicted person`s natural life, the range of sentencing options are very limited. If the trial judge does not wish to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (which carries a minimum of 20 years, but which, as in the present case, may extend to over 50 years), he must impose a sentence of up to ten years` imprisonment (which, with remission, would amount to a sentence of up to seven years` imprisonment).
 39.In serious cases the court must choose between the two options for a weighty sentence: ten years or life imprisonment. Under the old position, the effective choices would be up to seven years` imprisonment (after remission) or about 13 years` imprisonment for a `life sentence` (after remission), a gap of about six years. Without remission, the gap would be ten years. Now, the gap is very much wider. Even assuming a positive outcome after review by the Life Imprisonment Review Board, the gap between the sentencing options is between 7 and 20 years, more than double the old position. Assuming a negative outcome by the Review Board, or that the sentence was not commuted, the gap widens. In the present case, the gap is 44 years (the difference between 10 years and 54 years). There is no discretion for the court to impose a sentence of more than ten years, but less than life imprisonment. This compares to the position in England, where, in respect of manslaughter (murder without intent), the court has a discretion to impose a sentence up to and including a sentence for life (see the English Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 5, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1948).
 40.In a situation in which the court is desirous of a sentence greater than ten years, but feels that a sentence of life imprisonment is excessive, we have no choice but to come down, however reluctantly, on the side of leniency. Otherwise, the punishment imposed would significantly exceed the offender`s culpability. It would, in our view, be wrong to adopt an approach in which the court would prefer an excessive sentence to an inadequate one.
 41.However, we came to the view that the trial judge`s sentence erred too much on the side of leniency. He gave a discount in view of the following factors which he thought mitigated the offence: 
[The accused] had a clean record prior to this incident. He decided to surrender himself to the police, albeit three months later, but delayed contrition is still better than total lack of remorse in normal circumstances. He has also pleaded guilty to the present charge ... there is no suggestion that the accused turned himself in only because there was no other avenue open to him.
 42.We disagreed. As we have stated, this was a case in which the need to protect the public overwhelmed any scope for arguing that a discount ought to be applied. Though the reason why the respondent assaulted the deceased is readily understood, it is not readily justified. The assault was committed, even if on a rival gang member, on a harmless one. It was an assault with a dangerous weapon in a public place. The victim was grossly outnumbered.
 43.We were mindful that a trial judge`s discretion in sentencing ought not to be disturbed unless the sentence was erroneous or manifestly inadequate or excessive. The sentence below was in our view manifestly inadequate. However, in view of our forgoing comments, we also thought that the learned judicial commissioner was right to have rejected the sentence of life imprisonment. In the circumstances, we felt it was appropriate to enhance the sentence to the next highest sentence of ten years.
 44.On the question what number of strokes of the cane was appropriate, we considered two submissions made by the DPP as relevant. Firstly, he highlighted that Andy Ng Guohao, who had been sentenced to five strokes for rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code and for six strokes for possession of a dangerous weapon under s 6 of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act Act (Cap 65), would receive two more strokes than the respondent, an obvious incongruity. Secondly, it was pointed out that a minimum of 12 strokes of the cane are imposed for the offence of robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code, and that the offence of culpable homicide, in circumstances such as the present, ought to attract a similar, if not weightier, penalty. We accordingly revised the sentence to one of 15 strokes of the cane.",1998-10-21 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the judgment of the court): This appeal is against the judgment of Lai Siu Chiu J awarding (i) damages for the loss of profit against the appellants in the sum of US$567,000 for wrongfully terminating the time-charterparty entered into between the parties and withdrawing the vessel from the charter; (ii) a sum of S$47,800 as the replacement cost of two water-makers for their wrongful conversion; (iii) interest on both sums at 6% per annum from the date of the writ (19 October 1995) to the date of judgment (13 March 1998); and (iv) costs on an indemnity basis from 17 June 1997 that being the date of an offer to settle the two claims. The appellants` counterclaim for unpaid charter-hire and damages for the wrongful arrest of the vessel was dismissed. There is no appeal against this. The appellants were however ordered to pay the costs of the counterclaim on an indemnity basis from 20 June 1997. The appellants have appealed against this order for costs.
 2.
 The facts 
 
The appellants, the owners of the ship or vessel `Endurance 1` ex `Tokai Maru` (hereafter `the owners`) by a time-charterparty in the SHELLTIME 4 form made on 2 February 1994 chartered the `Tokai Maru` which was later renamed `Endurance 1` (hereafter `the vessel`) in circumstances which did not affect the admiralty jurisdiction in rem of the High Court to the respondents, Cotan Petroleum Pte Ltd (hereafter `the charterers`) for a period of one year (with a further one-year extension at the charterers` option) commencing from the date of delivery of the vessel to the charterers. The daily charter-hire was US$2,000 payable in advance for a calendar month of 30 days.
 3.By another time-charterparty also in the SHELLTIME 4 form and containing the identical printed and additional clauses as in the charterparty above and made on 2 February 1994 the charterers sub-chartered the vessel to Kohap (Hongkong) Limited or nominee (hereafter `the sub-charterers`) also for a period of one year (with a further one-year extension at the sub-charterers` option) commencing from the date of delivery of the vessel to the sub-charterers. The daily sub-charter-hire was US$2,800 payable in advance for a calendar month of 30 days.
 4.The vessel was delivered by the owners directly to the sub-charterers at Singapore on 17 March 1994. The charterers as they were required to by cl 9 of the charterparty duly paid the owners the charter-hire for the first calendar month of 30 days in the sum of US$60,000 in advance of the date of delivery.
 5.The relevant clauses of the charterparty for the purposes of this appeal are cll 1, 3 and 9. Clause 1, inter alia, provides that at the date of the delivery of the vessel under the charter `she should be tight, staunch, in good order and condition, and in every way fit for the service with her machinery, boilers, hull and other equipment in good and efficient state.` It is not disputed that the intended service of the vessel, a tanker, both under the charter and the sub-charter was to supply fuel oil to fishing vessels out at sea in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. An essential piece of equipment for this service is the pumping equipment to pump the fuel oil to the fishing vessels. Clause 3(i) provides that `throughout the charter service owners shall, whenever the passage of time, wear and tear or any event requires steps to maintain or restore the conditions stipulated in cll 1 and 2(a), exercise due diligence to maintain or restore the vessel`. Clause 3(iii) has an important bearing on the payments of hire. It reads: 
If owners are in breach of their obligation under cl 3(i) (as summarised above) charterers may so notify owners in writing; and if, after the expiry of 30 days following the receipt by owners of any such notice, owners have failed to demonstrate to charterers` reasonable satisfaction the exercise of due diligence as required in cl 3(i), the vessel shall be off-hire, and no further hire payments shall be due, until owners have so demonstrated that they are exercising such due diligence.
 
Furthermore, at any time while the vessel is off-hire under this cl 3 charterers have the option to terminate this charter by giving notice in writing with effect from the date on which such notice of termination is received by Owners or from any later date stated in such notice. This sub-clause (iii) is without prejudice to any rights of charterers or obligations of owners under this charter or otherwise ...
 Clause 9 provides as follows: 
Subject to cl 3(iii), payment of hire shall be made in immediately available funds to:
 
Sea Sources Trading Pte Ltd
 
5001 Beach Road [num ]11-14 Golden Mile Complex, S (0719)
 
in USD Account per calendar month in advance, less:
 
(i) any hire paid which charters reasonably estimate to relate to off-hire periods, and 
(ii) any amounts disbursed on owners` behalf, any advances and commission thereon, and charges which are for owners` account pursuant to any provision hereof, and 
(iii) any amounts due or reasonably estimated to become due to charterers under cl 3(ii) or 24 hereof (not relevant here).
 
any such adjustments to be made at the due date for the next monthly payment after the facts have been ascertained. Charterers shall not be responsible for any delay or error by owners` bank in crediting owners` account provided that charters have made proper and timely payment.
 
In default of such proper and timely payment,
 
(a) owners shall notify charterers of such default and charterers shall within seven days of receipt of such notice pay to owners the amount due including interest, failing which owners may withdraw the vessel from the service of charterers without prejudice to any other rights owners may have under this charter or otherwise; and 
(b) (provides for the payment of interest on late payment of charter-hire: not relevant here).
 6(1).
 The charterers` pleaded case 
 
The charterers` pleaded case was that the owners were in breach of their contractual obligation under the charterparty to deliver a vessel which was `tight, staunch, in good order and condition, and in every way fit for the service with her machinery, boilers, hull and other equipment in good and efficient state`. This is what cl 1 of the charterparty provided. Instead the owners delivered the vessel whose cargo pumps were totally inefficient and could not pump at the rate specified in the charterparty and whose engines repeatedly broke down and several days` service of the vessel were lost. Numerous particulars were given. Further the owners had an obligation under cl 3(i) of the charterparty to exercise due diligence to maintain or restore the vessel to the condition stipulated in cl 1. The owners had failed to do this. This was a further breach of the charterparty. In consequence of these breaches the charterers could not perform their obligations to the sub-charterers who repudiated the sub-charterparty on 8 April 1994 and the charterers had lost the profits they would otherwise have earned in the sum of US$571,200 (US$800 x 714 days, ie from 8 April 1994 to 22 March 1996 - being the end date of the charterparty inclusive of the period extended by the exercise of the option).
 6(2).In the alternative the charterers claimed that the owners had wrongfully withdrawn the vessel from the charterparty on or about 25 April 1994. In consequence the charterers had lost the profits they would have earned by sub-chartering the vessel on a rising market from the date of the wrongful withdrawal of the vessel for the remainder of the charter period inclusive of the period extended by the exercise of the option in the sum of US$836,400 (US$1,200 x 697 days ie from 25 April 1994 to 22 March 1996).
 6(3).The final claim made by the charterers was for the conversion of the two water-makers which were placed on board the vessel by the charterers for the purposes of the sub-charterparty and which the owners failed or refused to return following the wrongful withdrawal of the vessel notwithstanding the demands of the charterers. A sum of S$47,800 was claimed as the value of the two water-makers.
 7.
 The vessel`s condition and whether cl 3(i) applies 
 
Several days of the trial were spent in the charterers leading evidence to prove that the vessel did not comply with the provisions of cl 1 of the charterparty, that is to say that the vessel was not in a seaworthy condition at the date of her delivery on 17 March 1994 and the owners, principally through the chief engineer of the vessel, endeavouring to refute the charterers` evidence whose principal witness was the sub-charterers` supervisor who was on board the vessel throughout safeguarding the sub-charterers` interest. The learned judge after reviewing all the evidence accepted the evidence of the charterers that the vessel broke down on the occasions recorded by the sub-charterers` supervisor. She observed that on this issue the conflict between the charterers` evidence and the owners` evidence was irreconcilable. In her grounds of judgment she said: 
From my observation of the witnesses for the plaintiffs (charterers) and defendants (owners) when they testified, I believed that Jang`s (sub-charterers` supervisor) version of events was the true and accurate picture of what happened. I found that the defendants` case was riddled with inconsistencies and their witnesses were untruthful. I could not accept the engine log-book produced by Kapa (the chief engineer) as a genuine record of all the engine breakdowns and all the repairs made ...
 The learned judge set out four good reasons for not accepting the chief engineer`s evidence, all going to his credibility as a witness, which the charterers were not able to refute. In the result she held that the vessel was not seaworthy at the date of delivery by virtue of the fact that the main engine was not in good order and condition. This finding was inferred from the several times the vessel broke down at sea when repairs were carried out to the engine `resulting in lengthy delays which lasted over 214 hours or about 9 days` over a period at sea of less than a month. She also found as a fact that on the date of delivery of the vessel the cargo pumps Nos 1 and 4 were not working because they had been fitted in reverse making the vessel unseaworthy. This was rectified before the vessel sailed. However, No 1 pump broke down a few days after sailing and could not be repaired. Pump No 4 also broke down and was repaired but could only pump at a much reduced rate. Accordingly the learned judge held that the owners were in breach of cl 1 of the charterparty that is to say, that the vessel was not `
 staunch, strong, in good order and condition and in every way fit for service, with her machinery ... in good and efficient state 
`.
 8.Before us, counsel for the owners sought to persuade us to overturn the learned judge`s findings. She contended that although the vessel`s engine did break down at sea and although the pumps did occasionally fail or did not pump at the required rate when used at sea, the learned judge`s finding that the vessel did not comply with cl 1 of the charterparty was an erroneous finding. It was erroneous because, so counsel for the owners says, the learned judge failed to recognise that the evidence of the sub-charterers` supervisor `was also poor and at times inconsistent and untrue`. But the learned judge did recognise the fact that she was faced with conflicting evidence for she says this in [para ] 17 of the grounds of judgment: 
In this case, there was conflicting evidence of unseaworthiness as regards the machinery. I had to evaluate the evidence to determine whether the vessel was unseaworthy at the commencement of voyage, namely, 17 March 1994, that being the relevant testing (sic) point in a time charterparty.
 Then at [para ] 20 she says: 
I accepted the plaintiffs` (charterers`) evidence that the vessel broke down on the occasions recorded by Jang (sub-charterers` supervisor). On this issue, the conflict between the plaintiffs` and the defendants` (owners`) evidence was irreconcilable. ...
 The learned judge then gave her assessment of Jang, the sub-charterers` supervisor, the principal witness for the charterers and Kapa, the chief engineer, the principal witness for the owners from her observations made when they testified. We have already quoted this part of her grounds of judgment at [para ] 7 above. It is plainly evident that she believed Jang and not Kapa. Counsel for the owners has not shown us why the learned judge should have preferred the evidence of Kapa to that of Jang. The burden is clearly on her. The principles governing the review by an appellate court of findings of fact of the trial judge and inferences drawn from findings of fact have been restated by this court in 
Teknikal dan Kejuruteraan Pte Ltd v Resources Development Corp (Pte) Ltd
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 743
  at p 754; 
Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng Leong
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 305
  at p 310; and 
Computer Supermarkets (S) Pte Ltd v Goh Chin Soon Ricky & Ors
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 501
  at p 504. It is unnecessary to restate them yet again. Suffice it to say that the appellate court will not lightly differ from the findings of the trial judge unless it is shown that the trial judge was `plainly wrong` to use the words of Lord Shaw in 
Clarks v Edinburgh & District Tramway Co Ltd
 
[1919] SC (HL) 35
. In this appeal it was not shown to us that the learned judge was plainly wrong.
 9.In any case, we do not feel that we need to belabour this judgment by evaluating the learned judge`s findings by reviewing the evidence as even if the vessel`s condition did not comply with cl 1 of the charterparty at the date of delivery and the owners were thereby in breach of cl 1 of the charterparty, the charterers did nothing to determine the charterparty on this ground but continued with the charter of the vessel. But they invoked cl 3(i) of the charterparty as the principal basis of their claim against the charterers for the sub-charterers repudiation of the sub-charterparty on 8 April 1994 as a consequence of which they claim they lost the benefit of the sub-charterparty and the profits that could be earned therefrom. Hence the real issue is whether cl 3 (i) of the charterparty applies at all in the context of the charterers` principal claim as pleaded. In other words is there a cause of action.
 10.It is necessary to refer to the charterers` pleaded case again and set out verbatim paras 7 to 10 of the statement of claim: 
7 In breach of their duty under cl 1 of the head charterparty, Sea Sources (the owners) failed to deliver the vessel in the condition stipulated under cl 1 of the head charterparty at any time but purported to deliver the vessel to the plaintiffs (the charterers) on or about 17 March 1994. At the time of the purported delivery, the vessel was not `tight, staunch, strong, in good order and condition, and in every way fit for the service, with her machinery, boilers, hull and other equipment ... in good and efficient state` and/or she did not comply with the description in From B appended to the head charterparty.
 
Particulars
 
[Here 11 specified failures of the cargo pumps and the main engine are set out from (a) to (k).]
 
The plaintiffs reserve their right to supplement these particulars after discovery and/or interrogatories in this action.
 
8 Further, by cl 3(i) of the head charterparty, Sea Sources were under a duty to exercise due diligence to maintain or restore the vessel in accordance with the conditions stipulated in cll 1 and 2(a) of the head charterparty. 
9 In breach of their duty under cl 3(i) of the head charterparty, Sea Sources failed to exercise due diligence to maintain or restore the vessel in accordance with the conditions stipulated in cll 1 and 2(a) of the head charterparty at any time at all.
 
Particulars
 
The plaintiffs repeat, as best particulars which the plaintiffs can give pending discovery and/or interrogatories in this action, sub-paragraphs (b) to (k) of the particulars set out in para 7 hereof. The plaintiffs reserve their right to supplement these particulars after discovery and/or interrogatories in this action.
 
10 By reason of the matters set out in paras 7 and 9 hereof, the plaintiffs could not perform their obligations under the sub-charterparty and Kohap (the sub-charterparty) repudiated the sub-charterparty on or about 8 April 1994. The plaintiffs thereby lost the benefit of the sub-charterparty and/or the expected profits which the plaintiffs could have earned from the sub-charterparty.
 
Particulars
 
Loss of profits under the sub-charterparty (US$800 x 714 days from 8/4/94 to 22/3/96) US$571,200
 11.It will be seen at once that although the charterers pleaded a breach of cl 1 of the charterparty, they did not claim any remedy for that breach but used it to claim that the owners were in breach of cl 3(i) of the charterparty by not exercising due diligence to maintain or restore the vessel to the condition stipulated in cl 1 of the charterparty. Before considering a breach of cl 3(i) it is necessary to consider whether cl 3(i) is applicable at all. The learned judge held that cl 3(i) was not applicable as the owners` obligation to maintain or restore the vessel to the condition stipulated in cl 1 it must be shown that the vessel lost that condition through the passage of time or wear and tear during the course of the charter service, ie after the delivery of the vessel to the charterers and not before. The learned judge had found that the failures of both the main engine and the cargo pumps were due to defects that were present at the date of delivery. In adopting this construction of cl 3(i) the learned judge followed Colman J`s judgment in 
The Fina Samco
 
[1994] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 153
.
 12.We agree with the learned judge. We would add that the charterers` principal claim as pleaded appears to be inconsistent. If the vessel was not in the condition specified in cl 1 of the charterparty at the date of delivery and because of being in that condition broke down during the course of the charter service, to use the words of cl 1, it could not be said, in our view, that the breakdown was through the passage of time or wear and tear during the course of the charter service again to use the words of cl 1. This is how the charterers pleaded their principal claim and the claim pleaded in this way, in our view, could not give rise to a cause of action as cl 3(i) of the charterparty quite clearly could not apply.
 13.The position taken by the owners is that the vessel complied with cl 1 of the charterparty in every particular at the date of delivery on 17 March 1994. They had the backing of a certificate of seaworthiness issued by a professional ship surveyor on 2 September 1993. The same ship surveyor had also certified the vessel seaworthy after the vessel had been withdrawn from the charterparty. They referred to the certificate of seaworthiness dated 13 September 1994. The owners also referred to the vessel`s cargo ship safety equipment certificate certifying seaworthiness issued in June 1994. By reference to these certificates the owners contend that the vessel must have complied with cl 1 of the charterparty at the date of delivery and the failures of the engine and cargo pumps being subsequent to the date of delivery must be through the passage of time or wear and tear during the course of the charter service. In our judgment this submission has no substance. We noted in [para ] 7 above that the learned judge correctly drew the inference that the vessel was not seaworthy, that is that the vessel`s condition was not in conformity with cl 1 of the charterparty at the date of delivery, from the repeated failures of the main engine and cargo pumps `resulting in lengthy delays which lasted over 214 hours or about 9 days` over a period at sea of less than a month. In our respectful view the inference which the learned judge drew was irresistible. Such a number of failures, there were 11 particularised in the statement of claim (see [para ] 10 above), can hardly be said to be caused through the passage of time or wear and tear during the course of the charter service. Such a state of affairs, in our view, and it would appear in the learned judge`s view also, could only have arisen through lack of maintenance over a long period and neglect.
 14.For the foregoing reasons the charterers` principal claim fails. This was also the learned judge`s conclusion. We must therefore now consider the charterers` alternative claim which is wrongful withdrawal of the vessel.
 15.
 The wrongful withdrawal of the vessel from the charter 
 
The charterers as we have already noted above did not terminate the charter of the vessel on the ground that the owner had not complied with cl 1 of the charterparty. They continued with the charter. Under cl 9 of the charterparty, which we have set out in [para ] 5 above, charter-hire, less authorised deductions (there were none in this case), is payable per calendar month of 30 days in advance. The first month`s charter-hire was paid on the day before the vessel was delivered directly to the sub-charterers on 17 March 1994. Accordingly the next month`s charter falls due on 16 April 1994. There is no dispute as to this.
 16.The charterers claim that the owners wrongfully withdrew the vessel from the charter. The facts are these. On 15 April 1994 the owners addressed the charterers as follows: 
Subject: Charterhire of MT `Tokai Maru`
 
We refer to the above, and wish to advise you that the charter-hire of captioned vessel will be due on the 16th April 1994. This date is based on the dated (17th March 1994) when captioned vessel commenced loading at Mobil Wharf not on the date vessel sails from Singapore.
 
In view of the above, please let us have your cheque for United States Dollars Sixty thousand only US$60,000 for the charter hire from 17 April 1994 to 16 May 1994 by latest 16 April 1994.
 On 18 April 1994 the owners sent a facsimile transmission message to the charterers regarding the payment of charter-hire for the vessel. It read: 
Urgent
 
Further to our letter dated 15 Apr 94 in respect of subject matter we have not todate received your payment of US$60,000 being charter hire for captioned vessel from 17 Apr 94 to 16 May 94.
 
Please take notice, that unless we receive the above amount by 1700 hours today 18.04.94, you give us no alternative but to withdraw captioned vessel from your charter.
 The charterers responded on the same day by telefax. It read: 
Please note that the charter-fee should effect on 24/3/94 (this should read 23-4-94).
 
We wish to clarify that due to your request we have released the first payment on 16/3/94 and events we understand you know well.
 
We therefore seek your kind understanding and co-operation and we be remitting to you on due date.
 The owners replied also on the same day, 18 April as follows: 
We refer to your fax dated 18 Mar 94 (this should read 18 Apr 94) (Ref CT/FX/94).
 
We still maintain that charter hire should commence on 17 Apr 94. (The date captioned vessel commenced loading.)
 
However, we are willing to accede to your request to pay us on 24 Apr 94 provided if you can let us have 
 your banker`s guarantee for US$60,000 by 1700 hours today 18 Apr 94
. Your banker`s guarantee can be post dated to 24 Apr 94. [Owners` emphasis.]
 The charterers did not respond to the owners` last communication and on 25 April 1994 the owners purportedly withdrew the vessel from the charter. Their telex to the charterers reads: 
Further to our fax dated 15 Apr 94 requesting payment of charter hire for captioned vessel. Regret advise we have not todate received yr cheque/banker`s guarantee neither have we received any response from you.
 
In view of the above and clause 9(A) of charter party dated 02/02/94, we have instructed the master of MT `Tokai Maru` to proceed back to Singapore immediately.
 
We regret above action has to be taken, as you leave us with no alternative.
 17.The learned judge held that the owners` first notice dated 15 April 1994 `was clearly not a valid notice under cl 9(a)` since on the date on which the notice was given, the charterers were 
 not in default of payment of hire 
 in respect of the second instalment. A valid notice cannot be given until 
 after 
 the time for payment has expired, which means after 2400 hours on the due date, at the place where payment is to be made ( 
The Afovos
 
[1983] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 335
) (the emphasis is that of the learned judge). This is correct and we agree. In fact owners` counsel now concedes that this was not a proper notice.
 18.As regards the two notices given on 18 April 1994, the learned judge held that the first of them, whilst it was a clear and unambiguous ultimatum to the charterers to pay the charter-hire by a certain date, failing which the vessel would be withdrawn, it did not give the prescribed seven days` notice as required by cl 9(a). For this reason the notice was ineffective. As for the other she held it was not a clear and unambiguous notice of the owners` intention to withdraw the vessel as it stipulated the furnishing of a guarantee which was outside the terms of cl 9(a) for deferring payment to a date which the owners contended was the due date for the second months` charter-hire. Hence this too was not a proper notice to give effect to so serious a matter as withdrawing a vessel from charter for the non-payment of charter-hire. The learned judge referred to 
The Rio Sun
 
[1981] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 489
 and 
 The Afovos 
 and held that the owners had wrongfully withdrawn the vessel from the charter.
 19.The owners submitted to us that either of the two notices on 18 April 1994 would constitute a valid notice under cl 9(a) of the charterparty. The submission is that cl 9 merely required a notification of default and provided that the vessel was only withdrawn after the expiration of seven days cl 9(a) would be satisfied. This argument, however, runs counter to such cases as 
 The Afovos 
, 
 The Rio Sun

 on which the charterers rely for their proposition that the notice under a clause such as cl (9) of the charterparty, referred to in some of the cases as an `anti-technicality clause` must make it clear that the charterer is in default of the payment of charter-hire and that the owner is giving the ultimatum that unless the charter-hire is paid within the period specified in the charterparty, the owner will withdraw the vessel. The charterers submit that both notices given by the owners on 18 April 1994 fell far short of these requirements. Accordingly the withdrawal of the vessel pursuant to either of these two notices was wrongful.
 20.Counsel for the owners sought to distinguish the line of cases relied on by the charterers on the ground that the anti-technicality clauses in 
 The Afovos 
, 
 The Rio Sun 
 and 
 The Pamela 
 were in The New York Produce Exchange form where the period of notice was very considerably shorter, namely, 48 hours to seven days as in the instant case, and the wording of the clause required that the notice must contain a notice of the shipowner`s intention to exercise the option to withdraw the vessel at the end of the notice period. Admittedly the period of the notice is shorter but we could not agree that the wording of cl 9(a) of the charterparty did not contain a provision that the notice must contain a notice of the shipowner`s intention to exercise the option to withdraw the vessel. In 
 The Afovos 
 the material portion of the anti-technicality clause read: 
When hire is due and not received the owners before exercising the option of withdrawing the vessel from the charter-party, will give charterers forty-eight hours notice, ... and will not withdraw the vessel if the hire is paid within these forty-eight hours.
 In 
 The Rio Sun 
 it read: 
If hire not received when due, owners to give charterers 48 hours notice in order to rectify the cause for such delay before exercising that right under cl 5.
 And in 
 The Pamela 
 it read: 
If hire is due and not received, the owners, before exercising the option of withdrawing the vessel will give the charterers forty-eight (48) hours notice ... and will not withdraw the vessel if hire is paid within these 48 hours.
 Clause 9(a) of the charterparty reads: 
In default of such proper and timely payment
 
(a) Owners shall notify charterers of such default and charterers shall within seven days of receipt of such notice pay to owners the amount due ... failing which owners may withdraw the vessel from the service of the charterers ...
 21.In our view the intent and purpose of cl 9(a) of the charterparty is no different from the like clauses in the three cases referred to. They all make it clear that the charterers must be in default of the payment of charter-hire before the notice is given; that the owner is giving an ultimatum that unless the payment is made within the specified period the owner will exercise the option to withdraw the vessel from the charter. 
 The Afovos 
, 
 The Rio Sun 
 and 
 The Pamela 
 in our view cannot be distinguished on this account.
 22.The fact that on the one side the specified period within which to pay being 48 hours and in the other seven days would not also distinguish this case from the decided cases we have referred to. This submission is untenable. The period for the charterers to rectify the default to prevent the withdrawal of the vessel be it 48 hours as in New York Produce Exchange form or seven days as in the SHELLTIME 4 form used in the instant case is a contractually agreed provision. All else being equal different agreed periods to remedy or rectify the default of payment would not in our view distinguish this case from cases like 
 The Afovos 
, 
 The Rio Sun 
 and 
 The Pamela 
. Owners` counsel was not able to refer us to any cases in support of her propositions.
 23.Furthermore, the two notices given by the owners on 18 April 1994 were legally ineffective for two other reasons as well. Firstly the owners had demanded that either payment of the hire or the tender of a banker`s draft be made on the same day (ie 18 April 1994) by 1700 hours. This is clearly against the wording of cl 9(a) which allows the charterers a grace period of seven days to make payment. The notices indicate an intention on the part of the owners to withdraw the vessel if the demands were not complied with the day the notices were given. Secondly, seven days from the date of the charterers` receipt of the notification of the default had not elapsed before the owners withdrew the vessel. Clause 9(a) provides that the `Charterers shall within seven days of receipt of such note (of default) pay owners the amount due ...`. As such the grace period began to run from the date of receipt of the notification of default on 18 April 1994. The charterers were notified of the vessel`s withdrawal on 25 April 1995. On the principal laid down in 
 The Afovos 
, the time for payment would expire at midnight on 25 April 1994. But the charterers were notified of the withdrawal well before midnight at about 12.53pm. Withdrawal of the vessel under a charterparty only operates from the time the notice of withdrawal is received by the charterers, see 
The Georgios
 
[1971] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 7
.
 24.For these reasons the vessel was wrongfully withdrawn from the charter and accordingly the charterers are entitled to damages for breach of the charterparty. We will now address this question.
 25.
 Assessment of damages for breach of charterparty 
 
It seems to us that the learned judge assessed the damages on the basis of the loss of profit to the charterers occasioned by the breach of the charterparty. In her grounds of judgment she says this: 
The charter commenced on 17 March 1994, and was for a year with an option for extension. If the plaintiffs (charterers) had exercised their option to extend the charterparty for another year, the charter period would have ended on 16 March 1996. The sub-charterparty was for a period for one year with an option by the sub-charterers to renew, at a rate of US$2,800 per day. The damages would be the difference between the two charter hires, which was US$800 per day for a period of 709 days (from 8 April 1994 to 16 March 1996) or US$567,200. There was no doubt that the market rate for charter hire rose during the period of the charterparty. For instance Hozun had chartered the vessel to Sentek Marine & Trading on 5 Jan 1996 for US$3,500 per day (this is a reference to a subsequent charter of the vessel). As a consequence of the breach of charterparty, the plaintiffs suffered the loss in profit they would have made if the charter with the sub-charterers had continued.
 26.There is no dispute that on the evidence the vessel was withdrawn from the charterparty on 25 April 1994 albeit wrongfully. The undisputed facts are these. On 31 March 1994 the sub-charterers complained to the charterers, inter alia, that the cargo pumps, water-makers and derricks were not working; that the vessel`s maximum loading draft was not in compliance with the sub-charterparty and they claimed that the vessel could not load as much cargo as desired; and that delays by the vessel had caused their own buyers of marine gas oil to cancel their orders. This complaint was duly communicated to the owners by the charterers. The sub-charterers followed up their 31 March 1994 complaint to the charterers with a telex on 8 April 1994 in which they indicated their intention to terminate the sub-charterparty at the end of April 1994 when the vessel returned to Singapore if no suitable reply was forthcoming from the charterers or, if the vessel`s defects were not rectified . Then on 29 April 1994 the sub-charterers, unaware that the vessel had been wrongfully withdrawn from the charterers, telexed the charterers and specifically requested the charterers to replace the vessel with another vessel by 4 May 1994 as the vessel was `unacceptable` to the sub-charterers. This message was passed on to the owners by the charterers on the same day, ie 29 April 1994, notwithstanding that the owners had purportedly withdrawn the vessel from the charterers. The charterers did not provide the substitute vessel by 4 May 1994. The sub-charterers then chartered the `Ionian Light` and when the vessel arrived in Singapore on 8 May, the sub-charterers had their cargo of fuel oil transferred from the vessel to the `Ionian Light`. The sub-charterers then informed the charterers that they would not pay the sub-charter hire which had accrued from 8 April 1994.
 27.On these facts the learned judge found that the sub-charterers had repudiated the sub-charter on 8 April 1994. In our judgment this cannot be right. On 8 April 1994 the position taken by the sub-charterers as stated in the paragraph above is that they expressed an intention to terminate the sub-charterparty at the end of April 1994 unless a suitable reply is given to their earlier telex or if the vessel`s defects were not rectified. Even on 29 April 1994 the sub-charterers, unaware that the owners had already withdrawn the vessel from the charterers, telexed the charterers requesting that the vessel be replaced by 4 May 1994. It seems to us that the ultimate repudiation of the sub-charterparty, which was the charterers` failure to provide a substitute vessel to the sub-charterers, had no correlation to the owners withdrawal of the vessel from the charterers.
 28.It is clear beyond peradventure that the charterers did not charter the vessel from the owners in order to trade the vessel themselves but to sub-charter her to the sub-charterers at a profit. This was their business venture. The owners were well aware of this as they in fact delivered the vessel, on the charterers` instructions, to the sub-charterers directly. Since the owners wrongfully interfered with the charterers` business venture, the charterers ought to be restored to the position they were in before the wrongful withdrawal of the vessel; that is to say in the same position the charterers would have been in if the charterparty had been performed. See 
Hadley v Baxendale
 
[1854] Exch 341
 and 
Victoria Laundry v Newman Industries
 
[1949] 2 KB 528
.
 29.The learned judge assessed the damage on these principles but she computed the period from 8 April 1994, the purported date of the sub-charterers repudiation of the sub-charterparty (see [para ] 27 above). This in our view is wrong. The correct date the charterers lost the profits they would have earned from their sub-charter of the vessel is from the date of the wrongful withdrawal of the vessel from the charterers. This date is 25 April 1994. Further the learned judge in awarding damages to the charterers did so on the basis that the charterers and the sub-charterers would have exercised their respective options to extend the charterparty and the sub-charterparty for a further year. The learned judge accepted the evidence of Tay Siong Siew, the managing director of the charterers who was told that the rate in April 1994 was US$3,000 per day. He also referred to a subsequent charter of the vessel in January 1996 at US$3,500 per day and concluded that the market was rising and that in all probability both the charterers and the sub-charterers would have exercised their respective options even though the charterers did not adduce direct evidence to show that they or the sub-charterers would definitely have exercised their options. In our view this was not a reasonable inference to draw. The withdrawal of the vessel took place in the first month of a one-year charter. With eleven months still to go it seems speculative to say that the ship chartering business will still continue to be attractive as a business venture. It will be difficult to predict what the ship chartering business will be like eleven months ahead. The very reason there was a charterers` option to renew a one year`s charterparty for a further year at the same charter-hire instead of a two-year charterparty itself suggests uncertainty. Thus the learned judge erred.
 30.Accordingly, we will set aside the learned judge`s award of damages for the breach of the charterparty and award the charterers the sum of US$260,000 (325 days x US$800).
 31.
 Wrongful conversion of the two water-makers 
 
Next we turn to the question of conversion of the two water-makers. These were purchased by the charterers for the use of the sub-charterers during the period of the charter. One was purchased in September 1993 for S$15,000 and the other in March 1994 for S$32,800. The charterers demanded the return of the two water-makers after the owners had withdrawn the vessel from the charter. In response to these demands the owners on 4 May 1995, more than a year after the vessel was withdrawn, wrote to the charterers saying that if the charterers did not take delivery of the water-makers by 11 May 1995, the owners would sell or otherwise dispose of the water-makers but they did nothing to facilitate the charterers taking delivery. So the charterers requested to be informed of the vessel`s location on 6 May 1995 and again on 8 May 1995 to enable them to take the water-makers from the vessel. The owners did not reply and the water-makers remained on board. On these facts the learned judge held that the owners had committed the tort of wrongfully retaining the charterers` water-makers. We entirely agree with the learned judge.
 32.
 Assessment of damages for wrongful conversion of the two water-makers 
 
The learned judge awarded damages in the sum of the purchase price paid by the charterers for the two water-makers, namely, S$47,800. She awarded this sum as the replacement cost of the two water-makers. Where there is a market the charterers are expected to diminish the damage by going into the market and buying the water-makers in the market, so as to put themselves in the position they would have been if they had not suffered any wrong at all. If there is no market for the goods converted, the measure of damages would be the cost of replacement and the charterers must go to their suppliers to purchase the water-makers so as to put themselves in the same position as if they would have if not for the conversion (see 
Hall v Barclay
 
[1937] 3 All ER 620
).
 33.The owners submit that the learned judge was wrong to have proceeded on the basis that there was no market for the water-makers at the time of the conversion which was when the vessel was withdrawn from the charter. No evidence was led to this effect. The owners also submit that the cost of replacement should take into account depreciation of the water-makers at the time of conversion. We agree with these submissions. In our view the damages payable for the conversion of the two water-makers should be reassessed.
 34.
 Order 22A r 9 - offers to settle; costs on an indemnity basis 
 
Lastly we turn to the order for costs the learned judge made. In respect of the charterers` claims she ordered that the owners pay the charterers` costs on an indemnity basis from 17 June 1997 and in respect of the owners` counterclaim, which she dismissed, that the owners pay the charterers` costs at an indemnity basis from 20 June 1997. The basis of these orders were the two offers to settle, one made on 16 June and the other on 19 June. In her grounds of judgment she said: 
... As the plaintiffs (charterers) obtained a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, under O 22A r 9 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs were entitled to costs on the standard basis, in respect of their claim, until 16 June 1997, and similarly for the defendants` (owners) counterclaim up to 19 June 1997. Thereafter for the plaintiffs` claim commencing 17 June 1997 and for defendants` counterclaim commencing 20 June 1997, the costs to the plaintiffs would be on a full indemnity basis.
 35.The offer letter of 16 June 1997 required the owners to admit liability to the charterers so that the charterers may proceed to an assessment of damages. The offer to settle which was open until 1 July 1997 was that the charterers would accept 80% of the damages as assessed. The offer letter of 19 June 1997 was that the owners would discontinue their counterclaim which was for unpaid charter-hire and damages for the wrongful arrest of the vessel, and pay the charterers costs of the counterclaim.
 36.Order 22A r 9 of the Rules of Court 1996 provides as follows: 
(1) Where an offer to settle made by a plaintiff - 
(a) ... 
(b) is not accepted by the defendant, and the plaintiff obtains a judgment not less favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,
 
the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date an offer to settle was served and costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.
 
... 
(3) Where an offer to settle is made by a defendant - 
(a) ... 
(b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,
 
the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless the law orders otherwise.
 Rule 13 provides the above rule applies, with the necessary modifications to counterclaims. Order 22A r 12 provides: 
Without prejudice to Rules 9 and 10, the Court, in exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into account any offer to settle, the date the offer was made, the terms of the offer and the extent to which the plaintiff`s judgment is more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle.
 37.It appears to us from that part of the learned judge`s grounds of judgment we have set out in [para ] 35 above that the learned judge applied the rule literally without the exercise of any discretion or making an inquiry into the rationale and policy of the rule. From a perusal of the record it appears that the learned judge was not assisted by counsel in the matter. Even before us and from a perusal of the written cases we have received scant assistance from counsel. Counsel for the owners submits we have a discretion whether to award costs on an indemnity basis or not under O 22A and she refers us to r 12. On the other hand counsel for the charterers submits that there were no defences of any substance against the charterers` claims and therefore an offer to accept 80% of the amount of damages assessed on an admission of liability was a fair offer to settle. There was an element of compromise in the offer and as the offer was not accepted and the charterers obtained a judgment not less favourable than the offer, the owners ought to pay costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the offer. These submissions do not assist us and we doubt whether they would have assisted the learned judge had these submissions been made to her.
 38.It must however be admitted that there is no local learning on `offers to settle`. This is not surprising as O 22A is of recent origin. But similar procedures have existed in other jurisdictions and have given rise to judicial evaluation and consideration, as our researches show. We will refer to these for guidance. In Ontario, Canada, the offer to settle regime is contained in r 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. In New South Wales, Australia, it is contained in Part 22 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 and the costs consequences are laid down in Part 52 r 7 thereof. Both provisions are pari materia with our O 22A.
 39.In the Ontario Court of Appeal in 
Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molner Systems Group
 
[1991] 85 DLR (4th) 392
, Morden ACJO identified the rationale behind r 49 of their Rules of Civil Procedure. He said at pp 398 and 399: 
As far as the dictionary meaning of `settle` is concerned, while it may commonly be the case that when a party `settles` a proceeding the settlement will involve some element of compromise, on one side or both. I do not think that `settle` necessarily requires a compromise. 
 The word means to bring a dispute to an end by arrangement of the parties as opposed to by judgment of a court on the merits
 ... [Emphasis added.]
 
The purpose of r 49 is to encourage the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more speedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end of the trial. 
 The impetus to settle is a mechanism which enables a plaintiff to make a serious offer respecting his or her estimate of the value of the claim which will require the defendant to give early (that is, when the offer is served) and careful consideration of the merits of the case
. [Emphasis added.] There are many cases where there is no defence of any substance to a liquidated claim and, having regard to the purpose of the rule, I can see no reason, in such a case, why a plaintiff`s offer must be for something less than the full amount of the claim. The purpose of the rule is to discourage a defendant from using the judicial process, at the increased cost to the plaintiff, to delay the granting of the inevitable judgment and, in my view, there is no valid policy reason why a plaintiff should have to forgo part of its claim in order to be able to avail itself of the benefit of the rule. In such a case, I do not think there is any unfair prejudice to the defendant in being faced with such an offer.
 In that case, the plaintiff put up an offer to settle for 100% of the liquidated sum claimed and the court held that due to the complexities of the case which reasonably gave rise to uncertainties as to liability, it was not appropriate to order costs on an indemnity basis.
 40.There is greater emphasis on the element of compromise taken by the courts of New South Wales. In 
Tickell v Trifleska Pty Ltd & Anor
 
[1991] 25 NSWLR 353
 Rogers CJ said at 354: 
It is the primary aim of any judicial system to attempt to bring the parties to a point where, with fairness to themselves, they are able to dispose of the dispute between them 
 by compromise
. ... The whole object of establishing the system of offers of compromise was to make it easier for parties to come to a 
 true compromise
 of the dispute between them. [Emphasis added.]
 In that case the plaintiff made an offer to compromise for 100% of the amount claimed and the court held that costs on indemnity basis should not be awarded. At p 355 Roger CJ said: 
It was never in the minds of the draftsmen of the rule, or members of the Rule Committee responsible for the passing of this rule, that Pt 22 should be utilised simply as a statutory demand which, other circumstances being equal, will automatically entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis
 41.The same position was taken in 
Hobartville Stud Pty Ltd v Union Insurance Co Ltd
 
[1991] 25 NSWLR 358
 where the plaintiff offered to accept one dollar less than the full amount claimed and the court also refused to order costs on an indemnity basis against the defendant who did not accept the offer to compromise. Giles J at p 368 opined that even in cases where the plaintiff had a very strong case, there was still a need to make a compromise to attract the costs consequences under the rules. He was of the opinion that when these were genuine questions of liability between the parties, the plaintiff should not be permitted to litigate the issue of liability at the expense of the defendant.
 42.We find the jurisprudence referred to above of considerable assistance. The rationale or the principle behind O 22A is perfectly clear. If we may borrow the words of Morden ACJO in 
 Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molner Systems Group 
 it is to encourage the termination of litigation by agreement of the parties - more speedily and less expensively than by judgment of the court at the end of the trial.
 43.In our considered view where there is no defence of any substance to a liquidated sum, then in line with the principle behind O 22A, compromise is not a necessary element in the offer to settle. However, the lack of compromise would be a material consideration in determining whether the plaintiff or the defendant should be penalised with higher costs in cases where there are genuine issues of liability raised. This applies to both liquidated and unliquidated claims. In each case an exercise of discretion is called for (see O 22A r 9(1) and (2) `... unless the Court orders otherwise` and also O 22A r 12). It should be noted that the divergence of views expressed by the Ontario court and the New South Wales court stems from the applicable rule itself. The Ontario rule refers to an `offer to settle` whereas the New South Wales rule refers to an `offer to compromise`. Our O 22A refers to an `offer to settle`.
 44.In our considered view, also, it is axiomatic to the proper application of O 22A that the offer to settle should be a serious and a genuine offer and not just to entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis. This is particularly so where the claim is for an unliquidated sum to be ascertained. In our view an offer to settle for a percentage of an unliquidated sum to be ascertained, as the claims in this case for damages to be assessed, cannot by any means be said to be a serious and a genuine offer to settle. It runs counter to the principle behind O 22A as stated in [para ] 43 above. An assessment of damages, even where liability is a matter of course, can give rise to numerous complexities and result in protracted hearings and expense. It must follow that to offer to settle at a percentage of the unliquidated sum to be ascertained or of damages to be assessed cannot be a serious and a genuine offer to settle but is made to take an unfair advantage of r 9 of O 22A.
 45.What, in our view, is required is for the plaintiff to make his own estimate of what the unliquidated sum ought to be or his own assessment of what the damages ought to be and to offer that sum as being a fair and reasonable sum which the defendant ought to pay in settlement of his claim. It is then for the defendant to carefully consider the merits and demerits of the plaintiff`s claim and accept or reject the offer bearing in mind that should the offer be rejected and the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining judgment for a sum not less favourable than the offer he stands to pay costs on an indemnity basis. We respectfully adopt the words of Morden ACJO in 
 Data General (Canada) Ltd v Molnar System Group 
 that `the impetus to settle is a mechanism which enables a plaintiff to make a serious offer respecting his or her 
 estimate of the value of the claim 
 which will require the defendant to give early ... and careful consideration to the merits of the case`. [Emphasis added.]
 46.The mechanics under O 22A is not unlike the mechanics under O 22. Under O 22 the defendant makes an estimate in monetary terms of what he thinks is a fair and reasonable settlement of the plaintiff`s claim which he then pays into court. Likewise, under O 22A the plaintiff makes an estimate in monetary terms of what he thinks is a fair and reasonable sum the defendant ought to pay to settle his claim and offers to accept that sum in settlement of his claim - the offer to settle.
 47.The offers to settle the charterers` claim and the owners` counterclaim, in respect of which there was no judgment, in our view, were not serious or genuine offers to settle. The learned judge ought not to have awarded the charterers costs on an indemnity basis from the dates of the respective offers.
 48.
 Summary 
 
In our judgment, the charterers are entitled to their alternative claim for damages arising out of the owners` wrongful withdrawal of the vessel. As for the charterers` principal claims the position was this. Although the vessel was unseaworthy and the owners were in breach of cl 1, the owners` repudiatory breach was not accepted and communicated in any way by the charterers who were content to continue with the charterparty so long as the sub-charterers did not elect to terminate the sub-charterparty by reason of unseaworthiness. For the reasons stated, cl 3(i) of the charterparty was not applicable. In addition, the owners were also liable for the conversion of the two water-makers.
 49.Accordingly, we set aside the learned judge`s assessment of damages both in respect of the wrongful withdrawal of the vessel and the conversion of the two water-makers. We also set aside the learned judge`s award of costs on the indemnity basis in respect of the charterers` claims and the counterclaim from 20 June 1997. On the questions of costs, the considerations are these. The owners have partially succeeded on the contractual issues based on the unseaworthiness of the vessel. Those issues, which took up a lot of time, need not have been addressed as the case turned exclusively on the question whether the owners had wrongfully withdrawn the vessel from the service. The appeal before us cover issues of assessment in addition to those in contract and tort. However, the owners are ultimately liable for wrongful withdrawal of the vessel and the conversion of the two water-makers. In our view, the owners should bear one-third of the costs below. As for the costs before us, the owners having succeeded on most issues of liability and assessment should be awarded one-third of the costs of the appeal. However, the orders for costs the learned judge made on the ancillary applications shall stand. The appeal deposit will be refunded to the appellants.
 50.
 Conclusion 
 
In the result there will be judgment for the charterers in the sum of US$260,000; the assessment of damages for the conversion of the two water-makers will be referred to the Registrar for re-assessment; the owners (the appellants) are awarded one-third of the costs of the appeal but they shall pay the charterers (the respondents) one-third of the costs below; the orders for costs the learned judge made on the ancillary applications shall stand; and the appeal deposit will be refunded to the appellants (the owners). And we so order.",1998-12-07 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 The facts 
 1.On 19 February 1998, the appellant was charged with criminal breach of trust by a clerk or servant contrary to s 408 of the Penal Code. From 1993 to 1997, the appellant worked as a school clerk in St Anthony`s Primary School at No 1 Bukit Batok Street 34, Singapore. It was alleged that, from 11 January 1994 to 4 November 1994, she kept an amount of $26,188.50 being school and other fees belonging to the school.
 2.
 The proceedings 
 
On 28 May 1998, the first day of the six-day trial, the DPP tendered amended charges with the effect that the total amount the appellant now stood to be charged for was reduced to $1,400. This was split into two charges alleging criminal breach of trust of $800 in September 1994 and of $600 in May 1994.
 3.At the same time, the DPP informed the court that, two days preceding the hearing, evidence that a much larger sum was involved had come to light. She maintained that the same witnesses would be called. Nevertheless her instructions were not to proceed with the trial, pending further investigation into other amounts taken by the appellant during her employment at the school. The DPP sought an adjournment of proceedings and invited the court to exercise its powers under s 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the CPC`).
 4.Unfortunately, the district judge refused an adjournment on the mistaken ground that there was a general policy against granting adjournments. It was at this juncture that the prosecution applied under s 184 of the CPC for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. This was granted in respect of the original charge for $26,188.50. The appellant appealed to the High Court, seeking an acquittal. I dismissed the appeal on 13 October 1998. As such orders are not so common, I was grateful for this opportunity to make some observations on discharges not amounting to an acquittal.
 5.
 The appeal 
 
Before me, the appellant sought an acquittal. Two issues fell to be considered. First, could an acquittal be granted by the High Court and, more importantly on the present facts, should an acquittal have been granted by the court below ? I shall briefly dispense with the issue of jurisdiction. The offence in question, criminal breach of trust contrary to s 408 of the Penal Code is punishable by a maximum seven-year term of imprisonment. This fell within the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court by virtue of the provision in s 7(1) of the CPC. These facts are easily distinguishable from Yen Ching Yan v PP 
[1998] 3 SLR 430
 where the District Court, not being possessed of a criminal jurisdiction to hear the capital case, did not have the jurisdiction to grant the appellant a discharge amounting to an acquittal. This answers the first issue positively in that it was within the High Court`s appellate jurisdiction, having the same powers as the court below, to order an acquittal.
 6.I now turn to examine the circumstances which may warrant an order of discharge amounting to an acquittal. Section 184 of the CPC reads: 
(1) At any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered, the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge and thereupon all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same. 
(2) Such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court so directs except in cases coming under s 177.
 7.It has been held that the Public Prosecutor`s right to apply for a stay of proceedings under s 184 comes into existence upon the commencement of a summary trial: Loh Siang Piow & Anor v PP 
[1998] 2 SLR 384
. That case also decided that a summary trial is commenced when the charge is read and explained to the accused. In the present appeal, the appellant was charged on 19 February 1998.
 8.The DPP`s application was made on the first day of the hearing, that is, on 28 May 1998. As comprehensively discussed in recent cases such as 
Arjan Singh v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 271
  and 
PP v Kolandavelu
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 446
 , applications such as these are made at the Public Prosecutor`s discretion, as conferred upon him by art 35(8) of the Constitution and s 336(1) of the CPC. It is the prosecution`s power to initiate an application for the defendant to be discharged on the basis that the prosecution does not intend to prosecute further. As held in 
 Arjan Singh 
, the court has no discretion as to the staying of all proceedings on that charge and as to the discharge of the defendant from and of the same under s 184(1). These consequences are expressly provided for in the wording of s 184(1).
 9.However, upon the application under s 184(1) being made, s 184(2) kicks in. It then lies at the discretion of the court whether or not to allow the discharge to amount to an acquittal. LP Thean J (as he then was) observed at p 676 of his grounds of decision in 
Goh Cheng Chuan v PP
 
[1990] SLR 671
 that the words of s 184(2) are unambiguous and clear, and effect must be given to them: they give to the court an unfettered discretion to direct, in appropriate circumstances, that the discharge shall amount to an acquittal. At p 674 of the same grounds, he noted, and I concur, that in the ordinary case, the order of discharge under s 184 does not amount to an acquittal. This initial presumption is attributed to the wording of the legislation in stating that discharges ordered shall not amount to an acquittal `unless the court so directs`. I turn now to consider some of the factors that the court should consider in deciding whether or not to direct an acquittal.
 10.Upon a perusal of the case law on s 184, it appears to me that considerable leverage has been placed on prosecution`s statement of its intentions as to further prosecution in the near future. Although I am confident that the practice of law has progressed since cases such as 
K Abdul Rasheed & Anor v PP
 [1984-1985] SLR 561 where Lai Kew Chai J admonished the habit of refusing to order an acquittal on prosecution`s indication that it was not withdrawing the charge, it bears repeating that prosecution`s intentions are not a conclusive factor. In fact, a close reading of 
 Abdul Rasheed 
 and 
 Goh Cheng Chuan 
 will show that these statements were bald statements for which the learned judges rightfully placed little weight. I can do no better than to refer to LP Thean J`s observations in 
 Goh Cheng Chuan 
 at p 674 of his grounds: 
... In applying for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, the deputy public prosecutor said, among other things, that `the prosecution [had] every intention to proceed against the two accused` once the material witness was found. This ingenious move, it seems to me, was adopted to obviate the difficulty which was considered to be faced by the prosecution in 
 Abdul Rasheed
. 
 Such a move is undesirable, as it is unclear and confusing. If that section is invoked, it can only operate on the basis that the prosecution `will not further prosecute` the accused
. [Emphasis is mine.]
 The difficulty in 
 Abdul Rasheed 
 referred to above was the need to balance the prosecution`s right to proceed at a later stage with the prejudice to the accused in staying proceedings for an indeterminate period. However, it is unsatisfactory for the prosecution to merely declare its intention not to leave this matter suspended. As I said in 
 Loh Siang Piow 
, the Public Prosecutor ought to inform the court of all relevant matters as early as possible, for example, the difficulty of tracing a material witness.
 11.I noted from the record of the proceedings that the DPP was unable to give the court below any indication as to why an adjournment or stay of proceedings was required, apart from the fact that fresh evidence had surfaced in the two days before the hearing. In fact, the DPP confirmed in the notes of evidence that all her prosecution witnesses were waiting outside the courtroom. This brings me to a point that requires some clarification. At para 10 of her grounds of decision, the district judge refused the DPP`s application for an adjournment on the basis that the subordinate courts had a clear policy that no adjournments would be allowed unless there were very good reasons. While the courts justifiably practice rigorous case management principles to uphold our standards of efficiency, it is perhaps a timely reminder that granting a bona fide application for an adjournment would uphold equally crucial standards of justice. The appellant is now discharged but the prosecution is clearly not withdrawing their charges with the undesirable result that the appellant is subject to an indefinite apprehension of criminal proceedings, a position which would not have been as uncertain if an adjournment had been granted. I hasten to add that an adjournment continues to be viewed against the applicant. It remains the same measure against which Justices Lai Kew Chai and LP Thean decided to grant an acquittal in the cases of 
 Abdul Rasheed 
 and 
 Goh Cheng Chuan 
 respectively, where the proceedings were extensively delayed such that an original complainant was dead and the other unavailable in 
 Abdul Rasheed 
 and the remaining witness in 
 Goh 
 was unavailable after five years. Essentially, the courts are concerned with simultaneously expediting justice in the interests of the public and providing an accused with a fair trial.
 12.Returning to the issue of acquittal, what constitutes good cause has been clearly discussed in several older cases, such as 
Koh Teck Chai v PP
 
 
[1968] 1 MLJ 166
  and 
PP v Suppiah Pather
 
[1953] MLJ 126
 . In summary, the prosecution should give an indication of its intention to prosecute at some foreseeable point of time; and, substantiate reasons for its inability to proceed immediately. These requirements remain today. On the facts before me, I found no reason to disagree with the district judge`s refusal to grant an acquittal pending the DPP`s further investigations. The DPP informed the court that fresh evidence had surfaced just two days before the hearing. This evidence related to the same set of facts and the DPP submitted that any fresh charges should be tried together with the existing ones.
 13.In the circumstances, I did not find any `improper motive for making the application`, with reference to the principles laid down in 
 Arjan Singh 
 and 
 Loh Siang Piow & Anor 
. Before me, an affidavit filed on behalf of the prosecution stated that they have now recorded numerous additional statements from members of the school community and also from other relevant bodies. In the present case, investigations began only in December 1997 with the appellant being charged in February 1998. Proceedings in the court below were stayed in May 1998. In contrast to the period over which the offences are alleged to have been committed, this did not strike me as an unconscionable delay. I was also mindful of the facts of this case. The appellant had been a trusted servant of the school for some five years and the alleged act of dishonesty concerned a large amount of school fees. In the circumstances, I did not find any grounds to grant the appellant an acquittal but directed that the case be heard fairly quickly.",1999-01-04 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Facts 
 1.In 1979, one Haresh Chotirmall (`the petititoner`) was instructed by one M Udharam Bahanani, the managing director of a Panama company, Intra Group (Holdings) Co Inc (`Intra`) to purchase, in his own name, but as a trustee for the company, a property at Lot 287-19, Mk 25, known as 8B Tanjong Rhu Road, from one Dr Melville Norman De Souza, for $245,000. Intra supplied the purchase moneys, and a further amount for the renovation of the property between 1982 and 1983, although apparently some of the purchase price or cost of renovation was paid for by the petitioner.
 2.Being a permanent resident, the petitioner was a `foreign person` for the purposes of the Residential Property Act, and so sought and received approval from the Comptroller of Residential Property, subject to his first delivering an undertaking to use the property for his sole occupation and that of the members of his family as a dwelling house, and not for rental or any other purpose. He did not disclose to the Land Dealings (Approval Unit) that he intended to hold the property as a nominee for Intra. It was unclear whether he failed to do so intentionally, or simply because he was unaware that the legislation required him to obtain approval if he intended to hold it only as a nominee.
 3.Nevertheless, pursuant to his having received such conditional approval to acquire the property in his own name, the sale and purchase of the property was completed on 4 September 1979.
 4.In 1994, the petitioner contracted to sell the property to Hillview Mansion Pte Ltd for $11,064,050 without the consent of Intra. Hardikar Prasanna Dattaray, Intra`s assistant company secretary, lodged a police report against the petitioner. In the resulting investigations, the petitioner was charged with acquiring the property as a nominee with the intention of holding the property on trust for Intra under s 14(1)(a) read with s 25(1) of the Residential Property Act. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was convicted and fined $5,000 or three months` imprisonment in default.
 5.The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) took action to locate and seize the proceeds of sale. Part of the proceeds were represented by a bank account with the Bank of East Asia, containing $1,111,294.45 at 16 December 1995, the date the account was seized by the CAD. Another portion of the proceeds was located in the hands of Khattar Wong & Partners, who represented the petitioner in the sale and purchase, as stakeholders. The moneys held by Khattar Wong & Partners were paid over to the Accountant-General on 12 March 1997 and amounted to $7,785,501.70. Following the petitioner`s conviction and sentencing, these sums were subject to a disposal inquiry in the Subordinate Courts, presided over by district judge Eddie Tham.
 6.A parallel civil suit, Suit No 767 of 1996, was instituted by Intra against the petitioner for breach of trust. The primary relief sought was a declaration that the proceeds of sale were held by the petitioner on trust for Intra. The suit, however, was settled on the first day of trial and consent judgment entered by Chan Seng Onn JC on terms to the following effect: 
(1) The petitioner would pay Intra the sum of $1,269,751.88 with interest accrued thereon from 1 January 1998 at 7.5% per annum, compounded on a monthly basis. 
(2) Any sums received by the petitioner in the disposal inquiry would be divided in the following way: 
(a) the petitioner would pay Intra $695,000 being the sum remitted by Intra to the petitioner on account of the property; 
(b) the petitioner would retain $64,168.97 being the amount paid by the petitioner on account of the property; 
(c) the balance sum, if any, would be divided between Intra and the petitioner in the ratio 60:40.
 7.The district judge, having considered the terms of the consent judgment, made an order to this effect in the disposal inquiry: (1). of a sum of $740,000, $695,000 be paid to Intra and the balance divided between Intra and the petitioner in the ratio 60:40;
 (2). of the balance, 60% to be paid to Intra and the remaining 40% be confiscated by the prosecution.
 8.It is in respect of the decision of the district judge, from which there can be no appeal, that these petitions for revision come before me. In Crim Rev 21/98, the Public Prosecutor seeks confiscation of the 60% of the balance of the proceeds ordered to be paid over to Intra. In Crim Rev 24/98, Haresh Chotirmall (referred to for convenience as `the petitioner`) seeks a reversal of the order that 40% of the balance of the proceeds be forfeited to the State, and contends that it ought to be paid to him.
 9.
 Scope of criminal revision 
 
Generally speaking, a court sitting in its revisionary capacity will not interfere with the decision of a district judge in a disposal inquiry unless there is `a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice` or to `set right serious injustice` (per Yong Pung How CJ in 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 , applying 
Sofjan & Anor v PP
 [1969-1971] SLR 123 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 272
  and 
Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd & Ors v Vankrisappan & Ors
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 414
 ).
 10.
 Purpose of disposal inquiry 
 
In 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop 
, Yong Pung How CJ held that the disposal inquiry is `an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items produced at trial or found in the course of investigations`. It is not conclusive as to title and the rightful owner can assert his rights in a civil suit (applying 
Hoh Chee Khim & Ors v PP
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 105
 ). If, however, ownership is proved, the court has the discretion to award the item to its owner if it thinks fit (
 Thai Chong Pawnshop 
 at p 416 F-G). In the present case, the facts are not substantially in dispute. The complexity of the case stems from the legal issues.
 11.
 The legal issues 
 
The two main questions raised on the district judge`s order were, firstly, whether he had awarded the proceeds of sale to the rightful owner, and secondly, in view of the award, whether he had judiciously exercised his power of forfeiture under s 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code. I will deal with these in turn.
 12.
 Ownership of sale proceeds 
 
I first pause to reiterate my dicta in 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop 
 that the disposal inquiry is not a means by which to resolve conclusively a dispute on title. However, it is equally clear that this reasoning only applies where there is a dispute on the facts giving rise to competing claims to the property. In that situation, the court, lacking the procedures available in civil process to decide between competing claims, applies a `rough and ready` approach and makes an award in favour of the party it thinks has the better right to possession: see my decision in 
Sim Cheng Ho & Anor v Lee Eng Soon
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 346
  at p 350.
 13.In 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop 
, however, there was no dispute as to the ownership of the property. The facts were that items in question had been stolen and pledged with certain pawnshops. In the disposal inquiry, there was no question that ownership of the stolen goods vested in the person from whom the goods were stolen: the pawnshop had no right to title. The pawnshop had purchased the goods caveat emptor and the only issue, after restoring possession to the rightful owner, was the exercise of the district judge`s discretion under s 31 of the Pawnbroker`s Act (Cap 222) to order the owner to make a compensatory payment to the pawnbroker. Where there are little or no factual disputes, and title turns only on a question of law, the court can consider the question, even if it is a complex one.
 14.If, therefore, Intra had made a clear case for title on the undisputed facts, the district judge was correct to grant its claim. The Public Prosecutor contends, however, that Intra had no locus standi as a claimant in the disposal inquiry because it had acquired no proprietary interest in the subject matter of the inquiry, namely, the proceeds of sale. If that is correct, then the district judge committed a fundamental error in making an award in Intra`s favour.
 15.There are three routes by which Intra may assert an interest in those proceeds, the validity of each of which I propose to discuss in turn. The first is by asserting the existence of an express trust arising in 1979, when the property was acquired by the petitioner; the second is by asserting that the same facts in 1979 gave rise to a constructive trust; lastly, Intra may assert that a constructive trust arose when the petitioner sold the property and pocketed the proceeds in 1994.
 16.
 Express trust 
 
It is common ground that the petitioner was or became a fiduciary for Intra in 1979 when he took moneys from Intra on the understanding that he would acquire the property in his own name, but on trust for Intra. The moneys were subject to an express trust. These moneys were then transmuted into a trust in the property. The petitioner, however, misapplied these funds (or more accurately, the property representing them) when he sold the property and kept these funds for himself. This constituted a breach of trust, or a breach of fiduciary duty, and, in the ordinary case, affords Intra with two alternative remedies, of which it must elect one. It may seek either a proprietary remedy by having a declaration that the proceeds of sale (which represent the trust property) be held on trust for Intra, or a personal remedy for damages and an account of profits.
 17.However, the proprietary remedy is obstructed by two provisions of the Residential Property Act which render the trust in the immovable property null and void. The first is s 3(1)(b) read with s 3(2)(b) which I now set out: 
3(1) Except as provided in this Act - 
... 
(b) no person shall create any trust for sale in respect of any residential property or any estate or interest therein in favour of any foreign person; 
... 
(2) Any - 
... 
(b) trust for sale in respect of any residential property or any estate or interest therein created by any person in favour of any foreign person in contravention of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section 
...
 
 shall be null and void
. [Emphasis added.]
 18.The second provision is s 14, the relevant parts of which are as follows: 
(1) No - 
(a) citizen or approved purchaser shall purchase or acquire any estate or interest in any residential property as a nominee of any foreign person with the intention that such citizen or foreign person shall hold it in trust for such foreign person; and 
(b) foreign person shall authorize or appoint as his nominee any citizen or approved purchaser to purchase or acquire any estate or interest in any residential property with the intention that such citizen or approved purchaser shall hold it in trust for such foreign person. 
(2) Any trust created in whatever manner or form pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be 
 null and void 
 and there shall be no resulting trust in favour of the foreign person; and any contract or covenant between such citizen or approved purchaser and the foreign person in respect of such residential property or any estate or interest therein shall be null and void.[Emphasis added.]
 19.As I have emphasised, any attempt by an agent to acquire land on express trust for a foreign principal is rendered null and void by the Act. In my view, this prohibition obstructs not only the proprietary action for the trust property, but also prevents the beneficiary from tracing the trust property into the proceeds of its sale. The Act prohibits the court from giving effect to the parties` intention to create a proprietary interest in the beneficiary`s favour. This is so even in the absence of an express agreement to create a trust: s 14(2) puts beyond doubt that a resulting trust could similarly not arise.
 20.The trust, however, is not null and void if the procedure outlined in Part III of the Act is complied with. Under Part III, a foreign person may seek approval to purchase residential property on trust for a foreign principal.
 21.In fact, the petitioner did seek and obtain limited approval to acquire the property as a dwelling place for himself and his family. The effect of that approval was to circumvent the prohibitive effect of s 3(2)(a) and (c) (which prohibit the sale to or acquisition by a foreign person of residential property absolutely). In other words, the petitioner was permitted to purchase that particular residential property, and the sale of the property to him was not null and void.
 22.However, the approval did not extend to the creation of a trust for sale in favour of a foreign company. His failure to obtain such approval formed the basis for the petitioner`s criminal conviction. According to the Public Prosecutor`s argument, it follows that when the petitioner purchased the property, s 3(2)(b) or s 14(2) prevented the creation of an express trust of the equitable interest in Intra`s favour, and the petitioner held the property absolutely. Logically, this meant that Intra could not acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the property, and, by extension, had no say in the disposal inquiry.
 23.This much was agreed to by counsel for Intra, Mr Davinder Singh, who conceded that if, ex hypothesi, his client were to stake a claim to the premises before it was sold, that claim would have been blocked by s 3, or alternatively, s 14. If there was no trust in the property, then it follows that there could be no express trust in the proceeds of its sale. I accept this reasoning as correct. Accordingly, the district judge erred in law in awarding the sale proceeds, or any part thereof, to Intra, at least if he did so on the basis of an express trust. The petitioner was the legal owner of the property and therefore legally entitled to the proceeds.
 24.
 Constructive trust arising in 1979 
 
Mr Davinder Singh, however, contends that the prosecution`s argument that Intra has no proprietary claim is misconceived. He says that even though no express trust could arise in the property, his client is the beneficiary of a constructive trust in the proceeds. He says this constructive trust arose in 1979, when the petitioner, knowing that approval was required for him to purchase the property as a trustee, failed to get such approval. At this point I think Mr Davinder Singh and I parted ways on logic.
 25.His view was that his clients` claim to the premises before it was sold would have been blocked by ss 3 or 14, regardless of whether that claim was premised on an express or constructive trust. However, he says a distinction can be drawn between the residential property (in which the foreign person cannot acquire an interest) and the proceeds of sale (concerning which the statute is silent). Thus, he argued, by virtue of a constructive trust arising in 1979, it would have been possible for his client to enjoin the sale of the property in the petitioner`s hands, on terms such that the petitioner could not deal with the property inconsistently with the constructive trust in Intra`s favour. By extension, he says, now that the property has been dealt with, Intra can trace into the proceeds of sale declared in its favour, ergo Intra`s claim in the disposal inquiry.
 26.I disagree with the proposition that a constructive trust can operate in this manner, ie that it exists `in suspense` whilst it is represented by the property, and that it reattaches or bites when it is represented by the proceeds. With the exception of the remedial constructive trust (which I will come to later) I do not envision any doctrine under which a constructive trust can operate in this manner. If the Act permits the beneficiary under a constructive trust to pursue his claim against the property, then he must also be allowed to follow that claim into the proceeds of its sale (subject to the rules governing tracing in equity). If, however, the Act does not permit the beneficiary`s claim to bite on the property, neither can it bite on the proceeds. A proprietary claim premised on a constructive trust cannot (unless the Statute clearly provides) `lay dormant`: it either exists or it does not.
 27.In other words, if there is a constructive trust created by operation of law, then both the property as well as the proceeds must be accessible (if one construes the Act to permit the survival of constructive trusts) or inaccessible (if one construes otherwise).
 28.
 Whether a constructive trust survives the Act 
 
The more pertinent question is therefore whether a constructive trust survives the legislation or not. Whereas ss 3(1)(b), 3(2)(b) and 14 refer to the `creation` of a trust, or the `acquisition` of property with the intention to hold it on trust, the statute is silent on trusts which are not expressly `created` by the parties but which arise by operation of law.
 29.Let us, for the sake of argument, suppose that A, a Singapore citizen, is a fiduciary for B, a foreign person. Suppose then that A misappropriates B`s money in breach of trust and uses that money to buy residential property in Singapore.
 30.B, undoubtedly, has a personal action at common law against A for money had and received:

[1951] AC 251
 and, more recently in 
Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale
 
[1991] 2 AC 548
. The Act does not prohibit such an action in personam.
 31.B would ordinarily also be able to stake a claim on the property itself, either at law if the moneys remained identifiable until the property was acquired (

) or in equity (if the moneys were mixed or co-mingled prior to acquisition, and subject to the rule in 
Re Hallet`s Estate
 
[1880] 13 Ch D 696
). Does the fact that he is a foreign person for the purposes of the Residential Property Act frustrate his proprietary claim? Or, as Mr Davinder Singh put it - was it the intention of Parliament, by the Act, to obstruct his clients` efforts to trace the trust property into the proceeds?
 32.In 
Tan Cheow Gek v Gimly Holdings Pte Ltd
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 817
  at p 825, Judith Prakash JC held the view that the Act was passed to: 
... prevent speculation in residential properties in Singapore by foreigners leading to a rise in property prices which would adversely affect the interests of Singapore citizens.
 33.That is also the Government`s view, as revealed in 
 Hansard 
: 
... the cost of real estate had been sharply on the increase and had almost doubled over the previous year. Government was concerned about the rise and decided that it should confine its efforts at keeping down the cost of residential property, leaving the market value of commercial and industrial properties to find their levels by interaction of factors governing supply and demand. (Parliamentary Debates, 19 August 1975, Col 1202)
 34.The statutory objective of the Act is to limit speculation by foreigners in the residential property market in order to keep housing affordable for Singapore citizens. The objective is achieved by prohibiting foreign ownership of certain classes of residential property, including ownership by using trust devices.
 35.The wording of ss 3 and 14 reveal that the targeted mischiefs are: (a). `the creation of a trust for sale` [s 3(1)(b)];
 (b). the appointment of a citizen or approved purchaser by a foreign person `as his nominee` [s 14(1)(b)] and
 (c). the purchase or acquisition by a citizen or approved purchaser of an interest in residential property `with the intention ... [to] hold it in trust for [a] foreign person` [s 14(1)(a)].
 36.These provisions all refer to, and prohibit the creation of, express trusts. Section 14(2) prohibits a resulting trust from arising upon the failure of the express trust. This is an important provision to which I will return later. There is, however, nothing in the statute which prohibits a constructive trust from arising by operation of law. A constructive trust (at least one arising in the manner I have stated) falls into none of the prohibitions: it is neither a trust for sale nor an acquisition by a person intending to hold it only as a nominee. The Act prohibits trusts created by a transfer of property with the consent of, or the intention to benefit, the beneficiary. The constructive trust, on the other hand, is imposed by law when the transfer occurs against the wishes of the beneficiary, often fraudulently, and without exception, to his detriment.
 37.The Parliamentary Debates reveal that the creation of a constructive trust in favour of a foreign person was never an issue which concerned the legislators. That is perhaps understandable - I do not see how giving effect to a constructive trust, at least one arising in the manner I have described, can contravene the objectives of the Act. If the property is purchased by a Singapore citizen intending to hold it absolutely, then, at face value, there is no violation of the Act: even if his investment is speculative, this is not the type of speculation which the Act is aimed at. If, however, it happens that he was a fiduciary for some foreign person and had misappropriated the foreign person`s moneys to acquire the property, then the declaration of a constructive trust in the foreign person`s favour does not in any way contravene the intention of the Act. There was no intention on the part of the foreign person to speculate in Singapore property. It cannot even be said that he intended to acquire that property. The acquisition of the property on trust for him is against his wishes, and, in my view, he is entitled to trace his moneys into the property or the proceeds of its sale. In short, a constructive trust in moneys used to purchase residential property would survive the provisions of the Act.
 38.
 Did a constructive trust arise in 1979? 
 
However, I do not think a constructive trust can be made out on the facts of this case. The facts were that Mr Udharam, for Intra, instructed the petitioner, then a de facto director of the company and its representative in Singapore, to acquire the property on trust for the company, as was the company`s practice. In fact, the company had leased the property at 8B Tanjong Rhu Road, for Udharam when he lived in Singapore. Subsequently, the property was taken over by the petitioner, and in 1979, when the owner of the property decided to leave Singapore and sell the property, it was offered to Intra. As the petitioner was by then the only employee of Intra resident in Singapore, it was decided that the property should be bought in his name.
 39.It was alleged that, when the petitioner bought the property in his name in 1979, this amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty in that (1) he procured or permitted Intra to enter into an illegal transaction; (2) he procured or permitted Intra to purchase the property when he knew Intra would not acquire an interest in the property; or (3) he failed to protect Intra`s interests. There was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner intended, in 1979, to defraud the company of the moneys. On the contrary, he had repeatedly acknowledged Intra`s ownership of the property until about 1992, when he first contended that the property was owned by him absolutely.
 40.I am extremely doubtful whether these events constituted a breach of fiduciary duty justifying the imposition of a constructive trust. At its highest, I think the petitioner`s actions in 1979 amounted only to negligence, in that he failed to ascertain what were the proper legal steps required to obtain the property on the terms communicated to him by Intra, ie on trust. Even so, I do not think that degree of negligence amounted to a breach of his fiduciary duty as a de facto director of the company. On the company`s part, it could hardly say that it had been defrauded by its fiduciary.
 41.It would be more accurate perhaps to analyse the transaction between Intra and the petitioner as a payment made under a mutual mistake of law. However, I am uncertain whether a proprietary claim premised on a mistake of law can be justified on conventional reasoning. That proposition, which may have had currency as recently as 1994, must now be viewed as suspect. In 
Sinclair v Brougham
 
[1914] AC 398
 the plaintiffs had deposited moneys with a banking business operated by a company in which the shareholders were defendants. As it turned out, the banking business was ultra vires and upon the company`s insolvency, there were competing claims to priority by the depositors and shareholders. The House of Lords considered that an equitable proprietary interest arose under a trust in favour of the depositors. Viscount Haldane, with whom Lord Atkinson agreed, considered that the interest was in the manner of `a resulting trust, not of an active character` (at p 421).
 42.The English Court of Appeal, considering itself bound by it, expressly applied 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 in 
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council
 
[1994] 4 All ER 890
[1994] 1 WLR 938
. In 
 Westdeutsche 
, the plaintiff bank paid money to the defendant local authority pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement. The agreement was subsequently held by the House of Lords to be ultra vires the powers of the local authority and void. In an action to recover the money, the English Court of Appeal considered that the payment of the money under the mistaken belief that the transactions were valid gave rise, from the time the money was received, to a resulting trust in favour of the bank, and that the bank therefore had a proprietary claim to the money.
 43.The correctness of that reasoning arose incidentally in an appeal to the House of Lords on the question whether the bank ought to recover compound or only simple interest: see 
[1996] AC 669
; 
[1996] 2 WLR 802
. To establish the right to compound interest, the bank sought to preserve the Court of Appeal`s finding that its claim had a proprietary base. Lord Goff of Chievely considered that 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 might be confined to its particular facts, and declined to overrule it. He expressed the opinion, however, that the decision did not compel him to uphold the bank`s assertion of a proprietary right. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, whilst agreeing with Lord Goff`s conclusion that the bank had no equitable proprietary interest, spoke in stronger terms of 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 at 
[1996] AC 669
 at p 713; 
[1996] 2 WLR 802
 at p 836: 
As has been pointed out frequently over the 80 years since it was decided, 
 Sinclair v Brougham
 is a bewildering authority: no single ratio decidendi can be detected; all the reasoning is open to serious objection; it was only intended to deal with cases where there were no trade creditors in competition and the reasoning is incapable of application where there are such creditors. In my view the decision as to rights in rem in 
 Sinclair v Brougham
 should also be overruled. Although the case is one where property rights are involved, such overruling should not in practice disturb long-settled titles. However, your Lordships should not be taken to be casting any doubt on the principles of tracing as established in 
 Re Diplock
.
 44.Lord Lloyd of Berwick agreed that the decision ought to be overruled. Lord Slynn of Hadley, who expressed agreement with Lord Browne-Wilkinson, did not go so far, saying only that 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 ought to be departed from. Lord Woolf did not consider the question of overruling, but he agreed that it ought not be followed. Accordingly, even if I do not consider the decision overruled, it must be seriously doubted, and cannot form the premise for a proprietary claim here.
 45.The chief difficulty with 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 is that the payments made by the plaintiffs were intended to vest legal title in the recipients, and, payment not having been induced by fraud, ought ordinarily to have limited the plaintiffs` claim to a personal claim only. From the viewpoint of conventional theory, the source of the proprietary remedy is unclear.
 46.If it is to be regarded as correct in result but not reasoning, it may well be, if it were to be decided again today, that 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
 might be classified as a remedial constructive trust, a category of trusts not as yet recognised in English or Singapore law, though the possibility that such a doctrine may yet be entertained at some future date was mooted by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in 
 Westdeutsche 
 in his consideration of 
Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1980] 2 WLR 202
, a decision in which a proprietary claim was awarded for a mistake of fact. The plaintiffs had mistakenly paid the same sum to the defendants twice over, and thereafter sought recovery of the second payment. Owing to the defendants` insolvency, they asserted a proprietary claim so as to rank above the unsecured creditors. Goulding J awarded judgment to the plaintiffs, a result which did not sit on all fours with their Lordships` decision in 
 Westdeutsche 
, since there was no principle identified in 
 Chase Manhattan 
 that elevated the plaintiffs` claim beyond an in personam action. In dealing with the decision, Lord Browne-Wilkinson had the following comments at 
[1996] AC 669
 at p 716; 
[1996] 2 WLR 802
 at p 839: 
Although the resulting trust is an unsuitable basis for developing proprietary restitutionary remedies, the remedial constructive trust, if introduced into English law, may provide a more satisfactory road forward. The court by way of remedy might impose a constructive trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly deprived. Since the remedy can be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case, innocent third parties would not be prejudiced and restitutionary defences, such as change of position, are capable of being given effect. However, whether English law should follow the United States and Canada by adopting the remedial constructive trust will have to be decided in some future case when the point is directly in issue.
 47.For the same reasons I do not propose to consider the applicability of the doctrine of remedial constructive trusts here, at least not without the benefit of counsel`s submissions.
 48.As I have said, the proprietary claim was not recognised in 
 Westdeutsche 
 because it did not fall into a recognised category of legal principle giving rise to a claim in rem. Notwithstanding the ambiguous `resulting trust` imposed in 
 Sinclair v Brougham 
, their Lordships agreed in 
 Westdeutsche 
 that if the bank`s proprietary claim was based on a resulting trust, it had to fail because the facts fell into neither of the accepted means by which such a trust may arise. Said Lord Goff at 
[1996] AC 669
 at p 689; 
[1996] 2 WLR 802
 at p 814: 
As my noble and learned friend, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, observes, it is plain that the present case falls within neither of the situations which are traditionally regarded as giving rise to a resulting trust, viz (1) voluntary payments by A to B, or for the purchase of property in the name of B or in his and A`s joint names, where there is no presumption of advancement or evidence of intention to make an out-and-out gift; or (2) property transferred to B on an express trust which does not exhaust the whole beneficial interest. The question therefore arises whether resulting trusts should be extended beyond such cases to apply in the present case, which I shall treat as a case where money has been paid for a consideration which fails.
 His Lordship went on to hold that the failure of consideration gave rise to a personal claim only (and therefore rejected the claim for compound interest).
 49.In the present case, we see that Intra`s advancement of moneys to the petitioner for the purchase of the property falls squarely into the first of the enumerated categories of resulting trusts. However, even if I were to accept the existence of a proprietary claim in the manner of a resulting trust, Mr Davinder Singh`s argument would still fail. I am bound to recognise the bar on the proprietary remedy imposed by s 14(2), the section to which I made earlier reference, the relevant part of which reads: 
there shall be no resulting trust in favour of the foreign person
 50.Accordingly, on the question whether the mistake as to the provisions or effect of the Residential Property Act sufficed to invest Intra with a proprietary claim, I think the answer must, for the present purposes, be negative.
 51.At its very best, I think Intra`s right of recovery in 1979 amounted only to a personal action (which, of course, does not give rise to a proprietary remedy). It has come to my attention that, shortly after I heard parties` submissions, the House of Lords released an important decision reversing the long-established rule that a party may not bring a personal claim to recover moneys paid under a mistake of law. 
Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council & Ors
 
[1998] 3 WLR 1095
 concerned an action by a bank to recover moneys paid to local authorities under the same type of ultra vires interest rate swap agreements which gave rise to the 
 Westdeutsche 
 litigation. The local authorities resisted the claim, citing the rule established by the Court of King`s Bench in 
Bilbie v Lumley
 
[1802] 2 East 469
; 102 ER 448.
 52.The House of Lords declined to uphold the rule. The rule was criticised, broadly speaking, on three grounds. Firstly, that justice seemed to demand that the payer ought to recover where he has paid under the mistaken belief that he was required by law to do so, unless special circumstances dictated otherwise; secondly, that it was a capricious distinction that a payer could recover if he had laboured under a mistake of fact but not if he had made a mistake of law; and thirdly, the law as it stood tempted the courts to skew the interpretation of facts into one type of mistake or other to do justice in a particular case. Said Lord Goff, who delivered the leading opinion: 
It is perhaps easier for us now to see that the policy underlying the rule can best be achieved, consistently with justice, by the recognition of a right of recovery subject to specified defences to cater for the fears which formerly appeared to require a blanket exclusion of recovery.
 53.His Lordship went on to explain that the foundation for the departure from the established rule had been laid by, first, recognition that there exists a coherent law of restitution founded upon the principle of unjust enrichment, and secondly, recognition of the defence of change of position. In the event, their Lordships allowed the appeal from the decision of the Queen`s Bench, which had applied the old rule. If that is correct, then Intra would, subject to the other part of their Lordship`s decision, which concerns the time from which the period of limitation begins to run, have had a personal claim against the petitioner. That, of course, is besides the point, since it seeks in this revision to assert a proprietary claim.
 54.On that point, I reiterate that I think no constructive trust arose in the property in 1979. There was no breach of fiduciary duty giving rise to a trust in 1979. If a resulting trust arose because the Act avoids the express trust, I cannot recognise it because the statute avoids that too.
 55.The only remaining source of a proprietary remedy is the assertion that there was a breach of fiduciary duty when the petitioner sold the property in 1994 and kept the proceeds for himself. The question with which we are now concerned is the imposition of a constructive trust in 1994, at the point of sale of the property, and the existence of a proprietary remedy into the proceeds of that sale.
 56.
 Constructive trust arising in 1994 
 
I also have problems acknowledging that there was a breach of trust in 1994 when the petitioner sold the property and kept the proceeds. Had the express trust not been avoided by the Residential Property Act, then the petitioner would have been a trustee of the property, and his sale of the property and retention of the proceeds would ordinarily give the beneficiary two remedies: a proprietary claim to the proceeds (or property representing the proceeds) or a personal claim for damages for breach of trust or an accounting remedy. The disposal inquiry was concerned with the question whether there was a proprietary claim.
 57.If, however, the Act prohibited an express or resulting trust from arising when the property was acquired in 1979, and if there was (as I have held) no constructive trust affording a proprietary claim arising out of the events in 1979, then there is no `trust property` in respect of which the assertion of breach of trust can bite. In other words, for all intents and purposes, the petitioner was the legal and equitable owner of the property when he sold it in 1994. There was no breach of trust because the property was not trust property. As I have said, I do not agree with Mr Davinder Singh`s contention that, although Intra had no interest in the land for the period 1979 to 1994, it did have a `suspended` interest, which revived in the proceeds immediately upon the land being sold. The trust property must be identifiable throughout, or there is nothing to which the fiduciary obligation attaches. On these facts, Intra`s claim would probably have been limited to the in personam remedy elaborated on in 
 Kleinwort Benson 
. That does not assist us because here we are concerned with whether Intra has a claim in rem.
 58.However, even if I am wrong and there was some form of constructive trust over the proceeds arising in 1994, the proprietary claim would still be obstructed by the doctrine of illegality. The petitioner relies on the maxim in pari delicto potior est conditio possidentis, meaning, where both parties are equally guilty in an illegal transaction, the condition of the possessor is best. According to this rule, the court will not assist a party to recover property transferred in the course of an illegal transaction, and the loss lies where it falls, ie with the transferor. See 
Holman v Johnson
 
[1775] 1 Cowp 341
; 98 ER 1120. In the present case, the illegality takes the form of the blanket prohibition contained in the Residential Property Act.
 59.The courts will, however, render assistance to recover property transferred for an illegal purpose provided that the underlying illegal purpose does not have to be relied upon: 
Bowmaker`s Ltd v Barnet Instruments Ltd
 
[1945] KB 65
. 
Tinsley v Milligan
 
[1994] 1 AC 340
[1993] 2 All ER 65
 was a decision of the House of Lords recognising that the principle in 
 Bowmaker 
`s case extends to claims founded in equity as well as in law. So far as an equitable interest in property is the subject matter of a plaintiff`s claim, 
 Tinsley 
`s case is now the leading authority in England. Their Lordships` decision was applied here by Judith Prakash JC [as she then was] in 
Eng Bee Properties Pte Ltd v Lee Foong Fatt
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 837
 .
 60.In 
 Tinsley 
, the parties purchased a house, but which was registered in the sole name of the appellant so as to enable the respondent to make false claims for social security benefits. The parties fell out. The appellant claimed an equitable interest in the house on the basis of a resulting trust. In an action seeking possession of the house, Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that while the law would not permit enforcement of a contract for an illegal purpose, it neither prevented property passing under that contract, nor a plaintiff enforcing property rights under such a contract, provided that the plaintiff did not need to rely upon the illegal contract to establish the basis of his claim to the property right. Hence, His Lordship reasoned at 
[1994] 1 AC 340
 at p 376; [1993] 2 All ER 65 at p 91: 
The plaintiff is entitled to recover if he is not forced to plead or rely on the illegality, even if it emerges that the title on which he relied was acquired in the course of carrying through an illegal transaction...The respondent established a resulting trust by showing she had contributed to the purchase price of the house and that there was a common understanding between her and the appellant that they owned the house equally. She had no need to allege or prove why the house was conveyed in the name of the appellant alone, since that fact was irrelevant to her claim: it was enough to show that the house was in fact vested in the appellant alone. The illegality only emerged at all because the appellant sought to raise it.
 61.Similarly, 
Tribe v Tribe
 
[1996] Ch 107
 was a case in which a father transferred shares to his son for no consideration in order to deceive his creditors. He repented of his illegal purpose before he could achieve it, and sought to recover the shares from his son. His son refused to do so, and so the father brought an action against the son. The ratio of the case is that where the presumption of advancement applies, the transferor must rebut the presumption in order to establish his claim, but that because he must give evidence of the underlying illegal purpose in order to rebut the presumption, his claim will fail because the court will not recognise that evidence on the grounds of public policy. The Court of Appeal went on, however, to hold that the principle of locus poenitentiae extended both to claims in contract and equity, ie where the wrongdoer has withdrawn from his illegal purpose before it has been achieved, the court will recognise his title and re-vest the property in him. The latter part of the decision has no application here and is referred to for completeness.
 62.
 Tribe 
 is nonetheless illustrative of the principle in 
 Tinsley 
: if Intra has to rely on the underlying illegal transaction (the acquisition of the property on trust for itself) to assert its proprietary claim arising out of the petitioner`s breach of fiduciary duty in 1994, the claim must fail. In 1994, the petitioner was the legal owner of the property. He was entitled to the proceeds of its sale. Intra`s claim is entirely contingent upon the assertion that in 1979, when the petitioner purchased the property, he did so subject to the terms of an express trust, or alternatively, that there was a resulting trust in Intra`s favour, which trusts are prohibited by s 14(2). Because the claim is premised on a prohibited transaction, I cannot recognise it, and it fails accordingly.
 63.
 Weston v Beaufils 
 
Mr Davinder Singh, however, says that his client relies on a different exception to this rule, namely, that, where the transaction has been induced by the fraud or breach of fiduciary duty of one party, the innocent party may recover property transferred as a consequence of that transaction. He cited in argument 
 Weston v Beaufils 
 122 ALR 240.
 64.
 Weston v Beaufils 
 is a decision of the Federal Court of Australia in which Hill J stated that, where the transfer of property in pursuit of an illegal purpose is induced by fraud or breach of fiduciary duty, the transferor may recover his property. In 
 Weston 
, the plaintiff, Weston, had under-declared his income and structured his investments to evade income tax for ten years. When he got wind of a new tax filing system that would unravel his wrongdoing, he consulted a solicitor, the first defendant, Beaufils, who thereupon advised him that he could avoid detection if he transferred his properties to dummy companies set up by the first and second defendants. The defendants thereafter effectively misappropriated all those properties. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the companies held those properties on trust for him. Hill J agreed. The basis of his reasoning is set out in two important passages. At p 266, he stated: 
The first, and a very relevant exception on the facts of the present case, is said to apply where, although the parties may be in pari delicto in relation to the transaction which brings about a transfer of property sought to be recovered, that transaction has been induced by fraud of one of the parties, or there has been a breach of fiduciary duty by one of the parties to the other. This is but another way of saying that the parties are not in pari delicto at all.
 And then at p 267: 
In recommending, as a solicitor to Mr Weston, that moneys be paid to the Coolangatta Hotel company, in which Mr Beaufils had an interest, and that assets be transferred to companies under the control of Mr Beaufils, the latter stood in a fiduciary relationship to his client. That relationship he breached by putting himself in a position where his duty and his interest conflicted. Mr Weston acted upon Mr Beaufils advice. It would be unconscionable now for Mr Beaufils to be in a position to defend the present proceedings and thus be enriched by his own breach of duty on the basis that there was an illegal arrangement to which both he and Mr Weston were parties and that accordingly the loss should remain where it lay (ie on Mr Weston, not Mr Beaufils). In truth, there was no equality in the illegal participation. Mr Weston and Mr Beaufils were not in pari delicto. For this reason I am of the view that the defence of Mr Beaufils should fail.
 65.The principle in 
 Weston 
 has some precedent in England: 
Hughes v Liverpool Victoria Legal Friendly Society
 
[1916] 2 KB 482
 and 
Shelley v Paddock
 
[1980] 2 WLR 647
, both decisions of the Court of Appeal not cited in 
 Weston 
. These decisions also proceeded on the basis that, because of the fraud, the parties were not in pari delicto and that the innocent party could recover (which, in essence, is the same reasoning applied in 
 Weston 
). Thus, in 
 Hughes 
, the plaintiff recovered insurance premiums when he had been induced by the defendant`s fraudulent representation that an insurance contract was lawful when it was in fact illegal. In 
 Shelley 
 the plaintiff had been fraudulently induced by the defendants to enter into a contract to purchase a house which they had no title to give. It happened that the circumstances in which payment was made amounted to breach of exchange control regulations, although the plaintiff was unaware of this. The court held that notwithstanding the statutory violation, the plaintiff could recover damages in tort for fraud against the defendants.
 66.In all these cases, however, the `fraud` pertained to the illegal transaction. In other words, Intra`s claim is still tainted by illegality unless it can establish that there was fraud pertaining to the events in 1979. It has made that assertion, but I have held that there was, at best, only negligence. It cannot rely on a fraud occurring in 1994 for two reasons. The first is that the fraud in 1994 did not induce Intra to enter into the contract which, by virtue of its illegality, now perverts its claim. In 1979, both parties were still in pari delicto. Neither was innocent of the illegality, although both of them may have been ignorant of it. The second is, if I am correct in having held that the Act absolutely prevented any interest from arising in the property and that no constructive trust arose in 1979, there was no fraud to speak of in 1994, since the petitioner was the legal and equitable owner of the house (and, by extension, the proceeds of its sale).
 67.Of course, that presents us with a nice question, which is, in view of what the House of Lords has now decided in 
 Kleinwort Benson 
, how ought we to treat the in pari delicto rule where the illegal transaction was entered into under the mutual mistaken belief that it was legal? Does the rule not apply since the parties were unaware of the illegality? Since 
 Kleinwort Benson 
 was decided after the hearing, and the parties have agreed that the transaction was tainted by illegality (ie that the rule applies), I do not consider that I am bound to address that question here.
 68.Now, if I had agreed with Mr Davinder Singh that there was a constructive trust arising in 1979, then he would not have had to rely on the exception in 
 Weston 
 at all, the obvious reason being that (as I have held) the Act does not prohibit constructive trusts. If the creation of a constructive trust is not illegal, the in pari delicto rule does not obstruct the claim. However, as I have said, I think no constructive trust arose then.
 69.The Public Prosecutor, however, seeks to distinguish 
 Weston 
 on another ground. He made reference to Hill J`s observation at p 265 that: 
It is important, in this context, to identify the illegality alleged. Where the illegality alleged is, as here, conspiracy, it is the agreement between the parties which constitutes the illegality. The transfer by Mr Weston of assets was not, of itself, illegal. If it were, then the result would be quite different. The transfer is a legal act carried out in furtherance of the illegal agreement. To permit Mr Weston to recover property transferred is to put to an end the illegal purpose, not to enforce it. In permitting Mr Weston to recover, the court is merely giving effect to the resulting trust arising by virtue of the transfer being made without consideration, it is not giving its aid to the unlawful agreement. Rather, it is the respondent who is calling in aid the illegality by way of defence.
 70.The Public Prosecutor says that this passage identifies a distinction between cases where the illegal purpose is collateral to the transaction, and cases where the transaction is itself illegal. 
 Weston 
, 
 Hughes 
 and 
 Shelly 
 fall into the first category. In those cases, the property transactions were not themselves illegal, but that they were conducted with a view to achieving an `illegal purpose` - to evade tax or tax penalties (in 
 Weston 
) or to conduct an insurance fraud (in 
 Hughes 
) or avoidance of exchange control regulations (in 
 Shelly 
). 
 Tinsley 
 and 
 Tribe 
, to which I referred earlier, illustrate the same distinction: in both cases, the illegal purpose (to defraud the State of social security benefits - 
 Tinsley 
, or to deceive creditors - 
 Tribe 
) was sought to be achieved by entirely legal methods, namely, the transfer of property. The present case, however, falls into the latter category, namely, where the transfer of property is itself illegal. In those circumstances, it is said that the claimant cannot divorce his claim from the illegality: the claim is tainted by the illegality and it must fail.
 71.In that respect, the Public Prosecutor says that because the Residential Property Act makes the creation of all trusts illegal, Intra cannot lay claim to a proprietary interest under the exception in 
 Weston 
. To allow Intra`s claim, the court would, to use the words of Hill J, not be putting an end to the illegal purpose, but enforcing it.
 72.Again, that argument presupposes that the Act prohibits constructive trusts together with express and resulting trusts. I think it only extends to the latter two categories. It does not extend to the creation of constructive trusts, and, provided Intra had been able to establish a breach of trust in 1979 (for example, if the moneys had been stolen or misappropriated) then I think it could have succeeded without availing itself of the exception in 
 Weston 
, 
 Hughes 
 and 
 Shelley 
.
 73.I pause only to note that one important feature of both 
 Hughes 
 and 
 Shelley 
 is that the plaintiffs were innocent of the illegality. Where the party seeking to recover is not innocent but aware of the illegality of the transaction, he cannot succeed: 
Parkinson v College Of Ambulance, Ltd, and Harrison
 
[1925] 2 KB 1
, a decision of the Court of Appeal distinguishing 
 Hughes 
. I am not certain that the same degree of `innocence` could be attributed to the plaintiff in 
 Weston 
. Accordingly, I have my reservations as to whether it forms part of the same line of decisions as 
 Hughes 
 and 
 Shelley 
. I therefore think 
 Weston 
, on its facts, extends those cases to a point not as yet accepted in England, or, for that matter, in Singapore.
 74.My conclusion, in short, is that: (a). Intra could acquire no interest in the property or the proceeds of its sale under an express trust because of the provisions of the Residential Property Act;
 (b). had Intra shown that, in 1979, the transfer of moneys to the petitioner for the purpose of buying the property was induced by fraud, it could have established a constructive trust which would have survived the provisions of the Residential Property Act. However, it failed to do so;
 (c). Intra`s claim in 1979 was limited to a personal action for negligence, or alternatively the recovery of moneys paid under a mistake of law, and, at that point, it had acquired no proprietary remedy which would afford it a claim in the disposal inquiry;
 (d). if there was no express or resulting trust surviving the provisions of the Act in 1979, there was no trust property to speak of in 1994. Therefore a proprietary claim premised on a breach of trust in 1994 would also fail;
 (e). even if a constructive trust in the sale proceeds arose in 1994, the court cannot recognise that interest because Intra must assert the underlying illegality in order to establish its claim.
 75.Undoubtedly, had the equitable title survived the provisions of the Act, it would have been possible to find a breach of trust in 1994 giving rise to a personal as well as a proprietary remedy. However, the only claimant with a true proprietary interest was the petitioner. Intra`s in personam claim against the petitioner did not give it a right to the moneys in question. The district judge`s decision to allow Intra`s claim was tantamount to allowing Intra to garnish the moneys owned by the petitioner, and there are obviously more appropriate methods of achieving that result. It constituted an error of law and I therefore award the proceeds to the petitioner, Haresh Chotirmall. It is therefore left to me only to decide on the Public Prosecutor`s application, namely, whether or not to order forfeiture, a question which I consider below.
 76.I propose, however, to deal with one final matter first. It appears that none of the parties has applied for revision of that part of the district judge`s order that $695,000 be paid to Intra (ostensibly in compensation for its capital investment in the acquisition and renovation of the property). In view of the reasons I have presented above, I do not see why I should uphold that part of his order. It stands to reason that if Intra has no proprietary claim to the property, that must include a claim to the capital as well as the profits. It can stake no claim to the entirety of the proceeds. Accordingly, whatever order I make on the question of forfeiture, it will concern the whole of the proceeds, represented by the two accounts, with the Bank of East Asia for the sum of $1,111,294.45 and, with the Accountant-General, for the sum of $7,785,501.70. Intra, having no proprietary claim, must be limited to the in personam action. That includes the $45,000 ordered to be divided between the petitioner and Intra.
 77.
 Forfeiture 
 
I now turn to the question whether the moneys in the accounts ought to be handed over to their legal owner, being the petitioner, or whether they ought to be forfeited to the State. There is some discussion whether the term `forfeiture` ought to refer to the subject matter of the offence and `confiscation` should refer to the benefits or profits of the commission of the offence. I make no comment on that distinction, and the words are used here interchangeably.
 78.The question I now turn to is whether an order for forfeiture is consistent with the objectives of the Act, and under what circumstances a judge ought to exercise his discretion to order forfeiture.
 79.In 
 Magnum Finance 
, I identified that forfeiture is provided for in the legislation in three ways: (1) in statutes creating offences in which forfeiture of the subject-matter of the offence is mandatory and the court has no discretion but to order as such; (2) in statutes creating offences which also prescribe forfeiture as a penalty but in which forfeiture remains at the discretion of the court; and (3) in all other cases, s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies, first to govern the disposal inquiry and then the question whether a forfeiture order should be made. The present case falls into the third category.
 80.In 
 Magnum Finance 
, which also fell into the third category, I stated the following principles: (1). the onus is on the prosecution to show that forfeiture would be appropriate in the circumstances of each case;
 (2). forfeiture is primarily a punishment and serves as an additional penalty to the accused (at p 527G);
 (3). there is nothing in the language of s 386(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code to indicate that forfeiture is limited to cases where the property was unlawfully or improperly obtained or where the ownership cannot be ascertained (at p 528A);
 (4). an important consideration is the degree of the claimant`s complicity in the offence. Where the offence involved the use of a motor-vehicle, and the State seeks the forfeiture of the motor-vehicle, it was relevant that there were no reasonable steps available to the claimant to prevent the use of the motor-vehicle in the offence (bringing a woman into Singapore knowing she had been procured for the purposes of prostitution in Singapore, s 140(d) Women`s Charter) (at p 530B);
 (5). the value of the vehicle is also relevant in considering whether the forfeiture is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the maximum imposable punishment (at p 530C);
 (6). it would not materially aid the inquiry to consider whether or not, in the event of forfeiture, the claimant had civil remedies elsewhere as the existence of a civil claim does not ipso facto provide any rational justification for forfeiture (at 531D);
 (7). deterrence may well provide the only explanation why forfeiture should be ordered in any case. Forfeiture only operates meaningfully as a deterrent where the property to be forfeited belonged to the accused or to someone tainted with complicity. Where the claimant is innocent of any complicity, a forfeiture order ought not to be granted (at p 531F-G, 532F);
 (8). where the accused was fined $8,000 under a provision allowing a maximum penalty of $10,000 and a custodial sentence of up to five years, it was doubtful whether the offence was sufficiently serious to warrant forfeiture (at p 532H).
 81.The Public Prosecutor seeks to distinguish 
 Magnum Finance 
, in which confiscation was not ordered, on two grounds. Firstly, in 
 Magnum Finance 
, I said that forfeiture of vehicles of a hire purchase company would not in any way prevent further occurrences of the offence in that case, namely, the use of a vehicle to smuggle prostitutes into Singapore. By comparison, says the Public Prosecutor, forfeiture of residential property acquired by foreign persons in derogation of the Act, or forfeiture of the proceeds of sale of such investments would deter such acquisitions in the future.
 82.Secondly, whereas in 
 Magnum Finance 
 the hire-purchase company was only an innocent stranger to the wrongdoing, in the present case the petitioner has the paramount criminal responsibility. The petitioner was, undoubtedly, the wrongdoer in failing to obtain the requisite approval; or in failing to disclose the fact that the property was acquired by himself as a nominee only. The only party which could be regarded as `innocent` was Intra and for the reasons I have given, Intra has no claim to the proceeds. Even so, I am minded to distinguish even Intra`s `innocence` from that of the hire-purchase company in 
 Magnum Finance 
. Whereas I held in that case that there were no reasonable steps the company could have taken to prevent the use of the vehicle for the illegal purpose, there were undoubtedly steps which Intra, an experienced international trading and investment conglomerate, could have taken to avoid falling afoul of the Residential Property Act. By seeking legal advice, or corresponding directly with the lawyers performing the conveyance, they could have found out much earlier how to comply with the approval procedures in Part III of the Act. It does not help Intra`s position that Udharam, who instructed the petitioner, had in fact lived and worked in Singapore for a number of years.
 83.In reply, Mr Abdul Rashid Ghani argues for the petitioner that the purpose which I should seek to uphold is the deterrence of foreign agents from soliciting persons in Singapore to purchase properties on trust for them. In that respect, he says there is sufficient deterrence flowing from my recognition of the position that the Act does not confer a proprietary interest on the foreign agent. He says nothing is to be gained by penalising the Singapore citizen or approved purchaser who has bought the property on trust. He says forfeiture would not deter that person from agreeing to hold property on trust for a foreign person: if the moneys advanced are from the foreign person, the `trustee` would have invested nothing and suffers no potential loss, and so forfeiture has no effect on him, save that he loses a bare legal title.
 84.Secondly, it is said that in casting the petitioner in the light of a `wrongdoer` it must be remembered that he had approval to purchase the property in his own name. Hence if he had paid for the property with his own money, he would have been entitled to the proceeds. His wrongdoing was a breach of fiduciary duty.
 85.Thirdly, he says that it is relevant that the petitioner received a fine only and not a sentence of imprisonment. He relies on what I said in 
 Magnum Finance 
 that the court ought to consider the gravity of the offence. He further relies on my dicta that the court ought to weigh the value of the forfeited property against the gravity of the offence. He says, that judging from the fine imposed ($5,000) compared to the maximum penalty ($5,000 and three years` imprisonment), the gravity of the offence is not great. Similarly, it could hardly be said that one solitary transaction could have contributed significantly to rises in residential property prices in Singapore.
 86.Finally, it is said that since the petitioner had approval to purchase the property in his own name, and the trust of the property is invalid, there is no mischief in awarding the proceeds to him, and to leave Intra to pursue its civil remedy for breach of trust or contract. The petitioner`s punishment lies in the criminal conviction; there is nothing in the Act requiring forfeiture. I was referred to the Parliamentary Debates (at col 1206), in which the government explained that it had originally contemplated the imposition of income tax penalties on defaulting foreign persons, but that this scheme had been considered unworkable, so s 25 (the provision under which the petitioner was convicted) was introduced. Hence, he submits, there is nothing warranting the sanction of an additional penalty, namely, forfeiture.
 87.In considering these arguments, the question which weighs heavily on my mind is whether a person who acquires property in contravention of a statute, and then seeks to rely on the statute as an instrument of fraud, should be permitted to profit by his wrongdoing. In considering the relevance of the argument that the gravity of the offence does not attract forfeiture, it must be remembered that in 
 Magnum Finance 
 the claimant was entirely innocent of wrongdoing. The case is quite different here. The petitioner was guilty not only of a breach of the provisions of the Act, but attempted, in 1994, to rely on that breach to commit a fraud upon the company.
 88.To uphold the policy of the Act, at least on the present facts, I would consider that to deny the Public Prosecutor`s application for forfeiture would serve to encourage, rather than deter, non-compliance with the statutory provisions. Dealing with Mr Abdul Rashid Ghani`s first argument, I think it cannot be the case that forfeiture would not deter a Singapore citizen from purchasing the property on trust. On the contrary, if he knew that he might receive a windfall (if he is allowed to keep the proceeds of sale when the illegal scheme is discovered) that might prove a real incentive to him not to disclose the existence of the trust to the authorities.
 89.Secondly, it is not the case that the petitioner`s sole wrongdoing was the breach of fiduciary duty. He has breached the provisions of the Act in that he has assisted, or been complicit, in an illegal scheme which deceived the Government and violated the fundamental purpose of an Act of Parliament.
 90.Thirdly, my dicta in 
 Magnum Finance 
 concerning the need for parity between the sentence imposed and the consequence of an order for forfeiture must be read in light of (1) my finding that the petitioner, unlike the hire-purchase company in 
 Magnum Finance 
 was not innocent and (2) the effectiveness of a forfeiture order in deterring future illegalities. Whereas the position of the claimant in 
 Magnum Finance 
 was that of an innocent third party which was helpless to prevent a minor encroachment, I think the same cannot be said of the petitioner here.
 91.Lastly, I consider there to be not inconsiderable force in the contention that Parliament withdrew the unworkable scheme for an income tax penalty in exchange for a simpler scheme providing for a general offence for breach of the provisions of the Act. However, there is nothing to indicate that the provisions of s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code were not meant to work side by side with the provisions of the Residential Property Act. The scheme contemplated by s 386(2) is that special provisions in an act creating an offence have precedence. In the absence of such special provisions in the Residential Property Act, however, there is nothing to obstruct the exercise of judicial discretion over the proceeds of sale under s 386(2). I think it cannot be the case that Parliament intended the sole penalty against a defaulting foreign person or approved purchaser to be the s 25 offence. There are undoubtedly cases which will attract imprisonment in addition to the fine, and may warrant forfeiture as well. In cases such as the present case, where the maximum fine but not a custodial sentence is imposed, one must ask whether that penalty is sufficient. I think it is not. Accordingly, I would exercise my powers to vary the order of the district judge, and order that all sums representing the proceeds of sale be delivered into the hands of the State accordingly. It will be remembered that this sum of $8,896,796.15 still falls well short of the sale price of $11.06m, and that the balance is no longer accessible to the State.",1999-01-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was tried in a magistrate`s court on the following charge: 
You, Lim Poh Eng M/57 years NRIC No 0283101E, are charged that you between 14 January 1997 and 19 January 1997 at Health Gallery located at 32A Lorong Marican, Singapore, did cause grievous hurt to one H, to wit, by failing to attend to her complaints adequately after the colonic washout treatments and failing to refer her to the hospital for treatment, which omissions were so negligent as to endanger the life of the said H and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 338 of the Penal Code.
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced to ten months` imprisonment and ordered to pay compensation of $39,066.02 to H. He appealed against his conviction and sentence. I heard his appeal on 2 February 1999 and dismissed it. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 The facts 
 
The appellant is Lim Poh Eng, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. In 1992 the appellant went to the Hei Long Jiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China for a three week course in the internal medicine aspect of traditional Chinese medicine. While he was there, the appellant met a professor who was versed in the field of colon cleansing. This professor explained to him the colon cleansing procedure (`the procedure`) and showed him the equipment used. At this time the appellant had no intention of practising colon cleansing and did not purchase any equipment.
 3.In 1993, after his return, his son George Lim purchased colon cleansing equipment off the internet. The appellant tried the procedure on himself. After gaining confidence, he introduced the procedure to his family. From August 1996 onwards, the appellant started to introduce the procedure to his patients at his clinic, Health Gallery, which was in fact situated in his residence at 32A Lorong Marican.
 4.On 11 January 1997, one H visited Health Gallery for a consultation. H was seen by George Lim who prescribed a course of treatment of colonic washouts, and told H to return to the clinic on 14 January 1997 to begin her course of treatment.
 5.H returned to Health Gallery on the morning of 14 January 1997 with her daughter. They were attended to by the appellant`s daughter Sally Lim who instructed them to begin colonic washouts in the bathrooms. Sally Lim gave H a piece of paper and informed H and her daughter to follow the instructions on it. The procedure of colonic washout was not demonstrated to them. Both H and her daughter went to the bathrooms to begin the treatment without any supervision. During the treatment, H used the intercom to inform Sally Lim that she had difficulty inserting the tube into her anal canal. Sally Lim told H to insert the tube slowly and to try it again on her own.
 6.H did as she was told and completed the procedure. However, she felt unwell and tired after the procedure and was unable to work that day. She complained to the appellant when she saw him that afternoon but the appellant assured her that it was a normal reaction to colonic washouts. When H returned home she was unable to pass urine.
 7.On 15 January 1997 H returned to Health Gallery for her second washout, which she again administered on her own. After the washout she saw the appellant and informed him that she felt tired and unwell, that she had slight abdominal pain and that she had been unable to pass urine the night before. The appellant again assured her that this was a normal reaction.
 8.On 16 January 1997 H returned for her third washout. The washout was again self-administered. After the washout she experienced bowel incontinence. This was witnessed by the appellant and Sally Lim. The appellant did not give H any medical examination nor did he prescribe any medication for her. Instead he offered to arrange for someone to give her a massage to improve her blood circulation. H found the massage very painful. Bruises subsequently appeared, although she was unaware of this at the time. On 17 January 1997 H returned again to Health Gallery. Being too tired to continue with another washout, she rested in a room upstairs.
 9.Sometime in the evening of 17 January 1997, H`s husband and daughter brought her to Health Gallery and confronted the appellant. At this time, H displayed shortness of breath, spoke haltingly, required support from two persons to walk, looked pale and tired, had a weak pulse and showed signs of dehydration. The appellant told her family that she merely had an excess of `wind` and a deficiency of qi and prescribed Sheng Mai Shan. The appellant admitted that, after drinking the medicine, H`s pulse was still weak and he had reservations about her recovery. H`s family brought her home after she took the medicine. On 18 January and 19 January 1997, H did not return to Health Gallery. The appellant did not bother to monitor her health and progress, and assumed that she had chosen to visit another physician or doctor.
 10.On the night of 19 January 1997, H`s condition rapidly deteriorated and she was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Dr Denis Cheong (`Dr Cheong`) was the surgeon who operated on H after her admission. He testified that, on her admission, she was in grave danger. She exhibited signs of severe sepsis, low blood pressure, diabetic ketoacidosis (`DKA`) and disseminated introvascular coagulation (`DIVC`). Dr Cheong found a 0.5 cm perforation in H`s anal canal. His opinion was that the perforation had led to extensive gangrene on the pelvic floor, resulting in a mortality risk of 80% by the time he saw H. Dr Cheong carried out the first operation on 20 January 1997. The gangrene was highly advanced by that time and three further operations were necessary to remove all the dead tissues. Dr Cheong was of the opinion that the perforation was caused by the colonic washouts, which, left untreated, led to the gangrene, DKA and DIVC. Dr Cheong`s opinion on this was supported by Dr Francis Seow (`Dr Seow`), of the Department of Colorectal Surgery, Singapore General Hospital. After a six week stay in hospital, H recovered. She was however left with the permanent loss of her rectum and would have to wear a colostomy bag indefinitely.
 11.Dr Seow was one of the expert witnesses for the prosecution. He was of the view that the appellant was negligent in four areas. First, in allowing H to self-administer the washout without proper supervision. Secondly, in ignoring H`s complaints when they arose. Thirdly, in continuing to neglect her complaints and, fourthly, in giving H minimal treatment and sending her home when she was in a pre-collapse state.
 12.Another expert witness for the prosecution was Professor Deng Cheng Shan (`Professor Deng`), Deputy Director of Xiyuan Hospital, Beijing China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Professor Deng was of the view that the appellant was negligent in three areas. First, the appellant should not have allowed H to self-administer the colon cleansing. Secondly, the appellant should have carried out a rectal digital examination when H experienced pain after performing colon cleansing or had urinary or bowel incontinence. Thirdly, the appellant failed to diagnose H adequately on 17 January 1997. The appellant thought that she merely had asthenia, but in view of her dehydration and weak pulse, she was in fact suffering from shock syndrome and ought to have been sent to a hospital.
 13.Professor Shi Hai Ann (`Professor Shi`), Professor of Surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital at Hubei University, was one of the defence`s expert witnesses. He was of the view that colonic washouts could be self-administered and that the risk of perforation was less than 0.5%. His view was that, as the anal canal is about 2.5 cm long, if the insertion was 2 cm or less, the risk of perforation was negligible. The instructions given to H however stated that insertion was not to exceed three inches.
 14.
 Decision of the trial judge 
 
The trial judge held that the standard of negligence was the civil standard of negligence and that the relevant standard of care for civil actions was that laid down in 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Committee
 
[1957] 2 All ER 118
 of being `the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill` and that `it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary man exercising that particular art`. Applying the standard of care to the case, the trial judge was of the view that, since the appellant held himself out as a Chinese physician, the relevant standard was that of a Chinese physician.
 15.The trial judge was of the view that the medical evidence showed that the appellant owed the following duties to H in the light of her complaints: (a). he ought to have been concerned once H complained of the three symptoms of fatigue, an inability to pass urine and bowel incontinence;
 (b). he ought to have exercised special care once he heard H`s complaints as he was aware that H was diabetic;
 (c). once the three symptoms were known to him, a rectal digital examination should have been carried out to determine whether there was a perforation;
 (d). accordingly, by 16 January 1997, it was clear that he should have conducted a rectal digital examination. This would have revealed the 0.5 cm perforation. As he was unable to do so, he should have sent H to a hospital for tests;
 (e). the possibility of infection, sepsis and DKA should have been considered. If the appellant`s clinic was not equipped to handle tests for sepsis, DKA and DIVC, the patient should have been sent to a hospital;
 (f). as H showed signs of collapse on 17 January 1997, she should have been sent immediately to hospital; and
 (g). having sent her home, he ought to have monitored her condition.
 The trial judge found that the appellant had failed to discharge any of the above duties and had breached his duty of care beyond reasonable doubt.
 16.The trial judge was of the view that the appellant`s breach of his duties was a direct cause of her very serious condition when she was admitted to hospital. The trial judge was also of the view that the damage was not too remote as a perforation of the anal canal was a type of injury that was clearly foreseeable.
 17.In sentencing the appellant to ten months` imprisonment, the trial judge took the appellant`s readiness to compensate as a mitigating factor. The trial judge noted that the normal sentence imposed on an accused who pleads guilty to a charge under s 338 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) at its first mention is nine months` imprisonment. The trial judge also noted that the appellant`s negligence was not one of casual inadvertence but a deliberate and wilful blindness to the obvious.
 18.
 The appeal 
 
At the commencement of the appeal, the DPP applied to have her name and particulars withheld pursuant to s 9(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). I agreed and so ordered. There were four issues for the court`s consideration. First, whether the degree of negligence required in criminal cases should be higher than that in civil cases. Secondly, whether the criteria to determine if there is any criminal degree of negligence should be likelihood of injury, as opposed to possibility of injury. Thirdly, whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and, fourthly, whether the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive.
 19.
 Standard of negligence in criminal cases 
 
The first issue was whether the degree of negligence required in criminal cases should be higher than that in civil cases. Counsel for the appellant contended that the `law in this area, contrary to what many learned judges believe, is not well settled`, and that this `unsettled position has stood still for the last two decades`.
 20.This is not so. On the contrary, for the last three decades in Singapore, ever since the High Court`s decision in 
Mah Kah Yew v PP
 [1969-1971] SLR 441 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 1
 , where a court of three judges comprising Wee Chong Jin CJ, FA Chua and AV Winslow JJ sat, it has been well settled that the degree of negligence required in criminal cases is the same as that required in civil cases.
 21.In 
 Mah Kah Yew v PP 
 the court held that it was bound by virtue of s 88(3) of the Malaysia Act 1963 and s 13 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal of Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei in 
PP v Mills
 
 [1971] 1 MLJ 4 
. In delivering the judgment of the court, Wee Chong Jin CJ said that the court found it comforting that, by the doctrine of stare decisis, it was bound by the decision in 
 PP v Mills 
 because it accorded with the decision of the Full Bench of the High Court of Singapore in 
Woo Sing v R
 
[1954] MLJ 200
 , where the court held that it was not necessary to lay down a different standard of negligence in civil and criminal cases, and also with the court`s own views. The learned Chief Justice did not elaborate on the reasons why the court would have arrived at the same result as the court did in 
 Woo Sing v R 
 and 
 PP v Mills 
, but said that the court fully concurred with the reasons given by Buhagiar J in 
Anthonysamy v PP
 
[1956] MLJ 247
 for agreeing with the decision in 
 Woo Sing v R 
.
 22.The basis of the High Court`s decision in 
 Mah Kah Yew v PP 
 was that it was bound by stare decisis to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal of Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei in 
 PP v Mills 
. Leaving aside the issue of whether Singapore courts were bound by the Court of Appeal of Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei, I am uncertain if 
 PP v Mills 
 is indeed authority for the proposition that the standard of negligence is the same in both criminal and civil cases. In delivering the judgment of the majority, Williams CJ said at p 5: 
... I am of the opinion that the standard of negligence required for a conviction under s 304A(1) cannot be equated with that required for a conviction for manslaughter ...
 
In my view ... the nature and degree of negligence in an act causing death required to support a conviction under s 304A(1) is the same as that in any other act carried out so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the safety of others where that act was the immediate cause of death and not the remote cause.
 It is clear from the above dicta that the majority rejected the standard of gross negligence required for the common law offence of manslaughter. It is however less clear what the latter part of the above dicta means. The phrase `any other act carried out so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the safety of others` is essentially the same as that in ss 336, 337 and 338 of the Penal Code which uses the phrase `any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others`. In effect what Williams CJ seems to have said is that the standard of negligence for s 304A(1) is the same as that in ss 336, 337 and 338, which is very different from saying that the civil standard of negligence applies in criminal cases.
 23.In view of the uncertainty surrounding the exact meaning of Williams CJ`s dicta, I was of the view that 
 PP v Mills 
 is not an authority for the principle that the degree of negligence required in criminal cases is the same as that in civil cases. The doctrine of stare decisis with regards to the binding authority of 
 PP v Mills 
 was therefore irrelevant to the issue.
 24.Such uncertainty, however, does not cloud the decisions in 
 Woo Sing v R 
, 
 Anthonysamy v PP 
 or 
 Mah Kah Yew v PP 
. The courts in those cases clearly expressed their preference for the view that the standard of negligence required in criminal cases is the same as that in civil cases. These decisions are decisions of the High Court, however, and the High Court is not bound by previous decisions of the High Court: 
MV Balakrishnan v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 586
 , 
Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP
 
[1986] SLR 86
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 336
 . It was therefore open to the High Court in this appeal to review the law on the standard of negligence for criminal cases.
 25.The appellant`s case was that the standard of negligence in criminal cases should be an intermediate standard of negligence, which is lower than the standard of gross negligence for the common law offence of manslaughter, but which is higher than the civil standard of negligence. This was the position taken by the Privy Council in 
Dabholkar v King
 
[1948] AIR 183
, a case dealing with s 222 of the Tanganyika Penal Code, which is in pari materia with s 304A of the Singapore Penal Code. In delivering the judgment of the Privy Council Lord Oaksey said: 
... although the negligence which constitutes the offence in these circumstances must be of a higher degree than the negligence which gives rise to a claim for compensation in a civil court, it is not, in their Lordships` opinion of so high a degree as that which is necessary to constitute the offence of manslaughter.
 Lord Oaksey`s view was subsequently adopted by Lee Hun Hoe J of the High Court of Sabah in 
PP v Joseph Chin Saiko
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 129
 .
 26.The primary argument in favour of an intermediate standard is the need for a distinction between civil and criminal liability. While the English Court of Criminal Appeal`s decision in 
R v Bateman
 
[1925] 19 Cr App R 8
 is not directly relevant, in that it addresses the issue of the proper direction to the jury for the common law offence of manslaughter, the remarks of Hewart LCJ capture succinctly the rationale for making a distinction. The learned Lord Chief Justice said at pp 11-12 : 
... in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.
 27.While there is no doubt a need to maintain a distinction between civil liability and criminal liability, it is questionable whether it is necessary to have an intermediate standard of negligence in order to maintain that distinction. Even without a different standard of negligence, there are still two essential differences between a tort in negligence and criminal liability which involves negligence. First, in a crime which involves negligence, the breach of the civil standard of negligence has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, as opposed to a balance of probabilities. Secondly, in a crime which involves negligence, negligence is not the sole criteria of liability. For example, in the case of an offence involving s 338 of the Penal Code, in addition to proving negligence, the prosecution has to prove grievous hurt to a person and that the act endangered human life or the personal safety of others. There is therefore a difference in the presence of additional elements which have to be proved, and proved beyond reasonable doubt.
 28.An additional problem with the use of an intermediate standard of negligence is the difficulty of applying it in practice. While there is abundant case law which defines what the civil standard of negligence is in different situations, there is a dearth of authority which explains what the intermediate standard would be. The problem is compounded by the fact that, even within the law of tort, the civil standard varies in accordance with the circumstances. The standard of negligence in tort is that of the reasonable man, explained by Alderson B in 
Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co
 
[1856] 11 Exch 781
 at p 784 in the following manner: 
Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.
 The comments of WVH Rogers in 
 Winfield and Jolowicz 
 (15th Ed) at p 171 are instructive. While noting that the general standard is an objective standard, he notes that: 
Nevertheless, the law cannot be understood unless we bear in mind that it judges conduct by the particular circumstances in which the defendant finds himself and in some circumstances actually modifies the objective standard.
 Michael A Jones in 
 Textbook on Torts 
 (3rd Ed) at p 104 observes that none of the expressions describing the `reasonable man`: 
... indicates anything about the standard of care that the court will require in any particular situation. Indeed, in practice, `reasonable care` can be manipulated to produce standards which range from very low to almost very strict liability.
 In view of the variations even within the civil standard of negligence, an intermediate standard of negligence would be too elusive a concept to be workable. For the above reasons, I was of the view that the standard of negligence in criminal cases should be the civil standard of negligence.
 29.
 Degree of negligence - likelihood of injury or possibility of injury 
 
Counsel for the appellant tried to overcome the problem of defining an intermediate standard of negligence by suggesting that the intermediate standard of negligence should be the likelihood of injury as opposed to the civil standard of negligence which is the possibility of injury. This was the second submission of the appellant and I found it without merit for two reasons. First, it is based on the erroneous assumption that the civil standard of negligence is `possibility` of injury. However, as pointed out above, the civil standard of negligence varies in accordance with the circumstances. In the present appeal which involves medical negligence, the civil standard of negligence is not `possibility` of injury but the test enunciated in 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee
 
[1957] 2 All ER 118
 by McNair J at p 121 : 
The test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill. A man need not possess the highest expert skill at the risk of being found negligent. It is well established that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art.
 30.Secondly, the two sources for the phrase `likelihood` do not support an intermediate standard of negligence for criminal cases. One of the sources of `likelihood` is 
Adnan bin Khamis v PP
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 274
  where Ong CJ in delivering the opinion of the Full Bench of the Federal Court said at p 278: 
We think the test to be applied for determining the guilt or innocence of an accused person charged with rash or negligent conduct is to consider whether or not a reasonable man in the same circumstances would have been aware of the likelihood of damage or injury to others resulting from such conduct and taken adequate and proper precautions to avoid causing such damage or injury.
 While it is clear that the Federal Court in 
 Adnan bin Khamis v PP 
 rejected the gross negligence standard of the common law offence of manslaughter and replaced it with a general test couched in terms of the reasonable man, it is not clear whether this test was regarded as a civil standard of negligence or an intermediate standard of negligence. This uncertainty is heightened by the Federal Court`s approval of 
 Woo Sing v R 
 and 
 Anthonysamy v PP 
. The second source of the phrase `likelihood` is Michael A Jones`s 
 Medical Negligence 
. The statements which are relied on, however, are made in the context of a different area of negligence law. They are made with reference to principles on the remoteness of damage and not the standard of negligence. There is therefore no authority whatsoever for the view that the degree of negligence should be the likelihood of injury as opposed to the possibility of injury.
 31.
 Whether charge is proven beyond reasonable doubt 
 
The third submission of the appellant was that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The main contentions of the appellant revolved around the evidence of the expert witnesses Professor Deng and Professor Shi.
 32.The appellant`s objection to the evidence of Professor Deng was that he did not represent the standard of a Chinese physician in Singapore because he was trained in both traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine. The appellant`s objection was unfounded. Although he was trained in both forms of medicine, Professor Deng`s area of specialisation was traditional Chinese medicine. At the time of the trial, he was the Head of Traditional Chinese Medicine at Xiyuan Hospital. Moreover, he confirmed that his opinion was from a Chinese physician`s point of view.
 33.The appellant also objected to Professor Deng on the basis that the practice in China was different from that in Singapore. This objection was also baseless. The appellant himself relied on the evidence of a practitioner of medicine in China in the form of Professor Shi. Moreover, the appellant`s knowledge of colon cleansing was acquired from a professor in China.
 34.The appellant`s contention with regards to Professor Shi was that the trial judge failed to take into consideration Professor Shi`s evidence that the chance of perforation arising from colon cleansing was less than 0.5%. The appellant contended that this was consistent with the appellant`s personal experience where perforation occurred in only one out of 150 cases. After examining the evidence I found that Professor Shi`s evidence did not support the appellant. This was because Professor Shi`s estimation of less than 0.5% was based on an insertion into the anal canal of not more than 2 cm, whereas the printed instructions given by the appellant stated that insertion was not to exceed three inches.
 35.The appellant also contended that the trial judge failed to take into consideration Professor Shi`s evidence that tiredness and bowel incontinence are common symptoms after colon cleansing. The evidence of Professor Shi however did not in any way detract from the prosecution`s case. On the contrary his evidence supported the prosecution`s case. Professor Deng was of the view that the appellant was negligent in three areas, one of which was that, when H had urinary or bowel incontinence, a rectal digital examination was necessary. Professor Shi`s evidence that it was rare to have difficulty passing urine after colonic washouts supported Professor Deng`s view.
 36.In view of the expert evidence and the evidence as a whole, I found that the trial judge was right in finding that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
 37.
 Whether sentence was manifestly excessive 
 
The final submission of the appellant was that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive. The appellant relied on the cases of 
PP v Teo Poh Leng
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 15
  and 
PP v Gan Lim Soon
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 261
  in urging the court not to impose a custodial sentence. Both were road traffic cases and in both cases a fine was imposed. In 
 Gan Lim Soon 
 it was held that, in most cases under s 304A of the Penal Code, where death is caused by a negligent act as opposed to a rash act, it would be sufficient to inflict a fine on the accused. In most road traffic cases, however, death or injury is caused by a momentary lapse on the part of the accused. In contrast, the negligence of the appellant was sustained over a period of time in the context of a doctor-patient relationship where the patient was at the mercy of the doctor`s care and competence.
 38.The offence was in my view a serious one. The appellant prescribed colonic washouts without proper training in the procedure, without proper training in the use of the equipment, and without any understanding of the risks and complications involved. He took extremely poor care of H. He gave evidence that he knew that extra precautions were required where the patient was diabetic, but did not give any extra attention to H. Indeed when she complained after the first few washouts that she was unwell, he did not examine her but instead reassured her that it was normal. Despite reservations on 17 January 1997 about H`s recovery, even after she took his medication, he did not refer her to hospital, but instead sent her home without bothering to monitor her progress, callously assuming that she had gone to see another physician or doctor.
 39.The normal sentence imposed on a first time offender who makes a timely guilty plea to a charge under s 338 of the Penal Code is nine months` imprisonment. Taking the above factors into consideration, the appellant`s sentence of ten months` imprisonment was not in any way manifestly excessive.
 40.For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence.
 41.
 Variation of compensation order 
 
A final matter was the DPP`s oral application at the end of the hearing for the compensation order to be varied. At the trial, the district judge, on the application of the DPP, ordered compensation of $39,066.02 to H pursuant to s 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The sum of $39,066.02 was based on the medical fees due from H to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Pursuant to s 403 of the CPC, the district judge ordered payment to be by way of instalments: $9,066.02 on 21 September 1998 and $6,000 on the 21st of each successive month for five months.
 42.The respondent submitted an affidavit of Dr Wong Chiang Yin (`Dr Wong`), medical officer of the Ministry of Health dated 1 February 1999 in support of the application to vary the compensation order. The affidavit of Dr Wong stated that on 16 September 1998 Dr Wong received an invoice stating that a sum of $26,911.85 had already been paid by the PSA Corporation Ltd (`PSA`) as part payment towards the medical expenses. Dr Wong believed that the PSA was the employer of H`s husband and that H`s husband and his dependants were entitled to medical benefits provided by the PSA.
 43.The respondent therefore asked the court to exercise its powers of revision under s 268 of the CPC to vary the compensation order made by the district judge such that the sum of $26,911.85 be paid to the PSA and the balance of $11,676,97 to H.
 44.I dismissed the application for two reasons. First, s 401 of the CPC states that the court may make a compensation order to `any person or to the representatives of any person injured in respect of his person, character or property by the crime or offence for which the sentence is passed`. Regardless of the contributions made by the PSA to the medical expenses of H, the PSA was neither a `person` nor a `representative` of a person who was injured for the purposes of a compensation order under s 401 of the CPC. They were therefore not entitled to be the recipients of a compensation order.
 45.Secondly, although s 268 of the CPC provides that the High Court may on revision exercise the powers found in s 256 of the CPC, there was no provision in s 256 of the CPC which provided me with the power to vary the compensation order. Section 256(b) of the CPC provides that in an appeal against conviction, the court may alter the sentence. Section 256(c) of the CPC provides that in an appeal as to sentence, the court may alter the nature of the sentence. However, in the case of 
PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 885
 , Karthigesu JA in delivering the opinion of the Court of Appeal said at p 893: 
a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) is not part of the `sentence` and consequently the High Court would not have the power under s 256 to make such an order. In our opinion, a compensation order is not `punishment` for an offence under the Penal Code.`
 Since a compensation order is not regarded as part of the `sentence`, the High Court does not have the power under s 256(b) or (c) to vary a compensation order. A compensation order could conceivably be varied under s 256(d) in `an appeal from any other order`. That section was however unavailable since the appeal was only with regards to conviction and sentence.
 46.I therefore dismissed the application to vary the compensation order. This will not result in any inequity to the PSA since they can through their internal management system or civil action, recover the sums paid from their employee, if they so wish.",1999-02-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against sentence.
 2.On 27 June 1998, the respondent pleaded guilty before the learned magistrate to and was convicted on the following charge: 
You, Tan Fook Sum, male 37 years old, passport no A6199032, are charged that you on or about 23 June 1998 at about 5am on board Singapore Aircraft SQ flight 346 en route to Spain, Madrid, and when the flight is [sic] somewhere in Larnaca, Cyprus wilfully endanger [sic] the safety of the said aircraft and that of 237 passengers and 21 crew members on board the said flight, to wit, by lighting a fire on board the aircraft and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under para 45 of part V of the Air Navigation Order read with para 80(6) of the said Order.
 3.Paragraph 45 of the Air Navigation Order (Cap 6, O 2) (`the Order`) provides as follows: 
A person shall not wilfully or negligently imperil the safety of an aircraft or any person on board, whether by interference with any member of the flight crew of the aircraft, or by tampering with the aircraft or its equipment or by disorderly conduct or by any other means.
 Paragraph 45 is one of the provisions specified in Part B of the Thirteenth Schedule of the Order. The penalty for contravention of para 45 is spelt out in para 80(6) of the same Order, which provides: 
If any person contravenes any provision specified in Part B of the Thirteenth Schedule he shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term of one year or to both.
 4.The learned magistrate sentenced the respondent to a fine of $2,000 or in default four weeks` imprisonment.
 5.
 The facts 
 
These were contained in the statement of facts (exh A) to which the respondent admitted without qualification. They were as follows.
 6.On 22 June 1998 at about 11.30am, the respondent took Singapore Airlines flight SQ346 from Singapore Changi Airport bound for Madrid, Spain via Zurich for a holiday. He was seated in the economy class section of the aircraft. Sometime after midnight, the respondent went to the business class section to rest as that section was not fully occupied. At about 4.45am, the cabin crew approached the respondent and told him to return to his economy class seat. The respondent was unwilling to do so and argued with the cabin crew for not allowing him to remain in the business class section. He later reluctantly returned to his economy class seat. At about 5am, the respondent went to the toilet in the economy class section to urinate. While in the toilet the respondent, overcome with frustration with the cabin crew, took some rolls of tissue paper from the toilet, placed them in the wash basin and used his lighter to set fire to them. After starting the fire, the respondent returned to his seat. The smoke in the toilet triggered off the fire alarm and caused panic among the passengers and crew members. The fire was eventually extinguished by flight stewardess Jean Leong Suit Fun who had smelled the smoke and heard the fire alarm. She also saw the respondent running out from the toilet. She subsequently notified the captain of the flight who reported the matter to the Zurich police authorities. The respondent was repatriated from Zurich and arrived in Singapore at about 8.45am on 25 June 1998.
 7.The respondent claimed that he merely wanted to cause inconvenience to the cabin crew. He was not suffering from any mental disorder nor was he drunk at the time of commission of the offence.
 8.
 The magistrate`s grounds of decision 
 
In sentencing the respondent the learned magistrate took into account the following factors: (a). that the respondent had committed the act impulsively on the spur of the moment without premeditated intent;
 (b). that the item set alight was not a huge item and the fire was started in the wash basin, thus the possibility of a life-threatening fire occurring was small;
 (c). that no one was injured by the respondent`s act nor was there serious damage caused to the aircraft;
 (d). that there were no known local or foreign precedents or tariffs for such an offence;
 (e). that the prosecuting officer did not make any submissions on sentence; and
 (f). that the respondent had pleaded guilty.
 As such, the learned magistrate was of the view that the respondent`s conduct did not warrant a custodial sentence although she considered it sufficiently serious to justify the imposition of the maximum fine a magistrate`s court can impose. She therefore sentenced the respondent to a fine of $2,000 or in default four weeks` imprisonment. The respondent paid the fine and returned to Malaysia on 29 June 1998 after serving two days` imprisonment in Queenstown Remand Prison.
 9.
 Grounds of appeal 
 
The Public Prosecutor, being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, appealed against it. In reply to the factors which the learned magistrate considered mitigatory, the appellant essentially contended: (a). that the respondent`s act of starting the fire was not an act done on impulse but was a calculated and deliberate act of retaliation against the cabin crew;
 (b). that it was not correct to say that the item set alight was not a huge item and the fact that the fire was started in the wash basin made the possibility of a life-threatening fire small - the fire did not extinguish itself after burning for some time but grew large enough to trigger off the fire alarm, causing panic among the passengers and crew, and it was only the timely intervention of the flight stewardess that prevented the fire from spreading;
 (c). that the fact that there were no known local or foreign precedents or tariffs did not mean that the respondent was entitled to be treated leniently;
 (d). that the learned magistrate failed to take into account the fact that the prosecution had proceeded on the more serious limb of para 45 of the Order, namely, the `wilful` limb as opposed to the `negligent` limb;
 (e). that cases from other jurisdictions indicated that the courts would not tolerate acts which endangered the safety of passengers and crew on public transport and would pass custodial sentences to reflect this;
 (f). that the public expect and should be assured of the highest standards of safety in air travel in view of the vulnerability of aircraft in flight, and that persons who wilfully imperil air safety should be dealt with severely;
 (g). that there is no requirement in law for the prosecution to press for a deterrent sentence before a court may consider it in the exercise of its discretion; and
 (h). that the respondent`s plea of guilt was not a factor in mitigation as he had effectively been caught red-handed.
 Therefore the appeal should be allowed and a substantial custodial sentence imposed on the respondent.
 
 The appeal 
 
 10.
 Preliminary point: non-appearance of the respondent
The respondent was absent when the appeal first came up for hearing on 29 September 1998. I was then informed by the prosecution that it was unable to confirm if the notice of appeal had been served on the respondent. The delay in service was due to the fact that the respondent had, in the course of investigations, given the police his previous address but it later transpired that he no longer resides there. As such, I adjourned the matter for service to be effected on the respondent in compliance with s 254 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`).
 11.Subsequently, service of the notice of appeal, petition of appeal, notes of evidence, the learned magistrate`s grounds of decision, the prosecution`s skeletal arguments and the registrar`s notice of the hearing date together with a covering letter from the prosecution was successfully effected on the respondent at his present address. In his affidavit filed on 16 November 1998, the investigating officer, Staff Sergeant Toh Hock Guan (`SSgt Toh`), deposed that on 7 November 1998, the respondent contacted him by telephone in his office. The respondent confirmed that he had received the above-mentioned documents which had been sent by ordinary post. SSgt Toh explained that the Public Prosecutor was appealing against the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate and that the respondent had the right to appoint counsel to defend himself. The respondent, however, informed SSgt Toh that he did not intend to come to Singapore for the hearing of the appeal. SSgt Toh then explained that the High Court had the power to make an order adverse to him in his absence but the respondent maintained that he did not wish to appear at the hearing of the appeal.
 12.The respondent was true to his word. I therefore decided to issue a warrant of arrest (HCWA 2/98) against him at the adjourned hearing on 19 November 1998. I also directed that the warrant be executed with the assistance of the Malaysian authorities under the provisions of s 55 of the CPC, and adjourned the matter again until such time as the respondent could be produced before me. Unfortunately, the warrant could not be executed. The prosecution, being desirous of disposing of the appeal, requested that it be re-listed for hearing, notwithstanding the absence of the respondent. The appeal was finally fixed for hearing on 2 March 1999, at which time I proceeded to hear submissions on the merits.
 13.Section 254 of the CPC, which provides for the hearing of an appeal in the absence of the respondent, is in the following terms: 
(1) If at the hearing of the appeal the respondent is not present and the court is not satisfied that the notice of appeal was duly served upon him, the court shall not make any order in the matter of the appeal adverse to or to the prejudice of the respondent, but shall adjourn the hearing of the appeal to a future day for his appearance and shall issue the requisite notice to him for service through the Registrar. 
(2) If service of the last-mentioned notice on the respondent cannot be effected, the court shall proceed to hear the appeal in his absence.
 Section 254(2) should be read together with s 253(1), which reads: 
When the appeal comes on for hearing the appellant, if present, shall be first heard in support of the appeal, the respondent if present shall be heard against it, and the appellant shall be entitled to reply.
 In the present case, there was no doubt from the affidavit of SSgt Toh that the notice of appeal and all other relevant documents had been duly served on the respondent. If the court can proceed to hear an appeal in the absence of the respondent where service cannot be effected (s 254(2)), a fortiori where service has been effected but the respondent deliberately refuses to attend the hearing. The respondent was given every opportunity to come here and defend the appeal but has persistently declined to do so, and as such must be taken to have waived any argument he could have raised in his favour under the principle audi alteram partem. I was fortified in my conclusion by the decision of FA Chua J in 
PP v Tarmizi bin Ahmad
 (Unreported) , the circumstances of which were similar to those of the instant case. There the accused, a Malaysian, had pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge of cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He was sentenced to a fine of $1,000 or in default 50 days` imprisonment. The Public Prosecutor appealed against sentence. The accused confirmed receipt of all the relevant documents, including the notice of appeal and the registrar`s notice of the date of hearing of the appeal. The proceedings were twice adjourned due to the accused`s absence, but the third time round FA Chua J proceeded to hear the appeal in the absence of the accused and allowed the appeal, imposing a sentence of three months` imprisonment. In the circumstances, I acceded to the prosecution`s request to proceed with the hearing of the appeal.
 14.
 Sentencing principles
I now turn to the appeal proper. It is axiomatic that the court must pass sentence according to law: ss 180(n)(ii) and 192(2) of the CPC. A `sentence according to law` means that the sentence must not only be within the ambit of the punishable section, but it must also be assessed and passed in accordance with established judicial principles: 
PP v Jafa bin Daud
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 315
  at p 316. Leaving aside for the moment the ambit of the relevant `punishable section` in the present case, the application of the `established judicial principles` really requires the court, where the legislature`s prescriptions as to punishment are open-ended, to balance the divers and often competing policy considerations. I will consider each of these in turn.
 15.A good starting point is the remarks of Lawton LJ in 
R v Sargeant
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 74
 at p 77: 
What ought the proper penalty to be? ... [The] classical principles are summed up in four words: retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. Any judge who comes to sentence ought always to have those four classical principles in mind and to apply them to the facts of the case to see which of them has the greatest importance in the case with which he is dealing.
 It is proposed to briefly consider those principles which are relevant to and have the greatest importance in the present case. The conclusion arrived at will impact on the type and extent of sentence imposed.
 16.
 Retribution
The principle of retribution is no longer valid in one sense but in its other sense it is valid. As Lawton LJ said in 
 R v Sargeant 
 at p 77: 
The Old Testament concept of an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth no longer plays any part in our criminal law. There is, however, another aspect of retribution which is frequently overlooked: it is that society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of particular types of crime and the only way in which the courts can show this is by the sentences which they pass. The courts do not have to reflect public opinion. On the other hand courts must not disregard it. Perhaps the main duty of the court is to lead public opinion.
 And as he said elsewhere ( 
R v Davies
 
[1978] 67 Cr App R 207
 at p 210): 
At one time it was fashionable to suggest that retribution ought not to enter into sentencing policy. That opinion, I think, is not held as strongly now as it was a few years ago. The reason is manifest: the courts have to make it clear that crime does not pay and the only way they can do so is by the length of sentences. Sentences show the court`s disapproval, on behalf of the community, of particular types of criminal conduct
 The essence of the retributive principle, then, is that the offender must pay for what he has done. The idea is that punishment restores the just order of society which has been disrupted by his crime. It follows that the punishment must reflect and befit the seriousness of the crime. Each case must be considered on its merits but, in general, if the sentence is more severe, reflecting the serious public disapprobation, the sentencing court will not be wrong on principle: 
... the courts will not be performing their functions honestly if the seriousness of the situation is not reflected in the sentence imposed or if the sentence appears to defeat the object of the statute.
 per Hashim Yeop A Sani J in PP v Loo Choon Fatt 
[1976] 2 MLJ 256
 at p 257.
 17.The corollary of retribution is proportionality. Indeed, the view has been expressed (Tan Yock Lin, 
 Criminal Procedure 
 (1997), Ch XVIII at para 553) that 
the true meaning of lex talionis (an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth) was never retribution but proportionality
 Not much need be said of this, save that it is easy to state but not easy to apply - the just desert of an offence is not something measurable in the ordinary sense. In some cases, however - and the present case is one of them - the application of the proportionality principle is largely intuitive.
 18.
 Deterrence
There are two aspects to this: deterrence of the offender and deterrence of likely offenders, corresponding to specific and general deterrence respectively. Specific deterrence will be appropriate where the offender is a persistent offender or where the crime is premeditated, though its value in the case of a recidivist offender may be questionable. General deterrence aims at educating and deterring other like-minded members of the general public ( 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 522
  at p 525) by making an example of the particular offender. The foremost significance of the role of deterrence, both specific and general, in crime control in recent years, not least because of the established correlation between the sentences imposed by the courts and crime rates, need hardly be mentioned.
 19.
 Public interest
Closely related is the principle of advancing the public interest. The remarks of Hilbery J in 
R v Ball
 
[1951] 35 Cr App R 164
 at pp 165-166 have been cited with approval in the courts on numerous occasions: 
In deciding the appropriate sentence, a court should always be guided by certain considerations. The first and foremost is the public interest. The criminal law is publicly enforced, not only with the object of punishing crime, but also in the hope of preventing it. A proper sentence, passed in public, serves the public interest in two ways. It might deter others who may be tempted to try crime as seeming to offer easy money on the supposition, that if the offender is caught and brought to justice, the punishment will be negligible. Such a sentence may also deter the particular criminal from committing a crime again, or induce him to turn from a criminal to an honest life. The public interest is indeed served, and best served, if the offender is induced to turn from criminal ways to honest living.
 These remarks were made in the context of legislative prescriptions which fix the maximum penalty but they are equally apposite to laws which furnish alternative sentencing options. They emphasise the judicial role in sentencing which is based on advancing the public interest; thus stated the public interest principle is the deterrence principle.
 20.In another sense the public interest principle often means the protection of the public. For instance, it varies in proportion to the prevalence of the offence in question. Where an offence is prevalent, a more severe sentence may be meted out to mark the court`s disapproval and to acknowledge the seriousness of the offence. Also, the public interest sometimes means quelling the sense of outrage felt by the community; in this sense it is a reformulation of the retribution principle. Perhaps, in the final analysis, the public interest principle can be reduced to this (Tan Yock Lin, 
 Criminal Procedure 
, Ch XVIII at paras 655-701): 
The truth is that the public interest principle is all encompassing, as for instance is the view in one place: `Public interest varies according to the time, place and circumstances of each case including its nature and prevalence. What may be public interest in one place may differ from another.` 
 In this all encompassing sense, sentencing boils down to striking the `true` balance between the public interest and the interest of the offender.

 Application of principles
The difficulty caused by the multiplicity of operative principles is that it makes conflicts inevitable. A complicating factor is that the principles have to be applied not only in determining which of several options made available by the legislature is the suitable punishment but also in determining whether a number of options can be combined together. For instance, where (as here) the offence is punishable with a fine or imprisonment or both, the foregoing principles cannot be applied merely to determine whether the proper sentence is a fine or imprisonment but also to determine whether, in addition to a fine, a custodial sentence should be imposed. Moreover, after the proper option has been determined, it seems the foregoing principles must again be applied in order to ascertain what the amount of fine or the term of imprisonment should be. In the view of Tan Yock Lin, 
 Criminal Procedure 
, Ch XVIII at para 852, there is a better way: 
... what will facilitate more rational and informed sentencing is recognition that there is a dichotomy between public interest and aggravating or mitigating factors. Generally speaking, only the public interest should affect the type of sentence to be imposed while only aggravating or mitigating circumstances affect the duration or severity of the sentence imposed.
 In my opinion, this approach may usefully be adopted here.
 22.I therefore begin with the public interest in order to determine whether, in addition to a fine, a custodial sentence should be imposed in the present case. The respondent was convicted of wilfully endangering the safety of Singapore Airlines flight SQ346 and that of 237 passengers and 21 crew members on board by lighting a fire in the toilet of the aircraft. Although the respondent is the first person to be charged for such an offence in Singapore and there are no local or foreign precedents or tariffs, this did not mean, as the appellant rightly pointed out, that the respondent was entitled to be treated leniently. The seriousness of an offence under para 45 of the Order is evidenced by first, the fact that the maximum penalty for contravention thereof was increased (vide S 180 of 1992) to its current level from the previous one of a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term of six months or both. As the increase in the statutory maximum was not accompanied by a redefinition of the offence, the increase must be taken as an expression of the legislative intention that the offence is to be regarded as more serious. Second, and more importantly, the highest standards of safety in air travel must be ensured at all times for obvious reasons - we all need no reminder of the disastrous consequences that may result from a mishap caused by a compromise in these standards - and persons who wilfully imperil the safety of aircraft in flight (when they are most vulnerable) should be dealt with most severely. The abhorrence with which such conduct is regarded by the courts in other jurisdictions can be seen in the custodial sentences meted out to those who endanger the safety of air travel by acts of `air rage`. In 
 R v James Mullaly 
 [1997] 2 Cr App R (S) 343, for instance, the appellant pleaded guilty to recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any persons therein, and to being drunk on an aircraft, contrary to art 47 of the Air Navigation Order 1989 and s 61 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 respectively. Article 47 of the English Order is almost in pari materia with para 45 of our Order and it reads: 
A person shall not recklessly or negligently act in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft, or any person therein.
 The facts were that the appellant was a passenger on a Virgin Airlines flight from Orlando in the United States to Manchester. He had consumed a large quantity of alcohol during the flight and began behaving in a disorderly manner. He walked around the cabin, collided with other passengers, and banged on the door of the toilet cubicle, damaging it. He became increasingly agitated and the stewards decided to restrain him. The appellant resisted their efforts but was eventually restrained with the assistance of some male passengers. He then attempted to break free from his handcuffs and attacked a passenger who was trying to calm him down. For the rest of the journey the appellant continued to swear and struggle. When the plane landed at Manchester Airport the appellant was arrested. The maximum sentence which the court could impose was two years` imprisonment on each count. In sentencing the appellant, the judge remarked that anyone hearing of his conduct must have been horrified by the distress and terror the passengers felt and their feeling of helplessness as they flew over the Atlantic for five hours after his conduct commenced, and that such behaviour clearly called for the imposition of a deterrent sentence. He therefore passed the maximum sentence of two years` imprisonment for each charge, both sentences to run concurrently. On appeal, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 18 months` imprisonment for each charge. The court accepted as mitigatory, inter alia, the fact that no threat was engendered to the safety of the aircraft but only to the passengers therein.
 23.
 James Mullaly 
 was not an isolated incident. Instances of `air rage` are regrettably becoming more and more prevalent: see, for example, the articles titled `British airport to prosecute all air rage cases` (which appeared in 
 The Straits Times 
 on 28 January 1999), `Mid-air brawl forces plane to land off course` (
 The Straits Times 
, 2 February 1999), `Full Monty in aircraft lands police in court` (
 The Times of London 
, 9 February 1999) and `Man guilty of air rage` (
 The Nation 
, 17 February 1999). 
 The Straits Times 
 article dated 28 January 1999 reported that there has been a 400% increase in air rage incidents in Britain over the last three years, and that some fear that a berserk passenger will one day bring down a packed jet. Accordingly, police and airlines at one of Britain`s main airports, Manchester Airport, have launched a Disruptive Passenger Protoccol, designed to ensure that every offender is brought to justice and at the same time sending a clear message that anyone who put the lives of others at risk will be severely dealt with. It was also stated that so far, 39 airline operators have signed the Protoccol.
 24.More recently, the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Hunter (Glen Ronald)
 (Unreported) when referred to 
 Mullaly 
`s case, remarked that `that was a far worse case` than the present because the appellant in 
 Mullaly 
 had pleaded guilty to recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any persons therein, and additionally to being drunk on an aircraft, whereas the appellant in the present case was only convicted of the latter offence. In 
 R v Hunter 
, the appellant had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol prior to boarding the plane. Once on board, he began shouting and swearing and wandered around the aircraft being verbally abusive. At one point he deliberately struck his head against the front cabin partition, and later forced his way through the front cabin area where he threw himself on the floor. The appellant was arrested shortly after landing. He pleaded guilty to being drunk on an aircraft and was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment at first instance. On appeal, the court took into account various mitigating factors and reduced the sentence to one of six months` imprisonment, but remarked that `for behaviour of this kind a custodial sentence is inevitable`.
 25.Similarly, a custodial sentence was imposed in 
R v Ian Brown
 (Unreported) . The appellant had threatened to chop off an air stewardess`s hands during a British Airways flight, and hammered on the cockpit door as the aircraft began its descent into Manchester Airport. A sentence of four months` imprisonment was imposed for threatening behaviour. The appellant appealed. In dismissing the appeal, Simon Fawcus J said: 
It has been said in the past [that] behaviour of this loutish nature did not warrant a custodial sentence if carried out on the ground. But it is very different when carried out on an aircraft. Many people can be put at risk by it - hundreds of passengers and even people on the ground if there is behaviour of this type. We accept this incident was wholly out of character but there is another side to this picture and we want the message to be sent out to the public at large that anyone who behaves in this way aboard an aircraft will lose their liberty whoever they are.
 26.The rationale for the immediate imposition of a custodial sentence for behaviour for which, had it been committed on the ground, a non-custodial sentence would have been more appropriate, was elegantly explained by the English Court of Appeal in 
R v Oliver (Lawrence Charles)
 (Unreported) . Morison J, delivering the judgment of the court, said: 
It seems to us that travelling on an aeroplane places a special duty on passengers to co-operate with reasonable orders from the cabin and flight crew and to behave in an orderly manner. The safety of the aircraft itself and of the other passengers may be put in jeopardy by a passenger`s unreasonable or disruptive behaviour. 
 A relatively small incident may have catastrophic consequences which may not always be foreseen. It is correct in principle therefore for the courts dealing with such cases, even on a guilty plea, to impose sentences of imprisonment on those who have been proved to have committed offences of this kind on board an aircraft
. ... in this case, because of the plea of guilty, we think an appropriate sentence would have been 12 months and that 18 months was too long. Had the present offence been committed in a public place on the ground, a non-custodial sentence may well have met the gravity of the case. 
 But it seems to us that with passengers confined in a relatively small area, whose safety depends in part on the sensible behaviour of them all, an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate
. [Emphasis added.]
 27.Before me, the prosecution submitted that in the light of the publicity given to these cases, both in the local and foreign media, and given Singapore`s position as the premier air hub of the region, the court should deal severely with persons who endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Concern was expressed that, if a sentencing norm was not set as soon as possible in order to deter such conduct, the incidence of such cases may increase. I agreed with this. Hitherto reported incidents of `air rage` have been confined to attacks on the cabin crew (
 R v Ian Brown 
) or the passengers (
 R v James Mullaly 
, 
 R v Oliver 
 - where the appellant assaulted his own wife), or to the causing of a disturbance (
 R v Hunter 
), or to both. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in 
 James Mullaly 
 took into account as a factor in mitigation the fact that no danger was caused to the safety of the aircraft but only to the passengers therein. Whether or not this was a valid distinction, it is not present on our facts. A fortiori, the gravity of the offence committed in the instant case is so much greater because not only the safety of the passengers and the crew but also that of the aircraft was imperilled by the respondent`s wilful act. It follows that the principle of deterrence, in particular general deterrence, must be of paramount importance here. Considerations of retribution and the public interest (in the sense that the public has a legitimate expectation to be protected from such acts) too, all combine to compel the conclusion that a not insubstantial custodial sentence must be awarded in addition to a fine. The problem should be nipped in the bud before it becomes prevalent. What ought the length of such sentence to be?
 28.
 Mitigating and aggravating circumstances
It is convenient to consider the circumstances of the offence to begin with before moving on to the circumstances of the offender. First, it was not correct to say that the respondent committed the act impulsively on the spur of the moment without premeditated intent. The learned magistrate may have taken this view because of the short interval between the time the respondent argued with the cabin crew after being told to return to his seat (4.45am) and the time he went to the toilet and set fire to the tissue paper (5am). Nevertheless, the fact remains that the respondent`s act in starting the fire was a deliberate and intentional act of retaliation calculated, by his own admission, to cause inconvenience to the cabin crew. It certainly fell within the meaning of the term `wilfully` in that it was done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who did the act went with it: per FA Chua J in 
Ng Chwee Poh v PP
 
[1975-1977] SLR 603 at 616
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 230
  at 237. It is well established that where an act is done after deliberation and with premeditation as opposed to the situation where it is done on the spur of the moment and `in hot blood`, that is an aggravating and not a mitigating circumstance.
 29.Second, it was also not correct to trivialise the offence by saying that the item set alight was not a huge item and that the fire was started in the wash basin which made the possibility of a life-threatening fire small. Tissue paper is a flammable substance and the fire did not extinguish itself after burning for some time but grew large enough to trigger off the fire alarm, causing panic among the passengers and crew. Fortunately for the quick thinking and timely intervention of the flight stewardess, the fire was prevented from spreading and a possible mid-flight cabin fire which could have been disastrous was averted. In fact, the potential danger of a fire started in an aircraft toilet cannot be underestimated as that is an especially vulnerable area of the aircraft. This is plain from the commentary in the Federal Aviation Regulations (Part 25, Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes) issued by the United States Department of Transportation which is as follows: 
 Following an inflight fire which originated in a lavatory area, the FAA issued four Airworthiness Directives (AD) to require specific improvements in cabin fire protection
. Airworthiness Directive 74-08-09 (39 FR 12998, April 10, 1974), applicable to all transport category planes, requires 1,000 hour periodic inspections and repairs, as necessary, of all lavatory trash receptacles to ensure 
 fire containment capability
. It also requires preflight briefings informing passengers not to smoke in lavatories, and the installation of ashtrays near lavatory entrances and no-smoking signs on each side of the lavatory doors. ... Three additional AD`s, 74-21-03 (39 FR 36466, October 10, 1974), 75-02-04 and 75-02-05 (39 FR 13555, January 24, 1975), were issued for specific airplane models, requiring inspection and repair of lavatory electrical components and modification of lavatory trash receptacles to ensure 
 fire containment. Together, the AD actions were intended to eliminate likely ignition sources, end smoking in lavatories, and provide fire-safe trash receptacles in the event that fire occurs in a receptacle despite these precautions
. ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 Subsequent to the AD actions, there were two cabin fires that indicated that additional measures were needed to enhance protection against such fires. One of the fires occurred in flight near Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 2, 1983, and resulted in 23 fatalities. The other occurred on the ground at Tampa International Airport in Florida on June 25, 1983, and resulted in evacuation of the airplane with no injuries or loss of life
. ... [Emphasis added.]
 
In view of the above, the FAA adopted Amendment 121-185 (50 FR 12726, March 29, 1985) applicable to airplanes used in air carrier or commercial service under the provisions of Part 121 of this Chapter. This amendment requires the following to be installed: (1) a smoke detection system, or equivalent, in each lavatory prior to October 30, 1986; (2) a built-in fire extinguisher for each lavatory disposal receptacle prior to April 30, 1987; (3) additional hand fire extinguishers for airplanes with passenger seating capacities of 30 or fewer and 60 or more prior to October 30, 1985; ... .
 Further, the severity of the sentence should correspond to the degree of harm caused to the victims. In this respect, harm is not limited to physical injury but also includes psychological or mental harm. The custodial sentence awarded in the present case should therefore reflect the nature and extent of the injury inflicted on the passengers and crew as manifested in the panic caused by the sounding of the fire alarm.
 30.Third, and this follows partly from the previous point about harm including psychological or mental harm, it is not a relevant consideration that no one was actually injured or that there was no serious damage caused to the aircraft. In this connection, an analogy with drunken driving is instructive. In a charge of drunken driving, the fact that no one was injured is not a mitigating factor: 
PP v Pet
 
[1962] MLJ 194
 at p 194; if someone had been injured the accused could have been charged with another offence. The offence of drunken driving consists of doing a dangerous thing and placing other people in danger; to use the fact that no one was injured in mitigation would be to rob the offence of its essence. Similarly, the essence of an offence under para 45 of the Order is to wilfully (or negligently) imperil the safety of the aircraft or that of the persons on board; the fact that no one was injured and that the resulting damage was minimal is really irrelevant.
 31.Thus far an examination of the circumstances under which the offence was committed reveals only aggravating factors, not mitigating ones. What of the circumstances of the offender, the respondent himself? First, the respondent had pleaded for leniency as he has two parents, a wife who is not working and two children to support. The short answer to this is that the hardship was within presage and the respondent had brought it upon himself. The position is that hardship caused to the family by way of financial loss occasioned by imprisonment is of little weight today; and of no weight if the term is short: 
Lim Choon Kang v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 927
  at p 928. Hardship because of other family circumstances is also disregarded. Such hardship is the price which the convicted person must bear and cannot affect what would otherwise be the right sentence: 
 R v Ingham 
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 184 as cited in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  at p 308. Although ensuing hardship may exceptionally mitigate the rigour of punishment, the circumstances must be exceptional before the court will decide against a custodial sentence on this ground. Clearly, the circumstances of this case fell far short of those required to qualify hardship as a mitigating factor sufficient to persuade the court not to impose a custodial sentence.
 32.Second, the fact that the respondent has no previous convictions and is a first offender in respect of the offence charged, though not expressly pleaded, is of little assistance to him. The inference here must be that the respondent as a first offender and being of good character is a mitigating factor. In reply, it may be said that the weight to be given to this would be greater if there were positive evidence as to character rather than the negative inference from the absence of allegations of other convictions. Contrariwise, the counter argument could also be made, that being of good character is irrelevant as a mitigating factor but relevant as an aggravating factor in that the offence is so much greater because the offender should have known better. Of this particular offence, the comment of Ong Hock Sim J in 
PP v Lim Swee Guan
 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 84
  at p 86 bears repeating: `This is not the type of offence that the respondent would be allowed to commit over and over again.`
 33.Third, the learned magistrate was much persuaded by the fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty. It is of course a trite proposition that a timeous plea of guilt indicative of genuine remorse is a mitigating factor: see, eg 
Wong Yuk Ai v PP
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 51
  and 
R v Alcock & Ors
 
[1967] Crim LR 66
. However, there is no mitigation value in a plea of guilt if the offender pleaded guilty in circumstances knowing that the prosecution would have no difficulty proving the charge against him; or if he had been caught red-handed. In 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1990] SLR 1011
 , 1014; 
[1991] 1 MLJ 321
, 322-323, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) said: 
Although the appellant surrendered himself to the CAD, it is significant to note that this event occurred at a time when he really had no other choice. He had no choice because the Council of the Law Society had taken over the clients` account of his firm and it was only a question of time before his misdeeds came to light. This is in stark contrast to the defence he put forward in respect of the claim for $235,000 at a time when his misdeeds remained secret and safe with him. Similarly, the plea of guilty was not made in a case where the prosecution might have any trouble in proving the charges.
 
In making these comments, I do not dissent from the principle applied by the senior district judge that the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.
 So in the present case, there is doubt as to whether the respondent had really repented as he had effectively been caught red-handed and could not hope to put forward any plausible defence to the charge against him. His plea of guilt must thus matter little.
 34.Finally, a trial judge cannot justify a sentence that is manifestly inadequate by pointing to the omission of the prosecution to press for a deterrent sentence: 
PP v Darmalingam
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 519
  at p 520. A deterrent sentence is awarded entirely within the discretion of the court and there is no requirement in law for the prosecution to apply for deterrence before a court may consider it in the exercise of its discretion: 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 522
  at p 525. Thus the fact that the prosecution did not make any submissions on sentence did not exempt the learned magistrate from considering whether a deterrent sentence was appropriate in the circumstances, and this she did not do.
 35.
 The sentence
Policy considerations, the gravity of the offence including the particular facts and circumstances thereof all mandated the imposition of a custodial sentence. Moreover, the absence of mitigating (or the presence of aggravating) factors suggested that the term of imprisonment awarded should not be insubstantial. However, I was mindful of the statement in 
R v Curran
 
[1973] 57 Cr App R 945
 at pp 947-948 that: 
[a]s a general rule it is undesirable that a first sentence of immediate imprisonment should be very long, disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and imposed ... for reasons of general deterrence, that is as a warning to others. The length of a first sentence is more reasonably determined by considerations of individual deterrence.
 There was also the complementary principle that the fact that a sentence of imprisonment is awarded as a deterrent is no reason to award a longer term of imprisonment than the facts of the case warrant: 
Mohamed Abdullah Ang Swee Kang v PP
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 167
 . As was said in 
R v Bashir Begum Bibi
 
[1980] 71 Cr App R 360
 at p 361: 
[S]entencing courts must be particularly careful to examine each case to ensure, if an immediate custodial sentence is necessary, that the sentence is as short as possible, consistent only with the duty to protect the interests of the public and to punish and deter the criminal.
 
Many offenders can be dealt with equally justly and effectively by a sentence of six or nine months` imprisonment as by one of 18 months or three years. We have in mind not only the obvious case of the first offender for whom any prison sentence however short may be an adequate punishment and deterrent, but other types of cases as well. ...
 
What the court can and should do is to ask itself whether there is any compelling reason why a short sentence should not be passed.
 36.It was my considered opinion, however, that considerations of general deterrence must take precedence over those of specific or individual deterrence in the present case. I therefore increased the sentence to one of 12 months` imprisonment, with the fine of $2,000 to remain. This was justified on the ground that the learned magistrate had passed a sentence which was wrong in principle (see 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
[1986] SLR 126
 ), in that it failed to take into account the need for deterrence and the protection of the public. But I would add that, in my view, the maximum sentence which can be imposed under para 80(6) of the Order - imprisonment for a term of one year - is manifestly inadequate to deal with cases of this sort. Had I been empowered to do so, I would not have hesitated to impose a much stiffer sentence on the respondent, one which would have the very salutary effect of acting as a deterrent to other like-minded persons inclined to follow in the footsteps of the respondent. That, however, must be a matter for the consideration of Parliament, under whose sole and exclusive purview it lies.
 37.
 Conclusion 
 
Accordingly the appeal was allowed to the extent that the respondent should in addition to the fine of $2,000 be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months.",1999-04-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Introduction 
 1.The respondent pleaded guilty to three charges under s 465 read with s 471 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). In each charge, the respondent was alleged to have forged signatures of rightful owners of properties and then keeping the properties at his home or in his office. Seventeen similar charges under s 465 of the Penal Code were also taken into consideration in sentencing. The respondent was fined $8,000 in default of eight weeks` imprisonment on each of the three charges. The fines, amounting to a total of $24,000 were paid by the respondent.
 2.The prosecution appealed on the ground that the sentences passed were manifestly inadequate. After hearing the appeal, I allowed the appeal. I sentenced the respondent to three months` imprisonment on each of the three charges Two of the sentences were to run consecutively while the third sentence was ordered to run concurrently. Effectively, the respondent was to serve a total of six months` imprisonment. I also ordered that the fines remain. I now give my reasons.
 3.
 The facts 
 
The respondent was a police corporal attached to the Central Police Division. Between September 1994 to August 1997, he was performing the duties of an investigating officer. In the course of his duties, the respondent investigated several cases of shop lifting reported at his Division. The stolen properties were registered as case exhibits with the Case Property Store in the Police Division. Upon conclusion of the cases, the respondent forged acknowledgement slips that showed that he had returned exhibits which were the subject matter of the shoplifting cases investigated by him to the various complainants or owners. In most cases, he kept the properties at home or in his office.
 4.The offences came into light when an audit check was conducted on all the case exhibits registered under the respondent`s name.
 5.
 The trial judge`s decision 
 
The trial judge in assessing the sentence, took into consideration the mitigating fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty to the charges which obviated the need of a long trial. He also took into account the fact that the respondent had shown remorse by admitting his guilt at the earliest opportunity in the investigation stage in all his `cautioned statements`. In this case, there had been no loss suffered by the victims and the respondent had not profited from his misdeeds. As such, the trial judge was of the view that a heavy fine combined with dismissal from the police force was sufficient to meet the ends of justice. He thus ordered that the respondent pay a fine of $8,000 on each of the three charges.
 6.
 The appeal 
 
The prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed as being manifestly inadequate. The main contentions were that, firstly, the trial judge had failed to place sufficient weight on the fact that the respondent was a police officer. Secondly, the trial judge had failed to consider that 17 similar charges were to be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed.
 7.I shall address the contention that the trial judge had failed to place sufficient weight on the fact that the respondent was a police officer first. It was submitted by the prosecution that the respondent was a police officer and was thus duty bound to uphold the law. In committing such an offence, the respondent had tarnished the reputation of the police force. As such, it was submitted by the prosecution that a deterrent sentence ought to be meted out.
 8.Counsel for the respondent contended that the prosecution had failed to draw the court`s attention to certain features of the case which would justify the trial judge imposing a deterrent sentence. He accepted that the court had a discretion to impose a deterrent sentence even if the prosecution did not ask for one. This was established in the case of 
PP v Tan Koon Swan
 
[1986] SLR 401
 . However, he drew a distinction between the case here and that in 
 Tan Koon Swan 
 where, although the prosecution did not ask for a deterrent sentence, the prosecutor had drawn the court`s attention to sufficient aggravating factors that made it unnecessary for the prosecution to specifically ask for a deterrent sentence.
 9.It is hardly a controversial principle that a deterrent sentence is granted entirely within the court`s discretion. As I have said in 
Meeran bin Mydin v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 522
 , there is no requirement in law for the prosecution to apply for deterrence before a court may consider it in the exercise of its discretion. In 
Hon Kai & Ors v PP
 
[1955] SCR 1
, Rogers J commented that: 
It is no part of a prosecutor`s duty, once a conviction has been obtained, to make inflammatory appeals to the Bench for severity of sentence.
 10.However, the prosecution does have a duty to point out the aggravating factors which may warrant the imposition of a deterrent sentence. In my mind, it was clear that the aggravating factor in this case was that the person committing the crime had been a police officer. This must have been so obvious that it would not have been necessary for the prosecution to draw the court`s attention to it.
 11.In this case, it seemed clear to me that a deterrent sentence was warranted as the respondent had been a police officer who had committed these offences in the commission of his duty. The public is entitled to expect the highest standards from the police force. It would be sending the wrong signals to the public if a police officer who had committed forgery got off with only a fine. With due respect to the trial judge, it seemed to me that he had failed to consider adequately the fact that the respondent had been a police officer, when he sentenced the respondent to only pecuniary punishment. A custodial sentence in these circumstances was warranted not only to deter other like-minded individuals but also for the public interest.
 12.Further, I noted that, under s 178(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) with the consent of the prosecution and the respondent, the trial judge had to take into consideration 17 other similar charges which the respondent admitted that he had also committed over a period of eight months.
 13.In view of the fact that the maximum imprisonment term that could have been imposed by the trial judge for each of the three charges was two years, it seemed to me that the sentence of $8,000, in default eight weeks` imprisonment, on each of the three charges was manifestly inadequate.
 14.One of the main principles to note in sentencing is the totality principle. In 
Kanagasuntharam v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 , it was said at p 84: 
A sentencing court ought to have regard to the totality principle which requires the court to review the sentence and consider whether the aggregate is just and appropriate.
 15.In this regard, I was of the view that the trial judge`s cumulative sentence of $24,000 fine, in default 24 weeks` imprisonment, bore no proportion to the maximum penalty that can be suffered by the respondent. In my mind, this sentence was not in keeping with the respondent`s misconduct and failed to take adequately into consideration the other 17 offences committed.
 16.
 Conclusion 
 
A final point to note was that the trial judge had considered it a mitigating factor that, from the facts, there was no loss suffered by the victims and the respondent had not profited from his misdeeds. I just wish to reiterate what I said in 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
  that this was a legitimate mitigating factor but carried little weight.
 17.It seemed clear to me that in the circumstances of the case, where the accused was a police officer and had committed these offences in the course of his duty, it was in the public interest that a committal sentence be given. The whole purpose of the law is to maintain order and discipline and it was left to police officers to enforce the law. A deterrent sentence ought to be given to the respondent in view of this aggravating factor.
 18.Further, there was the fact that there were 17 other similar charges to be taken into account whilst sentencing. When one took that into consideration, it seemed clear that the sentences of $8,000 fine in default eight weeks` imprisonment on each of the three charges was manifestly inadequate.
 19.For the reasons above, I allowed the appeal and sentenced the respondent to three months` imprisonment on each of the three charges. Two of the sentences were to run consecutively while the third sentence was ordered to run concurrently. The fines were ordered to remain.",1999-04-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Background to the case stated 
 
In DAC 7675/98, DAC 7676/98 and DAC 15657/98, the respondent claimed trial to two amended charges under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one amended charge under s 403 of the Penal Code.
 2.In July 1997, the respondent was investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`CPIB`) as a consequence of information received relating to the said offences. After the CPIB investigations had commenced, the respondent wrote a letter dated 25 August 1997 to his Member of Parliament, Dr S Vasoo. The respondent requested Dr S Vasoo to forward certain written representations contained in the letter to the Attorney General`s Chambers (`AGC`). By the representations, the respondent sought the withdrawal of any potential criminal charges that might be brought against him. Dr S Vasoo forwarded the representations to the AGC on 27 August 1997.
 3.In the course of cross-examining the respondent, the Deputy Public Prosecutor (`DPP`) sought to refer the respondent to the representations for the purpose of impeaching his credit under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Counsel for the respondent objected to this reference on the ground that the representations were protected from disclosure. He submitted that it was an accepted fact of practice that representations made were communicated `without prejudice` in the course of negotiations with the AGC. This protection from disclosure was afforded by a broad principle of public policy to promote consensual case disposal.
 4.The prosecution`s case was that all representations to the AGC could become admissible. In response to the District Judge`s query, the prosecution confirmed that there was no known precedent for the use of representations in the manner sought. The prosecution submitted that it would be in the public interest for the court to avail itself of all available evidence.
 5.The District Judge held that the representations were protected from disclosure as they had been communicated `without prejudice` in the course of negotiations with the AGC. He excluded the representations from being used against the respondent and ordered that reference to the letter would not be permitted.
 6.On 2 September 1998, the respondent was convicted of the amended first and second charges and acquitted of the amended third charge.
 7.
 The question of law 
 
On 9 September 1998, the Public Prosecutor applied under s 263(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) for the following question of law to be reserved and stated as a special case by the District Judge for the consideration of the High Court: 
Whether a voluntary statement containing relevant evidence made by any person and communicated by him or on his behalf to the Public Prosecutor, in confidence or otherwise, in connection with any investigation into an offence or any criminal proceedings, is admissible against him at any trial for any of the following purposes:
 
(a) to cross-examine him on his testimony; 
(b) to impeach his credit; and 
(c) as substantive evidence.
 8.In a special case dated 14 October 1998, the District Judge submitted that the question should be dealt with specifically rather than generically to ensure that it was one which arose in the proceedings. Accordingly, he reserved the following re-stated question of law for the consideration of this court: 
Whether representations made by any person and communicated by him or on his behalf to the Public Prosecutor, in connection with any investigation into an offence or any criminal proceedings, may be used against him at any trial for the following purposes:
 
(a) to cross-examine him on his testimony; 
(b) to impeach his credit; and 
(c) as substantive evidence
 9.The District Judge had reserved the question of law in the shape of a special case in the form required by s 263(2) of the CPC. I found that he had not acted beyond his purview in restating the question. It was clear to me that a special case was not required to determine whether a voluntary statement containing relevant evidence was admissible against its maker. The main question that arose was whether that specific genre of statements, albeit voluntary and relevant, made as representations to the AGC could be used against its maker. I proceeded to consider the question as restated by the District Judge. The case stated was heard before me on 3 December 1998.
 10.
 Additional evidence 
 
Before moving on, the prosecution applied by way of CM 26/98 to include the following documents in the record of the case stated: (1) the respondent`s representations to Dr S Vasoo describing, among other things, the investigations and its genesis; (2) the respondent`s explanatory cover note to Dr S Vasoo; and, (3) Dr S Vasoo`s letter to the AGC, requesting the AGC to review the respondent`s appeal as stated in the enclosed representations. I allowed the application in the interests of having all the available facts before me. However, I was mindful that this court, in determining a question of law arising on a special case, concerns itself with the facts as set out by the District Judge in his statement of the special case. The additional information allowed could not be used to overturn any finding of fact made in the court below, only to inform my determination of the question of law in the case stated. The determination of this case stated falls under the High Court`s appellate criminal jurisdiction, as defined in s 19 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). This is to be distinguished from the High Court`s exercise of its revisionary powers in an application under s 268 of the CPC. It was with this caution that I proceeded.
 11.
 The decision below 
 
In his written grounds of decision, delivered on 30 September 1998, the District Judge explained that he did not rule that the representations were `inadmissible`. In fact, he had accepted that the representations may have been prima facie admissible and that the test of relevancy remained applicable. However, he emphasized that the question of admissibility should not be confused with the judicial discretion to exclude evidence.
 12.The District Judge observed that this application raised important and novel questions which had apparently not been tested in the local courts. The District Judge noted that Singapore lacked a legislative framework that dealt specifically with the admissibility of representations or statements made in the course of plea discussions, unlike, for example, the United States Federal Rules of Evidence (`FRE`). Nevertheless, he observed that under r 410(4) of the FRE, such representations were considered `without prejudice` and inadmissible subject to certain exceptions.
 13.Next, the District Judge turned to consider jurisdictions without any legislative framework governing the admissibility or exclusion of such statements. He found some support for the applicability of the `without prejudice` rule in the Privy Council review of the Canadian decision in 
Re Ramsay
 
[1870] LR 3 PC 427
. In addition, he noted that the Supreme Court of Western Australia went even further in 
Director of Public Prosecutions v Walsh & Ors
 
[1990] WAR 25
 and expressly recognised that communications to the prosecutor were made `without prejudice`.
 14.The District Judge opined that these same principles should apply to representations made to the AGC since they are firmly entrenched as our local equivalent of `plea bargaining`. He observed that our system of criminal justice had so far not permitted representations to be used against the accused in the fashion sought by the prosecution. He took judicial notice of the prevalent understanding that plea negotiations were conducted `without prejudice` and opined that the confidential nature of such negotiations promoted an invaluable general policy of encouraging consensual case disposal without trial. Such efforts at settlement could not be pursued in earnest if their content could later be used as substantive evidence against an accused.
 15.
 Arguments on the case stated 
 
The District Judge`s detailed examination of the status of plea discussions under the FRE framework was robustly contested by the prosecution. The prosecution asserted that there was no empirical evidence that plea bargaining held a similar role in the criminal justice system of Singapore. He relied on statistics showing that a mere 2.3% of persons charged in 1997 made representations (both plea and non-plea bargaining). The prosecution submitted that this was an insignificant proportion compared to the advanced plea-bargaining practices in the United States.
 16.The prosecution contended that our criminal justice system was, in contrast to the United States legal regime, geared towards finding the truth in criminal trials. He submitted that in the past 28 years, Parliament has been enacting legislation to render admissible in evidence all voluntary statements of accused persons or witnesses if they are relevant to any issue of fact in a criminal trial. In particular, he pointed to several examples in our criminal law pertaining to illegally obtained evidence. The court was reminded once again that it would be in the public interest to avail itself of all available evidence.
 17.Taking the example of confessions, the prosecution submitted that such statements were unquestionably prejudicial to the accused yet they are rarely excluded in Singapore courts unless the voluntariness of the statement had been disproved. In any case, he contended that the court below failed to apply the correct impeachment procedure first expounded in 
Muthusamy v PP
 
[1948] MLJ 57
 and approved in 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 . He argued that the District Judge should have examined the document to make a finding on whether there was any material discrepancy to justify cross-examination for impeachment.
 18.The prosecution criticized the use of a judicial discretion to exclude evidence on public policy grounds. He argued that the District Judge had failed to seriously consider the probative value of the respondent`s representations. Instead, the prosecution contended, the District Judge was too pre-occupied with the issue of inadmissibility and gave undue weight to its prejudicial effect.
 19.The prosecution`s main concern was (in their own words) the Public Prosecutor`s duty of upholding the public interest in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice, and their submission that this prevailed over any public policy of encouraging consensual disposal of criminal charges. The prosecution`s case was that this `higher public interest` would be betrayed should the courts permit a person to make representations to the AGC for which he cannot later be cross-examined should any inconsistency arise in his evidence in court. The prosecution said this would suggest to the public that lies were acceptable when making representations.
 
 Scope of representations in case stated 
 
 20.
 Representations made before charge
The District Judge`s definition of `plea discussions` encompassed all representations made to the AGC with a view to consensual case disposal without trial. This included the representations made by the accused below, even though they were made before he was charged but while investigations were pending. The District Judge noted that the United States courts, in dealing with the operation of r 410 of the FRE, have had to define what constitutes `plea discussions` and to examine whether such `plea discussions` were actually in progress in any particular case. He did not feel constrained by any of the resulting case law since they were mandated by the rubric of an evidential framework for admissibility under the FRE, a legislative framework which was not existent in Singapore.
 21.In view of the absence of any local legislative guidance on the admissibility of evidence obtained in plea negotiations, I found this to be the correct approach. At its highest, the FRE provides useful guidance on the evidential treatment of representations. In any case, I note that the court in 
 US v Boltz 
 663 F Supp 956 (1987), an authority mentioned by the District Judge in his grounds, found that it made no difference that the bargaining took place before charges were filed. It even observed, at p 961 of the report, that it will often make sense to both sides to bargain before charges are filed. Indeed, the consequent savings in costs and resources apply with equal validity to Singapore as they do in the United States.
 22.
 Nature of representations
The prosecution submitted that the FRE draws an important distinction between statements made in the course of plea discussions and statements volunteered by an accused person in the hope of leniency. A reading of the cases submitted does not yield any such distinction. They concern the issue of whether plea negotiations were ongoing at the time the statements were made. The case of 
US v Castillo
 
[1980] 615 F 2
d 878 discussed the two-tiered test first introduced in 
 USt v Pantohan 
 602 F 2d 855 for determining whether an admission by a criminal defendant was made in the course of plea negotiations. Firstly, the defendant must exhibit an actual subjective intent to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion. Next, the expectation of negotiating a plea at that time must be reasonable, given the totality of the circumstances. It was found that Castillo`s discussion with the prison counselor met neither prong of the 
 Pantohan 
 test and therefore admission of the counselor`s testimony was allowed. The court in 
US v Jimenez-Diaz
 
[1981] 659 F 2
d 562 also chose to deny the accused Salazar any privilege over statements made to federal agents on the basis that they were not made in the course of plea negotiations. Salazar`s statement was held admissible not because it was merely volunteered in the hope of leniency, but because it did not seek to plea negotiate.
 23.In any case, I find that such a distinction, if any, does not apply to the case stated. The AGC are the only recipients of the representations considered here whereas Castillo was talking to his prison counsellor, a person who was not empowered to prosecute or negotiate on behalf of any prosecuting authority; and Salazar made the statement to federal (FBI) agents. It was observed in 
 Boltz 
, at p 960, that the problem in cases such as 
 Castillo 
 was the need to distinguish plea bargaining from interrogation. This case stated considers representations made to the AGC as the prosecuting authority in Singapore. Like 
 Boltz 
, the position is between a suspect or accused person and the Public Prosecutor`s representative. The presence of federal and state prosecutors who could themselves make binding agreements distinguished 
 Boltz 
 from the cases of admissions to government agents such as in 
 Jimenez-Diaz 
. Before me, there is no question regarding statements made to, for example, the CNB, or the police in carrying out investigations.
 24.Representations are made to the AGC for a myriad of offences and through different modes. They are not always brought by a legal representative. Some are brought through the petitioner`s Member of Parliament (as was the case below), while others are brought personally, or by the accused person`s representative. The prosecution submitted that some representations may have nothing to do with any issue at trial but are merely pleas for compassion. I accept that the specific nature of the representation may differ but these include representations for withdrawal of charges, reduction of charges, compounding offences, amalgamation of charges or taking charges into consideration. All are motivated by a desire for leniency. I am in agreement with the District Judge`s ruling below and accept that representations requesting for the withdrawal of charges need not be treated differently from those made in the more restricted course of plea bargaining where some sort of quid pro quo is sought. Given any accused person`s desire to dispose of criminal charges, it cannot be said that an accused who seeks a withdrawal of charges will not, in the final analysis, agree to surrendering a lesser plea. In this way, a person who makes representations for the withdrawal of charges against him is clearly involved in a process of plea negotiations with the prosecution.
 25.For this case stated, I accept the District Judge`s definition of `plea negotiations` as applicable to our local equivalent of representations made to the AGC with a view to consensual case disposal. `Plea discussions` was read in 
 Boltz 
 to include statements made in pursuit of `offers of immunity, dismissal of all charges, or no prosecution, as well as offers to allow pleas to lesser or related offences.` The court there made the following observations, at p 961: `That the bargain was for immunity, forfeiture and a civil penalty, rather than a guilty or nolo contendre plea, should likewise make no difference. The completed bargain, in any negotiating situation, reflects the value of the desired behaviour and the power to compel it.` I see no difficulty with transporting this definition to the Singapore context. In the circumstances, representations to the AGC for all of the above mentioned purposes constitute the subject matter of this case stated.
 26.
 Whether representations to the AGC can be used against the petitioner 
 
The prosecution contended that the District Judge should have applied the 
 Muthusamy v PP 
 procedure before refusing their application for leave to impeach the accused on his representations. Indeed the District Judge was not unfamiliar with this procedure. Earlier in the trial, he had entertained one such application for impeachment on the accused`s s 122(6) statement. He carried out the correct procedure of impeachment as set out in 
 Muthusamy v PP 
 by examining the relevant portion of the s 122(6) statement which was alleged to reveal a material inconsistency. Having found no such inconsistency, the District Judge refused leave to cross-examine the accused on his s 122(6) statement.
 27.With regard to the representations, the District Judge applied a different approach. In his grounds of decision, the District Judge stated his view that, if the representations were so protected, it was immaterial whether any inconsistency was present. Any exercise of scrutiny and determination as to whether material inconsistencies were present (as was called for by the 
 Muthusamy 
 procedure) would then be superfluous. Notwithstanding this, the District Judge intimated that if the prosecution`s submission was correct, the representations may have disclosed an inconsistency which appeared to him to be a mere omission of detail, and therefore not a material discrepancy. Nevertheless, the District Judge sought to clarify that he had excluded reference to the representations in the exercise of his judicial discretion. His grounds of decision discussed the possibility of a `without prejudice` rule in criminal litigation, the status of plea discussions in the United States and the FRE, in particular, r 410 and policy considerations in the local context.
 28.
 Approach on case stated 
 
I turn now to consider these reasons in the process of answering this case stated. Before me, there are larger issues raised by the question of law. This special case will make the first determination of its kind in Singapore of the evidential value of representations made to the AGC in plea negotiations. Their position at law as informed by public policy must be considered. My approach is as follows. By way of background and in view of the absence of any local evidential framework for the treatment of representations, the approach taken in other jurisdictions will be discussed first. I will then proceed to examine the local evidential framework. Next, relevant policy considerations will be discussed. Finally, some observations will be made on constitutional issues such as the role of the Public Prosecutor and the judiciary in Singapore.
 29.
 The approach of various jurisdictions to plea negotiations 
 
The restated question of law made a crucial distinction which I have alluded to above. Plea negotiations, in their present informal framework, cannot immediately be assumed to enjoy the same rules that apply to the conduct of a criminal trial. It has been observed that plea bargaining appears to represent a form of administration of justice in which adjudication is performed privately outside the courtroom. `The formal safeguards embodied in the concept of `due process` are absent, and the procedural protections associated with adversarial confrontation are lacking` (see Baldwin and McConville, `Plea Bargaining and the Court of Appeal` (1979) 6 Brit J Law and Society 200 at 201). The authors went on to observe that, in plea bargaining, standards such as proof beyond reasonable doubt assumed a different meaning; that there was no testing of witnesses in cross-examination; inadmissible evidence (for instance, the accused`s previous convictions) risked being taken into account in the final determination of guilt of a particular charge and the traditional remedies open to defendants on appeal were largely foreclosed. They concluded that in the course of plea bargaining, there was an absence of the principles of adversary justice upheld in a criminal trial.
 30.I found this to be a crucial distinction reflected in the cautious approach of the English Court of Appeal in various cases which featured the treatment of plea discussions. As observed by Baldwin and McConville, the central concern of the English Court of Appeal has been to regulate the practice of judges meeting with counsel in private prior to the trial. This can be seen in their decision in 
R v Turner
 
[1970] 54 Cr App R 352
 wherein the court emphasised that, while there must be freedom of access between counsel and judge, any discussion on plea should be made between the judge and both counsel for the defence and the prosecution. The court in 
 Turner 
 sought to discourage such discussions and was of the view that so far as possible justice must be administered in open court. Lord Scarman delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
R v Atkinson
 
[1978] 2 All ER 460
 elaborated further: 
In this sensitive area, the appearance of justice is part of the substance of justice and it will not do if a prisoner or the general public derive the impression that it is possible ... to achieve a bargain with the court. Plea bargaining has no place in the English criminal law. ... It is found in some systems of law in which the prosecution are entitled to make submissions as to the character or length of the sentence. In such systems of law it is possible for a bargain to be driven between the defence and the prosecution, but never ... with the court itself. In our law, the prosecution is not heard on sentence. This is a matter for the court, after considering whatever has to be said on behalf of an accused man.
 31.The prosecution submitted that this drew a distinction between the criminal justice system of the United States where the prosecutor`s recommendations on sentence are followed once a successful plea bargain has been struck; and, countries such as England and Singapore, where there is no explicit rule allowing for bargain on sentence between the court and an accused. Indeed, in 
Chua Qwee Teck v PP
 
[1991] SLR 857
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 411
 , Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) followed Lord Scarman`s decision in 
 Atkinson 
. At 
[1991] SLR 857
, 864; 
[1991] 3 MLJ 411
, 415, he noted that plea bargaining, in the sense of the court bargaining with the accused as to the sentence, was not part of the administration of criminal justice in Singapore.
 32.While there is, as pointed out by the prosecution, a difference between the status of the public prosecutor`s recommendation in the United States and that in England, the reason why the English courts have been careful to restrict the conduct of plea negotiations must be remembered. The English court`s approach is not the result of upholding the principle of the admissibility of voluntary statements, but based on a recognition of the lack of safeguards for the conduct of plea negotiations. This approach also suggests that the law of evidence does not necessarily apply to representations made to a prosecuting authority in the same way that they apply to other voluntary statements containing relevant evidence. Needless to say, given the reticence of these authorities to so much as admit the role of plea negotiations, there is minimal discussion on the treatment of statements made in this unique context. What then is the evidential weight of representations made in the course of plea negotiations?
 33.I need only refer to the decision in 
 The Queen v Larocque 
 124 CCC 3d 564 as an authoritative statement on the judicial approach in this respect. The same issues that arise in this case stated were dealt with in the judgment of Weekes J. The facts were as follows. The accused`s counsel wrote to Crown counsel indicating that the accused would accept an offer made by the Crown and plead guilty to charges of sexual misconduct. The accused did not plead guilty. The Crown contended that the letter amounted to an admission of guilt and sought reception of the letter into evidence. It was argued that the letter was admissible and that the accused could then respond with evidence as to why it should not be held against him. The Crown argued that the letter was not part of the give and take of negotiations, and that those were completed but that the letter amounted to a separate discreet admission of guilt. The Crown submitted that once counsel for the accused had indicated that his client would accept the Crown`s offer and plead guilty, that utterance was an admission which could be relied upon by the Crown to prove guilt, even if made in a pre-trial conference.
 34.I digress for a moment to observe that the Crown`s arguments in 
 Larocque 
 are not unlike the prosecution`s submission in this case that the District Judge should have first admitted the representations and then decided on the evidence before him why the representations should not be used against the accused. By analogy, these contentions ask for such statements to be used as substantive evidence. Another similarity is found in the prosecution`s contention that a representation requesting withdrawal of charges should not be construed as plea-bargaining because there was no quid pro quo or `give and take` in the negotiating relationship. Both these arguments were rejected in 
 Larocque 
. Weekes J held that resolution discussions (the Canadian equivalent of `plea negotiations` defined above) are privileged and that the letter was inadmissible. He relied on an earlier decision in 
R v Bernardo
 
[1994] OJ No 1718
 wherein LeSage ACJ (as he then was) had noted that such pre-trial discussions were `without prejudice` to the rights of the parties. He noted that such negotiations will normally occur in private and should remain confidential unless a resolution is achieved in which case the discussions would normally be disclosed in court. LeSage ACJ opined the view that the public interest would be well served by encouraging such frank and full discussions between counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown.
 35.Weekes J also relied on the decision in 
R v Lake
 
[1997] OJ No 5447
. That judgment is equally relevant to this case stated. In 
 Lake 
, the Crown sought to adduce evidence relating to plea negotiations between counsel for one RC, a youth who was charged in respect of the same offence as Mr Lake but in separate proceedings, and the Crown. At para 44, McCombs J dealt with the issue of privilege in plea negotiations and stated the following: 
In my view, a ruling favourable to the Crown in the circumstances of a case such as this would have a profound chilling effect upon resolution discussions, an essential component of the administration of justice, and would do irreparable damage to the public interest in the proper administration of justice. This public interest is of such importance that it must outweigh all other considerations.
 36.McCombs J was undoubtedly referring to the overwhelming prejudicial effect of permitting representations made in plea negotiations to be used against the accused person. This did not go unnoticed in the case below. The District Judge had discussed the ramifications if any voluntary statement made to the prosecution must necessarily be admitted as substantive evidence. He raised the example of an accused person charged with ten counts of cheating. Through his counsel, the accused makes representations to the AGC of his willingness to plead guilty to two charges on the condition that the other eight are not proceeded with and are merely taken into consideration. What then is the position if his representations are not acceded to and he claims trial to all the ten charges? While there was little doubt that the accused`s statements made in the course of plea negotiations were voluntary, relevant and prima facie admissible, it would be patently unfair that they could be used against him at his trial as proof of an admission of all ten charges.
 37.Weekes J then proceeded to make several important observations. In 
 Bernardo 
 and 
 Lake 
 as well as in the case before him, the argument focused on plea negotiations which took place directly between counsel for the accused and counsel for the Crown. However, the position at law (applicable to Canada`s General Division) was as stated in r 28.03(1) of the Criminal Proceeding Rules, SI/92-99. This provided that the discussion in the pre-trial is without prejudice to the rights of the parties. He also noted, and I mention this for the record, that at the time the Crown sent the letter in issue to Larocque, no such rules of procedure were in effect in the Provincial Division. However, Weekes J held that there was no reason for drawing a distinction between plea negotiations that take place in a pre-trial context in the Provincial Division as opposed to those that occur in the General Division; and those that occur directly between counsel. In any case, new rules had since been effected on the Provincial Division. The new Rules of the Ontario Court of Justice in Criminal Proceedings SI/97-133 became effective on 1 January 1998. He noted that r 27.03(1) specifically provides that such pre-trial conferences were conducted without prejudice to the rights of the parties and was of the view that it would be an illogical anomaly if those pre-trial discussions which occurred before the implementation of the new rule were not without prejudice. For the purposes of answering the question of law raised, we are of course not so much concerned with the retrospective application of such a rule. Admittedly, no such rules have been introduced to plea negotiations in Singapore. It must be appreciated however, that Weekes J made his ruling when no such rules applied to his division. In the circumstances, I find that his reasons for holding plea negotiations to be privileged discussions apply with equal force to the case stated here.
 38.In any case, the principle of privilege attaching to statements made during plea negotiations has been expressly recognised at common law by the Canadian Court of Appeal. In 
R v Pabani
 
[1994] 17 OR (3d) 659
, the accused was convicted of the murder of his wife. While the accused and his wife were separated, a mutual friend tried to assist them in reconciling their differences. Statements, in which the accused implicitly acknowledged having assaulted his wife previously, were admitted into evidence at trial. The accused argued that these statements should have been ruled inadmissible as they were covered by the common law privilege pertaining to settlement talks in civil proceedings. The trial judge ruled that the statements were admissible. The facts in 
 Pabani 
 are clearly distinguishable in that these statements were voluntarily made to a person without prosecuting authority and were made outside the context of plea negotiations. What is more pertinent about 
 Pabani 
 is Finlayson JA`s observations on appeal. He found an accurate summary of the law in 
 McCormick on Evidence 
 (4th Ed) at p 198, which reads: 
Compromise evidence in criminal cases. ... the legitimacy of settling criminal cases by negotiations between prosecuting attorney and accused, whereby the latter pleads guilty in return for some leniency, has been generally recognized. Effective criminal law administration would be difficult if a large proportion of the charges were not disposed of by guilty pleas. Public policy accordingly encourages compromise, and as in civil cases, that policy is furthered by protecting from disclosure at trial not only the offer but also statements made during negotiations.
 I agree entirely with this view.
 39.The District Judge observed that, where no specific evidential framework shaped the conduct of plea negotiations, the courts have intervened to find that communications made in the course of negotiations are privileged from disclosure. In 
 DPP v Walsh 
, the prosecutor sought to tender evidence that he had been approached on a `without prejudice` basis by the accused`s legal representatives with a view to determining the prosecution`s attitude if the accused were to plead guilty and make full restitution of the sum wrongfully obtained. The Supreme Court of Western Australia, in a decision by Seaman J (at p 33 of the report), ruled that such communications were inadmissible. It is clear that the legal representative`s statement was prima facie voluntary and relevant. However, it was inadmissible because it had been made in what the court clearly recognised as the confidential and privileged context of plea negotiations.
 40.Finally, I turn to consider the status of plea discussions in the United States and FRE - r 410. The treatment of statements made in the course of plea negotiations is in a much more advanced state of development in the United States. FRE 410 now contains the legislative framework for admissibility of evidence of statements made in the course of plea discussions. The District Judge noted that this provision expressly renders such statements inadmissible in criminal litigation, subject to certain exceptions: 
Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions:
 
(a) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn; 
(b) a plea of nolo contendere; 
(c) any statement made in the courts of any proceedings under r 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or comparable state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or 
(d) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting attorney which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.
 
However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel.
 41.The District Judge noted that a substantial body of case law has developed as a consequence of FRE 410 but found it unnecessary to examine these cases in detail since no similar framework applies in the local context. Nonetheless, I found that these cases yielded some core principles which provide a useful background for the question of law raised. Briefly, they are as follows. The case of 
 Santobello v New York 
 
404 US 257
 (1971) at p 260 acknowledged that the disposition of criminal charges by agreement between the prosecutor and the accused was, properly administered, to be encouraged. It was observed that, if every criminal charge were subjected to a full-scale trial, the States and the Federal Government would need to multiply by many times the number of judges and court facilities. The District Judge relied on cases such as 
 US v Ross 
 493 F 2d 771 (1974) and 
 US v Smith 
 525 F 2d 1017 (1975) as authority that efforts in plea negotiations cannot be pursued in earnest if statements made in the course of discussions can be admitted in evidence subsequently as a weapon against the defendant when negotiations fail. Furthermore, it has been held that statements made in the course of plea discussions are not admissible in the US for the purpose of impeachment by contradiction, if the accused subsequently testifies at his trial and provides statements inconsistent with what he had said earlier in the plea discussion process: see 
 US v Lawson 
 683 F 2d 688 (1982); 
 US v Wood 
 879 F 2d 927 (DC 1989); 
 US v Mezzanatto 
 998 F 2d 1452 (1993) and 
 US v Acosta-Ballardo 
 8 F 3d 1532 (1993).
 42.
 Some relevant policy considerations 
 
The prosecution sought to distinguish plea discussions under United States law from the system of plea bargaining in Singapore. The DPP argued that, given the small number of representations made out of the total number of criminal cases in the given sample year of 1997, there was no empirical evidence to support the District Judge`s statement that plea representations are a vital part of the Singapore criminal justice system. With regard to these figures, I allowed for the possibility that they include offences for which representations to the AGC are not normally made. Nonetheless, as was submitted by the prosecution, the benefits of plea bargaining are enjoyed because of the courts` practice in giving sentencing discounts to accused persons who plead guilty. This discount (as much as a third of the normal sentence imposed on an accused person who claims trial) is awarded unless public interest requires that the accused be given a deterrent sentence. He submitted that the rationale for this sentencing discount was the same as that behind plea bargaining, that is, by his guilty plea the accused person was permitting the courts and prosecution to enjoy savings in resources.
 43.I was grateful to the prosecution for this submission. It accepts the pivotal role played by plea negotiations in achieving an accused person`s desire for leniency (whether it be in the form of a lighter sentence or a withdrawal of charges). We are not bound by FRE 410 nor the resultant cases. However, I found it hard to deny the validity of their policies to the local plea negotiations process. For example, the US Supreme Court in 
 Santobello v New York 
 made a comprehensive observation of the benefits of successful plea bargaining at p 261 of the judgment: 
It [plea bargaining] leads to prompt and largely final disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids much of the corrosive impact of enforced idleness during pre-trial confinement for those who are denied release pending trial; it protects the public from those accused persons who are prone to continue criminal conduct even while on pre-trial release; and by shortening the time between charge and disposition, it enhances whatever may be the rehabilitative prospects of the guilty when they are ultimately imprisoned.
 44.The same case recognised the essential role plea bargaining plays in the US criminal process for the following reasons: (a) no jury service for members of the public; (b) expeditious adjudication of the accused`s guilt or innocence; (c) saving in time, effort and resources for the State and the accused in undergoing trial. With the exception of the first benefit mentioned above, the second and third benefits appear equally valid to Singapore`s criminal justice system. Indeed the prosecution admitted this in their submission that plea bargaining in Singapore exists to benefit our policy of awarding a sentencing discount. The DPP described the rationale for giving this sentencing discount to be the same as that of plea bargaining, that is, (and I quote from para 28 of his full submissions) that there will be saving of time, resources, money and `it also spares the victims of crimes from the trauma of trial.` Indeed, this policy has been consistently applied by the courts. I myself have had occasion to make similar observations on this sentencing policy. In 
Krishnan Chand v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 291
  at p 294, I observed that one of the reasons credit is given to an accused for his guilty plea is after all, the time and effort he saves the authorities, which time and effort would otherwise have to be expended on investigation and prosecution.
 45.The DPP submitted that `the United States criminal justice system places great importance on the supremacy of individual rights to the extent that it overshadows other values, including that relating to the discovery of the truth.` He submitted that the Singapore criminal justice system, on the other hand, is geared toward finding the truth in criminal trials, `rather than letting accused persons off on procedural irregularities which have nothing to do with the probative value of the evidence sought to be admitted.`
 46.We should not deceive ourselves into believing that the function of plea negotiations is geared toward finding the truth the same way the laws of evidence seek to do so in a criminal trial. The plea negotiations process is discrete from the criminal trial. This is supported by the clear distinction drawn by the various jurisdictions examined above. The English Court of Appeal sought to distance the plea negotiations process from the criminal trial in open court. The Canadian decisions went further to recognise a need for representations made in plea negotiations to be inadmissible as substantive evidence in a criminal trial. The plea negotiations process is not so much intent on determining the truth of an accused`s criminal culpability as it is in achieving costs savings for the criminal justice system. The goal is to secure a lighter sentence in order that less of the court`s time and, in the long run, the resources of penal institutions, are wasted; and for a more lenient penalty to be enjoyed by the accused person.
 47.This goal does not constitute a procedural irregularity. Plea negotiations often start from a person being charged, or at the very least investigated by the police. Plea negotiations are triggered off when the prosecution is certain that there is at the very least a sufficient degree of evidence to proceed, without the benefit of an admission from the accused during plea negotiations. It is therefore a gross overstatement to say that protecting the confidentiality of representations would lead to the letting off of accused persons. In any event, it is not a question of technical procedure but a more basic issue of the importance of maintaining plea negotiations in our criminal justice system. The question is not about whether individual rights should overshadow other values. The issue is not one of rights. Nor is the issue one of the probative value of such evidence. There is no denying that such evidence would have probative value. Instead the issue is this. Is the process of plea negotiations crucial enough to the criminal justice system that the confidentiality of representations should be protected notwithstanding its probative value. The only reason given by the prosecution as to why such a privilege would hamper the administration of criminal justice was that people would lie in making representations. There is no reason to fear as any person who does so can be charged under s 182, Penal Code. Examined as a whole, the benefit of protecting plea negotiations clearly overwhelms whatever doubts it may produce.
 48.The prosecution argued that to uphold a consensual case disposal policy would threaten the public confidence in the criminal justice system. He submitted that to cloak representations made to the AGC with privilege would send a message to the public that lies could be made in representations but not used to discredit the maker. The prosecution`s submissions, at para 8, were as follows: 
People, especially accused persons, will think that it does not matter to their current charges to give false, fabricated, misleading or inaccurate information to the Attorney General`s Chambers through their counsel or MPs, as they will be advised that the prosecution is unable to use their statements in the representations against them. If this unsatisfactory state of affairs is allowed to persist, the integrity of the criminal justice system will be adversely affected leading to loss of public confidence in the administration of justice. The Public Prosecutor, who is the guardian of public policy and interest, will also find it difficult to discharge his prosecutorial discretion judicially and fairly under art 35(8) of the Constitution and s 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 49.The prosecution`s concern is best arrested here. To suggest that lies made in any context would go undisciplined is a serious allegation that augurs much concern. However, the format of making representations does not support such an argument. Firstly, as noted by the District Judge, the present scenario is distinguished from one where the accused was being prosecuted for furnishing false information within his representations. In such a case, representations would undoubtedly be admissible. For example, in a prosecution for intentionally giving false evidence contrary to s 193 of the Penal Code in 
Choo Pit Hong Peter v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 255
 , I did not hesitate to admit statements made to officers of the Commercial Affairs Department (`CAD`). Next, I note from the prosecution`s bundle of authorities that, as of 25 February 1998, a representation to the AGC must contain a statement that the accused`s attention has been drawn to the consequences of s 182 of the Penal Code. Without this statement being signed or acknowledged, the representation would not be considered by the AGC. At the outset, the accused is warned that should his statement of facts within the representation prove incorrect, he is exposed to a charge under s 182. I find that these are more than sufficient safeguards to ensure that the public is made aware that the criminal justice system will not suffer perjury. Moreover, the prosecuting authority`s dissatisfaction with the absence of safeguards cannot in itself stand as a reason to allow representations to be admissible as substantive evidence.
 50.For the sake of completeness, I shall explain the position with regard to representations once again. From the discussion above, it is clear that this arena of plea negotiations has evolved to meet the interests of (1) the prosecution in saving costs, time and resources, (2) the courts in carrying out sentencing policies and (3) the accused person`s hope for charges to be withdrawn or to plead guilty to lesser offences, the cumulative effect being a lighter sentence. Plea negotiations, as defined above, encompass representations made once investigations have begun. The investigations would have been initiated by the existence of substantive evidence proving the accused person`s involvement in a criminal offence. Where plea negotiations are underway, representations are made toward consensual case disposal for all of the three motivations identified above. They constitute an earnest attempt to dispose of the criminal prosecution without trial. The participants in this plea negotiations arena are not involved in a `fishing expedition` for evidence of criminal culpability or to detect a weak prosecution case. Therefore representations made in plea negotiations should not alter a party`s ability to discharge its evidential burden at the criminal trial of the offences charged.
 51.Hence, it is clear that a broad policy objective of consensual case disposal must be recognised to give effect to our courts` policy of giving sentencing discounts. It has been submitted by the prosecution that the rationale underlying this policy is the same as that of plea bargaining. Accordingly, the policy considerations discussed in the plea discussion and plea bargaining contexts which have been formulated in the United States jurisdictions may apply with considerable force here. The difficulty is to achieve a balance between securing convictions of guilty persons and the efficiency of the criminal process. I consider that a wholehearted endorsement of the prosecution`s contentions would so stifle the conduct of plea negotiations as to completely obviate its practice. The protection of representations as `privileged` documents is therefore not only important, but necessary, to preserve the harmonious prosecution of our criminal laws.
 52.This policy has been recognised by other jurisdictions such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. I am in full agreement with LaSage ACJ`s invaluable observations in 
 Bernardo 
 which were followed by Weekes J in 
 Larocque 
: 
I agree with the Crown`s submissions that there should be a recognized privilege surrounding plea discussions vis--vis the accused and the Crown. There are many reasons in the nature of public policy that would suggest that such a privilege does exist or ought to exist in order to encourage Crown and defence to have full, frank and private negotiations in criminal cases. I believe, as in civil cases ... settlement negotiation privilege ought to exist. ... The saving to the public and the resulting benefit to the administration of justice in resolving cases that ought to be resolved is substantial. Although there may be exceptions to that confidentiality or privilege such as obstruction of justice, or other issues, I am of the view that public policy would dictate that there be a confidentiality concerning negotiations. That privilege applies in the sense that the information disclosed will not be used against that person.
 I turn now to consider the precise quality of this privilege.
 53.
 The privilege in the context of the local evidential framework 
 
As has been pointed out earlier, the admissibility of a voluntary statement was never in issue. The applicability of ss 17 and 21 of the Evidence Act to admissions in criminal proceedings was not the subject of argument before me. One could consider representations to the AGC, for want of a better term, as being prima facie `technically admissible` under the Evidence Act. In this sense, the rationale underlying the generous admissibility provisions of ss 121 and 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code and s 147(3) and s 157 of the Evidence Act remain undisturbed.
 54.However, the subject of debate in the case stated was whether representations to the AGC fall inadmissible because they are privileged from disclosure. Such a privilege would exclude the use of representations to (a) cross-examine the accused person on his testimony; (b) to impeach his credit; and, (c) as substantive evidence. This bar to admissibility would apply the same way s 24 gives the courts no discretion to include a confession caused by inducement, threat or promise. It is deemed irrelevant in criminal proceedings. Under s 23 of the Evidence Act, the same premise of irrelevance operates to exclude admissions that are made `without prejudice` in civil cases.
 55.In the circumstances, the question is: whether confidential representations made to the AGC should be encouraged by virtue of a consistent extension of the policy recognised under s 23 of the Evidence Act. Consistency is emphasised because, in embarking on this exercise, I am mindful of the guidance given in s 2(2) and do not wish to create any rules inconsistent with existing provisions of the Evidence Act.
 56.It may be argued that by virtue of a literal interpretation of the wording in s 23, Stephen, the draftsman of our Evidence Act, intended to restrict the application of the `without prejudice` rule to civil cases. The rules of judicial interpretation dictate otherwise. Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) makes it imperative that the court adopt a purposive approach to statutory interpretation. Section 9A(1) reads: 
In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.
 57.This approach was explicitly recognised by the court in 
Constitutional Reference No 1 of 1995
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 201
  at p 210: 
It is well established ... that a purposive interpretation should be adopted in interpreting [the Constitution] to give effect to the intent and will of Parliament. The principle to be applied is that the words of the Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament: EA Driedger, 
 Construction of Statutes
 (2nd Ed, 1983) p 87.
 It was also held at p 211 that there is no blanket rule that a provision must be ambiguous or inconsistent before a purposive approach to statutory interpretation can be taken. This has been upheld in numerous cases including the recent Court of Appeal decision in 
Planmarine AG v Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore
 
 
[1999] 2 SLR 1
 . Further, 
Constitutional Reference No 1 of 1995
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 201
  observed that it would be wrong to adopt a literal approach (even if the statutory provision was not ambiguous or inconsistent) if the literal approach did not give effect to the will and intent of Parliament.
 58.Recent decisions in Singapore have affirmed the role of the Evidence Act as a facilitative statute: see 
Lee Kwang Peng v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 278
  at p 292. This was the means through which the probative versus prejudicial balancing tests of 
DPP v Boardman
 
[1975] AC 421
 was introduced to test evidence in similar fact cases. I discussed this in 
Tan Meng Jee v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 422
  at p 434. A similar approach has been taken to introduce common law rules not expressly provided for under the Evidence Act in the categories of, for example, hearsay evidence and corroboration. These authorities are all more recent than any binding English decision confirming the Act as a codifying Act.
 59.Indeed, a purposive construction has been applied to s 24 of the same Evidence Act in 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
 . In delivering the judgment of the court, LP Thean JA interpreted s 24 as undoubtedly bearing another possible construction that stood apart from the strict and literal construction. The purposive construction gave sense and meaning to s 24 and also achieved the purpose for which that section was enacted.
 60.In this case, a purposive interpretation is undoubtedly the preferred sensible approach toward reading an Act relatively untouched since its inception in 1893. Section 23 is silent on the application of the rule to representations made in the context of plea negotiations, which in itself is distinguished from the substantive trial of a criminal charge. Section 23, as observed by the editors of 5 
 Butterworth`s Annotated Statutes of Singapore 
 at p 83, concerns admissions which are not provable because of policy reasons. This is the policy of encouraging consensual case settlement in civil litigation. Section 23 does not expressly preclude the policy of consensual case settlement from being applied to a criminal justice system. Indeed, it cannot since otherwise the discretionary policy of awarding sentencing discounts would be void. Section 23 is silent on the plea negotiations process in criminal matters. It is clear that it was expressly outside the scope of Stephen`s consideration. In this finding, I am guided by LP Thean JA`s dicta in 
L & W Holdings Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1601
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 905
  at p 915 to refer to the purposes of the provisions and discover something which the draftsman may have inadvertently overlooked, in which case it would be the court`s duty `as a matter of construction to repair that omission.` A purposive construction would interpret plea negotiations in criminal matters as outside the draftsman`s scheme of the criminal justice system. This comes as no surprise, given that English authorities have been shy of acknowledging plea bargaining in the criminal process: see, for example, Lord Scarman`s declaration in 
R v Atkinson
 
[1978] 2 All ER 460
 at p 462 that `plea bargaining has no place in the English criminal law...`. Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) has been quoted above as following this stand: 
Chua Qwee Teck v PP
 
[1991] SLR 857
 , 864; 
[1991] 3 MLJ 411
, 415. This is true insofar as the judge sitting in court does not bargain with the accused on sentence. The plea negotiations process is outside the framework of evidence law administered by the court in determining criminal culpability of an accused person. However, to be alive to the needs of a modern criminal justice system in Singapore, it is clear that the purpose for which s 23 was enacted applies with equal force to the administration of the criminal justice system. This policy of consensual case settlement for criminal matters is realised in the plea negotiations process.
 61.Following the above discussion, the ruling is as follows. Representations cannot be deemed reliable or relevant as substantive evidence of the guilt of the offence charged. The privilege attaches itself to the representations and renders the representations confidential and privileged from disclosure on the basis that they are irrelevant. In this sense, to say that representations are privileged will not be inconsistent with s 23 of the Evidence Act since it does not introduce a `without prejudice` rule to the substantive criminal trial. Such a privilege only cloaks representations made in the course of plea negotiations.
 62.
 Nature of privilege 
 
In civil cases, the broad public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences was acknowledged by the House of Lords in 
Rush & Tompkins v Greater London Council
 
[1989] AC 1280
 at p 1300 to be the underlying purpose of the `without prejudice` rule. As pointed out by Donaldson LJ in 
Tramountana Armadora SA v Atlantic Shipping Co SA
 
[1978] 2 All ER 870
, it is in the public interest that there should be a procedure whereby the parties to a dispute can discuss their differences freely and frankly to make offers of settlement without fear of being embarrassed by such exchanges in case a settlement is not made. The English Court of Appeal decision in 
South Shropshire District Council v Amos
 
[1987] 1 All ER 340
 has widened the scope of without prejudice communications to include not only those documents which are marked `without prejudice` but also those which form part of the negotiation.
 63.Transposed to the plea negotiating arena, insofar as the prosecution and the accused person are in their own ways benefitting from the broad settlement policy, the representations carry a privilege analogous to `without prejudice` communication. However, I am uneasy with the risk that such a ruling may be misinterpreted as introducing the `without prejudice` rule to criminal proceedings, and not restricted to representations made in the course of plea negotiations. Some clarification must now be made.
 64.The Canadian rulings in 
 Larocque 
 and 
 Pabani 
 discussed above do not introduce a `without prejudice` rule into criminal law. At p 665 of the 
 Pabani 
 judgment, Finlayson JA observed that there was no such recognition by the criminal law of `without prejudice` statements outside of the plea bargaining structure. The privilege is only analogous to the `without prejudice` rule in civil proceedings and it only applies to statements made in the context of plea negotiations.
 65.The District Judge referred to 
Re Ramsay
 
[1870] LR 3 PC 427
 as an instance where the courts excluded statements which were made `without prejudice` in a quasi-criminal case. In that case, a State Attorney-General was required by a judge to show cause why he should not be committed for contempt of court. In the interim, the Attorney General obliged the judge`s request to furnish a written apology and retraction. After obtaining the written apology and retraction, the judge used the documents as an admission of the Attorney General`s authorship of the offending comments and held him guilty of contempt. This happened in spite of the tacit understanding that the contempt proceedings would be withdrawn. The Privy Council held that there was no reason not to treat the case as if the apology had been made `without prejudice`. I am of the opinion that this decision is not relevant to the special case at bar. The judge`s action in this case was clearly an abuse of process. It was with a view toward correcting such unconscionable conduct that the Privy Council made this finding. Indeed, in the century following its making, this decision has failed to establish any general precedent that `without prejudice` communications are not admissible in evidence in the substantive criminal trial. The ruling in this case stated does not change this position.
 66.
 How long does the privilege attach?
The privilege of confidentiality attaches to the representation and can only be lifted after the determination of criminal culpability or after the negotiated plea has been made. It is because of the nature of these representations and the conditions under which they were given that a privilege of confidentiality attaches to them until it no longer becomes harmful that their content be disclosed. For example, in civil suits, offers to settle made pursuant to O 22A provide a strong costs incentive for the parties to consider settlement. It is deemed an offer of compromise made without prejudice save as to costs. The fact that an offer to settle has been made and the content of the offer shall not be communicated to the court until all questions of liability and the relief to be granted (other than costs) have been determined.
 67.Another example is found in that of legal professional privilege. In the United Kingdom, the impending introduction of a wasted costs order against a solicitor found guilty of negligent conduct includes a provision that enabled the court to order disclosure of documents previously cloaked with legal professional privilege: r 48.6(3), UK Civil Procedure Rules. However, the lifting of this privilege only occurs after determination of liability between the parties (including the negligent solicitor`s client). The privilege remains intact while the substantive issues of liability, or, in this case, criminal culpability, remain outstanding.
 68.
 Concluding observations 
 
I find it necessary to respond to a recurring argument in the submissions. The prosecution has continually emphasised its role as the `guardian of public policy and interest`. It went further to aver that `as the court is not involved in plea bargaining, it may not be appropriate for it to determine for the Public Prosecutor what public policy requires should a plea discussion fail.` It went on to observe that, in any case, Parliament has not thought it fit to legislate and prescribe the conditions applicable to plea bargaining.
 69.This last observation is true. Article 58 of the Singapore Constitution vests Parliament with a law making function. In the absence of Parliament passing any express statutory framework concerning plea negotiations, it is for the courts to determine the position in law. Under Montesquieu`s classification, both the legislature (Parliament) and the judiciary hold positions as branches of government. The third branch is the executive. What then is the position of the Attorney General`s Chambers? Article 35(8) of the Singapore Constitution vests the Attorney General with the discretion to `institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for an offence.`
 70.As a branch of government, the judiciary has the decision making power to affect whatever concerns the administration of justice. This is circumscribed only to the extent that art 35(8) vests prosecutorial discretion in the AGC. In fact, the revision below which questioned the exercise of the AGC`s discretion in prosecuting the accused despite a purported letter promising immunity from future prosecution, confirmed the almost inviolable discretion of the AGC to prosecute. However, the judiciary has a wider responsibility in the administration of justice that involves decision-making following a system of evidential rules to bring about justice to each case. The purpose of making this observation is this. The branches of government bear the responsibility of making policy decisions, including the policy upheld by this case stated: that a broad policy of consensual case disposal applies to the discrete regime of plea negotiations.
 71.In the final analysis, the policy stated is a result of the courts` exercise of their judicial powers as vested in them by the Constitution. It was found that the process of plea negotiations brings immeasurable benefit to the criminal justice system. In order for such a process to be effective, the confidentiality of representations made during plea negotiations must be protected. If such a policy is undesirable, it would be for the legislature to change it. The scope of representations considered in this case is wide-ranging. It must be borne in mind that this includes representations made not just to the AGC`s representative in the Subordinate Courts, but also to representations made to the average Singaporean`s representative in Parliament during Meet the People Sessions. Having examined this question of law in considerable detail, my view is that there can be no simplistic transposition of rules meant for the treatment of admissible evidence in the substantive criminal trial. Rather, any evidential framework would require a careful, studied approach toward achieving a viable system of regulating plea negotiations in Singapore.
 72.
 Conclusion 
 
Whereas the privilege expressly recognised in s 23 is solely for the disposal of disputes between parties, the privilege covering representations made in plea negotiations has the additional purpose of maintaining public confidence in the administration of criminal justice by ensuring that representations can be made without prejudice to the accused. Hence, no express agreement is necessary in order to attract privilege. The extension of the `without prejudice` rule is limited to representations made in plea negotiations. No such privilege disturbs the existing common law and statutory provisions concerning admissibility of statements as admissions under the Evidence Act or statements such as those secured pursuant to s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Accordingly, representations made in plea negotiations may not be used for the purposes raised in the case stated. The question is answered in the negative.",1999-04-15 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 The charge 
 1.The appellant was charged under s 340(5) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed) (`the Act`) in that between 5 February 1993 and 2 April 1993, he was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business of Hong Siong Motor Credit Trading Pte Ltd (`Hong Siong`) with the intent to defraud one of Hong Siong`s creditors, namely, Chuan Petroleum Pte Ltd (`Chuan Petroleum`), whereby Hong Siong placed four orders with Chuan Petroleum for the delivery of marine gas oil and marine fuel oil, thereby incurring a debt of $643,153.93 (of which $428,233.14 still remains outstanding), which Hong Siong had no intention of repaying at the time the debt was incurred.
 2.The appellant was initially jointly tried with a co-accused, one Fong Chiong Kong (`Fong`) on one charge under s 340(5) of the Act. Fong subsequently pleaded guilty in a separate court to two amended charges, namely, (i) using, while being an officer of Hong Siong, deceitful or fraudulent or dishonest means to induce Chuan Petroleum to give credit to Hong Siong in contravention of s 406(a) of the Act; and (ii) failing, while being a director of Hong Siong, to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office in contravention of s 157(1) of the Act. Fong was fined $15,000 and $5,000 on the two amended charges respectively. The present trial thereafter proceeded against the appellant solely on the above charge.
 3.At the end of the trial, the trial judge found the appellant guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly. The appellant was fined $ 15,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs agreed at $17,000 and a compensation sum fixed at $150,000. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. After hearing submissions from counsel for the appellant and the DPP, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 4.
 The prosecution case 
 
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was mainly as follows. On 24 September 1993, Hong Siong went into liquidation under a compulsory winding up action. The directors of Hong Siong were one Ng Kim Thye (`Ng`) and one Ong Chin Ong (`Ong`). The registered principal activities of Hong Siong at all material times were those of motor vehicles and motor finance. It was undisputed that prior to its liquidation, Hong Siong had between 5 February 1993 and 9 March 1993 entered into four contracts to purchase consignments of marine oil from Chuan Petroleum. Upon taking delivery from Chuan Petroleum, Hong Siong had then resold the oil to other parties. The oil purchased under the first three contracts with Chuan Petroleum were resold by Hong Siong to Global Energy (Asia) Pte Ltd (`Global Energy`) while the oil under the fourth contract was resold to South Eastern Oil. The re-sale of the oil consignments all took place at a loss to Hong Siong, with the total loss suffered by Hong Siong in respect of the four transactions being $42,166.51. It was further undisputed that Hong Siong was fully paid by the end buyers (viz Global Energy and South Eastern Oil) in respect of the re-sale transactions. On the other hand, except for the first contract, Hong Siong did not pay Chuan Petroleum fully for the remaining contracts. The total sum owing from Hong Siong to Chuan Petroleum stood at $428,233.14.
 5.The prosecution`s case was that the business of Hong Siong was carried on fraudulently with the intent to defraud a creditor of Hong Siong, namely, Chuan Petroleum, and that the appellant was knowingly a party to such a business. In the early stages of the trial, counsel for the defence had conceded that the transactions between Hong Siong and Chuan Petroleum were carried out by Hong Siong fraudulently with the intent to defraud Chuan Petroleum, hence dispensing with any requirement for formal proof. The issue at trial was thus narrowed to whether the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions of Hong Siong.
 6.The prosecution contended that the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions involving the purchase by Hong Siong of oil from Chuan Petroleum. The prosecution`s principal witness was Fong. Fong testified that Hong Siong started dealing in oil after one James Tay introduced it to Ng and him. He said that as Ng lacked the necessary capital, the appellant was approached. Fong testified that at a meeting in early 1993 involving the appellant, Fong, Ng and Ong, it was agreed that Hong Siong would buy marine oil from Chuan Petroleum. The oil would then be sold to the appellant`s contacts and the resultant proceeds would be divided amongst the 4 parties. It was agreed that Ng and the appellant would each take 40% of the commission arising from the oil transaction while Ong and Fong would get 20% and 3% respectively. It was further agreed that the appellant would be responsible for coming up with the upfront money for the purchases, on the condition that he would get 10% interest on whatever amount he forked out. It was agreed that the appellant would be paid the money he put upfront, regardless of whether there was any profit.
 7.Fong testified that pursuant to the scheme, the appellant paid the $50,000 deposits due to Chuan Petroleum under the first and second contracts. The appellant also paid the balance sum of $100,000 due to Chuan Petroleum under the first contract. Fong said that the appellant and one Zainal Abideen (`Zainal`) were the ones who collected the proceeds from Global Energy after each re-sale. Fong further testified that there was one occasion on which he went down to DBS World Trade Centre (`WTC`) to meet the appellant, Ng and Zainal, expecting to be paid some commission, when a quarrel broke out between Ng and the appellant, resulting in a near fight between the two. He was informed by Zainal that the quarrel was over a sum of $30,000 which Ng claimed was due to him from the appellant. Fong further testified that, on another occasion when he went with the appellant, Ong and Zainal to DBS Parkway Parade to withdraw some money from Hong Siong`s account, a sum of $209,000 was withdrawn and handed to the appellant.
 8.The prosecution also relied on the evidence of Zainal Abideen (`Zainal`). Zainal worked as a general manager for Hong Siong from January to April 1993. He testified that Fong and the appellant alone handled the oil transactions with Chuan Petroleum. He said that the appellant once brought him to Global Energy`s office to introduce him to the staff of the company. On that occasion, he was asked to bring along a receipt book to authenticate his identity as representative of Hong Siong. He was given a cash cheque at Global Energy, which he later encashed and a sum of $70,000 was eventually paid into the appellant`s wife`s bank account. He also remembered another occasion when the appellant accompanied him to a bank to withdraw money. Over $50,000 was withdrawn and given to the appellant. On that occasion, a misunderstanding developed between the appellant and Ng which almost led to a fight between the two. Zainal further testified that the appellant had on another occasion provided him with the sum of $104,920.79 which he then handed to Vanessa Low of Chuan Petroleum. On that occasion, the appellant had travelled all the way to Lavender Street, near Chuan Petroleum, to pass the money to him.
 9.Apart from the testimonies of the above witnesses which showed the appellant`s direct connection with the fraudulent transactions, the prosecution also relied on various circumstantial evidence which they claimed proved the appellant`s involvement in the fraudulent schemes. Firstly, it was undisputed that Hong Siong had on 23 March 1993 paid Chuan Petroleum $104,920.79 by way of a cash cheque in settlement of the balance sum due under the first oil contract. The prosecution pointed out that it was no mere coincidence that, on the very same day, the appellant encashed his own cheque for the sum of $100,000 from his own account. The inference which the prosecution sought to draw was that the payment of the $104,920.79 was financed by the appellant, consistent with Fong`s testimony that the appellant was responsible for coming up with the capital for the purchases from Chuan Petroleum.
 10.The prosecution also pointed out that the appellant`s signature appeared on a payment voucher of Global Energy dated 15 March 1993. Indeed, the appellant admitted to collecting a DBS cheque in the sum of $50,374.69 from Global Energy on Hong Siong`s behalf, and to signing the payment voucher. This, the prosecution submitted, again showed that the appellant was involved in the oil transactions.
 11.The prosecution also alluded to the various payments made by Hong Siong to the appellant. First, there was the issuance of a cheque of $22,000 by Hong Siong to a courier of the appellant whom the appellant admitted he had sent to Hong Siong to collect payment. It was undisputed that this cheque was encashed by the courier and $18,000 was deposited into a DBS AutoSave account jointly held by the appellant and his wife. Further, on 6 March 1993, Global Energy paid Hong Siong a sum of $72,778.92, being payment of the balance sum owing under the second re-sale contract between Hong Siong and Global Energy. Statements of the appellant`s joint account with his wife showed that on the same day $67,000 was deposited into the joint account. The prosecution`s case was that such payments substantiated their contention that the appellant had been actively involved in Hong Siong`s scheme to defraud Chuan Petroleum and that the above sums received by the appellant represented his share of the profits from the scheme.
 12.
 The defence 
 
The appellant`s defence was a complete denial of any knowledge of the oil transactions between Chuan Petroleum and Hong Siong on one hand and Hong Siong and Global Energy and South Eastern Oil on the other. He claimed that his only dealings with Hong Siong involved two unsuccessful attempts to purchase a white second-hand Mercedes Benz car (`the car`) from Hong Siong. He said that the first attempt at purchasing the car occurred in November 1992. He negotiated the purchase of the car with Fong and Ng. The purchase price was purportedly agreed at $168,000, before a 20% discount which Hong Siong had agreed to grant him. He claimed that on 8 December 1992, he took possession of the car, after trading his old Toyota to Hong Siong for $54,000 and after paying Hong Siong a bank-draft for $68,000. It was agreed that the balance sum would be paid upon transfer of the title to the car. Taking into account the trade-in- value of his old Toyota, he had therefore effectively paid Hong Siong $122,000. The appellant produced at trial various receipts issued by Hong Siong evidencing the purported sale. However, Hong Siong failed to transfer the title to the car. Ng then informed him that he had decided not to proceed with the sale. He was very angry and made many attempts to recover the $122,000 that he had already paid to Hong Siong. After much difficulty and effort on his part the $122,000 was refunded to him by installments comprising payments of $11,300, $21,700, $18,000 and $67,000, leaving an unpaid sum of $4,000. He tried on several occasions to recover the remaining $4,000 from Ng and once even had a quarrel with Ng at the World Trade Centre over this. Zainal was present on that occasion and had to separate them to prevent them coming to blows. According to the appellant, therefore, the payments of $18,000 and $67,000, which the prosecution had earlier shown to have been paid into his joint account with his wife, were purported to be refunds made by Hong Siong to him in connection with the car transaction that fell through. He also explained the quarrel at WTC between him and Ng, which Zainal and Fong witnessed, as being an instance when he tried to recover the $4,000 still owing to him by Ng.
 13.As for the $100,000 which he admitted to have paid to Hong Siong on 23 March 1993, the appellant sought to explain it thus. He said that, shortly after he recovered the $118,000 from Hong Siong by way of installments, Fong called him and informed him that Ng had problems with his finance company and persuaded him to consider buying the same car again. He agreed to Fong`s proposals after being persuaded by Ong and Fong to trust Ng. Pursuant to the second agreement to buy the car, he claimed that on 23 March 1993, he met Fong and Zainal at Balestier Road, the meeting place designated by Fong, where he handed them $100,000 in payment of the sale price of the car. He adduced a receipt issued by Hong Siong evidencing the second purported sale of the car. It was agreed that the car would be transferred to his name in two day`s time. He claimed that the second transaction to purchase Ng`s car similarly fell through when Ng once again failed to keep his promise to transfer the ownership of the car. He had then threatened to report the matter to the police unless he was refunded the sum of $104,000 (the $4,000 being part of the $122,000 still owing). Ng then refunded him the sum of $100,000 on 3 April 1993 at Kentucky Fried Chicken, at the National Stadium, and on 4 May 1993, the remaining sum of $4,000 was also repaid by Ng.
 14.
 The trial judge`s decision 
 
The ingredients of the charge which the prosecution had to prove were summed up in 
Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 447
  at [para ] 35 as follows: 
For fraudulent trading offences, the prosecution needed only prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, two elements: first, that the business of the company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors or with a fraudulent purpose and, second, that the accused was knowingly a party to the carrying on of that business with such intent and purpose
 As it was undisputed that the four transactions between Hong Siong and Chuan Petroleum were fraudulent with the intent to deceive creditors, namely, Chuan Petroleum, the inquiry in the court below was confined to whether the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions.
 15.The trial judge was of the view that the appellant`s account of the transactions between him and Hong Siong, and the documents produced by him in support thereof, were unsatisfactory and cast serious doubts on him as a witness of truth. The trial judge first noted that the appellant had maintained throughout that Ng gave him a 20% discount off the purchase price of the car which worked out to a sum of $33,600. This sum was however reflected in Hong Siong`s letter to him dated 8 December 1992 as `cash deposit` and was further reflected in the payment voucher issued by Hong Siong as `repayment of a friendly loan`. The documents adduced by him were thus inconsistent with his version of the car transaction in which the sum of $33,600 was said to be a discount. The trial judge further noted that the appellant was unable to explain why an official receipt 007 dated 8 December 1992 for $68,000 was issued to him by Hong Siong when the sum was already included in another official receipt 3100 issued by Hong Siong on the same day. The trial judge concluded that the documents tendered by him could not support his account of the transactions between him and Hong Siong and that this was because his version was patently distorted or not the truth.
 16.The trial judge was further of the view that the four installment sums of $11,300, $21,700, $18,000 and $67,000, paid to the appellant purportedly as a refund of the $122,000 earlier paid by the appellant to Hong Siong, were downright suspicious. He was of the view that the first two sums looked strange for installment payments. What he thought was most curious was the appellant`s testimony that Hong Siong did not require him to issue any acknowledgement for each of the sums refunded, notwithstanding the uneasy relationship between him and Ng at the time the refunds were made. The trial judge also felt that the payment of $18,000 was dubious. The appellant had earlier agreed that the $18,000 came from a cheque issued by Hong Siong dated 4 March 1992 which was for $22,000. The appellant`s testimony was that his courier, who collected the cheque from Hong Siong on his behalf, was asked by Hong Siong to encash the $22,000 cheque and to pay $4,000 to Zainal, with the remaining $18,000 going to the appellant. The trial judge found it odd that Hong Siong should give the courier a cheque for $22,000 when they intended only to pay the appellant $ 18,000. If the appellant was truly not involved in the scheme with Ng, Ong, Fong and Zainal and was only a customer of Hong Siong, the logical thing for Hong Siong to have done, if it had truly wanted to refund the appellant $18,000, was to have issued the appellant a cheque for the exact amount of $18,000, thereby keeping the payments to the appellant and Zainal separate.
 17.On the whole, the trial judge was of the view that the appellant`s account of the car transaction and the monetary movements involved were riddled with lies and inconsistencies and were really no more than a shabby afterthought made up to cover the tracks of his involvement in Hong Siong`s illicit oil transactions with Chuan Petroleum. The trial judge found it noteworthy that the defence never cross-examined Fong on much of the details of the car transactions.
 18.On the other hand, the trial judge found the evidence of the prosecution witnesses - Fong and Zainal - fairly consistent. He was of the view that Zainal was a candid and truthful witness. As for Fong, the trial judge expressly acknowledged the fact that Fong was an accomplice. However, having perused Fong`s evidence carefully, he was of the view that Fong was really a reluctant prosecution witness. While an accomplice is an interested party and may have reasons to implicate an accused person in order to shift the blame from himself, the trial judge was of the view that Fong did not intend the worse for the appellant. The trial judge concluded that he had no reasons to suspect that Fong was not a reliable witness.
 19.The trial judge also referred to the evidence of one Thomas Ong, who was another prosecution witnesses. Thomas Ong was the managing director of Chuan Petroleum at the material time. Thomas Ong had testified at trial that, at about the beginning of 1994, he confronted Fong for the outstanding payments due from Hong Siong to Chuan Petroleum. Fong told him that he was unable to pay and that Thomas Ong should look to the masterminds of the four oil transactions, namely Ng and the appellant, for payment. Until that time, Thomas Ong had never liaised directly with the appellant. He testified that, when he followed Fong`s advice and looked up the appellant, the appellant kept maintaining that he had no knowledge of Hong Siong nor the identities of Zainal, Fong or Ng. The trial judge was of the view that Thomas Ong had no reason to concoct this account of the events. The trial judge found it curious that the appellant should want to lie about his acquaintance with Zainal, Fong or Ng. The inference that the trial judge drew from the appellant`s lie was that he denied association with these persons only because he was involved in the fraudulent transactions and was desperate to disassociate himself from Hong Siong and any of its officers.
 20.The trial judge was further of the view that on the facts of the case, there was other strong circumstantial evidence which pointed to the appellant`s involvement in the fraudulent transactions. Firstly, it was extremely coincidental that the appellant paid $100,000 to Hong Siong on 23 March 1993, the very same day on which Hong Siong settled the bill of $104,920.79 to Chuan Petroleum. Secondly, it was significant that the appellant admitted to collecting a DBS cheque for $50,374.69 from Global Energy, allegedly on Hong Siong`s behalf. The payment represented the proceeds of the sale of oil from Hong Siong to Global Energy and the fact that the appellant had collected it for Hong Siong showed that the appellant was more than just a creditor of Hong Siong. Thirdly, the fact that a substantial part of the sale proceeds from Global Energy went into the appellant`s account on the very days on which they were paid to Hong Siong did not fit into the picture of Hong Siong being a reluctant and difficult debtor of the appellant, contrary to the appellant`s testimony. Fourthly, the appellant`s willingness to part with $100,000, and the trouble he took to bring the money to a place outside Hong Siong`s office indicated by Fong, again suggested that the appellant was more than a creditor of Hong Siong.
 21.In light of all the above, the trial judge concluded that the prosecution had proven the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge accordingly found the appellant guilty and convicted him of the charge.
 22.
 Issues arising on appeal 
 
The concession made in the court below that the oil transactions were fraudulently entered into by Hong Siong was not disturbed on appeal. The only issue arising on appeal centered around the second element in Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah`s case, namely, whether the trial judge erred in finding that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was (i) knowingly and (ii) a party to the carrying on of the business of Hong Siong with intent to defraud a creditor, namely, Chuan Petroleum.
 23.
 Appeal against findings of fact 
 
The questions of whether the appellant had knowledge of the fraudulent transactions undertaken by Hong Siong, and whether he was indeed a party to such transactions, both raised issues of fact. In appealing against the trial judge`s decision on these two issues, the appellant was in effect appealing against the trial judge`s findings of fact. The principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing a trial judge`s findings of fact are well settled. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719: 
 An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence.
 In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor. [Emphasis added.]
 This principle has been endorsed repeatedly in numerous local High Court and Court of Appeal decisions : see for eg 
Soh Yang Tick v PP
 [1998] 2 SLR 43 , 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 , 
Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 656
 , 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
  and 
Lee Tiaw Chwee v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 563
 .
 24.It is thus clear that a trial judge`s findings of fact will only be overturned by the appellate court if they are clearly wrong. In 
PP v Azman bin Abdullah
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 704
  at [para ] 21, I made the following observations: 
It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge`s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong: see 
PP v Poh Oh Sim
 
[1990] SLR 1047
 . [Emphasis added.]
 And in 
Syed Jafaralsadeg bin Abdul Kadir v PP
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 788
 , I said [at [para ] 57]: 
I would not wish to add more to the statements of law laid out above except to reiterate that there is an extremely heavy burden cast onto the appellant to displace the trial judge`s findings of fact. The trial judge`s findings will not be overturned unless it can be shown that the trial judge was horribly wrong in drawing his conclusions.
 25.Where the trial judge`s finding of fact is based on his assessment of the witnesses` veracity and credibility, the appellate court will be even more reluctant to overturn his findings. As I observed in 
 Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP 
: 
It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing the trial judge`s findings of fact. It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, 
 especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses
, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence ...
 
Similarly, 
 in the case of Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour
. The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different approach will be taken. In such cases, it is again trite law that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. [Emphasis added.]
 With these observations in mind, I turn to the appeal proper.
 26.
 Knowingly 
 
The appellant`s counsel submitted that actual knowledge was required before a person could be said to be knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions carried out by a company within the meaning of s 340 of the Companies Act. Counsel cited the case of 
Rossleigh Ltd v Carlaw and Carlaw
 
[1985] 1 BCC 99
,537.
 27.Such a proposition is, in my view, not in doubt. I did not agree, however, with counsel for the appellant`s submission that, on the facts of our case, the appellant had no knowledge of the fraudulent oil transactions carried out by Hong Siong. In his Skeletal Arguments, counsel for the appellant gave a number of reasons in support of his submission. They could be summarized as follows: (a). The appellant was never involved at any time in the management of Hong Siong;
 (b). There was no evidence that the appellant was personally involved in the oil transactions between Hong Siong and Chuan Petroleum;
 (c). All Zainal said about the appellant`s involvement in the oil transactions was that the appellant introduced Royce Choo (the Operations Manager of Global Energy) to him;
 (d). Royce Choo indicated that, in the oil transactions, he dealt only with Zainal or Fong.
 28.In my view, reason (a) was clearly misconceived. Quite clearly, the appellant need not be involved in the day to day operations and management of Hong Siong in order to have knowledge of the illicit oil transactions. Indeed, the evidence of Zainal, Royce Choo and Fong all pointed to the appellant`s knowledge and involvement in the oil transactions even though he could not be said to be involved in the management of Hong Siong. Zainal for instance explicitly stated that all the oil transactions were arranged by the appellant and Fong. Royce Choo, the Operations Manager of Global Energy, also testified that the appellant was the person who introduced him to Fong. Most pertinently of all, Fong testified that the appellant was present at a meting in early 93 when the idea of Hong Siong entering into the oil transactions was conceived. It was for this reason that reason (b) cited by counsel for the appellant was similarly misconceived. Counsel`s contention under reason (c) that all Zainal said about the appellant`s involvement in the oil transactions was that the appellant introduced Royce Choo to him was also, in my view, misleading. The truth was that Zainal also said during examination-in-chief that the appellant and Fong were the parties who arranged the oil transactions. As for reason (d), counsel had evidently quoted Royce Choo`s testimony out of context. It was true that Royce Choo had, in one part of his s 371 CPC statement, stated that he only liaised with two persons, namely Zainal and Fong, on the oil transactions. However, at para 2 of the same statement, Royce Choo also stated that it was through the appellant that he got to know Fong. And at para 14, he further stated, that on the occasion on which he met Fong for the first time, which occurred either at the time the contract with Hong Siong was delivered to him for signing or at the time Fong came to collect a cheque from him, the appellant was with Fong. Reading Royce Choo`s evidence in its totality, it clearly suggested that the appellant was involved in the oil transactions between Hong Siong and Global Energy and had clear knowledge of the same.
 29.Implicit in the trial judge`s verdict in the court below, that the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent oil transactions, was a finding of fact that the appellant knew of the fraudulent transactions. The present arguments raised by counsel for the appellant were therefore really an invitation to this court to overturn the particular finding of fact made by the trial judge. I noted above that there was direct evidence in the form of Zainal and Fong`s testimony which suggested that the appellant indeed knew of the fraudulent transaction. The trial judge had the opportunity to observe Zainal and Fong`s demeanour and had assessed them to be truthful and reliable witnesses. As such, I was unable to conclude that the trial judge`s finding that the appellant had knowledge of the fraudulent transaction was reached against the weight of evidence. The finding of fact by the trial judge that the appellant had knowledge of the oil transactions should therefore not be disturbed.
 
 Party to the fraudulent transactions 
 
 30.
 The law
A person must participate, concur or take some positive steps before he can be a party to the fraudulent transaction. In 
Re Maidstone Buildings Provisions Ltd
 
[1971] 3 All ER 363
, Pennycuick V-C said: 
The expression `party to the carrying on of a business` is not, I think, a very familiar one but, so far as I can see, the expression `party to` must on its natural meaning indicate no more than `participates in`, `takes part in` or `concurs in`. And that, it seems to me, involves some positive steps of some nature. I do not think it can be said that someone is party to carrying on a business if he takes no positive steps at all. So in order to bring a person within the section one must show that he is taking some positive steps in the carrying on of the company`s business in a fraudulent manner.
 31.In the course of his submissions, counsel for the appellant cited the case of 
R v Miles
 
[1992] Crim LR 657
 which appeared to propound a higher test requiring proof of the assumption of a controlling or managerial role over the business of the company before a person can be said to be a party to the carrying on of it (`the 
 Miles 
 test`). In 
 R v Miles 
, the appellant was convicted of fraudulent trading contrary to s 458 of the Companies Act 1985 (UK) which is similar to s 340 of our Companies Act. The prosecution`s case was that the appellant had, together with his co-defendants, used the company, Financial Management Services Limited, for the purpose of selling wholly worthless shares in a non-existent enterprise. At trial, as in the present case, it was conceded that there was fraud on the part of the company. The issues therefore were (i) whether the appellant was a party to the carrying on of the business of the company or merely a salesman being instructed by others and (ii) whether the appellant was aware that the shares were worthless. The trial judge convicted the appellant. On appeal, the appellant`s principal arguments were that (i) on the proper construction of the words of the statute, some controlling or managerial function was required to bring a defendant within s 458 of the Companies Act 1985 (UK) and that the jury was never so directed and (ii) the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the meaning of `party to the carrying on of the business of the company` when he directed them that the phrase included `concurring in the trade which is involved in the business of the company`. The English Court of Appeal allowed the appellant`s appeal. In doing so, the court observed: 
[s 340] is designed to include those who exercise a controlling or managerial function or who are `running the business` to use the words of Lord Lane CJ in 
Grantham
 
[1984] 79 Cr App R 86
 at 91 ...
 If the 
 Miles 
 test was applied to our facts, then the appellant was arguably not a party to the carrying on of Hong Siong`s business since he did not assume any controlling role over the Company.
 32.Having perused the decision carefully, I was of the view that the 
 Miles 
 test should not be treated as being of universal application. The dictum in the 
 Miles 
 case, in my view, only stated the general principle that a mere officer of the company should not, without more, be regarded as a party to the company`s fraudulent transactions so as to be potentially liable under s 340(5) of the Act for the company`s misdeeds. The case does not stand for the converse, namely, that a person is only a party to the company`s misdeeds when he assumes a controlling or managerial role in the company. If the 
 Miles 
 test is treated as being of universal application, the result will be that only officers of a company (in fact only the senior officers) can ever be liable for the company`s fraudulent transactions under s 340(5) of the Act. This clearly is not the legislative intent behind s 340(5) of the Act which was drafted to cover `every person` and not just `officers` of the company. Section 340(5) is, on a literal construction, wide enough to cover outsiders who seek to make illegal profits by conspiring with companies in their fraudulent schemes. The punishment of such outsiders is clearly within the mischief of s 340(5) and it would, in my view, be anomalous if an unnecessarily restrictive interpretation were placed on s 340(5) so as to exclude such offenders.
 33.Furthermore, I noted that the full judgment of 
 R v Miles 
 had never been reported. The only report of that case was in the form of a digest contained in the 
 Criminal Law Review 
. From the digest, it was clear that the 
 Miles 
 test never formed part of the ratio decidendi of the case. The appeal was in that case allowed principally on the basis that there was a misdirection on the trial judge`s part as to the meaning of `party to the carrying on of the business of the company`. The Court of Appeal held that the words used by the trial judge in the summing up, particularly the phrase `concurring in the trade which is involved in the business of the company`, was materially irregular as it might well have had the effect of broadening the scope of the offence charged in the minds of the jury. The conviction was thus held to be unsafe and set aside.
 34.Given all these considerations, I was unable to conclude that 
 R v Miles 
 should be read as having laid down a universal test to be applied in all cases. If it had done so, I should state that I was unable to follow it.
 35.
 Arguments against the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was party to the fraudulent transactions
At the trial below, the conclusion reached by the trial judge was that the appellant was a party to Hong Siong`s fraudulent schemes. The conclusion in itself entailed a finding of fact made by the trial judge. An appeal against such a conclusion would therefore be subject to the ordinary principles governing an appeal against a trial judge`s finding of fact detailed above. On appeal, counsel for the appellant raised a number of arguments to persuade this court to find that the trial judge erred when he made such a finding. I will address some of the salient arguments raised by counsel in turn.
 36.
 The existence of a dishonoured cheque for the sum of $104,920.79
Counsel for the appellant argued that a perusal of Hong Siong`s bank statements showed that on 20 Mar 93, a cheque for the sum of $104,920.79 was paid out by Hong Siong, apparently to Chuan Petroleum, in settlement of the balance sum due under the first oil contract. Counsel pointed out that this cheque was reflected in the statements as having been dishonoured. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the dishonouring of this cheque substantiated the appellant`s version of the events. He submitted that, had the appellant been involved in the scam as alleged, he would have advanced the sum of money to Hong Siong way in advance and Hong Siong consequently would not have issued a dishonoured cheque on 20 March 1993. In my view, the fact that Hong Siong had on 20 March 1993 issued a dishonoured cheque proved nothing. It did not conclusively show that the appellant was not involved in the scam since the dishonour of Hong Siong`s cheque could have been due to a host of other reasons, such as poor coordination between Hong Siong and the appellant, or a delay on the appellant`s part in forwarding the funds to Hong Siong. The fact of the dishonoured cheque did not, in my view, assist the appellant at all.
 37.
 The trial judge`s finding that the appellant had denied knowledge of Hong Siong and/or its officers
Counsel for the appellant next submitted that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had denied knowledge of Hong Siong and its officers. Counsel suggested that all the appellant had said when confronted by Thomas Ong was that `...I don`t really know Hong Siong well, in fact I only came to buy car from them...` and that the appellant did not in fact outrightly deny knowing the officers of Hong Siong. I found the foregoing argument by counsel very misleading. The above quote cited by counsel for the appellant was taken from the appellant`s examination in chief. Indeed, it was not surprising that the appellant should in his examination in chief refuse to admit that he ever denied knowing Hong Siong and its officers. But, as was apparent from the trial judge`s grounds of decision, when the trial judge made the finding that the appellant denied knowing Hong Siong or its officers, he was in fact relying on Thomas Ong`s testimony and not the appellant`s testimony. The trial judge had evidently preferred Thomas Ong`s testimony to that of the appellant, which he was perfectly entitled to. It was therefore misleading for counsel to suggest that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant denied all knowledge of Hong Siong or its officers by focussing solely on the appellant`s version of what he told Thomas Ong.
 38.
 The fact that the appellant met up with Thomas Ong
Counsel for the appellant next argued that the fact that the appellant agreed to meet Thomas Ong at the IMM Building also showed that he had nothing to do with the scam, for otherwise, the appellant would have avoided Thomas Ong like a plague. I found this argument wholly untenable. Indeed, it was in the appellant`s interest to meet up with Thomas Ong and deny his involvement in Hong Siong`s fraudulent transaction once and for all. It would do the appellant no good to deliberately avoid Thomas Ong since this would only fuel Thomas Ong`s suspicions that the appellant was involved in the scam. In any event, Thomas Ong had the appellant`s office address and would have located the appellant sooner or later. Therefore, the fact that the appellant had met up with Thomas Ong did not show that he had nothing to do with the scam. It would simply have been pointless for the appellant to have attempted to avoid Thomas Ong.
 39.
 The trial judge`s reliance on Fong`s testimony
Counsel for the appellant next contended that the trial judge erred in basing his finding of fact on Fong`s testimony, because Fong`s testimony could not be trusted. Counsel first contended that Fong`s testimony could not be believed because his testimony suggested that the commissions that the appellant, Ng, Ong and Fong were to get were 40%, 40%, 20% and 3% respectively. This, counsel noted, added up to 103%, which rendered Fong`s testimony on this point unbelievable. I found this argument to be without merit. The discrepancy, even if it existed, was a very minor one which did not go to any material fact. The material fact pertained to whether the four persons did in fact agree to enter into the fraudulent transaction. Whether their purported commissions added up to 100% or not was of little significance. In any event, I noted that Fong had described the manner in which the proceeds were to be distributed in very general terms. It was but a general agreement between the parties that they would get 40%, 40%, 20% and 3% respectively. Indeed a perusal of Fong`s testimony in the notes of evidence suggested that what Fong may indeed have meant was that his 3% would first be taken out of the proceeds first and the remainder would then be distributed amongst the other three parties in the proportion of 40%, 40%, 20%. So construed, there was in fact no inconsistency.
 40.Counsel next contended that Fong`s testimony about the alleged meeting in early 1993 in which the sharing of profits was discussed was not corroborated by any of the other prosecution witnesses and therefore should not have been believed. Counsel submitted that, in the absence of any corroboration, the court should disregard the evidence given by Fong, citing the case of 
Tang Kin Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 46
 . I found this argument to be wholly without merit. Reliance on 
 Tang Kin Seng 
`s case was misplaced as that case was dealing with reliance on the uncorroborated evidence of victims of sexual offences. On our facts, Fong was an accomplice. The law on the treatment of evidence of accomplices in Singapore is very well settled. The court may convict an accused person based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice (see for eg 
Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 713
 , 
Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP
 
 
[1998] 2 SLR 592
 ). The corroboration warning against an accomplice`s evidence is no longer mandatory in law: s 135 Evidence Act (Cap 97). All that the court is required to do is to treat the evidence of an accomplice with caution as the accomplice may, not must, be presumed to be unworthy of credit: s 116 illustration (b) Evidence Act, 
 Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP 
, 
 Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP 
. Thus, counsel`s submission that Fong`s testimony on the alleged meeting should be disregarded, simply because it was not corroborated by the other witnesses, was without substance. The trial judge had cautioned himself that Fong was an accomplice and had perused Fong`s evidence very carefully before relying on it. Having done so, he found Fong to be a reluctant prosecution witness whose testimony was entitled to be believed. It followed that there was nothing in law which would have prevented the trial judge from relying on any part of Fong`s testimony, whether or not the part was corroborated.
 41.Counsel then argued that the actual commission received by Fong in respect of the second and third transactions, being $4,336.73 and $2,875.02 respectively, were not reconcilable with his testimony that it was agreed at the alleged meeting in early 1993 that he would get a 3% commission. In my view, this argument had no substance. The 3% commission that Fong testified that he would get was but a rough estimate. It was clear that he did not mean to testify that the agreement between the parties contemplated that he should get exactly 3% of the sale proceeds, calculated down to the last dollar.
 42.Counsel further contended that Fong had testified that the appellant advanced the $50,000 deposits required under the first two oil contracts between Hong Siong and Chuan Petroleum. Counsel submitted that a perusal of Hong Siong`s bank statement however showed that the $50,000 deposits were in fact paid out of the sale proceeds paid by Global Energy to Hong Siong on 22 February 1993 and 3 March 1993 respectively. Having perused the bank statements carefully, I was unable to see how the bank statements conclusively supported counsel`s submission that Hong Siong paid the $50,000 deposits out of the sale proceeds received from Global Energy rather than from funds furnished by the appellant.
 43.Counsel then compared Zainal and Fong`s account of the occasion at DBS (WTC Branch) when the appellant and Ng almost fought. Counsel highlighted several discrepancies between Zainal and Fong`s details of that occasion. For instance, counsel pointed out that Zainal testified that, on that occasion, he and the appellant went to the bank to encash a cheque. Ng and Fong were there but they waited outside the bank. After the cheque was encashed, they met Fong and Ng. Fong, Ng and the appellant then discussed something, following which an argument broke out between Ng, Fong and the appellant, which almost led to a fight between Ng and the appellant. Zainal further testified that on that occasion, money was withdrawn. Fong, on the other hand, testified that it was only on arriving that he saw the appellant and Ng breaking into a quarrel, almost to the extent of coming to blows. Fong further testified that no money was withdrawn on that occasion. In my view, the discrepancies noted in no way rendered Fong`s, or for that matter Zainal`s, testimony unreliable. Firstly, the discrepancies all related to immaterial details. Secondly, the event happened some five years ago. That there should be inconsistencies in the different witnesses` recollection of a specific event that happened such a along time ago was fully understandable. As the High Court pointed out in 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
  at 579: 
 Adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection.
 It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly over and over again. [Emphasis added.]
 A fortiori, where the discrepancy arises between the testimonies of different witnesses, a greater amount of latitude should be shown by the court since different people have varying capacities in observing and remembering details, particularly when the variance related to immaterial details. The point to note was that Fong and Zainal`s testimony of the event matched in material aspects. I therefore found no basis for concluding, based on the alleged discrepancies between Zainal and Fong`s testimonies, that Fong was an unreliable witness.
 44.
 Whether this court should overturn the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was a party to the fraudulent transactions 
 
For the reasons stated above, the arguments raised by counsel did not, in my view, show that the finding of fact made by the trial judge was reached against the weight of evidence or was otherwise obviously wrong. On the contrary, a consideration of the totality of the evidence showed that the trial judge`s finding of fact was well supported by the various evidence adduced before this court.
 45.
 Direct evidence in support of the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was a party to the fraudulent transactions 
 
Firstly, as already mentioned above, there was direct evidence in the form of Zainal and Fong`s testimonies which directly pointed to the appellant`s knowledge and involvement in the fraudulent transactions in question. The trial judge, who had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of these witnesses, had assessed them to be reliable and credible witnesses. The finding of fact made by the trial judge could be said to have hinged largely on his assessment of the credibility of these two witnesses and was thus not to be lightly overturned: 
 Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal 
, 
 Yap Gian Beng Terence v PP 
. I further found it significant that the evidence of Royce Choo (the Operations Manager of Global Energy), who was clearly not an interested party in the trial, also suggested that the appellant was involved in the oil transactions (see [para ] 28 above).
 46.
 Circumstantial evidence in support of the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was a party to the fraudulent transactions
Furthermore, there were various circumstantial evidence in this case which further supported the trial judge`s finding of fact. The circumstantial evidence as a whole pointed to the appellant`s involvement in the oil transactions and cast serious doubts on the appellant`s version of the events as involving no more than two unsuccessful car transactions negotiated between him and Hong Siong. The strong circumstantial evidence on our facts were, firstly, the unusual monetary movement on the appellant and Hong Siong`s part. It was extremely coincidental that on 23 March 1993, the appellant made payment of $100,000 cash to Hong Siong and Hong Siong on that very same day settled a bill of $104,920.79 with Chuan Petroleum in respect of the oil transactions. The coincidence in these two payments suggested that the $100,000 paid by the appellant to Hong Siong on 23 Mar 93 was really to finance Hong Siong`s settlement of $104,920.79 to Global Energy and not in payment of the car which the appellant had purportedly decided to re-purchase from Hong Siong. Additionally, Hong Siong`s purported refund to the appellant of the installment sums of $18,000 and $67,000 also occurred on the very day on which Hong Siong received proceeds of the re-sale of oil from Global Energy. This coincidence suggested that Hong Siong was really accounting to the appellant his share of the profits under the scheme when it made the payments of $18,000 and $67,000.
 47.Secondly, the appellant`s own admission that he collected the sum of $50,374.69 from Global Energy on Hong Siong`s behalf, for which he signed Global Energy`s payment voucher, also suggested that the appellant was more than just Hong Siong`s creditor, contrary to the appellant`s contentions. The same inference might also be drawn from the appellant`s testimony during cross examination that on 23 March 1993, when he paid Zainal and Fong $100,000 pursuant to the second car transaction, he took the trouble to encash his $100,000 cheque at the IMM Branch of DBS and then carried the money all the way to Balestier Road just to hand it to Fong and Zainal. If the appellant was truly only a customer of Hong Siong, he could well have paid Hong Siong a $100,000 cheque at Hong Siong` office or asked Hong Siong`s representatives to collect the cheque from his office. The appellant`s exceeding accommodation of Hong Siong`s requests as to the terms and location of payment of the $100,000 was inconsistent with the appellant`s assertion that he was merely a customer of Hong Siong. On the contrary, it supported Zainal`s testimony that the appellant handed him the sum of $100,000 for the purpose of settling Hong Siong`s debt to Chuan Petroleum under the oil transactions.
 48.Thirdly, the fact that Hong Siong paid the appellant the $18,000 installment by way of a $22,000 cash cheque, of which $4,000 was directed to be paid to Zainal, also suggested that the payments of $18,000 and $4,000 were in fact linked and that the appellant and Zainal were together involved in some scheme with Hong Siong. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for Hong Siong to issue a single cheque covering payments to both the appellant and Zainal. The logical course would have been for Hong Siong to pay the appellant by way of a $18,000 cheque, thereby keeping payments to the appellant and Zainal separate. The logical explanation as to why Hong Siong would want to pay the appellant and Zainal jointly by issuing a $22,000 cheque was that the $22,000 represented their respective commissions from the oil transactions which the appellant and Zainal were expected to apportion between themselves.
 49.Fourthly, it was significant that the appellant testified during trial that no written acknowledgements were ever required by Hong Siong each time the installment sums of $11,300, $21,700, $18,000 and $67,000 were refunded to him. This, in my view, rendered the appellant`s explanation that the sums of $11,300, $21,700, $18,000 and $67,000 were paid to him in purported refund of the sum of $122,000 improbable. A prudent commercial entity in the position of Hong Siong would naturally have wanted to have written proof that it had made the various refunds to the appellant, especially when the sum of $122,000 was repaid by installments over a period of time, thus rendering the keeping of proper records imperative for accountability purposes. Furthermore, given the uneasy relationship between the appellant and Hong Siong after the first aborted sale of the car, Hong Siong would have wanted written proof that the various sums had been received by the appellant. The fact that Hong Siong had methodically issued receipts in respect of payments 
 received from 
 the appellant also rendered it unlikely Hong Siong would not similarly have required written acknowledgements for sums 
 paid out 
 by it.
 50.Fifthly, the appellant`s explanation of the circumstances under which he parted with $100,000 to Hong Siong was also incredible. The appellant had explained that he had decided to enter into a second transaction to purchase Ng`s car because Hong Siong had kept the offer of a 20% discount open. Further, an 8-month wait was necessary had the appellant decided to purchase a new Mercedes car from the Cycle and Carriage company. Furthermore, at that time, car prices for second hand cars were rising. Besides, the appellant also explained that he trusted Fong who had helped him recover $118,000 paid under the first transaction. In my view, these explanations defied logic, especially when one considered the fact that the appellant had admitted to being angry with Ng when the first car transaction fell through. Even if the appellant needed a car urgently and was not willing to wait 8-9 months for a new Mercedes, he could well have gone to another second hand dealer. The appellant himself admitted that he only recovered $118,000 of the $122,000 paid over to the appellant after much difficulty. Indeed at the time the $100,000 was purportedly paid over to Hong Siong, Hong Siong still had not fully refunded the appellant his $122,000. A sum of $4,000 was in fact still owing. It was therefore incredible that shortly after recovering $118,000 from Hong Siong, he should be willing to part with $100,000 to Hong Siong once again. Indeed, of what good was a 20% discount when the appellant risked losing $100,000 to Hong Siong? I also noted that there was much animosity between Ng and the appellant immediately prior to the conclusion of the second car transaction. Evidence show that shortly before the second car transaction was purportedly entered into, Ng and the appellant almost came to blows. In my opinion, it was therefore incredible that the appellant could have negotiated a deal with Hong Siong to repurchase the earlier car, especially after Hong Siong had failed to honour its obligations under the first car transaction with appellant and had been extremely tardy in refunding him the sum of $122,000 which the appellant had paid to it pursuant to the first transaction. In my view, the alleged transaction to repurchase the car was more likely than not a story concocted by the appellant to explain the payment of $100,000 which the appellant had made to Hong Siong.
 51.Lastly, the appellant`s denial to Thomas Ong of having any knowledge of Hong Siong or its officers also cast serious doubts on the appellant`s explanation that the only dealings he had with Hong Siong involved the purchase of a car from Hong Siong. If the appellant had indeed been involved in two car transactions with Hong Siong, he would surely have known Fong and Ng. He ought therefore have been candid to Thomas Ong about knowing Hong Siong and Ng and Fong. The fact that he lied about knowing Ng and Fong suggested that he was involved in the oil transactions and was therefore desperate to disassociate himself from Hong Siong and its officers.
 52.It was also pertinent to note in this context that lies could in certain circumstances amount to corroboration when it indicated a consciousness of guilt. In 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
 , the Court of Appeal adopted the four criteria laid down by Lord Lane CJ in 
R v Lucas (Ruth)
 
[1981] QB 720
 which must be satisfied before a lie can amount to corroboration. Lord Lane CJ said in that case: 
To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.
 See also 
Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
  and 
Tan Pin Seng v PP
 
 
[1998] 1 SLR 418
 . On our facts, I was satisfied that the lies which the appellant told to Thomas Ong about not knowing Hong Siong and/or its officers was a deliberate attempt on his part to disassociate himself from Hong Siong and/or its officers, as well as to maintain ignorance of the fraudulent oil transactions. The lies related to the actual nature of the relationship between the appellant and Hong Siong, which was a material issue in this case. The lies were evidently motivated by the appellant`s realisation of guilt and fear of the truth. The appellant`s statement to Thomas Ong was further clearly shown to be a lie by the appellant`s own admission in court that he had dealings with Hong Siong, albeit in relation to two alleged car transactions. The four criteria laid down by Lord Lane in the 
 Lucas 
 case being satisfied, the lies told by the appellant to Thomas Ong could consequently be treated as corroborative evidence of the appellant`s guilt as well.
 53.
 Evidence in support of the appellant`s version of events
In light of the above, I was of the view that the trial judge`s finding of fact that the appellant was involved in the scam was consistent with the evidence adduced before him. The only pieces of evidence which supported the appellant`s version of the events were (i) the receipts issued by Hong Siong to the appellant which showed that the car transactions indeed took place, (ii) the evidence of one Loh Kok Lin who testified that the appellant had consulted him sometime in January 1993 on how to seek legal redress against a finance company which had failed to transfer to him a motor car which he had bought, and (iii) a police report lodged by the appellant on 16 August 1993 in which he complained about the first car transaction which fell through.
 54.
 The receipts
In my opinion, the receipts issued by Hong Siong were rightly given little weight by the trial judge. Given that it was conceded that the business of Hong Siong was carried out fraudulently with the intent to deceive Chuan Petroleum, if the appellant were truly a party to the fraudulent transaction, it would not have been difficult for the appellant to procure from his co-conspirators the various receipts so as to cover up his involvement in the scam.
 55.
 The police report
As for the police report, while it appeared to substantiate the appellant`s version of the events, upon further perusal, the appellant`s intentions in lodging the police report were indeed suspect. The police report was lodged on 16 August 1993. The unsuccessful first car transaction, the complaint of which formed the subject matter of the police report, occurred sometime in December 1992. The fact that the appellant had waited some eight months to lodge this police report raised suspicions as to his intentions in doing so. Furthermore the contents of the police report also did not support the appellant`s version of the events. In the report, the appellant stated that the balance `was unable to recover since May 1993`. However, in court, the appellant deposed that the sums Hong Siong owed him were fully recovered by 4 May 1993. The police report also curiously failed to mention the second car transaction which the appellant claimed was subsequently entered into between himself and Hong Siong. Indeed, it was noteworthy that the appellant made the police report after he was first questioned by the CAD in July 1993. In all, the impression one got from reading the police report was that the lodging of the report was yet another attempt on the appellant`s part to manufacture evidence to corroborate his case. However, as it turned out, the police report, instead of substantiating his defence, further exposed the falsehood in the story of the appellant.
 56.
 Loh Kok Lin`s statement
As for Loh Kok Lin`s statement, I was of the view that the trial judge rightly preferred the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses over Loh`s evidence since it was not unlikely that the appellant`s consultation with Loh was yet another attempt on his part to manufacture evidence so as to cover himself, should his illegal enterprise with Hong Siong be exposed.
 57.
 Conclusion 
 
On the whole, I found that the appellant had not shown that the finding of fact made by the trial judge was inconsistent with the weight of the evidence before the court or was otherwise plainly wrong. On the contrary, the trial judge`s conclusion appeared well-supported by the various direct and circumstantial evidence adduced before him. The appellant`s explanation of the transaction on the other hand was riddled with loopholes and inconsistencies. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the finding of fact made by the trial judge that the appellant was knowingly a party to the fraudulent transactions of Hong Siong should not be disturbed. I accordingly dismissed the appeal.",1999-05-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The facts 
 
The third appellant is the Workers` Party, a political party in Singapore. The first appellant, A Balakrishnan, is an insurance agent and a member of the Workers` Party. The second appellant, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam, is an advocate and solicitor and the Secretary General of the Workers` Party. The party publishes a bi-monthly newsletter called 
 The Hammer 
, which is sold to the public.
 3.The respondents were members of the organising committee for the 1995 Tamil Language Week (`the organising committee`). The first, third and fourth respondents are advocates and solicitors; the second respondent is a retired school principal; the fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth respondents are school teachers; and the seventh respondent is a computer operation officer.
 4.The 1995 Tamil Language Week was conceived in 1993 by 16 Tamil organisations with the aim of promoting the Tamil language and culture. Preparations for the event began in October 1993 and a co-ordinating committee was formed comprising members from 15 of the Tamil organisations under the chairmanship of the first respondent. Nine other Tamil organisations subsequently joined in, bringing the number of organisations involved to 25. As preparations for the event gained momentum, the 25 Tamil organisations appointed the organising committee to take charge of the preparations and execution of the event, including the solicitation of funds. In their public correspondence, the organising committee used letterheads printed for its use in connection with the 1995 Tamil Language Week. The names of the respondents were listed on the letterhead as members of the organising committee. The letterhead also listed the 25 Tamil organisations with a statement that the Tamil Language Week was organised by them. Sub-committees were formed by the organising committee to assist in various aspects of the organisation. Taking into account the organising committee and the sub-committees, there were nearly 430 persons involved in the preparations.
 5.In February 1995, the organising committee called a press conference to announce the 1995 Tamil Language Week, at which all the respondents were present. The press conference was covered by members of the press, radio and television corporations and was reported in 
 The New Paper 
, 
 The Straits Times 
, the 
 Tamil Murasu 
 and the 
 Tamil Nesan 
 and in the Tamil News on television and radio FM 96.8.
 6.8 April 1995 saw the official opening of the 1995 Tamil Language Week with the opening ceremony held at the Marina Mandarin Ballroom with about 700 guests in attendance. The event was carried live on radio and television. With that began a week of activities which included cultural shows, debates and seminars. As part of the activities, 5,000 copies of the 
 Thirukkural 
 were also distributed. The 
 Thirukkural 
 is a Tamil classical work of pithy sayings contained in 1,330 couplets composed by the Tamil poet Tiruvalluvar. In the 
 Thirukkural 
 distributed, there was a list of the 25 Tamil organisations as well as the members of the organising committee. The activities came to an end on 15 April 1995 with the closing ceremony held at the Mandarin Hotel attended by about 1,100 guests.
 7.On 28 May 1995 a `Thank You Dinner` was hosted by the organising committee for all volunteers who assisted in the organisation and running of the Tamil Language Week. The dinner was reported in 
 The Straits Times 
 and the 
 Tamil Murasu 
.
 8.In August 1995, there appeared an article in Tamil in the issue of 
 The Hammer 
 written by the first appellant about the 1995 Tamil Language Week, entitled `The Tamil Language Week - A Drama Enacted for Written Judgment` (`the article`).
 9.The respondents were of the view that certain passages in the article were defamatory of them and commenced an action on 26 December 1995 against the appellants claiming damages for defamation. They claimed against the first appellant as the author of the article, against the second appellant as the editor, and against the third appellant as the publisher.
 10.We now set out below an English translation of the article and for easy reference we number the paragraphs numerically as they appeared in the article, with the alleged defamatory words italicised (`the offending passages`): 
[1] 
 In the midst of a gathering of vultures determined to ensure that the number of intellectuals do not increase, we are proud to see the sacrificial white doves of 25 Tamil Organisations mingling in a national mainstream called the Tamil Langugage Week. 
 
[2] Having begun at the Marina Mandarin in April, it ended at the Orchard Mandarin with the slogan, `Let us speak sweet Tamil everyday`. It must not end with the pomp of the Tamil Language Week. 
 Although this Tamil Language Week is a drama enacted for written judgment by the government 
, it turned out to be a festival that shared the Tamilians` feelings. The Tamil language is a feeling inseparable from lives. There is a lot more services, works we need to do for Tamil. We wish to narrate the initial chapter for those who are elated that the Tamil Language Week has concluded in a manner to be proud of. 
[3] We respectfully request the honourable Tamils to see not only one side of the coin but the other as well. 
[4] 
 40 years have passed since Tamil received official recognition according to the Constitution in 1954. Despite that why have the 25 organisations remained tight-lipped and silent instead of proposing a resolution to question as to why Tamil has not been offered as a subject in the National University of Singapore. Is this your service to Tamil? You are cheating the Tamils living in Singapore generation after generation. Is this just? The Tamil Langugage Week you organised also resulted like what Bharathivar said `You are a warrior at words (no action).` Besides you gathering and dispersing, what have you achieved? 
Do you realise that by giving immigrants more respect, we are becoming a community without roots? 
[5] Ministers and Members of Parliament representing us, following western style, spoke more in English than in Tamil at the function. Should those who pave the way do thus? We are in a position to think about those who barbecue and eat their own conscience! 
[6] That there being no Tamil offered at the University, would the organisers know that the Ministry of Education has granted no approval whatsoever for Tamil teachers to study a degree course by post. Instead of saying `Speak Tamil`, we plead with you to help speak Tamil and help it grow. According to our latest information, the Tamil daily, Tamil Nesan, which has been printed in Malaysia since 1924, and sold here, has been restricted to a circulation of 2,000 copies only. 
[7] Many of us think that we are only 7% of the population. There is nothing wrong in seeking one`s rights. The mustard seed is small; but its effect is telling. The atom has the power even to destroy the world. Those who wonder whether it really can, please step aside. Those who say it can, surge forward. Besides Tamil Nadu, some 50 million Tamilians live in 42 countries of the world. Other than Tamil Nadu, Tamil is an official language only in Sri Lanka and Singapore. 
[8] Mr Shanmugam, Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC, who was part of a team visiting China and who returned to Singapore before his team did, participated in the Tamil Language Week`s closing ceremony and proudly claimed that he had hurried back for the said function at the expense of other functions for the sake of Tamil. In the beginning of this year we read in the newspapers that Mr Sinnakaruppan had been invited to the 8th World Tamil Language Conference and that he would be attending the said conference. But he made a statement that he did not attend the said conference. We know that no one attended it on behalf of the Government. That Tamil is an official language in this country is mere lip service. 
[9] 
 The organisers have told us that many fear that the Tamil language would die in the future. For that, there is no necessity for us to obtain the assurances of ministers who are in power today and who disappear tomorrow. We are creators of history for achievements! Let us realise and so act that so long as there is one Tamilian, Tamil will not die in Singapore. 
 
[10] 
 We learn that faces which have not been seen amongst Tamilians so far have, with an intention to seek political gain, taken on responsibilities in the Tamil Langugage Week. If that were true, we ask them not to prostitute nakedly and wander for position in the name of Tamil.

 Decision below 
 
The respondents complained that these underlined passages in the article were defamatory of them. The learned judge considered each of the passages `in the context of the article` and found that these were defamatory of the respondents. On the passage in para 1 (`first offending passage`) the learned judge held that the word `vultures` referred to the Singapore government and that the respondents of the organising committee were the `sacrificial white doves` of the 25 Tamil organisations. He construed this passage to mean that the respondents were `stooges` appointed by the 25 Tamil organisations to organise the Tamil Language Week to please the government.
 12.As for the passage in para 2 (`second offending passage`) the learned judge held that that passage identified the government as the party for whose approbation the Tamil Language Week was organised and staged.
 13.In respect of the passage in para 4 (`third offending passage`) the learned judge was of the view that the passage accused the 25 Tamil organisations of failing to champion the setting up of a Tamil studies department at the National University of Singapore and accused the members of the organising committee of being mere `warriors at words` who were insincerely paying lip service to the cause of the Tamil language.
 14.Turning to paras 9 and 10 of the article (`fourth offending passage`), the learned judge construed this passage to mean that the respondents were persons who had not been seen among the Tamilians and had taken on responsibilities of organising the Tamil Language Week in order to seek political gain, and were prostituting themselves for positions in the name of the Tamil language. In conclusion he held that the offending passages were defamatory of the respondents.
 15.The learned judge found that the respondents were the persons defamed by the offending passages. Upon appointment to the organising committee, the respondents went about raising funds and soliciting support. Their names appeared in the letterheads used by the organising committee in its correspondence. Their names also appeared in the 
 Thirukkural 
, 5,000 copies of which were distributed. The respondents were interviewed by the media to promote the public awareness of the Tamil Language Week and were visibly in the forefront of the activities. Based on these facts, the trial judge found that Tamil readers of the article would have identified the respondents as the persons referred to in the article.
 16.The appellants` defence of fair comment was rejected. The learned judge found that the offending passages were statements of fact except for the statement in the third offending passage `You are cheating the Tamils living in Singapore generation after generation`. This comment was, in the learned judge`s view, based on an incorrect statement of fact as there were two memoranda submitted to the authorities calling for the setting up of such a department at the National University of Singapore, one in 1981 and one in 1989. Furthermore, members of the organising committee had also met with some Members of Parliament to appeal for the setting up of a Tamil studies department.
 17.Using the damages awarded in

[1997] 1 SLR 648
 , and 
Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 337
  as a guide, the learned judge awarded against the first, second and third appellants jointly, $30,000 each to the first, third and fourth respondents in view of their public status as advocates and solicitors, and $25,000 each to the other respondents.
 18.
 The appeal 
 
Against the decision of the learned judge the appellants appealed. Five issues have been raised in this appeal, namely: (1) whether the words complained of were published of and concerning the respondents; (2) whether the words complained of were defamatory of them; (3) whether the defamatory words were a fair comment on a matter of public interest; (4) whether the second appellant was liable for the publication; and (5) whether the damages awarded were excessive.
 19.
 Identity 
 
The respondents complained that those passages in paras 1, 2, 4, 9 and 10 of the article which we have underlined were defamatory of them. But in none of these passages was any one of the respondents mentioned or referred to. Hence, the first question is whether these passages were published of and concerning the respondents. Mr Cashin argues that there these passages did not refer to the respondents or any of them and further the words `the organisers` were too vague and nebulous to be classified as a class to include the respondents. It was therefore difficult for any person on reading the article to identify the respondents as the persons referred to there.
 20.The question of identity was dealt with by the House of Lords in 
Knupffer v London Express Newspaper
 
[1944] AC 116
. In that case, a defamatory article appeared in a daily newspaper concerning a group called `Young Russia`. The plaintiff was an active member of the `Yong Russia` party and at one time was the head of the British branch of the party in England. He brought an action against the newspaper claiming that the article referred to him and defamed him. The judge at first instance held that the article referred to him and awarded him damages. On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the words could not be regarded as referring to the plaintiff. The plaintiff then appealed and the House of Lords dismissed the appeal. The observations of their Lordships are instructive. Viscount Simon LC said at pp 119-121: 
Where the plaintiff is not named, the test which decides whether the words used refer to him is the question whether the words are such as would reasonably lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to. There are cases in which the language used in reference to a limited class may be reasonably understood to refer to every member of the class, in which case every member may have a cause of action. A good example is 
 Browne v DC Thomson & Co
, where a newspaper article stated in Queenstown `instructions were issued by the Roman Catholic religious authorities that all Protestant shop assistants were to be discharged,` and where seven pursuers who averred that they were the sole persons who exercised religious authority in the name and on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church in Queenstown were held entitled to sue for libel as being individually defamed. Lord President Dunedin in that case said, at p 363:
 
`I think it is quite evident that if a certain set of people are accused of having done something, and if such accusation is libellous, it is possible for the individuals in that set of people to show that they have been damnified, and it is right that they should have an opportunity of recovering damages as individuals.`
 The words of Lord Atkin at pp 121-122 are also pertinent: 
The only relevant rule is that in order to be actionable the defamatory words must be understood to be published of and concerning the plaintiff. It is irrelevant that the words are published of two or more persons if they are proved to be published of him: and it is irrelevant that the two or more persons are called by some generic or class name. There can be no law that a defamatory statement made of a firm, or trustees, or the tenants of a particular building is not actionable, if the words would reasonably be understood as published of each member of the firm or each trustee or each tenant. The reason why a libel published of a large or indeterminate number of persons described by some general name generally fails to be actionable is the difficulty of establishing that the plaintiff was, in fact, included in the defamatory statement, for the habit of making unfounded generalisations is ingrained in ill-educated or vulgar minds, or the words are occasionally intended to be a facetious exaggeration. Even in such cases words may be used which enable the plaintiff to prove that the words complained of were intended to be published of each member of the group, or, at any rate, of himself.
 The thread that runs throughout their Lordships` reasoning is that where an article refers to a group of people without naming any individual, the question is not whether the article refers to the class, but whether the article in fact leads a reasonable person, who knows the plaintiff, to the conclusion that it refers to him.
 21.The test is an objective one and the objective nature of this test of identification was stressed in 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors
 
[1989] SLR 1063
 , 1078 where the High Court said: 
The plaintiff is not relying on any evidence extrinsic to the article, such as evidence of readers testifying that after reading the article, they understood that the words complained of in para 9 referred to the plaintiff. His case is that an ordinary reader reading the article would reasonably understand the words to refer to him. So the question is whether an ordinary reader reading the article would reasonably come to that conclusion. The test is an objective one, and in this respect, the following passage from the speech of Lord Guest in 
Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd
 
[1971] 2 All ER 1156
 at p 1261 is helpful:
 
`But here the question is not whether the words are defamatory. It is conceded that they were, if they refer to the appellant. The question is one purely of identity. ""Are the words capable of being understood to refer to the appellant?"" In my view, a somewhat more exacting test should be predicated where the question is one of identity. It is not sufficient for the reader to say ""I wonder if the article refers to Johnny Morgan"" nor is pure speculation sufficient. Nor is it sufficient that a reasonable person believes that the words refer to the plaintiff. The test is an objective one. The ordinary reader must be fair-minded and not avid for scandal. He must not be unduly suspicious. The ordinary reader must have rational grounds for his belief that the words refer to the plaintiff.`
 22.We now turn to the article, which must be read as a whole and the offending passages there must be read in their proper context. The article referred specifically to the 25 Tamil organisations: see paras 1 and 4 which we have set out above. The third offending passage referred to the 25 organisations: it accused them of failing to set up a department for Tamil studies at the National University of Singapore. Having made that accusation, it then questioned their service to the Tamil community and further accused them thus: `You are cheating the Tamils living in Singapore generation after generation`. The line following that stated: `The Tamil Language Week you organised also resulted in what Bharathiyar said, `You are warrior at words (no action)`. Besides you gathering and dispersing what have you achieved.` Following from the flow of the passage and, in particular, the fact that the accusations in the prior lines were aimed at the 25 Tamil organisations, it is clear that the last line of the third offending passage was also a continuation of the accusations directed at the 25 Tamil organisations and not at the organising committee. We are of the opinion that on a proper construction, the third offending passage did not refer to the organising committee.
 23.Only in paras 6 and 9 were there express references to the `organisers`. Immediately following para 9 is para 10 in which we find references to certain persons taking on `responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week`. By necessary implication this paragraph also referred to the `organisers`. The organising committees were effectively the `organisers` of the Tamil Language Week.
 24.Mr Cashin submits that the language in the last paragraph was not capable of referring to and did not refer to the respondents. The reason was that the respondents were, by their own admission, persons of long service in the Tamil community whose faces had been seen among the Tamilians, whereas the last paragraph only referred to persons whose faces had not been seen among the Tamilians. That, in our view, is not the point. The real point which was sought to be made in that paragraph is not persons who had not been seen among the Tamilians, but about persons who had `taken on responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week` for a political favour. The respondents were the organisers and, as members of the organising committee, were the people who had taken responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week, and para 6 and the last two paragraphs of the article referred to them.
 25.In considering this question of identity of the respondents in the article, it is relevant to bear in mind the publicity given to the respondents as members of the organising committee. The respondents were all present at a press conference held in February 1995 which was widely reported in the press, television and radio. They were interviewed by the media to raise public awareness of the event, though the publicity given by the media to individual respondents was uneven. The first respondent, as the chairman of the organising committee, received the most publicity amongst the organising committee. During the period 26 February to 31 May 1995 he was referred to in eight articles from the 
 Tamil Murasu 
, the 
 Tamil Nesan 
 and 
 The Straits Times 
 and referred to in six radio broadcasts. The second respondent was referred to in one radio broadcast. The third respondent was referred to in two articles: one in 
 The Straits Times 
 and the other in the 
 Tamil Murasu 
 and referred to in one radio broadcast. The fourth respondent was referred to in five articles: one in 
 The New Paper 
 and four in the 
 Tamil Murasu 
. The fifth respondent was referred to in three articles in the 
 Tamil Murasu 
 and wrote a letter regarding the Tamil Language Week to the 
 Tamil Murasu 
 which was published. The seventh respondent was referred to in an article of 
 The Straits Times 
. The tenth respondent was referred to in an article in the 
 Tamil Nesan 
 in his capacity as the advisor to the organising committee. The sixth, eighth and ninth respondents were not referred to specifically in the media. They were, however, at the forefront of the organisation and were highly visible to persons who took part in the Tamil Language Week. Besides being the treasurer, the sixth respondent was also the chairman of the sub-committee for school activities. The eighth and ninth respondents served as members of the organising committee and were respectively the chairman of the sub-committee for the opening ceremony and the organiser for the inter-secondary school debates. In the midst of carrying out their responsibilities, the sixth, eighth and ninth respondents would have met and worked with a significant number of people and would have been identified as persons assuming responsibility in the Tamil Language Week.
 26.It should also be borne in mind that the 1995 Tamil Language Week was the first time since independence that such an event had been held, and was therefore given considerable prominence among members of the Tamil community and the media attention given to the respondents would be sufficient to enable the reader of the article to associate those respondents as persons who had taken on responsibility in the 1995 Tamil Language Week.
 27.In addition, the respondents would have been identified from the listing of their names in the letterhead which the organising committee used for its correspondence and in the 
 Thirukkural 
 distributed. The respondents were also present at the major functions such as the opening and closing ceremonies in their capacity as members of the organising committee, functions which were attended by several hundred members of the Tamil community. About two months before the article appeared, on 28 May 1995, the respondents also hosted a `Thank You Dinner` for over 400 volunteers, thereby reinforcing their identities as persons who took up responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week.
 28.Having regard to the text of the article and the amount of publicity given to the members of the organising committee, we are of the opinion that a reasonable person who was acquainted with the respondents on reading the article would come to the conclusion that paras 6, 9 and 10 of the article referred to the respondents.
 29.
 Whether the offending passages were defamatory 
 
The respondents relied on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of and this included the inferential meaning. The `natural and ordinary meaning` of words in the law of defamation has through the years been the subject of repeated judicial expositions. In 
Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 
[1964] AC 234
, Lord Reid in his speech gave his much cited exposition on the `natural and ordinary meaning` of words at p 258: 
There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs ... What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 In the same case, Lord Devlin said at p 277: 
My Lords, the natural and ordinary meaning of words ought in theory to be the same for the lawyer as for the layman, because the lawyer`s first rule of construction is that words are to be given their natural and ordinary meaning as popularly understood. The proposition that ordinary words are the same for the lawyer as for the layman is as a matter of pure construction undoubtedly true. But it is very difficult to draw the line between pure construction and implication, and the layman`s capacity for implication is much greater than the lawyer`s. The lawyer`s rule is that the implication must be necessary as well as reasonable. The layman reads in an implication much more freely; and unfortunately, as the law of defamation has to take into account, is especially prone to do so when it is derogatory.
 In the same vein, it was also said by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in the Privy Council`s decision in 
Jones v Skelton
 
[1963] 3 All ER 952
 at p 958: 
The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or an indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words ... The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader, guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words.
 A similar approach was taken by the High Court in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors 
 (supra) where the court said at pp 399-400: 
The issue is one purely of construction of the words, but the rules of construction applicable in construing a contract or a will are not applicable for the purpose. The proper approach is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons.
 
... The words complained of in para 9 must be read in the context of the whole article and, in particular, in the context of paras 6, 7, 8 and 10; the context dictates the meaning of the words.
 30.Mr Cashin takes issue with the meaning ascribed by the learned judge to the first offending passage, namely that the `white doves` were the `stooges` represented by the respondents who organised the Tamil Language Week for the government, the `vultures`. Mr Cashin contends the natural and ordinary meaning of the first offending passage is that the `white doves` were some noble persons who are self-sacrificing in promoting the Tamil language among the `vultures`.
 31.In our opinion, the first offending passage is not about any `stooges` organising the Tamil Language Week to please the government. Its natural and ordinary meaning is that despite the gathering of a predominant number of people, `the vultures`, who were determined to ensure that the number of Tamil intellectuals would not increase, there were those who were the dedicated ones, the `white doves` of the 25 organisation, who courageously took part in the Tamil Language Week, and in that sense were self-sacrificing.
 32.Such a meaning is also in line with the flow of the article. The first paragraph of the article acknowledges the participation of the members of the 25 Tamil organisations in the Tamil Language Week. The second paragraph of the article hailed the Tamil Language Week as `a festival that share the Tamilians` feelings` and exhorted those who were elated over the success of the Tamil Language Week not to allow it to end there and reminded them there was a lot more work to be done for Tamil. In the context of this paragraph, we turn to consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the words `Although this Tamil Language Week is a drama enacted for written judgment by the government`. This is the passage in the paragraph complained of by the respondents as defamatory. The respondents contend that the natural and ordinary meaning of this passage is that `the [respondents] organised the Tamil Language Week in order to obtain and curry favour with the Government`. In our opinion, that is not the natural and ordinary meaning. The word `drama` in the context referred to the Tamil Language Week and the meaning of this passage is that the Tamil Language Week was organised as envisaged by the government. The focus of the offending passage is on the government. Taking the entire sentence in the context of the second paragraph, the point made is that, despite the fact that the Tamil Language Week was staged as required by the government, it actually turned out to be more than a mere show; it `turned out to be a festival that shared the Tamilians` feelings`.
 33.Paragraph 3 of the article then requests the Tamils to see not just one side of the coin but the other side as well. Thenceforth, there was a change in the tone of the article from one of endorsement to one of criticism.
 34.We now come to para 4 of the article. That paragraph is critical of the 25 organisations. This paragraph contained an indictment of the 25 organisations to the following effect: that they had been `tight-lipped and silent`; that they had not done anything to promote the cause of the Tamil language; that they had deceived or misled generations after generations of Singaporean Tamils; and that in organising the Tamil Language Week they merely paid lip service to the cause of the Tamil language and had achieved nothing.
 35.We now come to paras 9 and 10, being the last two paragraphs of the article. In respect of para 9 the natural and ordinary meaning is apparent and plain; and its sense was innocuous and there is actually no dispute on that paragraph. The main contention centres on para 10. The natural and ordinary meaning as contended by the respondents is that `the [respondents] are nakedly prostituting themselves in order to seek political gain/office rather than serve the cause of the Tamil language`. Mr Cashin contends that the natural and ordinary meaning of this paragraph is that the respondents were self seeking in organising the Tamil Language Week, and that such a meaning is not defamatory. In our opinion, the natural and ordinary meaning is that the respondents took on the responsibilities of organising the Tamil Language Week for an ulterior purpose, ie to make use of the Tamil Language to seek a political gain or office and not for the purpose of promoting the cause of the Tamil language.
 36.We now turn to consider whether the passages in the article complained of are defamatory of the respondents. The first offending passage is not defamatory of the respondents. Nor is the second offending passage defamatory. On its natural and ordinary meaning, clearly there is no defamatory or adverse imputation to any of the organisers of the Tamil Language Week. The only adverse imputation which can arise is to the government. The imputation in the fourth paragraph is not to the respondents but to the 25 organisations. It imputes inability and lack of serious effort in promoting the Tamil language. We find that, on the natural and ordinary meaning, the last paragraph of the article is defamatory. The sting lies in the imputation of insincerity of purpose and ulterior motive for personal gain on the part of the respondents in organising the Tamil Language Week.
 37.
 Whether the defence of fair comment was made out 
 
The next submission of Mr Cashin is that the defence of fair comment is made out in respect of the defamatory passages. The four elements which are required to be established in the defence of fair comment are: firstly, that the words complained of are comments, though they may consist of or include inference of facts. Secondly, the comment is on a matter of public interest. Thirdly, the comment is based on facts, and fourthly, the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved: 
Jeyaretnam JB v Goh Chok Tong
 [1984-1985] SLR 516 at p 522 and 
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp v Wright Norman & Ors
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 760
  at p 770.
 38.The distinction between fact and comment was discussed at length by this court in 
Chen Cheng & Anor v Central Christian Church
 
 
[1999] 1 SLR 94
 . After examining the propositions laid out in 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed), the court observed at p 104: 
At the end of the day much depends on how the defamatory statement is expressed, the context in which it is set out and the content of the entire article or passage in question. One should adopt a common sense approach and consider how the statement would strike the ordinary reasonable reader, ie whether it would be recognizable by the ordinary reader as a comment or a statement of fact.
 39.Taking into consideration the context and content of the fourth offending passage (ie the last paragraph of the article), we are of the view that the defamatory sting of the fourth offending passage which makes allusion to the respondents prostituting nakedly for positions in the name of Tamil, is a comment. This comment is based on a prior statement of fact, that faces which have not been seen amongst the Tamilians have taken on responsibilities in the Tamil Language Week. The commentary nature of the last line is most evident from the manner in which it began, `
 If that were true 
, we ask them not to prostitute nakedly and wander for position in the name of Tamil` [emphasis is added].
 40.However, in order for the appellants to avail themselves of the defence of fair comment, the comment must be based on facts which exist. As was said by Lord Ackner in delivering the Privy Council`s decision in 
Jeyaretnam JB v Goh Chok Tong
 
[1989] SLR 4
 at pp 8-9; 
[1989] 3 MLJ 1
 at p 3: 
It is of course well established that a writer may not suggest or invent facts and then comment upon them, on the assumption that they are true. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist, the defence of fair comment fails. The commentator must get his basic facts right.
 There were no existing facts on which the appellants could base their comment. The respondents provided strong evidence of their extensive involvement in the affairs and needs of the Tamil community. In marked contrast, no evidence was adduced by the appellants to show that the comment made in the fifth offending passage was based on any true facts. Indeed, under cross-examination, the first appellant admitted that the comment was based solely on his personal knowledge, on whether he had seen those persons up to the time of the Tamil Language Week. In other words, the comment of prostituting for a position in the name of Tamil was made on a wild and unverified assumption that persons who had not been seen by the first appellant had never been involved in the Tamil community. In order for the defence of fair comment to succeed, the commentator must get his facts right. This he failed to do and for that reason the defence is not available to the appellants.

 Whether the second appellant was liable for the article 
 
Mr Cashin submits that the second appellant is not liable as editor for the article. He argues that the sole responsibility for the article lay with the first appellant and that he published it without the second appellant`s knowledge of the contents. Although the second appellant is the editor of 
 The Hammer 
, his editorial responsibility is only for articles written in English or translated into English for the English section of the publication and not for any article in another language. The responsibility for articles in other languages lay with the editors appointed for their respective language sections.
 42.The textbook authorities are uniform in their stand that the editor is liable for a defamatory article because of his involvement in the publication of the defamatory matter. 
 Duncan and Neil on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed) states at [para ] 8.12: 
Every person who takes part in the publication of defamatory matter is prima facie liable in respect of that publication. For example, in the case of a libel in a newspaper the writer of the article and the proprietors, the editor and the printers of the newspaper are liable ...
 Similarly 28 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed), para 38, says: 
Every person who takes part in or procure the publication of a libel is prima facie liable jointly and severally for all the damage caused by it. Thus, if a libel appears in a newspaper, the author of the libel and the proprietor, the editor, printers, publishers and vendor of the newspaper are prima facie jointly and severally liable.
 The same point is made in para 6.3 of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) where it says: 
In accordance with general principle all persons who participate in the publication of a libel and who are liable therefor are jointly and severally liable for the whole damage suffered by the plaintiff. Thus in the case of the publication of a newspaper the journalist, editor and publisher are all joint tortfeasors. `If one repeat, and another write a libel, and a third approve what is wrote they are all makers of it; for all persons who concur, and show their assent or approbation to do an unlawful act, are guilty` (per curiam in 
R v Paine
 
[1696] 5 Mod 163
 at 167).
 At para 6.19 the learned authors add:
 The editor of a newspaper obviously may not read every word published in each edition but it is submitted that he has the requisite responsibility for the entire issue.
 43.Mr Cashin`s argument is essentially that the second appellant was not liable because he did not take part in the writing and publication of the article. The evidence, however, points to at least some involvement on his part as the editor of the publication.
 44.The responsibility of the second appellant as the editor is borne out by the evidence of the first appellant and Mr Low Thia Kiang, who were the sub-editors of the Tamil and Chinese sections respectively. In the affidavit of the first appellant, he said that the second appellant, as Secretary General of the Workers` Party is the general editor of the paper, and that other members of the Workers` Party were appointed as editors of the Chinese, Malay and Tamil sections of 
 The Hammer 
. The first appellant also said that he informed the second appellant about the subjects that he had chosen to write on. The evidence of Mr Low Thia Kiang, witness for the appellants also supports this. In his testimony, he said: 
The executive council jointly holds the permit. The editor is the secretary-general. The paper has four language sections. So we appoint sub-editors. Whether that allowed is not for me to interpret.
 45.It is clear from the first appellant`s and Mr Low Thia Kiang`s testimony that the second appellant was the general editor and that the first appellant`s role was that of a sub-editor for the Tamil section. Although the first appellant had the editorial responsibility for the Tamil section, the second appellant remained the general editor and was informed of what articles were to be written. As the general editor, he was thus involved in the approval of the subject matter of the articles, the decision to publish what was presented before him and in the appointment of appropriate persons to be responsible for the vetting of the articles in their respective languages. If such sub-editors fail to perform their job adequately, the general editor cannot evade responsibility by saying that he had delegated it to others.
 46.
 Whether the damages were excessive 
 
On the issue of damages, Mr Cashin argues that the quantum given by the court below was excessive since the respondents were not public figures. However, the fact that the respondents were not public figures was already taken into account by the learned judge. This can be seen from the lower sums awarded to the respondents in comparison to Mr Chiam See Tong in 
Chiam See Tong v Xin Zhang Jiang Restaurant Pte Ltd
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 196
  where he was awarded $50,000 in respect of the publication of his photograph in a restaurant`s advertising material, and in 
Chiam See Tong v Ling How Doong & Ors
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 648
  where he was awarded $120,000 for accusations that he was a government stooge, and in comparison to Mr Goh Chok Tong in 
Goh Chok Tong v Joshua Benjammin Jeyaretnam
 
 
[1998] 3 SLR 337
  where he was awarded $100,000 for the imputation arising from these words uttered at an election rally: `and finally, Mr Tang Liang Hong has just placed before me two reports he has made to the police, against you know, Mr Goh Chok Tong and his people`. In addition, the trial judge also took into account the difference in public status by awarding a lower sum to the respondents who were not advocates and solicitors.
 47.The learned judge`s award was, however, based on his finding that the first, second, third and fourth offending passages were defamatory of the respondents. In our view, however, only the fourth offending passage was defamatory of the respondents. While the sting was no doubt still present in the fourth offending passage, standing on its own, the damage caused to the respondents` reputation was correspondingly less.
 48.There was also a point of distinction which, with respect, we think that the learned judge did not take into account. In the three cases referred to as guiding precedents, the publication of the defamatory matter was in the press. The extent of publication was much greater than that of the present case. The circulation of 
 The Hammer 
 is limited by the fact that it is not sold on the news stands. Out of the 20,000 copies which were printed, only 8,000 copies were sold in various parts of Singapore and only Tamil readers would have read it. Also, not all the Tamil readers of the article in August 1995 would at that time still be familiar with the persons who held responsibilities in the 1995 Tamil Language Week. The actual extent of publication of the article was very limited and very much less than that of the three cases referred to by the learned judge. Admittedly, the gravity of defamation cannot always be ascertained by reference to the extent of the publication; nor can it be varied or adjusted by some direct proportion to the number of persons to whom the defamatory material is published. Nonetheless, the extent of publication remains an important factor which should be considered in the assessment of damages: see 
Tang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor

 Conclusion 
 
Notwithstanding the views we have expressed in [para ] 47 and 48, we do not think that the damages awarded to the respondents were manifestly excessive, and we are not disposed to disturb the award. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs. We order that the deposit as security for costs be paid to the respondents or their solicitors to account of the costs.",1999-05-18 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal against the conviction of the appellant of the capital offence of having murdered one Lee Mui Kee by stabbing him in the neck with a knife at the `Big A` Fried Chicken Restaurant at Upper Serangoon Road on 8 April 1985 at about 9pm [see 
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 404
 ]. At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, we were of the view that the learned trial judges had not, in the light of other independent and hard evidence led by the prosecution, given sufficient weight to the exculpatory parts of a statement given by the appellant which established on a balance of probabilities that the appellant had stabbed the deceased without premeditation in a sudden fight. As the case in our view fell squarely within exception 4 of s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and we sentenced him under s 304(b) of the Penal Code to a term of ten years` imprisonment.
This appeal raised a question of general importance in the law of evidence in a criminal trial in relation to the evidential status of the exculpatory part or parts of a `mixed statement` voluntarily made by an accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the `CPC`) and admitted `in evidence` under s 122(5) of the CPC.
The evidence giving rise to this vexed question of law and practice may be summarized as follows. The appellant is a male Chinese. In April 1985 he was 25 and was working as a casual labourer. He and the deceased had been childhood friends. The deceased, a lorry driver, was also 26. At least two persons must have seen the killing but no witness came forward who could testify as to the actual stabbing and how it had occurred. The proprietor of the restaurant and four of his employees gave evidence. Three of the employees stated in evidence that the appellant and the deceased had patronized the restaurant that night at about 8pm. They sat at table 2 as marked on the sketch plan of the restaurant. It was at one far end of the restaurant, near the wall, and was away from the main and only entrance of the restaurant. They were drinking beer. The deceased sat next and to the left of the appellant. Two of the restaurant employees also testified that they saw at least two other male Chinese coming into the restaurant and sitting at the same table with the appellant and the deceased. They sat opposite them. Another witness, Toh Kwee Choo, said that she saw two or three other male Chinese entering the restaurant and joining the appellant and the deceased. She said: `... not long after that there was this noise of tables and chairs falling.` The police, despite their efforts, had not been able to trace these two or three male Chinese who could have shed a great deal of light as to what had happened that fateful night.
However, all five witnesses said that they heard a commotion. Tables, chairs and glasses were heard to have been overturned or smashed. Two of them, Lee Leong Huat, the supervisor in the restaurant, and Chung Siew Choo, a waitress, also said in evidence that they saw the deceased running away from table 2, bleeding from the neck, and he was chased by the appellant who tried to stab the deceased. They said, however, that the appellant did not stab the deceased as the deceased had fallen down and had succumbed to his wound near table 9, which was near the main entrance of the restaurant. The appellant threw down two knives which were recovered from the vicinity of table 9 and ran out of the restaurant.
The investigating officer told the trial judges that he saw a trail of blood leading from the restaurant to the pavement outside the shopping centre in front of a coffee house. The analysis of the blood swabs taken revealed that the blood taken at the restaurant and on both the knives was Group O, which was the blood type of the deceased. The blood taken from the trail of blood from the restaurant to the pavement outside the shopping centre was Group B. The accused`s blood group was A. This piece of evidence clearly suggested that another person had been injured.
The autopsy showed that the deceased had been stabbed in the left lower neck to a depth of 24cm. The wound itself was 6cm long. The blade of the knife had transacted both the arteries in the neck and had also penetrated the lung. The blade was plunged downwards and backwards from left to the right side of the deceased`s body at an angle of 45o. This was the fatal wound. Haemorrhage from this wound was the cause of death. The deceased had also sustained a 3cm superficial wound at the back of his right wrist. It was a defensive wound.
At 2.50am on 9 April 1985 the appellant surrendered himself to the police. He took the investigating officer to the Farrer Road hawker centre to recover his bloodstained T-shirt. He was brought to the Criminal Investigation Department. Between 7.25am and 8.30am that same morning, after the fateful night before, he made a voluntary statement to the investigating officer. His statement was as follows: 
 
On 6 April 1985 the deceased `Ah Tee` asked me whether I was prepared to pay the loan of $2,000. As I did not borrow this sum of money from the illegal moneylender I refused to repay him the loan. Ah Tee then told me to get someone to settle the matter with him. He had suggested that I could go to his house at Hougang Avenue 3 on 8 April 1985 at 7.30pm. At the stated time I went to his house to look for him, but he was not at home. I have carried two knives with me, I tucked them in my trousers at the left waist and covered them up with my T-shirt. I bought the knives from an emporium at Hougang Avenue 6 before going to look for the deceased at his house. When I could not find him I went to the ground floor to wait for him.
 
 
 
I wish to add that I brought the knives to his place because I expected that I would be confronted by the deceased and his friends when I was unable to give him any money. In fact prior to this meeting there were instances that I was assaulted by the deceased and his friends when I did not have the money to give them. About half an hour later I saw the deceased coming towards the block. When I spotted him I called him. Ah Tee came to me and asked me to follow him to Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. I agreed and sat on his motor cycle. On our way to the Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre I noticed that there were two motor cycles behind us. I believe that the motor cyclists behind are from his gang. On arrival Ah Tee led me to the `Big A` fried chicken restaurant, both of us occupied a table in the restaurant. Ah Tee ordered a jug of beer and some chicken. The motor cyclists and the pillion riders did not enter the restaurant. They waited outside.
Whilst we were still in the restaurant another four of de`s gang came into the restaurant; one of them sat with us while the others sat at the next table. When we were about to finish the chicken and the beer, Ah Tee asked me whether I had brought the $2,000 to him. When I answered him that I did not have money to give him even I agreed to pay the loan [sic]. On hearing what I said Ah Tee was unhappy and gave me a punch. I managed to dodge away but I was still hit slightly by the punch on my right cheek near the eye. After which Ah Tee and his gang stood up and came towards me, before they could do anything I whipped out a knife from my trousers and stabbed Ah Tee with it. I remember stabbing the deceased once. I then saw one of his gang members come forward. I immediately whip out another knife to attack him I did not know whether I had stab that person or not. At the same time I saw Ah Tee collapsed onto the ground. I immediately threw the knife which I was holding and fled.
From the scene I took a taxi to my friend`s house at Farrer Road to borrow a shirt from my friend. I changed into fresh clothing and sat in the Farrer Road hawker centre for a while. After I had a cup of tea at the hawker centre I took a taxi to Punggol and went into hiding. In my uncle`s house I consider the matter again and decided to surrender myself to the police. I then requested my uncle to send me to the Paya Lebar Police Station where I surrender myself. That is all I have to say.
The statement was admitted `in evidence` under s 122(5) of the CPC as part of the prosecution evidence. The prosecution then closed its case against the appellant.
Former counsel of the appellant submitted that the appellant had no case to meet. He recognized that the trial judges, in addition to the prosecution evidence set out earlier in this judgment, also had before them an admission by the appellant that he had stabbed the deceased. But former counsel of the appellant stressed that the trial judges, nevertheless, had before them the explanations and allegations of the appellant as to the circumstances leading to the stabbing. It was submitted that the appellant`s explanations and allegations, viewed against the other prosecution evidence as a whole, were sufficient to establish one or more of the special exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code. In connection with this submission, the trial judges in their judgment set out the following salient features of the appellant`s statement:
 
 
(1) prior to the incident, the accused had been assaulted by the deceased and his friends when he did not have money to give them; 
 
(2) prior to his meeting the deceased on 8 April 1985, the accused bought two knives on the expectation that he would be confronted by the deceased and his friends; 
 
(3) he met the deceased at the ground floor of the deceased`s flat and agreed to follow the deceased to the `Big A` restaurant; he sat on the deceased`s motor cycle; 
 
(4) they were followed by two motor cycles whose riders belonged to the deceased`s gang; 
 
(5) four of the deceased`s gang came into the restaurant while he and the deceased were drinking and eating; 
 
(6) the deceased gave him a punch which hit him slightly on the left cheek; 
 
(7) the deceased and his gang stood up and came towards him whereupon he took out a knife and stabbed the deceased; when one member of the gang came forward, he took out the other knife to attack him.
  
 
 
The submissions of former counsel of the appellant directly raised the issue as to the evidential status of exculpatory or self-serving statements made by an accused and admitted under s 122(5) of the CPC. Reliance was placed on the following authorities: (i)

 [1981] 2 MLJ 
 lxxi.
The trial judges reviewed extensively the authorities cited. It is not necessary for us to repeat them except for two cases. In coming to their views the trial judges placed great reliance on 
 R v Storey and Anwar 
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 334 and the Privy Council decision in 
 R v Leung Kam-kwok 
 (1985) 81 Cr App R 83. We would now have to consider these two authorities in some detail to see if they support the views taken by the trial judges.
In 
 Storey and Anwar 
 the police had found a large quantity of cannabis in the defendant`s flat. In an unsworn and voluntary statement, the defendant, a call girl, claimed that the cannabis belonged to a man, an Indian she called Ali, who had brought it into her flat against her will. She said she was remonstrating with Ali when the police arrived. Her explanation, if true, would have proved that she was never in possession of the cannabis. To a submission that she had no case to meet, the trial judge overruled it and called for the defence. She elected to remain silent. Thereupon the trial judge left the issue as to the truth or otherwise of the defendant`s explanations to the jury. She was convicted.
It is noteworthy that Widgery LJ identified the issue before the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in the following terms: 
 
The question which arises in this case is whether the fact that she gave shortly afterwards an explanation which, if true, would provide a completely innocent explanation is enough to produce a situation in which the learned judge`s duty was to say that there was no case to meet.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the trial judge in calling for the defence. We would emphasize certain portions in the following passage of the judgment of Widgery LJ at pp 337-338: 
 
The court has given careful consideration to this important point. We think it right to recognize that a statement made by the accused to the police, although it always forms evidence in the case against him, is not in itself evidence of the truth of the facts stated. A statement made voluntarily by an accused person to the police is evidence in the trial because of its vital relevance as showing the reaction of the accused when first taxed with the incriminating facts. If, of course, the accused admits the offence, then as a matter of shorthand one says that the admission is proof of guilt, and, indeed, in the end it is. But if the accused makes a statement which does not amount to an admission, the statement is not strictly evidence of the truth of what was said, but is evidence of the reaction of the accused which forms part of the general picture to be considered by the jury at the trial.
 
 
 
Accordingly, in our judgment, in this case the fact that the cannabis was on the applicant`s bed in her flat was in itself some evidence of possession to go to the jury. Her unsworn explanation, although, if true, it would have been a complete answer to the charge, did not cancel out or nullify the evidence which was provided by the presence of the cannabis. 
 It was ultimately for the jury to decide whether that explanation was or might be true, and it was not for the judge necessarily to accept it at the stage when he was considering the submission 
. In the event therefore, we have come to the conclusion that the learned judge was entitled to and right to leave this matter to the jury and not to withdraw it from them merely because the accused`s unsworn explanation would, if true, have been a complete answer to the charge.
Two important points emerge, one directly relevant to the issue under consideration and the other on the role of a trial judge as a decider of law at the close of the prosecution case and his role as a decider of fact when the defence is called. The first point is this. It was clearly acknowledged by Widgery LJ that the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement have to be considered by the jury. That could only be so if and only if the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement are also regarded as evidence before the jury. We should at once say that its evidential value is obviously quite a separate and distinct matter.
Secondly, and this point has a bearing later in this judgment, what Widgery LJ said in relation to the role of a trial judge and jury in England, as a decider of law and deciders of fact respectively, was a clear precursor of the principles subsequently enunciated in the famous speech of Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  at p 52: 
 
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
 
 
 
We turn next to 
 R v Leung Kam-kwok 
 (1985) 81 Cr App R 83. It is insto bear in mind one aspect of this decision. It was held that `having elected not to give evidence, the appellant`s statements admitting responsibility for the killing but claiming he had no intention to kill, were not evidence of the truth of the facts so stated, but only evidence that he had made them, 
 and it was then for the jury to evaluate the admission and the unsworn explanation or excuse as they thought fit 
.` (See the headnotes and p 91, emphasis added.) Lord Roskill at p 91 went on to approve what was `succinctly and correctly` stated by James LJ when giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Donaldson & Ors 
 (1976) 64 Cr App R 59 at p 65 as follows: 
 
In our view there is a clear distinction to be made between statements of admission adduced by the Crown as part of the case against the defendant and statements entirely of a self-serving nature made and sought to be relied upon by a defendant. When the Crown adduces a statement relied upon as an admission it is for the jury to consider the whole statement including any passages that contain qualifications or explanations favourable to the defendant, that bear upon the passages relied upon by the prosecution as an admission, and it is for the jury to decide whether the statement viewed as a whole constitutes an admission. To this extent the statement may be said to be evidence of facts stated therein. If the jury finds that it is an admission they may rely upon it as proof of the facts admitted. If the defendant elects not to give evidence then in so far as the statement contains explanations or qualifications favourable to the defendant the jury, in deciding what, if any, weight to give to that part of the statement, should take into account that it was not made on oath and has not been tested by cross-examination. When the Crown adduces evidence in the form of a statement by the defendant which is not relied on as an admission of the offence charged such a statement is evidence in the trial in that it is evidence that the defendant made the statement and of his reaction which is part of the general picture which the jury have to consider but it is not evidence of the facts stated.
 
 
 
The trial judges called for the defence. This we think was entirely proper. We agreed with their views that `(t)here was credible evidence that the (appellant) had intended to stab the deceased at the neck and such stabbing was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.`
We should now refer to an astonishing submission made by former counsel of the appellant. In contending that there was no case to meet, he submitted that the explanations of the appellant given by the appellant in his voluntary statement should be accepted as true on the ground that the voluntary statement had been tendered by the prosecution as part of its case against the appellant. This extravagant submission not unexpectedly received short shrift from the trial judges. They ruled that it was not the law in Singapore that exculpatory statements in a confession used by the prosecution as part of its evidence were admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents thereof. That ruling was patently correct. Otherwise, prosecution could never put in a confession of murder if they are bound to accept the truth of an accused`s explanations and thus defeat the purpose of using the confession.
Next, we come to the basic difficulty in this appeal. It relates to the evidential status of a mixed statement already admitted in evidence after a defence is called. How should trial judges direct themselves when performing the function as deciders of fact in regard to mixed statements, particularly in a case where an accused person elects, as he is entitled, to remain silent?
The High Court of two judges (Lai Kew Chai J and Grimberg JC) in March 1988 had to grapple with this problem in a case of murder in 
 PP v Ong Kin Hong 
 (Criminal Case No 12 of 1986) (unreported). The 90-page judgment of the High Court, to which the mixed statement of the accused was appended, is unreported. The brief facts were as follows. Ong Kin Hong, 49 years of age and the proprietor of a shoe factory, was charged for the murder of a female aged 34 an hour or two before noon on 24 December 1984. She was found dead lying on the floor of a toilet of the premises of the Singapore Footwear Merchants Association, Block 68, Lorong 16, Geylang, Singapore. She died of multiple injuries to the head, neck, chest and abdomen which could have been inflicted with a great deal of force by an instrument such as an iron pipe. She was a clerk of the association of which the accused was a member. DSP Koh Kong Song, a finger print expert, testified that the print lifted from the tap head in the toilet was that of the accused`s right thumb. Sixteen characteristics of the print lifted from the tap head corresponded with those of the accused`s right thumb. When the body was discovered in the afternoon, the water from the tap was still running. The maintenance officer of a company employed to maintain and look after the security of the association`s building said in evidence that at about 10.30am on 24 December 1984 he saw the accused, who is positively identified, hurriedly leaving the association premises.
Evidence was also led from other witnesses relating to the movements of the accused that morning. It was further established that a roll of Sun-X film, a substance used to stick to glass surfaces to reduce the rays of the sun, was found at the pantry of the association premises by the investigating officer when he visited the scene. He did not seize it as its relevance was not then apparent to him. The caretaker of the association said that she had thrown it away. It was further established that the accused had after the killing asked a witness to buy for him another roll of Sun-X film, as if to replace the one he had left at the association. The investigating officer later seized the replacement roll of Sun-X film from the office of the accused.
On 26 December 1984 the accused was arrested. He made a statement which was a total denial of any involvement in the murder. He stoutly maintained that stance until 7 January 1985 when he was confronted by the investigating officer with the facts relating to the Sun-X film. He then orally confessed and told the investigating officer that he had killed the deceased and had thrown the iron pipe into the Whampoa River. He led the officer there but the officer decided not to attempt to retrieve it as it was his view that it would have been a futile exercise.
Later the same day, the accused made a long written statement. He confessed to the killing but gave several explanations. He claimed in exculpation that he had done so after an argument with the deceased. He said the deceased insulted him and he slapped her after which he went to the toilet, wishing to end the alternation. But the deceased followed him and assaulted him with a broom made of fibre from the leaves of coconut trees, prodding and striking his genitals with it. He further claimed that he fell on the floor of the toilet as a result of the assault. Seeing an object close at hand, he picked it up and struck the deceased with it.
The trial judges called upon the accused to enter his defence. He elected to remain silent. His counsel submitted that the mixed statement of the accused had proved on a balance of probabilities that there was grave and sudden provocation, self defence and sudden fight under exceptions 1, 2 and 4 of the Penal Code. Counsel for the defence also submitted that as a matter of law it was not open to the trial judges to reject the exculpatory parts of the mixed statement once and if they decided to accept the inculpatory parts of the statement.
The trial judges rejected this submission. They held that they were entitled to test the evidential value of the exculpatory parts of the statement against other evidence before the court `in order to assess their weight`. They stated at pp 76-77 thus: 
 
We commenced our consideration of counsel`s submission by considering the confession. It is what has become known as a `mixed statement`, that is to say a statement containing a confession as well as self-exculpatory parts. 
 Findley Duncan
 (1981) 73 Cr App 359, established that when a mixed statement is under consideration the whole statement must be looked at, that is to say both the incriminating parts and the excuses or explanations. It is permissible for the court to proceed upon the basis that the incriminating parts are likely to be true (otherwise why should the accused have uttered them?), whereas the excuses might not have the same weight.
 
 
 
Furthermore, it is appropriate where the accused has elected not to give evidence, as in the present case, to take that fact into account in assessing the weight of the exculpatory parts of the statement. In short, all the components of a `mixed statement` (which, having been admitted, becomes part of the prosecution evidence) are evidence of the facts referred to in it. These components may be tested against the other evidence before the court, in order to assess their weight. We were obliged, therefore, to reject [counsel`s] argument that it was not to open to us to accept those parts of the confession in which the accused admitted killing the deceased, and reject those parts of it in which he sought to exculpate himself.
The accused unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appellate court concluded that the trial judges were entitled on all the evidence to reject the defences which were based solely on the statements made by the accused. As the appellate court did not criticize the principles which were applied by the trial judges in that case, it may be taken that they had implicitly approved them. On one view, it may be said with some force that the appellate court on that occasion came very close to approving the principles set out in 
 R

 (1981) 73 Cr App R 359. In 
 Ong Kin Hong 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 76
  at p 78 A/B-E/F they stated: 
 
The trial judges, after carefully examining the exculpatory parts of the appellant`s evidence, and having done so, rethem. They came to the conclusion that the accused had committed a premeditated assault upon the deceased, intending to kill her, and that he had brought onto the premises of the association, an iron rod or bar with which to achieve his purpose, which he threw into the Whampoa River after having achieved it. The trial judges found that there was evidence before them that, in the days immediately before the murder, the deceased had been wary of the appellant, not wishing to be left alone when he was in the vicinity. There was also produced in evidence a note written by the deceased a few days before she died which indicated that an incident had occurred involving the appellant which had distressed the deceased. In a written statement made to the police on the day of his arrest, the appellant spoke of rumours circulating in the association to the effect that he was lecherous, an allegation which he denied. The trial judges concluded that the appellant regarded the deceased to be the source of these rumours. They were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the murder of the deceased and they accordingly convicted the appellant.
 
 
 
The Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
 v 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
  referred to the question whether a self-exculpatory statement admitted in evidence under s 122(5) of the CPC is evidence of the facts stated therein or one which a court is entitled to take a full account of. But the appellate court expressed the view that it was premature for them to comment on the matter as it did not arise for a decision in that case. At p 266 it stated: 
 
In our judgment, a statement whether or not it is purported to have been made under s 122(6) is admissible in evidence so long as s 122(5) is satisfied. There is no doubt that an inculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein. It is not necessary for us to decide whether an 
 exculpatory
 statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein or, as the High Court put it another way in 
 Chan Sway Beng
`s case [
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
 ], one `which the court was entitled to take a full account of`. We understand that this issue has arisen in 
 PP v Chan Kim Choi
 [
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 404
 ] where the High Court held that exculpatory statements when given in accordance with s 122(6) and tendered in court pursuant to s 122(5) may be admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence, but not a truth of the contents thereof. Since this issue has not arisen before us and since the decision of the High Court is under appeal, it is premature for us to comment on the decision.
 
 
 
The question before us was directly raised and, in our view, fully addressed by the House of Lords in their judgment in 
 R v Sharp 
 [1981] 1 All ER 65. That judgment was delivered at the end of 1987 and it was reported within the first quarter of 1988.
In relation to the trial of this case below, the trial judges heard it in July 1988. They announced their decision on 14 July 1988. They delivered their grounds of decision on 29 December 1988. It was unfortunate, in our view, that the seminal decision of 
 R v Sharp 
 was not brought to their attention. It was even more unfortunate that the earlier and equally apposite decision of Lord Lane CJ in
 R v Duncan 
at p 365, which was approved by the House of Lords in 
 R v Sharp 
, was also not cited to the trial judges.
The factual context which gave rise to
 R v Sharp 
 was briefly as follows. The defendant stood trial on a charge of burglary of a dwelling house. He was seen jogging at 6.30am one morning by two police officers who were about to arrive in their car at the dwelling house in response to a telephone call. The defendant ran in the direction of his car and drove off at speed. The police officers gave chase in their car but lost sight of the defendant for a while, after the defendant had driven into a slip road. A short while later, they again saw him driving his Cortina. The police stopped him. He turned abusive and drove off again at great speed. Later, the police recovered the Cortina at a golf course. They recovered glass particles from the defendant`s track suit which he was wearing that day and on the driver`s seat. Forensic evidence established that the glass recovered and the glass samples taken from the burgled house was indistinguishable. Three days later, he made a voluntary mixed statement to the police. He claimed that his car had an accident, and a small part of it had fallen out. He was running back to retrieve the part. He denied that he had attempted to escape from the police officers because he did not know that they were police officers. He also explained that he had driven into the slip road to urinate. As for driving off again from the police, he claimed that he had reason for doing so, which he had given to his solicitor, but he refused to tell the police what it was.
The accused elected to remain silent and he was convicted of burglary. But the trial judge, in treating the defendant`s statement as a mixed statement, directed the jury selectively. He said they were entitled to regard his statement that he was in the area at the time of the burglary as an admission and that the other exculpatory parts of the statement were not evidence of the facts related. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge`s direction to the jury was contrary to 
 R v Duncan 
.
The question certified for the decision of the House of Lords in 
 R v Sharp 
 was in the following terms: 
 
Where a statement made to a police officer out of court by a defendant contains both admissions and self-exculpatory parts do the exculpatory parts constitute evidence of the truth of the facts alleged therein?
 
 
 
The House of Lords answered the question by ruling that the whole statement constituted evidence of the truth of the facts it asserted and the judge should have directed the jury that both the incriminating parts and the excuses or explanations must be considered in determining where the truth lies, although where appropriate, as it usually would be, the judge might, and should have, pointed out that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas the excuses did not carry the same weight. They cited with unqualified approval what Lord Lane CJ said in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Duncan 
 at p 365: 
 
Where a `mixed` statement is under consideration by the jury in a case where the defendant has not given evidence, it seems to us that the simplest, and, therefore, the method most likely to produce a just result, is for the jury to be told that the whole statement, both the incriminating parts and the excuses or explanations, must be considered by them in deciding where the truth lies. It is, to say the least, not helpful to try to explain to the jury that the exculpatory parts of the statement are something less than evidence of the facts they state. Equally, where appropriate, as it usually will be, the judge may, and should, point out that the incriminating parts are likely to be true (otherwise why say them?), whereas the excuses do not have the same weight. Nor is there any reason why, again where appropriate, the judge should not comment in relation to the exculpatory remarks upon the election of the accused not to give evidence.
 
 
 
In our considered view, the law in Singapore in relation to the evidential status of mixed statements admitted under s 122(5) of the CPC is precisely the same. The only rider we would add is that in Singapore the deciders of fact in a criminal trial are judges and judicial officers who are professionally trained to apply the rules of evidence under the Evidence Act.
We now turn to the trial judges` treatment of the evidence at the close of the defence in the trial below. They stated their findings as follows: 
 
It was entirely possible that the account of the incident given in the cautioned statement was accurate as to the events described therein. But it was also possible that it was not a complete account of what had happened. On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the accused was seen chasing the deceased with a knife in his right hand. The accused was also seen to have made a motion of stabbing the deceased. This event was not recounted in the cautioned statement. Giving such weight as we could to the cautioned statement in the light of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, we were unable to conclude that the accused had discharged, on a balance of probabilities, the burden of proving any circumstances which brought him within the general exception of right of private defence under s 96 of the Penal Code or any of the special exceptions 2, 4 and 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant in this appeal is Mr Palakrishnan. We would like to say that we were greatly indebted to him for drawing our attention to the leading authorities we have discussed in this judgment. He submitted that the trial judges at the conclusion of the trial had failed to give sufficient consideration to the exculpatory parts of the appellant`s mixed statement in the light of the incontrovertible evidence led by the prosecution which in material respects plainly supported his contention that the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that he had stabbed the deceased without premeditation in a sudden fight within exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code.
We agreed with his submissions and our reasons are as follows. On that fateful night, it was plain that the appellant found himself in the restaurant in a dangerous situation. The deceased was at the material time joined by his gang. It was probable that the appellant had armed himself with two knives for his own protection because he was, as he had anticipated, greatly out-numbered. The prosecution witnesses from the restaurant confirmed that two or three members of the gang of the deceased had joined them. A sudden fight broke out immediately after the deceased was joined by his gang. Tables and chairs were overturned. Glasses were broken. There was no reason to disbelieve the appellant when he said that it was the deceased who had started the fight. The absence of any evidence of injury on the appellant was an innocuous fact as the appellant had stated in his statement that the deceased had only slightly injured him. Faced with the danger posed by the gang he stabbed the deceased only once on the neck. We have to note that there was incontrovertible evidence that he had also knifed a member of the deceased`s gang as bloodstains, different from the blood group of either the appellant or the deceased, were found at the pavement outside the restaurant. The appellant was therefore fighting against at least two persons from the opposing camp.
We refer to the evidence of two prosecution witnesses that the appellant had chased the deceased and had made the motion of attempting to stab the deceased. This evidence was, in our view, the opinion of the two witnesses who came to the conclusion because the appellant was seen following the deceased. Having regard to the layout of the restaurant, we noted that the path taken by the deceased and followed by the appellant was the only path that led to the only exit of the restaurant. It was not an unreasonable inference in our view to think that both of them had in fact intended to get out of the restaurant. Certainly, it was the natural thing for the appellant himself to have done so. There were still at least two other members of the deceased`s gang who were near table 2 in the restaurant and the appellant must have feared that they might attack him. We refer to the fact that the appellant was seen holding up his knife as though attempting to stab the deceased again. It seemed to us that it was also not an unreasonable inference that in holding up the knife and making his getaway, he was adopting a threatening posture merely to keep the deceased and the other members of the gang at bay. He wanted to get away, as in fact, he did.
In these circumstances, we came to the conclusion that the appellant had stabbed the deceased without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. He had only inflicted one blow. Although it turned out to be fatal, we could not say that in all the circumstances of the case, he had taken undue advantage, seeing that he was dangerously out-numbered, nor could we say that he had acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
We accordingly allowed the appeal and convicted the appellant of the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 Sundaresh Menon CJ:
Introduction
1       This appeal was the first that touched on the issue of sentencing for offences under s 13(
aa
) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), a provision that was introduced in 2013 to make it an offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence under the Act within Singapore, notwithstanding that all or any of the acts constituting the aiding, abetment, counselling or procurement were done outside Singapore. For convenience only, I refer to the acts of aiding, abetment, counselling and procurement collectively as “abet” or any of the derivatives of that word. Similarly, I refer to the offence that is being abetted in this way as “the primary offence” or “the underlying offence”.
2       Where an offender is charged under s 13(
aa
) of the Act, the punishment prescribed by s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the Act, ranges from a 
minimum
 of two years’ imprisonment or $4,000 fine or both to a 
maximum
 of ten years’ imprisonment or $40,000 fine or both. The prescribed range of punishments covers the abetment of any of a broad range of offences under the Act which in turn attract an extremely broad range of punishments. At one end of the spectrum, the Act prescribes the imposition of the death penalty for the underlying offence and in certain limited circumstances, life imprisonment as an alternative to the death penalty. Further down that end of the spectrum are those offences that are punishable with a term of imprisonment of between 20 and 30 years and accompanied by a minimum of 15 strokes of the cane. At the other end of the spectrum, there are offences that carry a maximum punishment of one month’s imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine (see for example, an offence under s 40B(4)(
a
) of the Act for failing to submit to the taking of photographs, finger impressions, particulars and body samples). It is thus evident that the range of punishments prescribed for the offence under s 13(
aa
) is lower at the top end than the maximum punishment that may, and in many cases, 
must
 be imposed for certain primary offences; and is higher at the bottom end than the maximum sentence that may be imposed for other primary offences. In my judgment, this militates against the possibility of finding a direct co-relation between the punishments prescribed for the abetment offence under s 13(
aa
) with those prescribed for the corresponding primary offence.
3       In the present case, the Appellant was charged with abetting one Kannan Reti Nadaraja (“Kannan”) to import into Singapore 10.38g of diamorphine. The underlying offence (namely, the importation of 10.38g of diamorphine) would have attracted a punishment falling between 20 and 30 years’ imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane. It would therefore have fallen at the high end of the range in terms of the seriousness of the underlying offences prescribed in the Act. The Prosecution, in the exercise of its discretion, charged Kannan with importing a 
reduced
 quantity (9.99g) of diamorphine, resulting in a corresponding 
reduction
 in the severity of punishment that could be imposed on Kannan. For this offence, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of between 5 and 30 years’ imprisonment with a minimum of 5 strokes of the cane.
4       I pause to observe that there is a slight difference in the structure of the punishments for the offence of importation of diamorphine under s 7 and of trafficking the same under s 5 of the Act. The punishment prescribed for importation offences ranges from 5 to 30 years’ imprisonment with a minimum of 5 strokes of cane save for (i) cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 10g in which case the prescribed punishment range is between 20 and 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and (ii) cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 15g in which case the death sentence is mandatory. The punishment range prescribed for trafficking offences is 5 to 20 years’ imprisonment with a minimum of 5 strokes of the cane save for (i) cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 10g in which case the prescribed punishment range is between 20 to 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and (ii) cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 15g in which case the death sentence is mandatory. Notwithstanding this difference, I do not think that in practice the precedents have drawn any distinction between the sentences imposed for importation and trafficking: see for example 
Public Prosecutor v Kovalan A/L Mogan
 
[2013] SGDC 395
 at [24]. Furthermore, it is clear that the overall tenor of the punishment provisions for ss 5 and 7 of the Act is similar in that (i) a minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes is imposed in cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 10g and (ii) the death penalty is prescribed where the quantity of diamorphine involved exceeds 15g. It stands to reason, given the generally linear relationship between sentence and the quantity of diarmorphine imported or trafficked, that sentences below 20 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate in cases where the quantity of diamorphine involved falls below 10g even where importation offences are concerned. I therefore approach the remaining discussion on this basis.
5       On the basis of the indicative sentencing guidelines I set out in 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
 (“
Vasentha
”) at [47] for cases involving trafficking in a quantity of diamorphine of up to 9.99g, the reduced charge against Kannan would have attracted a punishment of around 15 years’ imprisonment as well as 10 to 11 strokes of cane in the absence of any compelling mitigating circumstances. Notwithstanding the guidelines set out in 
Vasentha
, the Prosecution prevailed upon the sentencing court to impose a much lower sentence on Kannan. Kannan was eventually sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, a marked and 
very
 substantial departure from the indicative guidelines set out in 
Vasentha
. No cogent explanation for the Prosecution’s sentencing position was put forward. The sentencing judge in Kannan’s case did not write a judgment explaining his reasons. Nor was any appeal filed by any party, which is unsurprising since Kannan was the beneficiary of a remarkably lenient sentence and this had been sought by the Prosecution. I concluded in the circumstances that the sentence imposed on Kannan was wrong in principle.
6       I take this opportunity to remind sentencing courts that sentencing is a matter that lies exclusively within their prerogative. While the Prosecution is expected to assist the court in this task, it is for the sentencing court to determine what sentence would be just in all the circumstances. And while sentencing courts should not slavishly apply sentencing benchmarks and tariffs, the judicial prerogative to depart from such guidelines must be exercised in a 
reasoned
 and 
measured
 manner and only in 
appropriate
 cases: 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1
 at [24].
7       I also take this opportunity to remind the Prosecution of what I said in the Opening Address that I delivered at the Sentencing Conference held in 2014 (
Singapore Law Gazette
 (February 2012)) on the duty of the Prosecution in relation to sentencing. On that occasion, I said at paras 34 to 39:
34    … 
The Prosecution owes a duty to the Court and to the wider public to ensure that the factually guilty and only the factually guilty are convicted, and that all relevant material is placed before the Court to assist it in its determination of the truth. This duty extends to the stage of sentencing where the Prosecution should place all the relevant facts of the offence and the offender before the Court. Furthermore, the Prosecution should always be prepared to assist the Court on any issues of sentencing. But what does this mean in practical terms?
35    It is perhaps possible to extrapolate from those principles that are widely accepted and to arrive at some thoughts about the prosecutorial role in sentencing. First, the Prosecution acts only in the public interest. That immediately distinguishes it from those who appear in a private law suit to pursue the interest of a private client. On this basis, there would generally be no need for the Prosecution to adopt a strictly adversarial position. Second, that public interest extends not only to securing the conviction in a lawful and ethical manner of those who are factually guilty, but also to securing the appropriate sentence.
36    The latter point is a critical one. Private victories tend to be measured by the size of the damages awarded or the pain inflicted on the opposing side. But the prosecutorial function is not calibrated by that scale. The appropriate sentence will often not bear a linear relationship to the circumstances. … Hence, this calls for the Prosecution to reflect on why it takes a particular view of what sentence is called for in a given case and to articulate those considerations so that the sentencing Judge can assess these and assign them the appropriate weight.
37    I suggest that the Prosecution can play a vital role by identifying to the Court:
a.    The relevant sentencing precedents, benchmarks and guidelines;
b.    The relevant facts and circumstances of the offence and of the offender that inform where in the range of sentences the case at hand may be situated;
c.    The offender’s suitability and other relevant considerations that may bear upon whether particular sentencing options that might be available should be invoked;
d.    The relevant aggravating and mitigating considerations;
e.    The relevant considerations that pertain to aggregating sentences[;]
f.    Any particular interest or consideration that is relevant and that pertains to the victim; and
g.    Where it may be appropriate to order compensation to be paid to the victim, the relevant considerations (including the appropriate quantum).
38    While the Prosecution may take the position that a certain sentencing range is appropriate in the circumstances, 
it must present all the relevant materials to enable the Court to come to its own conclusion as to what the just sentence should be
.
39    These broad guidelines can be supplemented with another very practical point. 
All the relevant facts must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and in guilty pleas, the accused must know all the facts on the basis of which he pleaded guilty. For the Prosecution to raise a fact undisclosed in the statement of facts or ask the Court to draw an inference from the facts at the stage of sentencing may be unfairly prejudicial to the offender, who cannot be punished for something that is not proven. Hence, the statement of facts must be prepared with this in mind.
[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis in italics added]
8       In my judgment, this guidance would serve the Prosecution well in framing its sentencing submissions in future cases. Sentencing courts are greatly assisted by submissions from the Prosecution because these are taken to be made in the public interest. But it is nevertheless incumbent on the sentencing court to evaluate the cogency of the position that is taken by the Prosecution, which for its part, is obliged to place the relevant materials before the court to enable it “to come to its own conclusion as to what the just sentence should be”.
The proceedings in the court below
9       Before the District Judge, the Prosecution sought a sentence of between 7 and 8 years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that there were signs of syndication since the “number of persons involved [was] more than [the Appellant] & Kannan” notwithstanding that the element of syndication was not specifically mentioned in the Statement of Facts (“SOF”).
[note: 1]
 I pause here to note that save for the mention of three persons who participated in the drug run (namely, Kannan, the appellant and one Krishnamurthi Pradheeb Eluthachan (“Krishnamurthi”) who ferried Kannan to Singapore on a motorcycle), the SOF did not even hint of any other features of syndication. The Prosecution also argued that the Appellant was more culpable than Kannan on the basis that Kannan’s standing in the syndicate must have been lower than the Appellant’s, and urged the District Judge to impose a more severe sentence on the Appellant as compared to the sentence of 6 years’ and 5 strokes of the cane that had been imposed on Kannan.
10     The District Judge was persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that the offence was a syndicated one. In her view, there was a hierarchy of command because the Appellant “received instructions from his superior which he then passed to Kannan to perform”, and “within this hierarchy, other person or persons recruited Kannan and promised him payment”.
[note: 2]
11     The District Judge also agreed that the Appellant was more culpable than Kannan because he had an “active and important role”
[note: 3]
 in the drug run whereas “Kannan was a mere tool”.
[note: 4]
 She took the view that the appellant “with his knowledge, experience and position in the hierarchy, had instructed and taught Kannan what to do” and had “sent the young Kannan to commit the act while he … remained safely in Malaysia”.
[note: 5]
 Therefore, the District Judge held that the Appellant’s custodial sentence could not be less severe than Kannan’s sentence since he was more culpable than Kannan, and sentenced the Appellant to 7 years’ imprisonment.
My decision
12     There were two main planks to the Appellant’s contentions in this appeal. First, the Appellant submitted that the District Judge had misapplied the principle of parity and had failed to consider the range of punishment prescribed for offences under s 13(
aa
). Secondly, the Appellant contended that the District Judge had erred in finding that the transaction was part of a syndicated enterprise.
13     Before me, the Prosecution submitted that a term of between 7 and 8 years’ imprisonment was appropriate and justified because it reflected the relative culpability of the Appellant and Kannan. The gist of this submission is neatly encapsulated in the following paragraph from the Prosecution’s written submissions:
44    We acknowledge that the sentence sought in respect of Kannan was not in accordance with the sentencing framework laid down in 
Vasentha
 – this was necessary, however, to ensure parity in sentencing between an offender of greater culpability (
ie
, the appellant) versus an offender of lower culpability (
ie
, Kannan) in the same criminal enterprise and was achieved through the eventual imposition of a higher sentence for the appellant. In this regard, we note the caution sounded by the High Court against excessive obeisance to sentencing precedents … and therefore calibrated our sentencing approach towards Kannan to avoid any such injustice in punishment. The desirability of consistency cannot, after all detract from the need for individualised justice.
14     With great respect to the Prosecution, and also to the District Judge who seemed to accept it, this submission is wrong in principle for a number of reasons. 
First
, the primary offender (namely, Kannan) should have been sentenced to a term that was well outside the sentencing range for the s 13(
aa
) offence. It would be wrong in principle to think that the sentence to be imposed on the primary offender should be manipulated in some way to serve the ends of relative culpability as the Prosecution sees it. As I have noted at the outset of my judgment (see at [2] above), it is simply impossible to directly correlate the range of sentences under s 13(
aa
) with that applicable to the range of primary offences in that manner because the former encompasses a range that is both higher (at the low end) and lower (at the high end) than the latter.
15     Aside from this, the approach taken by the Prosecution in relation to Kannan also threatens to throw into disarray the applicable sentencing guidelines for all the other cases involving drug traffickers whether they are couriers or not, a point which the Prosecution candidly accepted. There is often little to distinguish the culpability of couriers who transport quantities of such drugs. How is “individualised justice” served when another courier carrying a similar quantity as Kannan is to be sentenced? I therefore said in no uncertain terms in my brief oral grounds when I disposed of the appeal that the sentence imposed in Kannan’s case should not be regarded as having any precedential value and I reiterate that given the absence of any cogent explanation, it should be regarded as wrong in principle.
16      
Secondly
, because the punishment provision for s 13(
aa
) offences covers a wide range of underlying offending behaviour, in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence, in my judgment, the sentencing court should have regard to two primary considerations in determining what the appropriate sentence should be within the range prescribed for the offence at hand. These are:
(a)     The gravity of the underlying offence; and
(b)     The actual culpability of the offender who is before the court facing a charge for an offence under s 13(
aa
).
17     I elaborate briefly on each of these points.
The gravity of the underlying offence
18     The language of s 13(
aa
) makes it clear that the offence under that section is for abetting another “
offence under
 [
the
] 
Act
”. In my judgment, this would, at least as a starting point, require the sentencing court to have regard to the underlying offending behaviour that the primary offender has been charged with. The point has particular significance here because there was a substantial difference between Kannan’s underlying offending behaviour, which was importing 10.38g of diamorphine on the one hand, and that with which he was charged, which was importing not less than 9.99g of diamorphine. As noted above at [3], this has a material impact on the applicable range of punishments. In this respect, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor, Mr Wong, submitted that it was within the discretion of the Prosecution to reduce the charge against Kannan; and he submitted that the fact it has chosen to do so should not affect the sentence imposed on the Appellant.
19     The issue before me was this: whether the court is entitled to have regard to the actual offence with which the primary offender was charged in assessing the gravity of the underlying offence. While I rejected the Prosecution’s submission that the parity principle mandated the imposition of a harsher sentence on the Appellant, I accepted that parity could apply in a broader sense when assessing the gravity of the offence that the Appellant had been charged with abetting. I am aware that there are authorities dating back to the 1990s that suggest that the issue of parity becomes irrelevant once co-offenders have been charged with different offences as there would no longer be any basis for comparison: see for example 
Tay Huay Hong v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 290
 at [39]–[40] and 
Phua Song Hua v Public Prosecutor
 
[2004] SGHC 33
 at [38]. However, I do not think that those cases support the proposition that the court should be blind to the actual offence with which the primary offender was charged. Indeed, I note that Chao Hick Tin JA, in 
Lim Bee Ngan Karen v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 4 SLR 1120
, having examined the authorities, including some from other jurisdictions, left the door open to the application of the principle of parity where participants in a common criminal enterprise are charged with different offences. Chao JA took the view that the principle of parity could, with appropriate limitations, be applied in such cases and much will depend on why different charging decisions were made in respect of the co-offenders ([38] and [41]).
20     While the present appeal concerned the correlation between the sentence of an abettor and the offence for which the primary offender was charged rather than parity in their sentences, I agreed with the general approach taken by Chao JA and prefer the view that the court should consider the matter in the round. On this basis, I considered that the sentencing court when dealing with an offence under s 13(
aa
) of the Act would be entitled to have regard to the offence that the underlying offender was actually charged with as a relevant factor in the overall analysis, if it is looking to achieve a measure of appropriate relativity between the offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise, at least to the extent this is possible within the context of the sentencing range applicable to each of them. Mr Wong was undoubtedly correct that it was within the discretion of the Prosecution to charge Kannan on the basis of the lower quantity. But if they chose to do that, I do not think, in the absence of some explanation, the Prosecution can then urge the court to shut its eyes to the fact that they have exercised their discretion in a particular way in relation to the primary offence, when it comes to sentencing the offender for the secondary offence under s 13(
aa
).
21     Of course it may be the case that the Prosecution has exercised its discretion in favour of the primary offender on account of personal mitigating factors, such as his vulnerability owing to his youth or immaturity. In such circumstances, there would seem to be no reason in principle why the benefit of any reduction in the charge against the primary offender should benefit the abettor. Similarly, there might be instances where the Prosecution is not in a position to proceed against the primary offender. Yet if it has the evidence, there would seem to be no reason in principle why it ought not to be able to proceed against the secondary offender under s 13(
aa
) without regard to the fact that it has not done so against the primary offender. In such cases, the court might (and likely would) proceed to sentence the offender under s 13(
aa
) on the basis of the offending conduct with which he has been charged, without regard to the offence with which the primary offender has been charged (if at all).
22     Mr Wong submitted that the reason the Prosecution reduced the charge against Kannan is to be found in the Prosecution’s view and submission that the Appellant is more culpable than Kannan. With respect, this misses the point and as noted at [2] and [14] above, this rests on a misconception as to how the primary and secondary offenders should be punished in these cases. The Appellant might well be more culpable than Kannan but given that the two offenders have been charged with different offences, the Appellant’s sentence must ultimately be calibrated by reference to the range of punishments that is prescribed for 
his
 offence and any attempt to achieve relativity between the offenders should be undertaken within this context.
The actual culpability of the offender
23     I turn to the next factor which is the actual culpability of the offender who is before the court. Here too I regard the position of the Prosecution as being incorrect in principle. The true inquiry in my judgment is framed by reference to where, in the broad spectrum of conduct that is encompassed by the types of 
abetment
 referred to in s 13(
aa
), the particular conduct of the particular offender before the court falls. The section covers acts ranging from assisting to instigating, procuring and even coercing the commission of the underlying offence. The real focus of the inquiry should be on where, in that range, the conduct of the abettor falls.
24     That inquiry may well require the court to consider the relative actions of the primary offender and the abettor. But this would be an incidental inquiry directed at determining the culpability of the abettor rather than to assess the appropriate or comparative penalties to be visited upon each of them. This can be illustrated with a brief example: suppose that the abettor 
coerces
 a courier to transport 25g of diamorphine by threatening to injure him. The courier will face the death penalty if he is convicted; or if he can bring himself within the relevant provisions of the Act, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment; or if the Prosecution chooses to reduce the quantity of diamorphine in respect of which he is charged to 14.99g he may face a sentence of between 20 and 30 years’ imprisonment with a minimum of 15 strokes. But in any of these situations, the primary offender will face a punishment that is substantially higher than that of abettor who, even assuming the most serious type of underlying offence and the most egregious type of abetment, cannot be sentenced to more than 10 years’ imprisonment and a $40,000 fine.
25     In the present case, Kannan, the primary offender, was charged with an offence that carried a punishment ranging from 5 to 30 years’ imprisonment. As I was not persuaded that there was any reason to ignore the actual charge that was preferred against Kannan, I approached the case on that footing. I ignored the erroneous sentence that was imposed on Kannan (namely 6 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane) and consider the putative sentence that should, in my judgment, have been imposed (which is a term of imprisonment of around 15 years with around 11 strokes of the cane). On this basis, Kannan’s offence, although serious, would attract a punishment that is well below the punishments prescribed for the most serious offences under the Act which, as I have said, include sentences of death, life imprisonment or imprisonment terms of between 20 and 30 years. Since the offence abetted by the Appellant is not close to the most serious of offences under the Act, it stands to reason that he should not be sentenced to suffer a punishment that falls near the highest end of the sentencing range for s 13(
aa
) offences. At the same time, the primary offence was a serious offence under the Act. I was thus of the view that a starting point of between 5 and 6 years’ imprisonment would have been appropriate in the instant case.
26     I then turned to consider the actual culpability of the Appellant. The Prosecution contended that the Appellant was more culpable than Kannan. Although for the reasons I have outlined at [24] above, I did not think this was 
directly
 relevant, I nevertheless considered the Prosecution’s complaint on the footing that what they are contending is that the nature of the abetment in this case is of a more egregious variety 
because
 the Appellant allegedly prevailed upon Kannan to commit the underlying offence. To make this good, they contended, as they did in the court below, that the present case involves a syndicated offence. I did not accept this contention. The element of syndication would be a seriously aggravating factor (see 
Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] 3 SLR 180
 at [31]) but it is nowhere to be found in the SOF. The SOF mentions three persons involved in the drug run, namely, the Appellant, Kannan and Krishnamurthi. In the Appellant’s mitigation submissions before the court below, it was argued that the Appellant was merely passing on instructions to Kannan. In other words that he was nothing more than a messenger. The Prosecution argues however, that there must have been a chain of command and the Appellant, who was in charge of relaying instructions to Kannan, must have been higher up in that hierarchy as compared to Kannan. On this basis, they say an inference should be drawn that this was a syndicated operation.
27     It is true that some flexibility in respect of standard of proof and evidentiary sources is typically accorded to both the Prosecution and the defence in the sentencing process: 
Public Prosecutor v Aniza bte Essa
 
[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327
 at [60]–[62]. However, the degree of flexibility that is to be accorded must ultimately depend on the materiality of the fact in question and the possible prejudice that could be caused to the position either of the Prosecution or the Defence by taking a particular fact into account. It is apposite to refer once again to the extract from my speech which has been referred to above at [7]. I would underscore, in particular, the point made at para 39 of the speech, which is that it may be unfairly prejudicial to the offender if the Prosecution were to raise a fact undisclosed in the SOF or ask the court to draw an inference from the facts at the stage of sentencing, which the accused was not aware of when he entered his plea. Where a material factor that either aggravates or mitigates the offence is to be put forward by either the Prosecution or the Defence, then it is incumbent on them to either have it agreed, or to prove it. Such proof can be by way of evidence adduced at a 
Newton
 hearing (see 
Ng Chun Hian v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] 2 SLR 783
 at [24]); or on the basis of submissions without adducing further evidence for this purpose (see 
R v Robert John Newton
 (1982) 4 Cr App R(S) 388 cited in 
Public Prosecutor v Soh Song Soon
 
[2010] 1 SLR 857
 at [3]). But where the latter course is taken, the burden will be on the Prosecution to persuade the court that the aggravating facts it wishes to rely on are supported by the SOF. In this regard, the court would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the relevant inferences should be drawn: see for example 
Public Prosecutor v Liew Kim Choo
 
[1997] 2 SLR(R) 716
 at [64]. And where the inference sought by the Prosecution is not an irresistible one, the doubt will be resolved in favour of the accused.
28     With this in mind and having perused the SOF in this case, I was satisfied that it could not reasonably be inferred that the Appellant was a member of a syndicate. The SOF did not allege that the Appellant was even acquainted with Krishnamurthi. Further, the mere fact that the Appellant was relaying instructions to Kannan did not, in my judgment, inexorably lead to the conclusion that the Appellant was part of a syndicate and was higher up in the chain of command. It would not be right to disregard the possibility that the Appellant was a mere messenger as opposed to someone who was remotely directing or controlling the operations of a drug syndicate as suggested by the Prosecution. Therefore, in view of the fact that syndication is a seriously aggravating factor and that there was insufficient basis to support such a finding, I did not think it safe or fair to count it against the Appellant for the purpose of sentencing. This did not mean that the Appellant was not 
in fact
 part of a syndicate; it only meant that evidence of his participation in a syndicated drug network was absent and therefore, could not be used to aggravate his culpability so as to enhance his sentence. On balance, in my judgment, nothing in the SOF warranted the imposition of a sentence that was higher than the starting point of between 5 and 6 years’ imprisonment.
29     Lastly, the Appellant’s plea of guilt was a relevant mitigating factor in my judgment. While his plea of guilt came late in the proceedings, it had the benefit of advancing the administration of justice and saved the court, the Prosecution and public the time and costs of a full trial. Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Too, urged upon me that this is a case where the Prosecution did not have the benefit of any presumptions at law that it could rely on to make out their case against the Appellant. Indeed, they were entirely dependent on the evidence of a co-offender, Kannan. Hence, had the matter gone to trial, it could not be said with certainty that the Prosecution would have prevailed and the Appellant’s decision to plead guilty should be regarded as evidencing remorse and therefore treated as a significant mitigating factor. In my judgment, Mr Too is correct in these points. I would only add that the Prosecution’s principal witness, had the matter gone to trial, would have been a co-offender, Kannan, who had been sentenced to an inexplicably lenient sentence of six years’ imprisonment at the urging of the Prosecution when he should have been sentenced to an imprisonment term that was 2 or 2.5 times as long. This might well have been a relevant factor that could have been taken into account in assessing the weight of his evidence.
Conclusion
30     In the circumstances, I considered that the initial starting position should be reduced on account of this mitigating factor. I therefore allowed the appeal and reduced the term of imprisonment from a term of 7 years to a term of 4.5 years, backdated to 10 September 2014.

 Woo Bih Li J:
Introduction
1       This is a claim in negligence regarding the post-operative care of a patient who underwent a surgical procedure known as a Whipple operation. Unfortunately, the patient encountered post-operative complications and eventually passed away. The Defendant was the surgeon who performed the operation, and was in charge of the patient's post-operative care.
2       The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant ought to have, at various time-points after the operation, suspected or diagnosed a post-operative complication and performed a Computed Tomography (“CT”) scan of the patient’s chest, abdomen, and pelvis (an “abdominal CT scan”). This would have led the Defendant to perform certain interventional procedures earlier than was in fact done. Those procedures would have saved the patient's life.
3       The Defendant submits that there was no reason, at the time-points put forward by the Plaintiff, to suspect or diagnose the complication, and, in any event, it was reasonable not to have performed the abdominal CT scan earlier. Moreover, the Defendant denies that an earlier CT scan would have altered the course of the patient's post-operative management.
Background
4       The deceased, Mdm Lee Lee Chan (“Mdm Lee”), was 59 years of age at her passing on 28 July 2011. The Plaintiff is the widower of Mdm Lee and is also the administrator of her estate. The Defendant, Dr London Lucien Ooi Peng Jin, is a Senior Consultant Surgeon at Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) specializing in hepato-pancreato-biliary (“HPB”) surgery,
[note: 1]
ie
, surgeries involving the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts.
5       On 4 July 2011, Mdm Lee underwent a Whipple operation performed by the Defendant to remove a tumour on the head of her pancreas. While under post-operative care, she suffered several complications, and passed away on 28 July 2011.
[note: 2]
 Her final cause of death was as follows:
[note: 3]
IA)    ACUTE HAEMORRHAGE FROM THE PORTAL VEIN IN A CASE OF SEPTICAEMIA DUE TO
IB)     
DEHISCENCE
 OF THE 
ANASTOMOTIC SITES
 OF A WHIPPLE OPERATION
[Emphasis added]
6       The Plaintiff now claims against the Defendant in negligence in his capacity as the administrator of Mdm Lee’s estate.
7       All material events took place in July 2011. For brevity, I will omit the year in subsequent descriptions of Mdm Lee's treatment, and will where appropriate identify treatment dates by their post-operative day (“POD”) numbers, 
ie
, POD1 (4 July) through POD25 (28 July).
Whipple operation
8       The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. At its head is the duodenum (
ie
, the first section of the small intestines) and the bile duct (
ie
, the tube joining the liver to the pancreas).
[note: 4]
9       In a Whipple operation, the pancreatic head, the gallbladder, and part of the bile duct, stomach, and small intestines are removed. The remnants of the pancreas, bile duct, and stomach are then anastomosed (
ie
, reconnected) to the gastrointestinal tract to facilitate normal digestion and absorption of food.
[note: 5]
10     Mdm Lee had three anastomoses during her Whipple operation:
(a)     a hepaticojejunostomy, which joined her bile duct to her small intestines;
(b)     a gastrojejunostomy, which joined her stomach to her small intestines; and
(c)     a pancreaticogastrostomy (a “PG”), which joined her pancreas to her stomach.
Allegations and issues
11     In his Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (the “SOC”), the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant:
[note: 6]
(a)     failed to obtain the informed consent of Mdm Lee to the Whipple operation;
(b)     failed to perform the Whipple operation and two subsequent surgeries in the manner required of an HPB specialist; and
(c)     failed to deliver timely and appropriate post-operative care.
12     At or around the beginning of the trial, the Plaintiff narrowed his claim to a single allegation, 
ie
, that the Defendant failed to offer timely and appropriate care between the Whipple operation and two subsequent surgeries.
[note: 7]
13     The Plaintiff submitted that by 7 July (POD3), Mdm Lee had suffered “an anastomotic leak of the anastomotic sites of the Whipple Operation”,
[note: 8]
 which the Defendant failed to investigate, diagnose, and treat timeously. By the time the anastomotic leak was diagnosed on 17 July, it had deteriorated severely. Thereafter, despite knowing of the anastomotic leak, the Defendant failed to manage Mdm Lee appropriately. Up until 24 July, he failed to investigate whether her fluid collections were adequately drained by the existing abdominal drains, and to intervene via a percutaneous drainage procedure (
ie
, inserting a small tube through the skin to drain fluid in the abdomen) into any undrained fluid collections. By the time the Defendant decided to perform a percutaneous drainage procedure on 24 July, Mdm Lee’s condition had become unsalvageable.
14     The Defendant submitted that Mdm Lee did not have an anastomotic leak until 2300hrs on 16 July, and was managed appropriately both before and after that time:
(a)     Before 2300hrs on 16 July, it sufficed for the Defendant to have simply suspected, but neither investigated nor diagnosed, an anastomotic leak. In any event, his management and treatment of Mdm Lee would have been substantially the same even if she had been diagnosed with an anastomotic leak.
(b)     Following the occurrence of an anastomotic leak at 2300hrs on 16 July, it was appropriate for the Defendant to have managed Mdm Lee with non-surgical measures.
[note: 9]
 She was too unstable for invasive intervention, whether in the form of a laparotomy (
ie
, opening up the abdomen to wash it out and close the disrupted anastomosis), or a percutaneous drainage procedure to remove the undrained fluids in the abdomen.
[note: 10]
 Hence, she was managed non-surgically to optimise her condition for the definitive intervention of a laparotomy.
The law on negligence
15     The applicable legal principles are not in dispute. In Singapore, the leading authority on medical negligence is 
Khoo James and another v Gunapathy d/o Muniandy and another appeal
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 1024
 (“
Gunapathy
”). The test is as stated in 
Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee
 
[1957] 1 WLR 582
 (“
Bolam
”) at 587:
[A doctor] is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a 
practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular act
 … Putting it the other way round, a [doctor] is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a body of opinion who would take a contrary view.
[Emphasis added]
16     The Court of Appeal in 
Gunapathy
 added (at [59]) that the 
Bolam
 test has been supplemented by the House of Lords decision in 
Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority
 
[1998] AC 232
 (“
Bolitho
”). Since 
Bolitho
, a defendant-doctor will not be exonerated simply because a body of experts testifies in his favour. An expert view must satisfy the “threshold test of logic” in order to constitute, in the words of 
Bolam
, “a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular act.” The expert must have directed his mind to the comparative risks and benefits of each possible course of action, and reached a “defensible conclusion” after balancing these risks and benefits. The conclusion must be internally consistent on its face, and must not ignore or controvert known medical facts and advances in medical knowledge (
Gunapathy
 at [63]–[65] and [109]). Further, as Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) stated in 
D’Conceicao Jeanie Doris (administratrix of the estate of Milakov Steven, deceased) v Tong Ming Chuan
 
[2011] SGHC 193
 at [109]:
The fact that a doctor acknowledges the practice of one group of doctors while stating that he would have opted for a different course does not of itself cause his opinion to become inconsistent. … an expert can provide evidence of what practices are accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men by stating his view of what he believes other doctors would have done (even if he would not himself have adopted that course).
17     An allegation that a doctor was negligent in failing to order a post-operative diagnostic test must be positively proved, and the medical basis for ordering the test must be affirmatively established. A doctor would not be negligent simply because there was no harm in ordering the test (
Chua Thong Jiang Andrew v Yue Wai Mun and another
 
[2015] SGHC 119
 at [66]–[69]).

Suspicion of anastomotic dehiscence: 7 to 16 July
Post-operative Pancreatic Fistula
20     On 7 July (POD3), Mdm Lee had amylase levels of 1,361U/L and 1,942U/L respectively in her right and left operatively-inserted drains.
[note: 28]
 These levels were respectively 7.3x and 10.4x of her normal serum amylase level of 186U/L.
[note: 29]
 Citing Claudio Bassi 
et al
, “Postoperative pancreatic fistula: an international study group (ISGPF) definition” (2005) 138(1) 
Surgery
 8 (the “Bassi Article”), the Plaintiff submitted that, in view of these results, the Defendant should have suspected or diagnosed an anastomotic leak. This was initially denied by the Defendant.
21     A patient with a POD3 drain amylase level of over 3x her normal serum amylase level has, by definition, a post-operative pancreatic fistula (a “POPF”). This authoritative test for a POPF is found in the Bassi Article at p 10 (“the ISGPF Test”):
Output via an operatively placed drain (or a subsequently placed, percutaneous drain) of any measurable volume of drain ﬂuid on or after postoperative day 3, with an amylase content greater than 3 times the upper normal serum value.
Because there was much argument over the meaning of the Bassi Article, I have annexed a copy of it to this Judgment.
22     Based on her drain amylase level on 7 July, Mdm Lee had a POPF. Although Dr Mak accepted this, he did not equate the POPF with an anastomotic leak. He added only that the prognosis on 7 July was that the POPF would resolve spontaneously.
[note: 30]
 The disputes between the parties were thus as follows:
(a)     whether a POPF was to be equated with an anastomotic leak in the context of a Whipple operation; and
(b)     if so, whether the Defendant should at least have suspected that Mdm Lee might have had such an anastomotic leak given her drain amylase levels on 7 July.
23     The Plaintiff submitted that in the accepted medical literature, the terms “leak” and “POPF” are synonymous and interchangeable. Accordingly, Mdm Lee had by 7 July suffered from, and should have been diagnosed with, an anastomotic leak. He referred to the following passage from the Bassi Article (at p 10) to support his contention:
[note: 31]
[T]here is considerable overlap of the terms fistula and leak; they appear to be contingent definitions, and the terms fistula, leak, leakage, and anastomotic insufficiency should be considered interchangeable.
24     The Defendant submitted that the terms “POPF”, “anastomotic dehiscence”, and “anastomotic leak” are distinct. Even if Mdm Lee had a POPF on 7 July, she did not necessarily have an anastomotic leak. I set out the Defendant’s definitions of these terms:
[note: 32]
(a)     POPF: a leakage of pancreatic fluid into the abdominal cavity that results in drain output on or after POD3 with an amylase content of over 3x the serum amylase activity, 
without any indication of the mechanism
 by which the leakage actually occurred.
[note: 33]
(b)     Anastomotic dehiscence: a rupture or disruption in an anastomosis (the PG anastomosis in Mdm Lee’s case) that results in a 
gap in the anastomosis
 through which contents of the stomach and pancreas can leak into the abdominal cavity.
[note: 34]
(c)     Anastomotic leak: an anastomotic dehiscence that results in 
leakage
 of the contents of the stomach and pancreas into the abdominal cavity.
[note: 35]
Since a anastomotic dehiscence is the mechanism through which an anastomotic leak occurs, I will refer to both the complications of an anastomotic leak and an anastomotic dehiscence simply as a “Dehiscence”.
25     The Defendant claimed in his closing submissions that he had from POD3 (7 July) suspected a Dehiscence based on Mdm Lee’s elevated drain amylase level, even though there was no need to have documented it:
[note: 36]
Prof Ooi’s evidence was that since reviewing Mdm Lee’s POD 3 drain amylase test result up to 17 July 2011, he had kept the suspicion of the possibility of an anastomotic leak in mind during his treatment and management of Mdm Lee.
26     This submission stood in stark contrast to the Defendant’s pleadings and evidence-in-chief. In the Defence, Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase levels were omitted entirely from the Defendant’s account of his observations and decisions from 4 to 16 July.
[note: 37]
 This was even though the SOC had described the drain fluid amylase level of 1,361U/L (for the right drain) on 7 July, as a finding that “reflected a clear possibility of a pancreatic leak.”
[note: 38]
27     As chronicled in the Defence, Mdm Lee was first observed for indications of a Dehiscence late in the night of 16 July when she complained of sudden abdominal pain.
[note: 39]
 An abdominal CT scan in the morning of 17 July showed a possible Dehiscence.
[note: 40]
 Only thereafter was she “diagnosed” with “septic shock likely secondary to anastomotic leak”.
[note: 41]
 The Defendant then pleaded that “[o]n 17 July 2011, an anastomotic leak was suspected.”
[note: 42]
 This suggested that he did not even suspect a Dehiscence until 17 July.
28     The Defendant pleaded also that from 4 to 16 July, “[t]he volume of fluid drained from [Mdm Lee’s] abdominal drains, the fluid amylase levels, and the occasional pain were not unusual.”
[note: 43]
 He stated also in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) that her drain amylase level on 7 July “was slightly elevated but was not unusual”.
[note: 44]
 These were remarkable statements. The fluid amylase levels in [Mdm Lee’s] right and left drains on 7 July were respectively 7.3x and 10.4x her normal serum amylase levels (see [20] above). These far exceeded the [3x] threshold for identifying the existence of a POPF under the Bassi Article. Even Dr Mak described Mdm Lee’s drain amylase levels on POD3 as “high”.
[note: 45]
29     The Defendant stated further in his AEIC that amylase-rich pancreatic fluid spilt during the Whipple surgery “may not have been totally washed away during surgery … will persist for a few days post-operatively and … therefore be measureable or detectable in the abdominal drains.” It was thus “more relevant to monitor for a possible anastomotic leak through observing the colour and volume of the drain [fluids].” For Mdm Lee, “the colour of the drain fluid was not worrisome or suggestive of any form of anastomotic leak until 17 July”.
[note: 46]
30     In his oral evidence, the Defendant put forward two additional explanations for Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase level: (i) seepage of pancreatic fluid through the suture holes along anastomoses, and (ii) release of amylase-rich exudate due to pancreatitis or irritation of the pancreas. In support of these contentions, the Defendant cited Vladimir D Dugalic 
et al
, “Drain amylase value as an early predictor of pancreatic fistula after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy” (2014) 20(26) 
World Journal of Gastroenterology
 8691 (the “Dugalic Article”) at 8695.
[note: 47]
31     Hence, the Defendant offered four explanations in total for Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase level: (i) retention of pancreatic fluid spilt during surgery; (ii) seepage of pancreatic fluid through anastomotic sutures; (iii) release of amylase-rich exudate due to pancreatitis or irritation of the pancreas, and (iv) a Dehiscence. I will refer to the first three explanations as the “benign explanations”.
32     Although the Bassi Article acknowledged (at p 8) that, conceptually, a POPF describes not only a Dehiscence but also a parenchymal leak not directly related to an anastomosis, it was written with the objective of producing a universal test to identify a Dehiscence. The focus of the research was on the link between an elevated POD3 drain amylase level and the existence of a Dehiscence after pancreatic resection. In my view, the Bassi Article was written to set out an objective international biochemical test to diagnose, or at least to suspect, the existence of a Dehiscence. Although the existence of a POPF does not conclusively prove the existence of a Dehiscence, the Bassi Article treated the two concepts synonymously. Given the undisputed authoritativeness of the Bassi Article on the post-operative management of patients after a Whipple operation, I find that the Defendant should have at a minimum suspected the existence of a Dehiscence based on the fact that Mdm Lee had, by definition, a POPF on 7 July.
33     The benign explanations for Mdm Lee’s POPF put forth by the Defendant (at [31] above) did not assist him. As Dr Mak clarified, one would expect the benign explanations for an elevated drain amylase level to be “self-limited” and settle within a few days of a Whipple operation.
[note: 48]
 The Bassi Article advocated conducting the drain amylase test for identifying a POPF “on or after [POD3] simply because one hopes that by the third day, you might exclude some of the other possible causes for amylase being present in the fluid.”
[note: 49]
 This was also the view of Dr Nikfarjam, who opined that “stitch holes often seal up, and they don't persist beyond day 3. Anastomotic leaks, on the other hand, of any significance would persist.”
[note: 50]
34     In other words, the reason for measuring the drain amylase level on POD3, and not earlier, is precisely to exclude the benign explanations as likely causes of an elevated drain amylase level. Further, although the Defendant relied on the benign explanations to account for Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase level, he could not exclude a Dehiscence as a possible cause of the same. Indeed, based on the Bassi Article, a Dehiscence was not simply a possible but rather a 
likely
 cause of her elevated POD3 drain amylase level. Hence, the Defendant should have at least suspected that Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence.
35     Although the Defendant could not overtly deny that the Bassi Article was relevant and applicable to the circumstances at hand, he downplayed its utility during the trial and in his submissions.
36     First, the Defendant referred to Yi-Ming Shyr, 
et al
, “Does drainage fluid amylase reflect pancreatic leakage after pancreaticoduodenectomy?” (2003) 27(5) 
World Journal of Surgery
 606, which appeared to suggest that elevated drain amylase levels do not indicate a Dehiscence.
[note: 51]
 However, this article was written two years before the Bassi Article, and its findings had been considered by the authors of the Bassi Article when they formulated their definition of a POPF (at p 11, footnote 49). More importantly, the Defendant had in his submissions accepted the Bassi Article as authoritative.
[note: 52]
37     Secondly, the Defendant submitted that the Bassi Article was intended purely to facilitate comparative study of surgical experiences.
[note: 53]
 However, the Bassi Article “suggest[ed] that use of [the] proposed definition of POPF will confirm its clinical value and allow accurate comparison of different surgical experiences” (at p 12). I note that the Defendant’s submissions quoted only the latter part of this sentence (which referred to the accurate comparison of surgical experiences),
[note: 54]
 but omitted any reference to the former part of the sentence (which confirmed the “clinical value” of the ISGPF Test).
38     Thirdly, the Defendant relied on Daniel J Moskovic, 
et al
, “Drain data to predict clinically relevant pancreatic fistula” (2010) 12 
Journal of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Billary Association
 472 to show that elevated drain amylase levels are not of themselves clinically significant.
[note: 55]
 However, the Bassi Article ascribed no clinical significance to the bare fact of an elevated POD3 drain amylase level. Instead, it proposed a three-tier 
ex post facto
 grading of the clinical significance of a POPF, with Grade A having no clinical impact (see [46] below).
39     Finally, the Defendant suggested that the volume and colour of the drain fluids were more important indicators of a Dehiscence than an elevated POD3 drain amylase level (see [29] above). However, the Bassi Article had examined the diagnostic value of the volume and quality of drain output before formulating its objective test for a POPF/Dehiscence by reference to the POD3 drain amylase level (at p 11). This is not to say that the volume and colour of the drain fluid are unimportant, but only that the absence of drain fluid of a large volume or a sinister colour does not detract from the possibility of a Dehiscence when the requirements of the ISGPF Test (at [21] above) are satisfied.
40     As noted above, the Bassi Article did not postulate that the existence of a Dehiscence is necessarily clinically significant. It thus suggested a three-tier grading based on the clinical significance of a Dehiscence (see [46] below). The Defendant appeared to have conflated the 
existence
 of a Dehiscence with its 
clinical significance
. Had he accepted the possible existence of a Dehiscence from 7 July (POD3) before the trial commenced, the many questions and arguments on the Bassi Article could have been avoided. I find that the Defendant’s stand and his attempts to draw a distinction between a POPF and a Dehiscence (in order to minimise the application of the ISGPF Test) contrived, especially since he did not reject the ISGPF Test outright. Indeed, it is telling that 
he belatedly alleged in his closing submissions that he had suspected a Dehiscence from 7 July
 (see [25] above). However, he was bound by his pleadings, which were to the effect that he did not suspect a Dehiscence until 17 July.
41     I would add only that the Plaintiff’s oral elaboration of his opening statement added to the confusion. It conflated the criteria for identifying the 
existence
 of a Dehiscence with that for assessing its 
severity
. I set out the statement of counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Tan Chee Meng, SC (“Mr Tan”).
[note: 56]
 
Mr Tan:
 
 
[T]he universally accepted test, is the test whereby the drain amylase level exits [
sic
] three times the serum level. That is indicative of a leak.
 
 
 
 
 
Your Honour, we are not saying that that is the only criteria. We are saying that the drain amylase test is universally accepted as the most objective test for any treating physician who are involved in a pancreatic surgery.
 
 
…
 
 
 
 
 
Court:
 
 
But on the one hand you tell me it is the most objective test, and on the other hand you say it is not the only criterion?
 
 
Mr Tan:
 
 
Yes. Because, your Honour, it would be wrong for me to say that just because it is three times over, therefore it is a leak, because there are other criteria that one looks at to ensure that such a possibility is minimised. This is based on the paper by Bassi, which my expert will bring your Honour through.
 
42     Dr Nikfarjam opined that a Dehiscence could be identified from an elevated POD3 drain amylase level alone. He took the view that Mr Tan’s statement above, that “there are other criteria that one looks at to ensure that [the] possibility [of a leak] is minimised”, was more accurately a statement that the severity of a leak could not be determined solely based on an elevated POD3 drain amylase level.
[note: 57]
43     On the other hand, Dr Beckingham accepted that Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase level gave rise only to a suspicion, and not necessarily a diagnosis, of a Dehiscence.
[note: 58]
44     For this case, the distinction between a suspicion and a diagnosis of a Dehiscence is not material. Both of the Plaintiffs’ experts testified that a Dehiscence is the most frequent major complication after pancreatic surgery.
[note: 59]
 Dr Mak acknowledged that a Dehiscence is the most severe cause of a POPF, “the one which we as surgeons are obliged to consider as our worst case scenario.”
[note: 60]
 I find that it was thus unreasonable for the Defendant to fail to even suspect a Dehiscence based on Mdm Lee’s elevated POD3 drain amylase level. In doing so, he fell below the standard of care expected of him.
45     I note that Dr Mak opined that “the possible [POPF] that was discovered on [7 July] was not directly related to the later anastomotic dehiscence” that the Defendant eventually diagnosed on 17 July (see [121] below). What Mdm Lee had on 7 July was a “transient or biochemical pancreatic fistulae” that settled spontaneously. Hence, “there was not any dehiscence of the [PG] anastomosis before 16
th
 July”.
[note: 61]
 However, the Defendant did not mention a transient or biochemical pancreatic fistulae in his evidence. Besides, as Dr Beckingham explained (by reference to the Dugalic Article (at p 8697)), the concept of “a fistula that wasn't there to start with and then developing later … after the 5th post-operative day” was doubtful.
[note: 62]
 In any event, Dr Mak conceded that “it [was] difficult to determine, if the fistulae had closed by 16
th
 July”.
[note: 63]
 Accordingly, I do not accept the suggestion that Mdm Lee had on 7 July a [transient] POPF that settled shortly thereafter and that was unrelated to the Dehiscence diagnosed on 17 July. Instead, she likely had a Dehiscence from 7 July. Although this Dehiscence was not clinically significant on 7 July, it deteriorated and had become much worse by 16 and 17 July.
Post-operative management
46     The Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that an abdominal CT scan should have been performed before 17 July to investigate Mdm Lee’s condition.
[note: 64]
 Had it been done, it would have confirmed the existence of a Dehiscence and revealed a need for intervention: specifically, a percutaneous drainage procedure to drain the collections of fluid in the abdomen that were inadequately drained by the existing operatively-inserted drains.
47     As a result, Mdm Lee did not have an abdominal CT scan until 17 July, by which time it was “too late” for any intervention to have changed her outcome:
[note: 65]
Mdm Lee's symptoms were indicative of anastomic [
sic
] dehiscence. Yet, the Defendant failed to order a full abdominal CT scan until 17 July 2011 by which time it was too late. Further, the Defendant failed to institute timely percutaneous drainage measures and/or conduct timely fluid amylase tests to rule out any anastomic [
sic
] dehiscence.
It bears mention that the last sentence is not an alternative plea, and therefore also refers to the same deadline of 17 July for the ordering of a full abdominal CT scan.
48     In my view, the mere fact that, on 7 July, Mdm Lee had a POPF shed little light on how she should have been managed thereafter. The Bassi Article cautioned that the ISGPF Test was “so inclusive that many asymptomatic patients that fit the definition of POPF may not be clinically ill”. It thus proposed a three-tier grading system for POPF (Grades A, B, C), depending on the extent to which the patient deviated from the normal post-operative course. Further, the grade of severity has little predictive value because it can be determined only retrospectively, 
ie
, at the end of the patient’s post-operative course, whether discharge from the hospital or death (at pp 10–11).
49     Although the Defendant fell below the standard of care expected of him in failing to even suspect a Dehiscence based on the elevated POD3 drain amylase level, he will not be liable in negligence unless it is shown that this omission caused the injuries suffered by Mdm Lee. Specifically, the Plaintiff must prove: (i) that the Defendant should have managed her differently if he had suspected a Dehiscence from 7 July, and (ii) that a different management would have changed the outcome of her case. Since the Plaintiff did not plead a loss of chance, this must be proved on a balance of probabilities.
50     Before any evidence was led on the first day of trial, the Defendant applied to amend his Defence to clarify that there would have been little change to Mdm Lee’s management even if a Dehiscence had been diagnosed before 17 July:
[note: 66]
Even if an anastomotic leak / dehiscence had in fact been present and diagnosed earlier than on 17 July 2011, in light of her condition during [4 to 16 July], she would have been treated in substantially the same manner as she had been contemporaneously treated …
51     I turn now to the post-operative management of Mdm Lee from 7 July according to the time-frames described in the Plaintiff’s submissions.
7 to 10 July: initial recovery
52     Dr Beckingham testified that “the earliest point at which it would have been reasonable to consider further intervention would be 11 July, and probably the latest point at which we should have been considering it was 17 or 18 July.”
[note: 67]
 Further, such intervention would have been performed only “on the assumption that you [have] do[ne] a CT scan which shows you something significant enough to warrant percutaneous drainage.”
[note: 68]
 Although Dr Beckingham subsequently retracted his evidence that percutaneous drainage could have been performed as late as 17 or 18 July, he nevertheless refrained from criticising Mdm Lee’s management before 11 July.
[note: 69]
 
Court:
 
 
But previously you had said earliest is the 11th, latest is 17th or 18
th
 … Which seemed to suggest … that even if you did not do it on the 11th, that is not necessarily negligence because you have given a range. So can you help me on that.
 
 
Dr Beckingham:
 
 
I will, your Honour. I will retract it for a start then. So it should have been done on the 11th. My only comment for saying the 17th was that -- or 18th, was that after that time, I am not sure it was going to make a great deal of difference, so my comment of the 11th to the 18th, is that was our window of opportunity. If we didn't do it on the 11th, there were still other opportunities to do it when it probably would have made a difference. But if we left it until after the 18th, even if we had done it at that time, I don't think it would have made a difference to the outcome in this case -- 18th, 19th. So yes, it should have been the 11th. Apologies for the confusion.
 
53     Dr Nikfarjam did not challenge Mdm Lee’s management prior to 11 July. From 7 to 8 July, despite her elevated POD3 drain amylase level, she had improved since her Whipple operation and was not unwell.
[note: 70]
 It was thus reasonable for the Defendant to have managed her the way he did.
[note: 71]
 On 9 July, Mdm Lee experienced respiratory compromise (
ie
, breathing difficulties) and shortness of breath,
[note: 72]
 and drained “haemoserous” fluid.
[note: 73]
 It was thus appropriate to have focussed on controlling these complications on 9 and 10 July.
[note: 74]
54     Accordingly, I am of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in his management of Mdm Lee from 7 to 10 July.
11 to 13 July: pleural effusion, free fluid in abdomen, and other factors
55     On 11 July, Mdm Lee’s breathing difficulties worsened. At 1205hrs, she was acidotic with an Arterial Blood Gas (“ABG”) level of pH7.290 (the “11 July ABG”).
[note: 75]
 At 1600hrs, her abdomen was “slightly distended”.
[note: 76]
 A chest X-ray showed bilateral basal atelectasis (
ie
, collapse of the lungs), and a right-sided pleural effusion (
ie
, shift of fluid into the chest) with free fluid around her liver.
[note: 77]
 Her hands and feet were edematous, 
ie
, swollen by the accumulation of fluid in the tissues.
[note: 78]
 (I note that the British spellings of this adjective and its associated condition are respectively “oedematous” and “oedema”. I will however adopt the American spellings, “edematous” and “edema”, which were used in the medical notes for Mdm Lee, and in the parties’ evidence and submissions.) Her heart rate fell from 106 beats per minute (“bpm”) at 0900hrs to 80bpm at 1800hrs, but rose to 88bpm after 2200hrs.
[note: 79]
 Her albumin level fell to 19g/L, down from 22g/L on 9 July.
[note: 80]
 The Defendant ordered the pleural effusion to be treated with percutaneous drainage of the chest.
[note: 81]
 At about 1945hrs, a CT scan of the chest was performed to guide the insertion of a tube for that percutaneous drainage procedure (rather than to investigate Mdm Lee’s condition generally). The scan revealed free fluid in the right suphrenic space (
ie
, below the right diaphragm).
[note: 82]
 Notably, this scan was ordered not by the Defendant but by the radiologist who performed the percutaneous drainage procedure.
[note: 83]
56     The Plaintiff argued that, in addition to the chest CT scan, the Defendant should have ordered an abdominal CT scan, which would have revealed undrained fluids in Mdm Lee’s abdomen, and in turn have necessitated percutaneous drainage of the abdomen as well.
57     On 12 July, 2,360ml of abdominal fluid was drained from Mdm Lee.
[note: 84]
 Her ABG level was pH7.301 at 0213hrs (the “12 July 0213hrs ABG”) and pH7.323 at 1108hrs (the “12 July 1108hrs ABG”).
[note: 85]
 She was acidotic but improving.
58     On 13 July, 2,500ml of abdominal fluid was drained from Mdm Lee.
[note: 86]
59     The Plaintiff submitted that by 11 July (POD7), Mdm Lee had deviated from the usual clinical course after a Whipple operation.
[note: 87]
 The clinical signs and symptoms she displayed necessitated a CT scan of her abdomen to eliminate the possibility of a Dehiscence and to investigate whether further intervention was necessary. Additionally, the clinical indicators that emerged between 11 and 12 July should have heightened the Defendant’s suspicion of a Dehiscence, and alerted him to the need for such an abdominal CT scan. The Plaintiff highlighted 10 indicators when cross-examining the Defendant and Dr Mak, but referred to a total of 12 indicators in his submissions:
[note: 88]
(a)     POPF based on the elevated POD3 amylase level on 7 July;
(b)     respiratory compromise on 9 July;
(c)     delayed gastric emptying;
(d)     increasingly large volume of abdominal drain fluids;
(e)     elevated heart rate persistently above 85bpm;
(f)     haemoserous drain fluid at various points from 9 to 11 July;
(g)     pleural effusion on 11 July;
(h)     persistently low albumin levels;
(i)     metabolic acidosis on 11 (and 12) July;
(j)     free fluid below the diaphragm (seen on the chest CT scan);
(k)     elevated white blood cell (“WBC”) count on 11 July; and
(l)     slight abdominal distension on 11 July.
60     The Defendant agreed, in cross-examination and in submission, that Mdm Lee had by 12 July displayed these 10 or 12 indicators.
[note: 89]
 However, he testified that not all of the indicators persisted 
at the same time
. Some had resolved, while others had been attributed to causes other than a Dehiscence. Once an indicator was accounted for, it was “dropped from the equation” and “we move[d] on.”
[note: 90]
 Thus, it was incorrect to manage Mdm Lee by “tak[ing] the ten [or twelve] symptoms and signs and throw[ing] them into one time frame. That is not the way you practice medicine.”
[note: 91]
 I do not understand the Plaintiff’s experts to have been propounding a different approach. Nevertheless, the parties disagreed on the 
extent
 to which each indicator had resolved.
61     The Plaintiff made detailed submissions only on the haemoserous fluid, pleural effusion, persistent low albumin, acidosis, free abdominal fluid, and abdominal distension. I will first examine these indicators individually, and then consider whether Mdm Lee’s management should have been changed in the light of all the indicators, viewed globally.
Pleural effusion
62     The Defendant in his oral evidence-in-chief attributed the pleural effusion to Mdm Lee’s low albumin level, which allowed fluid to leak out of her blood vessels and into the [third] space in her chest.
[note: 92]
 The fact that she had edema even of her extremities
[note: 93]
 (see [55] above) reinforced the conclusion that the third-spacing was so extensive as to have caused the pleural effusion.
[note: 94]
 This was exacerbated by her atelectasis, which had in turn been worsened by her lack of mobilisation.
[note: 95]
 Given the absence of abdominal complaints, all indicators pointed to the chest – and away from the abdomen – as the source of the pleural effusion.
[note: 96]
63     Dr Mak accepted that a Dehiscence could contribute to fluid in the abdomen, which could in turn lead to a pleural effusion.
[note: 97]
 Given Mdm Lee’s highly elevated POD3 amylase level, the pleural effusion could not have been due only to her low albumin state. The possibility of a Dehiscence must also have been addressed.
[note: 98]
 However, any concerns about a Dehiscence were assuaged by the significant improvement in her clinical condition after her chest was drained.
[note: 99]
64     Dr Nikfarjam opined that on 11 July, the breathing difficulties increasingly experienced by Mdm Lee, coupled with the associated development of a significant pleural effusion, should have raised concerns of a significant intra-abdominal complication. Large pleural effusions rarely occur after a Whipple operation in a patient who, like Mdm Lee, has no significant pre-existing heart failure, chronic liver disease, malnutrition, or chronic kidney disease.
[note: 100]
 However, Dr Nikfarjam then accepted that it was “reasonable to monitor what happens after 11 July to [determine] whether there might be a clinically significant anastomotic leak,”
[note: 101]
 and that on “12 and 13 July [Mdm Lee’s] clinical condition had improved after the drainage of the pleural effusion on the 11th.""
[note: 102]
65     Dr Beckingham testified that the pleural effusion was caused by the presence of pancreatic fluid [from a Dehiscence] within the abdominal cavity, which ""irritate[d] the pleural viscera directly above the diaphragm.”
[note: 103]
 He cited Mark I van Berge Henegouwen 
et al
, “Incidence, Risk Factors, and Treatment of Pancreatic Leakage after Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Drainage versus Resection of the Pancreatic Remnant” (1997) 185(1) 
Journal of the American College of Surgeons
 18 at pp 21–23, which found that at least 48.3% (14 of 29) of patients with a Dehiscence developed a pleural effusion, and that a pleural effusion pointed to a Dehiscence.
66     Dr Mak explained that, statistically, the fact that 48.3% of patients with a Dehiscence developed a pleural effusion did not mean that there was a 48.3% chance that Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence by virtue of her pleural effusion.
[note: 104]
 The study (at [65] above) considered only the 
incidence
 but not the 
cause
 of the pleural effusions in the patients studied. It was unreliable since pneumonia, infections of the chest or lung, and low albumin states were more common causes of a pleural effusion than a Dehiscence.
[note: 105]
Acidosis
67     In his AEIC, the Defendant attributed Mdm Lee’s 11 July ABG results to a “respiratory acidosis”.
[note: 106]
 In his oral evidence-in-chief, however, he amended his explanation of the 11 July ABG results to a “metabolic acidosis possibly secondary to a respiratory cause”.
[note: 107]
 He elaborated that while acidosis from a lung failure was “respiratory acidosis”, acidosis from a lung problem that impaired the transport of oxygen to the tissues and thereby caused the tissues to produce acid was “metabolic acidosis”.
[note: 108]
68     Dr Mak accepted that Mdm Lee had on 11 July suffered metabolic acidosis. The fluid that had accumulated in her chest from her pleural effusion made breathing difficult and prevented the lungs from getting enough oxygen to her tissues. The 11 July ABG result was “quite abnormal”. He thus “ha[d] to exclude various possibilities … for example, of infection and sepsis.” However, he remained “unsure simply on the basis of looking at this test result whether in fact that problem with breathlessness has also led and contributed to this abnormal state where her acidosis is.”
[note: 109]
69     Dr Nikfarjam dismissed any relation between the metabolic acidosis and the lungs. He explained that Mdm Lee’s partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO­
2
) levels, which would have increased if her lungs had been unable to fully expel the carbon dioxide in her body, had remained normal.
[note: 110]
 Since her lungs were working normally, they could not have caused the acidosis.
70     The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant’s belated amendment of his evidence-in-chief (see [67] above) showed that he had “failed to apply his mind to properly evaluating the causes of the acidosis”. Instead, he had “jumped to the conclusion that it must have been a result of the pleural effusion at the time.”
[note: 111]
 The metabolic acidosis indicated an intra-abdominal problem, which undermined attempts to localise the clinical indicators to a chest problem.
[note: 112]
71     However, the significance of the 11 July ABG result was not fully borne out in the evidence of the Plaintiff’s experts. Dr Beckingham did not mention the 11 July ABG result in his evidence-in-chief or cross-examination, and discussed it only at the end of his re-examination when Mr Tan brought it to his attention.
[note: 113]
 Dr Nikfarjam agreed that Mdm Lee’s management on 11 July was appropriate, and that any differences between how he would have managed Mdm Lee and how the Defendant had in fact managed her constituted “an acceptable standard of variation.”
[note: 114]
72     It was only after counsel for the Defendant, Ms Kristy Tan (“Ms Tan”), referred Dr Nikfarjam to the 11 July ABG results that he expressed concern about them.
[note: 115]
 Dr Nikfarjam explained that “if [he] had seen this blood test, [he] would have actually been more worried that there's an intraabdominal problem,” and “would have been more concerned that an imaging test should have been done on the 11th, of the abdomen.”
[note: 116]
 This was not convincing. If the 11 July ABG results were as important as he was belatedly making them out to be, he would not have neglected them earlier in his evidence.
73     Notably, the chest CT scan was performed only around 1945hrs on 11 July. Dr Nikfarjam conceded that, if the Defendant was unaware of the chest CT scan results, it was acceptable not to have ordered an abdominal CT scan despite the 11 July ABG result.
[note: 117]
 The Defendant testified during cross-examination that he saw the chest CT scan results only at 0730hrs on 12 July.
[note: 118]
 This was accepted by the Plaintiff.
[note: 119]
 By then, the 11 July ABG results had been superseded by the 12 July 0213hrs ABG results,
[note: 120]
 which showed that the acidosis had improved 
significantly
[note: 121]
 after the chest drainage. The 12 July 1108hrs ABG results showed further improvement in the acidosis,
[note: 122]
 and both of the Plaintiff’s experts accepted that Mdm Lee was in a good and stable condition on 12 July.
[note: 123]
Free fluids in abdomen
74     The Defendant attributed the free fluid above the liver displayed by the 11 July chest CT scan to Mdm Lee’s low albumin state, which facilitated third-spacing in the abdominal cavity. The free fluid was of little concern because it could be drained by her existing abdominal drains.
[note: 124]
 Dr Mak agreed with this assessment,
[note: 125]
 and added that there was in fact no significant collection of fluid shown on the [albeit limited] set of images taken in the 11 July chest CT scan.
[note: 126]
75     The Plaintiff did not dispute Dr Mak’s opinions in his submissions.
76     Dr Beckingham referred only to a “2-to-3-cm rim of fluid around [Mdm Lee’s] liver which has not been drained”, but gave no evidence as to its significance.
[note: 127]
 This fell short of establishing the Plaintiff’s submission that there was “significant fluid under her diaphragm”,
[note: 128]
 particularly since Dr Nikfarjam had accepted that the free fluid above the liver could have been drained out by the existing abdominal drains.
[note: 129]
Haemoserous fluid, persistent low albumin, and abdominal distension 
77     The Defendant gave evidence that haemoserous fluid was a very non-specific sign of a Dehiscence. It indicated only that blood had been mixed with serous fluid.
[note: 130]
 The observations of haemoserous fluid between 9 and 11 July were not accompanied by any abdominal signs, except for a slight abdominal distension recorded at 1600hrs on 11 July that subsequently settled.
[note: 131]
 Further, the drain fluid became serous shortly thereafter.
[note: 132]
 Dr Mak echoed these observations, and emphasised that Mdm Lee’s abdomen would have exhibited signs of disquiet had there been a Dehiscence.
[note: 133]
 The Plaintiff’s submissions did not refer to any evidence from his own experts on the issue of the haemoserous fluid.
78     The Defendant testified that low albumin was similarly a very non-specific sign of a Dehiscence.
[note: 134]
 Although Dr Mak accepted that a suspicion of a Dehiscence had to be entertained if a low albumin state persisted,
[note: 135]
 he attributed Mdm Lee’s low albumin state from 11 to 14 July to her “somewhat conservative” albumin supplementation of 100ml/day and to her continued fasting.
[note: 136]
 He added that the steady rise in her albumin levels from 11 to 14 July pointed further away from a Dehiscence, which would have affected them adversely.
[note: 137]
 Dr Beckingham accepted that a low albumin state was common after a Whipple operation because a patient would not have been fed for three to four days.
[note: 138]
 Dr Nikfarjam testified only that low albumin was “a reflection of a patient becoming unwell … rather than a true cause”,
[note: 139]
 and was “indicative of an inflammatory process that’s going on.”
[note: 140]
79     The Defendant explained that the slight abdominal distension would have been worrying only if it was accompanied by impaired bowel function, which could have suggested a collection of fluid in the space behind the lining of the abdominal cavity.
[note: 141]
 Mdm Lee had normal bowel functions, which Dr Nikfarjam accepted was reassuring.
[note: 142]
 Once again, the Plaintiff’s submissions did not refer to any evidence from his own experts on the issue of the abdominal distension.
Management
80     Despite all the indicators relied upon by the Plaintiff to submit that the Defendant should have ordered an abdominal CT scan on 11 July (or soon thereafter), the short point is that this was not the initial position taken by his experts.
81     Dr Nikfarjam agreed that the Defendant’s management of Mdm Lee on 11 July was appropriate. He also agreed that her clinical condition had improved on 12 and 13 July. However, he then backtracked and emphasised the 11 July ABG results (see [71] and [72] above).
82     As for Dr Beckingham, he had initially testified that it would have been reasonable to have performed percutaneous drainage – after a CT scan of the abdomen
[note: 143]
 – as late as 17 or 18 July. Although he would have ordered an abdominal CT scan and percutaneous drainage on 11 July,
[note: 144]
 it was reasonable not to have done so since Mdm Lee was getting better. Notably, this remained Dr Beckingham’s position even “assuming she has an anastomotic leak”.
[note: 145]
83     It was only at the close of his re-examination that Dr Beckingham retracted this evidence and asserted that an abdominal CT scan should have been done on 11 July (see [52] above). I place little weight on this late retraction and assertion.
84     On balance, I am of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in his management of Mdm Lee from 11 to 13 July.
14 to 16 July: abdominal pain
85     On 14 July, Mdm Lee had a low albumin level of 22g/L
[note: 146]
 and drained “chylous” fluid.
[note: 147]
 At 1000hrs, she complained of severe pain over a wound site,
[note: 148]
 and received 75mg of Pethidine, a painkiller.
[note: 149]
 At 1100hrs, she had pain with slight tenderness around her right drain site.
[note: 150]
 At 1200hrs, she had mild abdominal pain with a soft abdomen and generalised tenderness on palpitation. However, she had no guarding, rebound tenderness, or peritonitis.
[note: 151]
 At 1347hrs, her C-reactive protein (“CRP”) value was 135mg/L while her WBC count was 11.53 x 10
9
/L.
[note: 152]
 At 1620hrs, her pain had become “much better” and she was alert and comfortable.
[note: 153]
86     On 15 July, the colour of Mdm Lee’s drain fluid was “light haemoserous” at 0600hrs
[note: 154]
 and “yellowish” at 1520hrs.
[note: 155]
 Across the morning, she drained 1,510ml and 20ml of fluid from right and left abdominal drains respectively.
[note: 156]
 At 0810hrs, she was alert, comfortable, and had no complaints of pain, normal parameters, and a soft and non-distended abdomen.
[note: 157]
 At 1000hrs, she was well enough for physiotherapy, and performed ankle pumps and marched on the spot.
[note: 158]
 When the Defendant saw her at 1320hrs, she was well and had no complaints. She took feeds and passed flatus. She drained serous fluid.
[note: 159]
 At 1530hrs, she underwent another physiotherapy session. Three further physiotherapy sessions were then planned for 16 and 17 July.
[note: 160]
87     On 16 July, Mdm Lee had pain scores of 6/10 at 0930hrs and 3/10 at 1430hrs, but was alert and clinically well.
[note: 161]
 She underwent physiotherapy and did not complain of pain until 2035hrs.
[note: 162]
 Her drain fluids were “yellowish”.
[note: 163]
88     The Plaintiff submitted that, taken together, the clinical indicators that Mdm Lee exhibited pointed to a Dehiscence. As at 14 July, these included her elevated POD3 amylase level, her low albumin level, her elevated CRP and WBC values, her “chylous” fluid, and her abdominal disquiet.
[note: 164]
 As at 15 July, Mdm Lee also displayed an inability to tolerate the soft foods that were commenced on 13 July, an elevated heart rate, and drain fluid of a high volume and light haemoserous or yellow colour.
[note: 165]
 As at 16 July, Mdm Lee suffered from the aforementioned unexplained abdominal pain. The Plaintiff focused on the abdominal signs and “chylous” fluid on 14 July, the “yellowish” fluid on 15 July, and the unexplained abdominal pain on 16 July.
89     As mentioned (at [60] above), it was not unreasonable for the Defendant to have considered only the indicators that had persisted at a given point of time. Those that had been resolved or otherwise attributed to conditions other than a Dehiscence could be “left out [of] the equation.”
[note: 166]
 Accordingly, I will once again examine the indicators in question individually, and then consider whether Mdm Lee’s management should have been changed in the light of all the indicators, viewed globally.
Abdominal disquiet on 14 July
90     The primary indicator relied upon by the Plaintiff was Mdm Lee’s abdominal disquiet on 14 July. I set out chronologically the observations on her abdomen, as recorded in her clinical notes.
[note: 167]

Seen by the Defendant
 
91     The Plaintiff submitted that the progression from severe pain at 1000hrs to generalised tenderness at 1230hrs should have alerted the Defendant to the possibility of a Dehiscence and the need for an abdominal CT scan.
[note: 168]
 Although the pain apparently dissipated thereafter, the Plaintiff submitted that Dr Yeo’s observation of “pain much better than earlier today” at 1620hrs meant that the pain had resurfaced and that the underlying abdominal problem remained unresolved.
[note: 169]
 I do not accept this contention. Those words did not mean that the pain had resurfaced, but that Mdm Lee had been getting better, not worse. The Defendant’s review of Mdm Lee at 1920hrs that evening, in which he observed that Mdm Lee was well with no complaints of pain, bear this out.
92     The Defendant accepted that 
unexplained
 abdominal pain accompanied by tenderness and guarding could point to a Dehiscence,
[note: 170]
 but denied that Mdm Lee had such unexplained pain, generalised tenderness, or guarding.
(a)     Mdm Lee’s abdominal pain at around 1000hrs was attributable to tugging on the right abdominal drain stitched to her skin.
[note: 171]
 She had localised the pain to her right drain site.
[note: 172]
 At 1100hrs, the Defendant examined her and found her abdomen soft and non-tender except for slight tenderness around the right drain site.
[note: 173]
 Finally, X-rays of her chest and abdomen showed an absence of free air, which pointed away from bowel-abdominal communication.
[note: 174]
(b)     The record of “generalised tenderness” at 1230hrs was inconsistent with the contemporaneous observations that Mdm Lee’s abdomen was “soft” with “0 guarding, 0 rebound, 0 peritonism”.
[note: 175]
 Tenderness and guarding go together, except at the very onset of an abdominal problem. When tenderness has spread through the entire abdomen to give “generalised tenderness”, guarding must have followed. The discrepancy in the clinical records made it reasonable to have held off action.
[note: 176]
 By the time the Defendant reviewed Mdm Lee at 1920hrs on 14 July, her pain issues had resolved, and her abdomen was soft and non-tender.
[note: 177]
 Her abdomen remained soft and non-tender for the remainder of 14 July, and through 15 and 16 July.
93     Dr Mak testified that a Dehiscence would have irritated or inflamed the abdomen. However, Mdm Lee’s abdomen was soft and non-tender with no peritonism (
ie
, inflammation
[note: 178]
).
[note: 179]
 At 1030hrs, the clinical entry of “mild guarding” was contradicted by the observation that the abdomen was “soft”. The further observation of “0 rebound” reinforced the conclusion that there was no peritoneal irritation or other serious abdominal problem.
[note: 180]
 At 1230hrs, the record of “no peritonism” in particular showed that the abdomen was well.
[note: 181]
94     On the other hand, Dr Nikfarjam testified that on 14 July, Mdm Lee had “no right to have generalised tenderness at this point after surgery.” He stressed the importance of an observation of generalised tenderness, and concluded that in view of this, the Defendant should have ordered an abdominal CT scan. Although there was some inconsistency between the observations of “tenderness” and “0 peritonism” at 1230hrs, some of the abdominal signs could have been masked by the Pethidine that was administered at around 1000hrs. Moreover, “you would never want to be waiting for someone to develop peritonism before you act”;
[note: 182]
 particularly since Mdm Lee had developed abdominal pain that she did not have before.
[note: 183]
95     Interestingly, Dr Beckingham gave no evidence on the significance of the abdominal signs displayed by Mdm Lee on 14 July.
96     The observation of “generalised tenderness” was made by a junior doctor.
[note: 184]
 As the Defendant testified, it could have been a product of unwieldy assessment technique.
[note: 185]
 Further, it was undisputed that this observation was generally inconsistent with the contemporaneous observation, made by the same doctor, that Mdm Lee’s abdomen was “soft” with “0 guarding, 0 rebound, 0 peritonism”.
[note: 186]
 More importantly, the Defendant had personally reviewed Mdm Lee at 1100hrs and 1920hrs, shortly after each disputed observation was recorded, and found her abdomen soft and non-tender.
[note: 187]
 The review at 1920hrs, in particular, was carried out after all the effects of the Pethidine had worn off.
[note: 188]
 The Defendant thus attributed the initial pain to tugging on the abdominal drains,
[note: 189]
 and concluded that Mdm Lee’s abdominal signs showed no real cause for concern throughout 14 July.
[note: 190]
Chylous fluid on 14 July
97     Abdominal fluid turns white and milky – 
ie
, chylous – when the fat globules in the lymph vessels leak out into the abdomen.
[note: 191]
98     The Defendant testified that the chylous fluid was attributable to the chyle from the fats in Mdm Lee’s soft diet on 13 July. If a Dehiscence had occurred at that time, Mdm Lee would have been in significant pain. Instead, she exhibited no such indicators at all.
[note: 192]
99     However, the Plaintiff’s experts opined that the amount of fat in the food that Mdm Lee had consumed on 13 and 14 July was insufficient to have produced a chyle leak. Dr Beckingham testified that chyle leaks are unheard of in pancreatic surgery.
[note: 193]
 Hence, the term “chylous” in the clinical notes described only the appearance of the fluid. There was no other evidence of a chyle leak.
[note: 194]
 Dr Nikfarjam added that the definitive test for a chyle leak is a triglycerides test for fat globules,
[note: 195]
 which was not done. Instead, the Defendant simply diagnosed and treated the chylous fluid based on what he believed to be the characteristic appearance of chyle in the abdominal drains.
[note: 196]
 This was misguided. The chylous fluid could in fact have been pancreatic fluid, which could present a similar appearance to the white colouration of chyle.
[note: 197]
 The Defendant also conceded that the white colouration could have concealed pure pancreatic fluid, which was colourless.
[note: 198]
100    Two senior HPB surgeons separately recorded the observations of chylous fluid: Dr Wong Jen San at 0810hrs and the Defendant himself at 1100hrs. The former added that a dissection of a lymph node could have caused the increased chylous output.
[note: 199]
 Dr Mak and Dr Ng Shin Yi testified that chyle has a distinctive appearance that experienced specialists can immediately identify.
[note: 200]
 As observed by the Plaintiff, 14 July was the only time when Mdm Lee’s drain fluid had a chylous appearance.
[note: 201]
 Both parties agreed in the Glossary of Medical Terms that the Plaintiff tendered to the court that “chylous fluid” meant “
[f]atty fluids
 with a white, creamy or milky colour 
from the lymphatic system
[note: 202]
 [emphasis added]”. The Plaintiff could have put forward his own interpretations of term “chylous”, as he did for other entries in the Glossary. The fact that he did not do so reinforced the conclusion that Mdm Lee had only chyle in her drains.
101    It was thus not unreasonable to have attributed Mdm Lee’s chylous fluid to a chyle leak, particularly when her drain fluid became serous again shortly after her diet was changed to manage the chyle leakage.
[note: 203]
Yellowish fluid on 15 July
102    The Plaintiff submitted that the “light haemoserous”
[note: 204]
 and “yellowish”
[note: 205]
 colours of Mdm Lee’s drain fluid on 15 July “should have rang alarm bells.”
[note: 206]
 He referred to the Defendant’s evidence that “[a]ny time we see something that has been described differently, we will check”,
[note: 207]
 and to Dr Mak’s evidence that bile is yellowish and that a “mixture of bile and serous fluid can also turn yellowish.”
[note: 208]
103    The Defendant testified that the change in the colour of drain fluid from “chylous” to “light haemoserous” at 0600hrs on 15 July was not in itself of concern. Only if the haemoserous colour had persisted would he have been worried.
[note: 209]
 By 0950hrs, however, the drain fluid had become “serous”.
[note: 210]
 Similarly, concerns about the “yellowish” fluid observed at 1520hrs had been assuaged following Dr Yeo’s review of Mdm Lee that evening. The fluid had become “serous” and was of no concern. Dr Yeo did not see fit to record it.
[note: 211]
104    Dr Mak added that bile is “golden yellow” or “intensely yellow”, rather than the “straw coloured faint yellow tinge” of normal serous fluid.
[note: 212]
 The absence of observations about the 
quality
 of the fluid (in particular, that the fluid was bilious), as opposed to simply the colour of the fluid, suggested that Mdm Lee did not have a Dehiscence.
[note: 213]
105    Importantly, neither of the Plaintiff’s experts took issue with the “yellowish” and “haemoserous” observations, whether in their expert reports or their oral testimony.
Continued abdominal pain on 16 July
106    The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant would have diagnosed a Dehiscence based on the significant abdominal pain in the morning of 16 July if he had been suspecting a Dehiscence. It was “blinkered” to have attributed the pain to “faecal loading”.
[note: 214]
 The Plaintiff added in his reply submissions that the Defendant should have been alarmed because the residual pain (pain score 3/10) after Mdm Lee passed motion was “unexplained”.
[note: 215]
107    The Defendant testified that Mdm Lee’s pain score fell from 6/10 to 3/10 after she passed motion.
[note: 216]
 The abdominal X-ray on 14 July had showed faecal loading.
[note: 217]
 He thus concluded that faecal loading had caused the abdominal pain at 0625hrs.
[note: 218]
 Dr Mak agreed that the passing of motion substantially resolved what appeared to have been severe abdominal pain. This suggested that the pain had not been caused by a Dehiscence or by significant inflammation or infection within the abdominal cavity.
[note: 219]
108    However, Dr Nikfarjam opined that faecal loading could not explain Mdm Lee’s abdominal concerns.
[note: 220]
 Further, it was worrying that she kept developing abdominal pain even while on antibiotics.
[note: 221]
 Even so, Dr Beckingham accepted that faecal loading could have caused the pain, which was resolved upon the passing of motion. Mdm Lee had not passed motion from 14 to 16 July, and faecal loading was seen on the abdominal X-ray that was performed on 14 July.
[note: 222]
Management
109    The Defendant testified that Mdm Lee improved on 12, 13, and 14 July. This was incompatible with her having suffered a Dehiscence.
[note: 223]
 X-rays of her abdomen and chest showed that the operatively-inserted abdominal drains were in place and that there was no free air in the abdomen, which would have indicated a Dehiscence.
[note: 224]
 The fall in her WBC count from 26.26 x 10
9
/L on 11 July to a near-normal 11.53 x 10
9
/L on 14 July suggested an absence of on-going sepsis and infection in the abdomen. The maintenance of that WBC level from 14 to 16 July suggested further that Mdm Lee was quite well.
[note: 225]
110    Dr Mak found that Mdm Lee’s stable global condition on 14 July was incompatible with that of a patient with a Dehiscence, who would have deteriorated.
[note: 226]
 Less risk-tolerant doctors might have considered an abdominal CT scan, but it was acceptable to have continued to observe Mdm Lee.
[note: 227]
 An abdominal CT scan was necessary only if she had had a fever, worsening abdominal pain associated with rebound tenderness and guarding, or drain fluid that was bilious or purulent.
[note: 228]
111    Dr Nikfarjam opined that he would have ordered an abdominal CT scan in anticipation of performing percutaneous drainage, given the earlier abdominal pain and the observation of generalised tenderness on 14 July. It was unacceptable for the Defendant to have waited until Mdm Lee became unstable before conducting a CT scan, especially given her elevated POD3 drain amylase level.
[note: 229]
 However, Dr Nikfarjam then appeared to accept that the improvement in the pain on 15 and 16 July 
reduced
 the need for an abdominal CT scan.
[note: 230]
 
Ms Tan:
 
 
I wasn't suggesting that after the 11 pm episode, you don't do the CT scan. If I were to cut it off before then, before that episode, would you agree that it would be reasonable, given what happened in the course of the daytime of the 16th, not to have ordered the CT abdomen scan immediately, in the daytime?
 
 
Dr Nikfarjam:
 
 
I have given you my answer. With everything considered, I don't agree. I don't agree. It should have been done, whether you want to say should have been done on the 14th, 15th, 16th, on all those days, I actually believe there should have been done, and it's not reasonable to have left them and not performed them.
 
 
Ms Tan:
 
 
Leaving out the 16th night --
 
 
Dr Nikfarjam:
 
 
 
If you forget what we knew in the past
, and you just want to base it on the patient's pain improving, justifying not doing a CT scan, 
if you want to say the pain is the only thing you want to consider, and because the pain is better we won't do a CT scan, yes
; you didn't have to do a CT scan because the pain is better.
 
[Emphasis added]
112    Having testified that Mdm Lee should have had an abdominal CT scan on 11 July, Dr Beckingham did not give evidence that an abdominal CT scan should have been performed on 14 July.
113    The abdominal pain that Mdm Lee suffered initially in the morning of 14 July did not persist. The effect of the Pethidine that she had received at around 1000hrs that morning would have worn out after six hours.
[note: 231]
 Yet she did not complain of further pain thereafter. The observation of generalised tenderness was inconsistent with the observation of “0 guarding, 0 rebound, 0 peritonism” (see [96] above). In any event, the Defendant in his subsequent review that evening did not observe any tenderness of the abdomen. Indeed, there was no subsequent observation of generalised tenderness on 14, 15, or 16 July.
114    As Dr Mak testified, a scan should be ordered only if there was a good reason for doing so, and not “just to look to see what things were like”.
[note: 232]
 Moreover, as noted in Emmanuel Melloul 
et al
, “Poor level of agreement on the management of postoperative pancreatic fistula: results of an international survey” (2013) 15 
Journal of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Billary Association
 307 at 312, there is “poor or no agreement” between HPB centres around the world as to the use of imaging strategies like CT scans in the management of POPF. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in his management of Mdm Lee from 14 to 16 July.
Diagnosis of anastomotic dehiscence: 16 to 17 July
115    At 2300hrs on 16 July, Mdm Lee complained of a sudden intense pain over her abdominal region (pain score 8/10).
[note: 233]
 She was “screaming” in pain.
[note: 234]
 Her right and left abdominal drains drained 2,775ml and 330ml of fluid respectively. She received 50mg of Pethidine, but continued to describe pain “everywhere in the abdomen” (pain score 8/10).
[note: 235]
116    At 0050hrs on 17 July, Mdm Lee exhibited abdominal “tenderness”. At 0130hrs, she complained of abdominal pain and a tender lower abdomen. Believing that a Dehiscence had occurred, Dr Ng Shu Li made an order to “KIV CT Abdo[men] if symptoms persist” in respect of a Dehiscence.
[note: 236]
117    At 0900hrs, Dr Yeo observed that Mdm Lee had deteriorated and that her abdominal tenderness had persisted. An ABG test showed severe metabolic acidosis of pH7.187 requiring correction by bicarbonate infusion.
[note: 237]
 As the Defendant was not at work on 17 July (Sunday), Dr Yeo informed him of these findings over the telephone.
[note: 238]
 Given that Mdm Lee was in severe abdominal pain but had no severe kidney problems or breathing difficulties, the Defendant believed that the acidosis was likely due to an intra-abdominal cause. He thus “instructed Dr Yeo to arrange for an urgent [abdominal] CT scan to investigate if there was any anastomotic leak which may be the cause of a suspected intra-abdominal sepsis.”
[note: 239]
118    At 1230hrs, a CT scan of Mdm Lee’s chest, abdomen, and pelvis (the “17 July Abdominal CT Scan”) was performed. It confirmed a Dehiscence and revealed collections of fluid. The scan report stated:
[note: 240]
There is a possible mural defect in the region of prior gastrojejunostomy with adjacent extraluminal pockets of pneumoperitoneum … A moderate to large amount of free low density peritoneal fluid is visualised, mainly in the perihepatic and left subhepatic regions where air fluid levels are visualised. Free low density peritoneal fluid is also visualised along the pericolic gutters and within the pelvis.
119    At 1300hrs, Mdm Lee was moved to the High Dependency Unit (“HDU”) for monitoring and for stabilisation via correction of her acidosis.
[note: 241]
120    By 1320hrs, the Defendant had arrived at SGH, reviewed Mdm Lee, and diagnosed her with a “delayed pancreatic dehiscence”.
[note: 242]
 After a discussion with Dr Ng Shin Yi, the consultant intensivist at the SICU on 17 July, the Defendant moved her to the SICU for resuscitation at 1530hrs.
[note: 243]
121    There is no dispute that Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence on and after 2300hrs on 16 July, if not earlier. The Plaintiff did not challenge the Defendant’s actions on 17 July, save that the diagnosis should have been of a subsisting and not a new Dehiscence.
122    Every case must be decided on the issues raised by the pleadings, which bind the parties. If other issues are desired to be raised or come to light during the trial, they must be pleaded by way of amendment (
Deans Property Pte Ltd v Land Estates Apartments Pte Ltd and another
 
[1994] 3 SLR(R) 804
 at [15]). Although evidence at trial can overcome omissions in a party’s pleadings where the opponent is not taken by surprise (
Holland Leedon Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v C & P Transport Pte Ltd
 
[2013] SGHC 281
 at [150]), it may not establish facts radically different from those pleaded that more than simply vary, modify, or develop what has been alleged (
John G Stein & Co Ltd v O’Hanlon
 
[1965] AC 890
 at 909).
123    I reiterate that the Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that by 17 July, it was too late to have performed an abdominal CT scan on Mdm Lee (see [47] above). Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s submission that, after 17 July, the Defendant should have ordered yet another abdominal CT scan with a view to performing percutaneous drainage on Mdm Lee’s abdomen, was strictly speaking immaterial to his case. However, for completeness, I will address the Plaintiff’s allegations about what the Defendant should have done on and after 17 July.
124    As an aside, I will first address the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant should, in line with his approach of managing Mdm Lee conservatively, have performed a repeat drain amylase test to “track the ‘improvement’” of her POPF.
[note: 244]
 This must have referred to the period from 8 to 16 July, 
ie
, between the emergence of the POPF on 7 July and the 17 July Abdominal CT Scan that confirmed a Dehiscence. Relying on the opinions of Dr Nikfarjam and Dr Mak, the Plaintiff contended that the Defendant should have performed a repeat drain amylase test to assess “whether [the POPF on 7 July] had resolved spontaneously or if alternative management was required.”
[note: 245]
 However, the evidence of Dr Nikfarjam and Dr Mak did not go that far. Dr Nikfarjam opined that a repeat drain amylase test should have been performed 
only
 if the Defendant believed that the POPF had resolved and intended to remove the existing drains.
[note: 246]
 Similarly, Dr Mak observed that “there are no recommendations for routine follow-up evaluation of the amylase” of a patient with a POPF in order to determine the existence of a Dehiscence.
[note: 247]
 I note that Dr Beckingham did not appear to have given any evidence on the subject. In my view, since the Defendant did not intend to remove Mdm Lee’s abdominal drains, there was no need for him to have performed a repeat drain fluid amylase test.
Management of anastomotic dehiscence: 17 to 28 July
125    I set out the relevant portions of the Defendant’s AEIC on his plan for Mdm Lee from 17 July:
[note: 248]
89.    The intensivists were consulted and saw the Patient at about 1.30 pm [on 17 July], and a joint decision was taken for the Patient to be transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (“SICU”) for haemodynamic support. IV fluids and other resuscitation drugs were administered to provide her with support, and as she was in a poor state, she required inotropes to sustain her parameters. Presently, as the Patient’s surgical drains were still functioning well, and the Patient was haemodynamically unstable, the plan was for non-surgical intervention at that stage to allow for resuscitation to take priority with a possibility of exploratory laparotomy at a later date should that become essential.
90.    The surgical option would allow external drainage and lavage of the bowel contents that were leaked into the abdominal cavity and repair or closure of the anastomotic leak to minimise the leaking of bowel contents through the anastomosis. However, as the Patient’s surgical drains are still in place, such abdominal contents are able to drain out through these drains. Further, her NG tube would also reduce the amount of bowel contents crossing the anastomosis into the abdominal cavity. Therefore, the fact that these tubes/drains were still in place and functioning reduced the benefit of surgery, especially in the circumstances whereby the patient is ill, haemodynamically unstable and requiring inotropic support. Surgery can be an option subsequently if the Patient’s condition does not improve or deteriorates.
91.    In discussions with the intensivists, it was clear that if the Patient was brought to surgery now in her current condition, her mortality rate would be very high, and she would most likely perish (possibly even on the operating table).
92.    Primary care was handed over to the intensivists at the SICU as they worked to resuscitate the Patient and stabilise her condition.
126    The Defendant submitted that it was reasonable and appropriate to have managed Mdm Lee non-surgically on and after 17 July, and such management did in fact improve her sepsis.
[note: 249]
 From 17 to 19 July, he held off a laparotomy, a further abdominal CT scan, and a percutaneous drainage procedure because of Mdm Lee’s unstable condition and because her existing drains were managing the free fluid collections seen on the 17 July Abdominal CT Scan.
[note: 250]
 From 20 to 23 July, he held off a laparotomy because non-surgical management was continuing to improve Mdm Lee’s condition, and he held off an abdominal CT scan and percutaneous drainage because the additional benefits that they promised were outweighed by the risks involved.
[note: 251]
 On 24 July, however, he ordered an abdominal CT scan because of the increase in Mdm Lee’s WBC count and the appearance of feculent matter in her abdominal drains, and then decided to perform percutaneous drainage of the loculated collections revealed on the scan.
[note: 252]
 Nevertheless, before the percutaneous drainage could be performed, it was superseded by a decision to operate on Mdm Lee, on which I will elaborate later (at [156]–[159] below).
127    It is clear to me from the Defendant’s AEIC and oral evidence at trial
[note: 253]
 that, from 17 July, he had wanted to perform a laparotomy but could not do so because Mdm Lee was haemodynamically unstable. The intensivists had to resuscitate and stabilise her first. This was also the evidence of Dr Ng Shin Yi
[note: 254]
 and Dr Ang,
[note: 255]
 who were the consultant intensivists at the SICU on 17 July and from 18 to 25 July respectively. However, it was less clear whether, after Mdm Lee’s condition had improved by 19 July, the Defendant had been continuing to wait for an opportune time to perform the laparotomy, or had changed his mind and had been deferring the laparotomy to see whether her condition would improve to such an extent as to render a laparotomy unnecessary. As it turned out, this lack of clarity was not material, as I will explain later.
128    As for the Plaintiff’s case, I reiterate that it was Dr Beckingham’s evidence that 17 or 18 July was the latest time for intervention via a percutaneous drainage procedure (after an abdominal CT scan) or a laparotomy (see [52] above). Thereafter, any such intervention would not have “made a difference to the outcome in [Mdm Lee’s] case.” Dr Beckingham maintained this position throughout the trial.
[note: 256]
129    As for Dr Nikfarjam, he opined that if percutaneous drainage was not performed on 17 July, it should have been performed “on the 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, till the day [Mdm Lee] had surgery.”
[note: 257]
 
Ms Tan:
 
 
You see, for the period from 17 to 25 July, your report does not identify what it is you say would have been done differently or when you would have done it. So can you please tell us now, since you think that there is falling below a reasonable standard of care, what it is you would have done differently, and when, since you have not stated it in your report?
 
 
Dr Nikfarjam:
 
 
So I have mentioned in my report that as of the 17th, I would have looked at radiological drainage. 
From 17th onwards that's what I would -- would consider as an initial step.
 So if that hasn't been performed, that's what I'm referring to. The fact that no intervention was undertaken to address this patient's intraabdominal sepsis, that is my point, and that is the only point that I'm referring to, which I stated on the 17th, and I have not repeated it every day after.
 
 
 
 
 
 
I have mentioned it on the 17th, but in my report, I haven't rediscussed on the 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, till the day the patient had surgery.
 So that is what I'm saying.
 
[Emphasis added]
Ms Tan pressed Dr Nikfarjam to give a more specific time-frame for the performance of percutaneous drainage. However, he maintained that the time-frame was simply after Mdm Lee “had gone into the intensive care, was intubated, was given some inotropic supports and was having blood pressure maintained” in the afternoon of 17 July.
[note: 258]
 This was vague.
130    The Plaintiff’s submissions were no better. He first alleged that the Defendant should have “included [as part of his treatment plan], a plan for percutaneous drainage to drain the source of [Mdm Lee’s] abdominal sepsis as soon as she was resuscitated and stabilised.”
[note: 259]
 Since Mdm Lee was undergoing resuscitation and stabilisation from 17 to 19 July, the earliest opportunity for percutaneous drainage was 20 July. Yet, in the very next paragraph of his submissions, the Plaintiff criticised the Defendant for not ordering a CT scan, in order to perform percutaneous drainage, “prior to 24 July”.
[note: 260]
 This was too sweeping an allegation as it ignored the fact that Mdm Lee was undergoing resuscitation and stabilisation from 17 to 19 July.
131    Another sweeping submission made by the Plaintiff was his criticism of “[t]he Defendant’s inaction for more than a week between 17 July 2011 and 26 July 2011” as “inexcusable.”
[note: 261]
 At risk of belabouring the point, Mdm Lee was haemodynamically unstable and had to be resuscitated and stabilised from 17 to 19 July. Moreover, a further abdominal CT scan was in fact performed at 1430hrs on 24 July
[note: 262]
 (the “24 July Abdominal CT Scan”), following which the Defendant ordered a percutaneous drainage procedure (see [156] below). It was thus incorrect for the Plaintiff to allege that the Defendant had been inactive between 17 and 26 July.
132    These sweeping submissions served only to distract from the real issues in question. The pertinent timeframe was 20 to 23 July, rather than the longer period of 17 to 26 July. I will explain this later (at [141]–[155] below), after describing the period from 17 to 19 July in order to contextualise the actions that were taken by the Defendant and to explain the state that Mdm Lee was in during that time.
17 to 19 July
133    When Mdm Lee arrived at the SICU at 1530hrs on 17 July (see [120] above), Dr Ng Shin Yi, the consultant-in-charge of the SICU, observed that she was “acutely ill”.
[note: 263]
 Besides a Dehiscence, she suffered from septic shock, a low and unstable blood pressure, and an acute kidney injury.
[note: 264]
 She was put on active non-surgical management to control the flow of fluids to the dehisced anastomosis in order to allow it to seal off naturally.
[note: 265]
(a)     First, a Nasogastric Tube (an “NGT”) was inserted through her nose to evacuate her stomach contents.
[note: 266]
(b)     Secondly, she was placed Nil-by-Mouth.
[note: 267]
 From 19 July, she received intravenous nutritional support.
[note: 268]
(c)     Thirdly, her antibiotics were “escalate[d]” to intravenous Tazocin.
[note: 269]
 Intravenous Vancomycin was added on 21 July.
[note: 270]
(d)     Fourthly, her operatively-inserted drains were put on wall suction to increase the rate of drainage of abdominal fluids.
[note: 271]
(e)     Fifthly, she was administered three different inotropes to support her blood pressure.
[note: 272]
(f)     Finally, she was put on dialysis to mitigate the effects of her acute kidney injury.
[note: 273]
134    By 2100hrs on 17 July, Mdm Lee had become more stable. However, she remained on two inotropes. Her abdomen was slightly more distended than earlier in the day but was still soft. Her NGT drained bilious fluid, and both her abdominal drains drained turbid fluid. Her urine output was fair.
[note: 274]
 She had an elevated intra-abdominal pressure due to an accumulation of fluid in her abdomen. Across the day, she experienced severe coagulopathy and acidosis, and had low oxygen saturation that required intubation for ventilation.
[note: 275]
135    On 18 July, Dr Ang assumed the role of consultant-in-charge of the SICU from Dr Ng Shin Yi, and with it, the care of Mdm Lee.
[note: 276]
 At 0830hrs, Mdm Lee remained “very unwell”. In her condition on 18 July, surgery carried a 70–80% risk of death. Accordingly, the objective was to continue resuscitation to improve her condition.
[note: 277]
 By 2020hrs however, Mdm Lee had gradually stabilised. She displayed good drainage from her right drain of 800ml. Her intra-abdominal pressure had fallen further, and her abdomen had become less tense and distended.
[note: 278]
 However, various issues persisted, including low blood pressure, severe coagulopathy, poor oxygen saturation, acidosis, acute kidney injury, raised intra-abdominal pressure, and septic shock.
[note: 279]
136    By 0930hrs on 19 July, Mdm Lee had improved even further. Her oxygen saturation had increased, and a single inotrope sufficed to support her blood pressure. Her lungs were clear and she was able to obey commands. However, her coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, and raised intra-abdominal pressure remained unresolved. The Defendant consulted Dr Ang and concluded that Mdm Lee was in no condition for surgical intervention.
[note: 280]
137    The Defendant testified that he had monitored Mdm Lee’s drainage and abdominal signs at all times, and would have intervened via percutaneous drainage or even surgery had she failed to progress as expected.
[note: 281]
 However, Mdm Lee was from 17 to 19 July too ill for any intervention.
[note: 282]
138    Dr Mak agreed that from 17 to 19 July, Mdm Lee was “not stable or in any fit condition to be transferred out of the [S]ICU for any length of time”. Any consideration of “the possibility of these various interventions, whether surgery or drainage … would have been academic because she was not fit at all for any of these procedures to be done.”
[note: 283]
139    Dr Beckingham observed that up until 18 July, Mdm Lee was “as sick as a dog”. While a laparotomy was theoretically possible, his first choice would have been a percutaneous drainage procedure.
[note: 284]
 Nevertheless, Mdm Lee needed to be stabilised before any such percutaneous drainage could be performed.
[note: 285]
 Given her condition, he would have been cautious, and would have “th[ought] carefully about whether to do a radiological guided drainage” at all.
[note: 286]
 Since Dr Beckingham had observed that any intervention after 18 July would have been “too late” (see [52] above), he did not comment on her management thereafter.
140    Dr Nikfarjam accepted that the plan from 17 July to stabilise Mdm Lee for surgery was reasonable.
[note: 287]
 He disputed only the 
delay
 in intervening, specifically via a percutaneous drainage procedure. He contended that “after 24 hours, if [she] did not improve rapidly enough for surgery … there shouldn’t have been any further time waiting for surgery.”
[note: 288]
 Nevertheless, he accepted that even after this 24-hour period, insofar as there was no risk of deterioration, “[i]f the SICU team and the surgeon are still saying that ‘Maybe this is not the best window for surgery; we can get her to a better window’, then it would be reasonable to wait till the best possible window.”
[note: 289]
 Since Dr Nikfarjam accepted that “from the septic point of view, there was improvement” with the non-surgical measures implemented from 17 July, I am of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in holding off surgery or even percutaneous drainage, between 17 and 19 July.
20 to 23 July
141    On 20 July, Mdm Lee had been stable overnight, and her inotrope support had been decreased to a minimum. Her NGT and abdominal drains continued to drain well. She was, however, still coagulopathic with a low platelet count, and still needed dialysis for her kidneys. The Defendant decided to continue with non-surgical management, and to perform a laparotomy if there was no further improvement.
[note: 290]
142    By 21 July, Mdm Lee had improved further even though she remained on the Dangerously Ill List. Her blood pressure had stabilised and she was taken off inotropes. Her bilateral basal atelectasis and oxygen saturation had improved further. Her acute kidney injury was healing, even though she remained on dialysis. However, she drained bilious fluid and had septic shock, a low albumin level, and coagulopathy. After consulting Dr Ang, the Defendant decided against a laparotomy. Mdm Lee’s NGT and abdominal drains were effectively draining the site of her Dehiscence. The risks of a laparotomy outweighed any potential benefits involved.
[note: 291]
143    At 0435hrs on 22 July, Mdm Lee was unable to focus her eyes, and her level of consciousness had deteriorated.
[note: 292]
 However, she could move all her limbs, and continued to maintain her blood pressure without inotropic support. Her lungs were clear and her oxygen saturation was at 100%. However, her coagulopathy persisted.
[note: 293]
 At 1510hrs, Mdm Lee was sent for a brain CT scan because her lack of consciousness pointed to the existence of a life-threatening bleed of the brain.
[note: 294]
 However, the scan revealed the absence of any such bleed.
[note: 295]
144    On 23 July, Mdm Lee maintained a similar clinical state to that which she was in on 22 July. Bilious fluid continued to be noted in her NGT, and her surgical drains drained clear brownish fluid. She continued to require blood products to support her coagulopathy,
[note: 296]
 which had worsened.
[note: 297]
145    The Defendant testified that by 20 July, the focus had shifted away from optimising Mdm Lee for surgery to “using the conservative [non-surgical] management to get her well”.
[note: 298]
 Surgery was maintained as a consideration only “if [Mdm Lee was] not improving further.”
[note: 299]
 The effectiveness of these non-surgical measures was demonstrated by the “dramatic drop in the [WBC] count, from 28.14 x 10
9
/L to 11.58 x 10
9
/L, by 20 July”, as well as the general clinical improvements of a reduction in her need for inotropes and continued active drainage of fluid.
[note: 300]
 On 21 July, she was well enough to have her remaining inotrope removed, her WBC count had fallen further to 10.3 x 10
9
/L, and she was afebrile.
[note: 301]
146    Dr Mak appeared to accept that there was an opportunity from the morning of 21 July, given that Mdm Lee was sufficiently stable without inotropic support to be brought out of the SICU, for percutaneous drainage to have been performed.
[note: 302]
 The 17 July Abdominal CT Scan had revealed collections of fluid on the left side of her abdomen and in her pelvis that were not easily drained by her existing operatively-inserted drains.
[note: 303]
 Moreover, Mdm Lee had uncontrolled sepsis on 21 July (as evinced by her organ failure, renal failure, and on-going bleeding) even if she had improved from a septic point of view from 17 July.
[note: 304]
 The only collection of fluid that remained undrained was that in her pelvis, which needed to be “sorted out.”
[note: 305]
 Since, Mdm Lee was on 21 July in a very similar state of clinical stability as she was in at 24 July (when the Defendant eventually decided to perform a percutaneous drainage procedure),
[note: 306]
 Dr Mak would have considered performing percutaneous drainage on 21 July.
147    However, Dr Mak pointed out that percutaneous drainage should only be performed after an abdominal CT scan had been carried out and then only if the scan revealed undrained fluid collections necessitating such intervention.
[note: 307]
 Also, Mdm Lee’s coagulopathy had to be corrected before percutaneous drainage could have been undertaken.
[note: 308]
 This was the case on 24 July. Moreover, even though Dr Mak would have considered percutaneous drainage, he would have taken Dr Ang’s guidance as to whether and when it would have been safe to bring Mdm Lee out of the SICU.
[note: 309]
 Although 21 July was the first available opportunity for percutaneous drainage, Dr Mak testified that he would have waited another day had Dr Ang told him to do so. In Dr Mak’s opinion, Mdm Lee did not appear to have been so unstable that he would have lost all opportunities to intervene simply by waiting an additional day.
[note: 310]
148    Dr Ang gave evidence that on 21 July, Mdm Lee had been “slowly improving” and remained on track for the definitive intervention of surgery. Hence, Dr Ang would not have recommended even an abdominal CT scan – much less the consequential measure of percutaneous drainage – because “there’s really no point to do a scan to see where the loculation is, if our intention is to open up the patient.”
[note: 311]
149    It is not disputed that the Defendant, as the lead surgeon, made the decision whether to order percutaneous drainage or a laparotomy (or neither). However, Dr Ang candidly admitted that because Mdm Lee was in intensive care, any such decision involved a “collaborative discussion”
[note: 312]
 with her. Dr Ang would have been prepared to suggest percutaneous drainage had she thought it advisable.
[note: 313]
 Yet, she did not suggest that percutaneous drainage be performed on 20 or 21 July. Notably, Mr Tan assured Dr Ang during cross-examination that he was “not suggesting any shortcoming on [her] part.”
[note: 314]
150    Dr Nikfarjam’s opinion that percutaneous drainage should have been performed at some point in time on or after 17 July gave the impression that Mdm Lee was deteriorating from 17 July onwards, and that the Defendant’s non-surgical management of her was inadequate. It appears that, initially at least, Dr Nikfarjam did not appreciate that although Mdm Lee had deteriorated from 17 to 19 July, she had improved on 20 and 21 July. Hence the Plaintiff’s present focus, in his submissions, on 20 July and particularly 21 July (leaving aside the other sweeping allegations in his submissions). I thus hesitate to rely on Dr Nikfarjam’s evidence on the timing for the performance of a percutaneous drainage procedure.
151    The Defendant’s position was that given Mdm Lee’s condition from 17 to 22 July, there were grave risks in moving her out of the SICU and into the radiology suite. She was so moved on 22 July 
only
 because of the graver concern about a life-threatening bleed of the brain.
[note: 315]
 Given the grave risks of keeping Mdm Lee outside the SICU, the Defendant did not tag on a further abdominal CT scan while she was in the radiology suite.
[note: 316]
 Dr Ang and Dr Mak agreed with this assessment.
[note: 317]
 Notably, neither of the Plaintiff’s experts gave evidence on whether Mdm Lee should have had a further abdominal CT scan on 22 July when she was sent for a brain CT scan.
152    On the other hand, the Defendant’s evidence on why he did not order a further abdominal CT scan soon after the 17 July Abdominal CT Scan was given in a rather roundabout fashion. During his cross-examination of the Plaintiff’s experts, Ms Tan emphasised the risks of moving the Plaintiff away from the support at the SICU in order to carry out such a scan, but did not compare the risks of such a movement against the benefit of a further abdominal CT scan. It was only subsequently, when the Defendant was cross-examined, that he explained that he had held off a further abdominal CT scan because was no need for it (until 24 July).
153    Notwithstanding the roundabout manner in which the Defendant gave his evidence, I accept that he did not consider the question of whether to perform a further abdominal CT scan in isolation but as part of his overall risk-benefit assessment of moving Mdm Lee out of the SICU. I also accept that the brain CT scan was performed on 22 July because of the overriding concern about a life-threatening bleed of the brain, which was not disputed by the Plaintiff. However, the fact that this brain CT scan was performed did not mean that a further abdominal CT scan should have been tagged on thereafter, and the evidence did not go so far as to establish that.
154    On 23 July, Mdm Lee remained in a similar state as she was in on 22 July. In his submissions, the Plaintiff did not take issue with her management on 23 July. Similarly, neither of the Plaintiff’s experts specifically challenged her management on 23 July, beyond Dr Nikfarjam’s assertion that percutaneous drainage should have been performed on or after 17 July. There is thus no need for me to examine Mdm Lee’s management on 23 July.
155    Hence, I am of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in his management of Mdm Lee from 20 to 23 July.
24 to 28 July
156    On 24 July, in consultation with Dr Ang, the Defendant ordered a CT scan of Mdm Lee’s abdomen and pelvis to check her abdominal condition and healing potential.
[note: 318]
 This was performed at 1430hrs, and it revealed a loculated fluid collection in the left suphrenic space and another along the stomach wall. Free intraperitoneal fluid was also seen in the pelvis.
[note: 319]
 At 1730hrs, the Defendant ordered a percutaneous drainage procedure, and consent for this was obtained.
[note: 320]
157    The Defendant testified that he had ordered the 24 July Abdominal CT Scan because the increase in Mdm Lee’s WBC count and the emergence of feculent matter in her abdominal drains indicated a new sinister development.
[note: 321]
 Although, as the Plaintiff observed, these reasons were not mentioned in the AEICs of the Defendant and Dr Ang,
[note: 322]
 they were recorded in Mdm Lee’s contemporaneous clinical notes:
[note: 323]

[Emphasis added in italics and bold]
Thereafter, the Defendant ordered that a percutaneous drainage procedure be performed to drain the loculated fluid collections that were revealed on the 24 July Abdominal CT Scan.
[note: 324]
 However, the procedure was not performed on 24 July because the radiologist asked that Mdm Lee’s coagulopathy be corrected first.
[note: 325]
158    The Plaintiff’s position was that by 24 July, it was “too late” for a further abdominal CT scan.
[note: 326]
 Similarly, neither of his experts specifically challenged Mdm Lee’s management on 24 July, save for Dr Nikfarjam’s broader assertion that percutaneous drainage should have been performed on or after 17 July.
159    On 25 July, Dr Lim assumed the role of consultant-in-charge of the SICU from Dr Ang. At 0720hrs on 25 July, the Defendant reviewed Mdm Lee together with Dr Ang and Dr Lim.
[note: 327]
 Dr Lim was of the opinion that any improvement in Mdm Lee’s condition had plateaued.
[note: 328]
 The clinical view of both the surgical team and the intensivist team was that she was in the best possible state for any intervention. The Defendant therefore decided to perform a laparotomy instead of a percutaneous drainage procedure.
[note: 329]
 This laparotomy was eventually performed on 26 July.
[note: 330]
160    On 27 July, Mdm Lee appeared to improve.
[note: 331]
161    At 0445hrs on 28 July, Mdm Lee took a sudden turn for the worse.
[note: 332]
 At 0730hrs, a second laparotomy was performed.
[note: 333]
 Yet, Mdm Lee continued to deteriorate, and passed away that evening.
162    The Plaintiff also did not appear to take issue with the Defendant’s management of Mdm Lee from 25 to 28 July. Although the Plaintiff challenged the performance of the two laparotomies (on 26 and 28 July) in his SOC, he did not pursue this allegation at trial or in submissions (see [12] above). I am thus of the view that the Defendant did not fall below the standard of care expected of him in his management of Mdm Lee from 25 to 28 July.
Causation: hypothetical intermediate events
163    Even if there was a negligent omission, no liability lies unless the negligence 
caused
 or 
materially contributed
 to the injuries suffered (
Yeo Peng Hock Henry v Pai Lily
 
[2001] 3 SLR(R) 555
 at [52]).
164    Given that the Plaintiff did not plead a loss of chance – that the omission of an abdominal CT scan had deprived Mdm Lee of a better chance to live – he bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities:
(a)     what an abdominal CT scan performed before 2300hrs on 16 July would have revealed;
(b)     that the results of such an abdominal CT scan would have led to earlier clinical intervention; and
(c)     that such earlier clinical intervention would have prevented the demise of Mdm Lee.
165    The Plaintiff submitted that where the loss stemming from a negligent omission could have been avoided if all of several hypothetical intermediate events had occurred, causation is established if the occurrence of 
each
 intermediate event – assessed individually – is proved on a balance of probabilities. It was immaterial that the entire series of intermediate events, on a cumulative probability, was less likely than not to have occurred.
[note: 334]
166    In 
Brodie McCoy (A Minor by her Mother and Litigation Friend Joanne Jones) v East Midlands Strategic Health Authority
 [2011] EWHC 38 (QB) (“
McCoy
”), the plaintiff’s mother underwent a cardiotocograph (“CTG”) trace scan. The defendant-doctor concluded that the CTG trace results were normal and sent the plaintiff’s mother home. The plaintiff was subsequently born with brain damage. The plaintiff alleged that the CTG trace was suspicious and that a further CTG trace should have been ordered. The High Court framed the issue as whether, “had a further scan been carried out on 17
th
 March 1993, on a balance of probabilities would it have led to delivery before hypoxia caused brain damage to [the plaintiff]” (at [8(iii)]). Having found that “the [initial] trace is insufficient evidence upon which to conclude that a continued or further trace would have been suspicious”, the High Court held (at [81]):
I find on a balance of probabilities that the Claimant has not established that a second or resumed CTG on 17
th
 March 1993 would have been suspicious or pathological so as to lead her obstetrician to decide that Ms Jones' baby should be delivered on 18
th
 March 1993 or at any time before 21
st
 March 1993.
167    Similarly, in 
Bright (Billy-Joe Marie) (by her father and litigation friend Peter Bright) v Barnsley District General Hospital NHS Trust
 [2005] Lloyd’s Rep Med 449 (QB) (“
Bright
”), a doctor negligently omitted to carry out an ultrasound scan to check foetal growth at 32 weeks’ gestation. A scan at 32 weeks’ gestation had a 60% chance of revealing foetal distress, which would have necessitated a further scan. Such a further scan had an 80% chance of showing a growth restricted foetus, which would have necessitated a careful controlled delivery, which had in turn an 80% chance of delivering an undamaged child. The defendant argued that the cumulative probability of delivering an undamaged child was thus 60% x 80% x 80% = 38%, which fell short of proof on a balance of probabilities. The English High Court rejected the argument, and held that each probabilistic event was a separate hypothetical fact to be decided on the balance of probabilities (at [35]).
[W]hat would the reasonable radiographer at this hospital have found at the first 32-week scan which should have been carried out? In my judgment, it is settled and conventional law that this is to be answered on the balance of probabilities and it is agreed that on balance that such a scan would probably have revealed a [distressed foetus]. This is a 
question of (hypothetical) fact to be decided on a balance of probability
. 
Thereafter
, for the purposes of deciding what would then have happened (ie 32 weeks’ scanning revealing [distressed foetus]) is something which is to be 
treated as though it would have occurred in fact
.
[Emphasis added]
168    I agree with this approach. As the English High Court explained, “there should be no difference in approach in … deciding on what would have happened as opposed to deciding whether something had or had not actually happened” (at [41]). Moreover, the alternative of examining the cumulative probability of a chain of hypothetical events would open the causation inquiry to abuse, for one could formulate an infinite number of intermediate events the occurrence of each of which involves a degree of uncertainty.
Before 2300hrs on 16 July
169    I have found no breach of duty in the Defendant’s omission to perform an abdominal CT scan (and percutaneous drainage) before 2300hrs on 16 July (see [54], [84], and [117] above). This suffices to dispose of the claims in negligence in respect of Mdm Lee’s post-operative management before 2300hrs on 16 July. For completeness, I will nevertheless address the point of whether an omission to perform an abdominal CT scan before 2300hrs on 16 July caused Mdm Lee’s demise.
170    Dr Beckingham asserted only that an abdominal CT scan performed between 11 July and 2300hrs on 16 July “may well have identified further collections in the abdomen”, and that there “may well have been a collection in the pelvis on the 11th which has not yet been drained”.
[note: 335]
 This was vague, and did not prove on a balance of probabilities that an abdominal CT scan before 2300hrs on 16 July would have revealed such collections.
171    Dr Mak opined that the images of Mdm Lee’s abdomen produced by the 11 July chest CT scan did not show the presence of fluid beyond the right suphrenic space. Accordingly, an abdominal CT scan done on 11 July would have shown only the same fluid in the right suphrenic space revealed on the chest CT scan and no other abnormal features beyond that.
[note: 336]
 Since there were no signs of tenderness, guarding, or rebound tenderness, there would likely have been no evidence of a Dehiscence.
172    Dr Nikfarjam initially gave evidence that an abdominal CT scan performed on 14 July would have revealed the same features shown on the abdominal CT scan that was performed on 17 July (see [118] below). The improvements that Mdm Lee displayed on 15 and 16 July were due to her good organs compensating for the deficiencies in the organs that had failed. By 2300hrs on 16 July, however, she had become so unwell that she was unable to support her vital signs.
[note: 337]
 However, Dr Nikfarjam subsequently conceded that the 
extent
 of the fluid collections revealed would differ between an abdominal CT scan performed on 14 July and the 17 July Abdominal CT Scan. The fluid was building up within Mdm Lee’s abdomen between 14 and 17 July.
[note: 338]
 
Ms Tan:
 
 
I'm just taking you hypothetically on what you are saying, okay? If the fluid is building up from the 14th to the 17th, are you saying that what you will see on the CT scan on the 14th then will not be what -- be the same as what you see on the CT scan on the 17th?
 
 
Dr Nikfarjam:
 
 
I will clarify. What I mean is that the patient, if they had an oral contrast, like they did with the CT on the 14th, you would see oral contrast leaving the stomach into the peritoneal cavity; you would see free gas into the peritoneal cavity. The extent of fluid builds up with time, and some of it on the 17th was leaving the abdomen through the drain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
So the amount of fluid, the exact amount wouldn't be exactly the same on the 14th. There would be a buildup to the 17th.
 
 
[Emphasis added]
173    On balance, it remained unclear what an abdominal CT scan performed after the 11 July chest CT scan, but before the 17 July Abdominal CT Scan, would have revealed. Hence, the Plaintiff has not established that Mdm Lee would have been managed differently had the Defendant ordered an abdominal CT scan between 11 July and 2300hrs on 16 July. In consequence, I am unable to find on the balance of probabilities that carrying out such a CT scan would have saved her life.
After 2300hrs on 16 July
174    The Plaintiff made no submissions on the question of causation in relation to the events after 2300hrs on 16 July.
[note: 339]
 I reiterate that Mdm Lee was in no condition for percutaneous drainage from 17 to 19 July (see [137]–[140] above), while percutaneous drainage was in fact ordered on 24 July (see [156] above). This leaves only the period from 20 to 23 July.
175    In my view, even if the Defendant had ordered a percutaneous drainage procedure between 20 and 23 July, it was unlikely that the procedure would have been performed immediately. Mdm Lee was in no better a coagulopathic state from 20 to 23 July than she was in on 24 July.
[note: 340]
 At 1730hrs on 24 July, the radiologist tasked with performing the percutaneous drainage ordered by the Defendant had directed that the coagulopathy be corrected first (see [157] above), and the correction had not been completed by 0720hrs the following morning.
[note: 341]
176    Accordingly, the Plaintiff has not established that the Defendant’s omission to order a further abdominal CT scan (and a percutaneous drainage procedure) between 2300hrs on 16 July and the 24 July Abdominal CT Scan caused Mdm Lee’s demise.
Feeds
177    It was not part of the Plaintiff’s pleaded case that Mdm Lee’s post-operative feeding between 11 July and 2300hrs on 16 July was inappropriate.
[note: 342]
 However, the question of feeding was raised by the Plaintiff at trial and in submission. For completeness, I will consider the feeds provided to Mdm Lee that have been raised by the Plaintiff.
178    The Plaintiff submitted that “the major disruption late on 16 July 2011 was likely the result of the Defendant’s failure to cease oral feeding and on the contrary increasing Mdm Lee’s feeding to full liquid feeds and soft feeds thereafter.”
[note: 343]
11 July to 1900hrs on 13 July
179    From 11 July until 1900hrs on 13 July, Mdm Lee had small liquid feeds.
180    The Plaintiff submitted that “it was imperative to be certain that a patient did not have a Leak prior to commencing them on feeding.”
[note: 344]
 Hence, the only prudent course from 11 July was to keep Mdm Lee Nil-by-Mouth (
ie
, no oral feeding).
[note: 345]
 He relied on Dr Mak’s opinion that oral feeds may aggravate a Dehiscence,
[note: 346]
 on Dr Beckingham’s assertion that “pouring fluid into her mouth [without eliminating the possibility of a Dehiscence] may cause infection or irritation and cause a SIRS response”
[note: 347]
 [see [190] below], and on Dr Nikfarjam’s evidence that “[i]n patients with a PG [anastomosis], once a major anastomotic leak occurs food and fluid that is taken orally is likely to leak out the stomach, exacerbating the problem.”
[note: 348]
181    However, Dr Beckingham testified that the small liquid feeds were “insignificant”,
[note: 349]
 did not do any harm,
[note: 350]
 and were “reasonable” 
whether or not Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence
.
[note: 351]
 Dr Nikfarjam agreed that there was “no established restriction against giving oral intake after a POPF, by definition, is present”,
[note: 352]
 and that it was appropriate that she was “put progressively on liquids” from 8 to 13 July.
[note: 353]
182    Given that the Defendant had observed that Mdm Lee had tolerated her liquid feeds well, the Plaintiff has not established that the feeds from 11 July to 1900hrs on 13 July were inappropriate.
1900hrs on 13 July to 1900hrs on 14 July
183    From 1900hrs on 13 July until the morning of 14 July, Mdm Lee had a soft 
food
[note: 354]
 diet.
[note: 355]
 However, after her bout of abdominal pain at 1000hrs on 14 July (at [85] above), she was kept Nil-by-Mouth.
[note: 356]
184    The Plaintiff submitted that the signs and symptoms exhibited by Mdm Lee on and after 14 July (at [85]–[87] above]) “started surfacing almost immediately after Mdm Lee was commenced on soft foods in the evening of 13 July”.
[note: 357]
 He concluded that “[a]s evident from the final outcome, the result of commencing soft foods was truly disastrous and could have been avoided.”
[note: 358]
185    However, neither of the Plaintiff’s experts took issue with this soft food diet and the placing of Mdm Lee Nil-by-Mouth thereafter. Dr Nikfarjam found the soft food diet reasonable and “the correct order to make”, even if there was a POPF by definition.
[note: 359]
 Dr Beckingham testified that the soft food diet was reasonable only if there was no Dehiscence,
[note: 360]
 but conceded that there was no evidence that it produced sufficient gastric fluid to cause pain, and that any such increase in gastric fluid could in any event have been controlled by the abdominal drains.
[note: 361]
186    Accordingly, the Plaintiff has not established that the feeds from 1900hrs on 13 July to 1900hrs on 14 July were inappropriate.
1900hrs on 14 July to 2300hrs on 16 July 
187    Around 1900hrs on 14 July, when the pain had subsided, Mdm Lee was given 250ml of small 
liquid
[note: 362]
 feeds.
[note: 363]
188    At 0810hrs on 15 July, the surgical team increased Mdm Lee’s liquid feeds to 500ml/day after reviewing her and finding no complaints of pain. At 1320hrs, she had taken her liquid feeds well, continued to have no complaints, and was cheerful, mobilising, and hungry. Her abdominal signs were normal, soft and non-distended, and she was passing flatus. The Defendant thus increased her liquid feeds to 1L/day.
[note: 364]
 At 2130hrs, she had tolerated these full or unrestricted
[note: 365]
 liquid feeds well.
[note: 366]
189    On 16 July, Mdm Lee was continued on full liquid feeds. At 0903hrs, she had 200ml of coffee.
[note: 367]
 At 0930hrs, the Defendant ordered that a soft food diet be kept in view if there was no more pain (although Mdm Lee never did progress to the soft food diet).
[note: 368]
 At 1300hrs, Mdm Lee had 100ml of Milo.
[note: 369]
 Thereafter, she continued to be clinically well despite her abdominal pain, which was localised to faecal loading and which resolved once she passed motion. The full liquid feeds were thus maintained.
[note: 370]
190    The Plaintiff submitted that the major disruption late on 16 July 2011 stemmed from the Defendant’s failure to cease oral feeding. Instead, the Defendant put Mdm Lee on full liquid feeds.
[note: 371]
 The Plaintiff cited the oral evidence-in-chief of Dr Beckingham:
[note: 372]
Well, we know that we already have a pancreatic leak, by definition; but something has changed on the 16th. And I think what has happened is that from the period from the 4th to 16th there has obviously been a pancreatic fistula present, but on the 16th, either with the 
introduction
 of 
food
 on the two days -- 
which starts two days before
, that that has enlarged the fistula. The fistula is a hole between the stomach and the peritoneal cavity. So whether that has enlarged it or it's become a secondary infection, one of these two features has introduced what we call a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, a SIRS attack, which is where the body basically starts to react against itself and causes breakdown of various organs, which we see evident in Mdm Lee later on.
[Emphasis added in italics and bold]
191    I make three observations.
192    First, Dr Beckingham’s opinion above had to be viewed with circumspection. It was unclear whether his reference to “food” on 14 July was to the soft food diet that morning or the small liquid feeds that evening: the Plaintiff could not prove that the soft food diet that morning was unreasonable (see [184] above), while Dr Beckingham accepted that the small liquid feeds that evening were appropriate.
[note: 373]
 It was also unclear whether Dr Beckingham had mistakenly believed that Mdm Lee had consumed 
solid
 foods rather than 
liquid
 feeds from 1900hrs on 14 July. I thus hesitate to conclude that the liquid feeds on 15 July exacerbated the POPF. Dr Beckingham’s subsequent comment in cross-examination that “the thing that I would not want to do is 
start
 pouring fluid into her mouth … which may cause infection or irritation and cause a SIRS response [emphasis added]”
[note: 374]
 was, with respect, unconsidered, given his earlier acceptance that small fluid feeds would be insignificant and not cause any harm (see [181] above). Indeed, the Plaintiff relied on the comment not to show that the liquid feeds had in themselves caused or materially contributed to Mdm Lee’s condition at 2300hrs on 16 July, but only to establish that there was already a Dehiscence.
[note: 375]
193    Secondly, although Dr Mak said that he would not have given small liquid feeds of up to 1L/day from 15 July, he added that there was no evidence that the Dehiscence was aggravated by the liquid feeds that Mdm Lee had from the evening of 15 July.
[note: 376]
194    Thirdly, Dr Nikfarjam, who took the position that Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence by 7 July, nevertheless agreed that the “continuation of liquids from 14th night to 16
th
 [was] reasonable.”
[note: 377]
195    In the interests of completeness, I note also that Dr Mak accepted in cross-examination that he would not have ordered liquid feeds of 1L/day on 15 July if he had suspected that Mdm Lee had a Dehiscence.
[note: 378]
 However, the questions put to him in cross-examination were limited to what he himself would have done on 15 July, and not whether what the Defendant in fact did on 15 July was negligent. Neither party addressed this aspect of Dr Mak’s evidence in its submissions.
196    Accordingly, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that Mdm Lee’s feeds caused or materially contributed to the injuries suffered by her.
Conclusion
197    The Plaintiff has taken a machine-gun approach with his allegations in the hope that one of the bullets fired would find its target. In his SOC, he alleged that the Defendant (a) failed to obtain the informed consent of Mdm Lee to the Whipple operation; (b) failed to perform the Whipple operation and two subsequent surgeries in the manner required of an HPB specialist; and (c) failed to deliver timely and appropriate post-operative care (see [11] above). It was only before the trial commenced that he narrowed his allegation to the post-operative management of Mdm Lee, which was limited to the period between the Whipple operation on 4 July and 17 July (although he subsequently attempted to extend it up to 24 or 26 July) (see [12] and [47] above). Even then, many of his allegations of negligence were not borne out by the evidence of his experts.
198    Unfortunately, the Defendant also muddied the waters by his attempts to downplay the possibility that Mdm Lee had suffered a Dehiscence, which included the tenuous distinctions between a POPF and a Dehiscence, and between suspecting and diagnosing each condition. These assertions were contrived, particularly in view of the Defendant’s belated submission that he had suspected a Dehiscence from 7 July (see [40] above). Even so, the burden remains on the Plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities.
199    The Plaintiff has not shown that the Defendant was negligent in omitting to order an abdominal CT scan before 2300hrs on 16 July. Even if it was open to him to argue that a further abdominal CT scan should have been performed before 1430hrs on 24 July, he has also been unable to establish that the Defendant was negligent in failing to do so. Further, he has not established that such an abdominal CT scan or further abdominal CT scan would have led the Defendant to have managed Mdm Lee differently. Finally, he has not proven that such a different management of Mdm Lee would have saved her life.
200    Accordingly, I find that the Plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden of proof. I dismiss his claim against the Defendant.
201    I will hear the parties on costs.
202    I record my appreciation for the assistance rendered by Dr Winston Woon, Senior Consultant, HPB Surgery Service, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He was an assessor appointed by the court and gave as much of his time as he could.

Introduction
1       In December 2013, the appellant, Sim Wen Yi, Ernest, bought two types of airsoft arms (an airsoft pistol and an airsoft gun) in Thailand and brought them back to Singapore. He was 25 years old then. He first started using these arms to shoot at trees and inanimate objects. This escalated when he began shooting people from his second floor residential unit, taking aim at them as they walked along public areas below. In January 2015 alone, he shot at three unsuspecting persons on four occasions. The hard, non-compressible plastic pellets discharged from these arms even hit one of the victims on her temple, near her eye.
2       Eight charges under the Arms and Explosives Act (Cap 13, 2003 Rev Ed) (“the AEA”) and the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) were preferred against the appellant. He pleaded guilty to and was convicted of three charges for the following offences:
(a)     Importation of the airsoft pistol under s 13(1)(
b
) read with s 13(2)(
a
) of the AEA for which he was sentenced to a fine of $8,000 (“the Importation Charge”).
(b)     Possession of the airsoft gun under s 13(1)(
a
) read with s 13(4) of the AEA for which he was sentenced to a fine of $4,000 (“the Possession Charge”).
(c)     Voluntarily causing hurt using an airsoft gun, an instrument for shooting under s 324 of the Penal Code for which he was sentenced to seven weeks’ imprisonment (“the s 324 charge”).
The s 324 charge
3       The arguments on appeal largely concerned the custodial sentence imposed for the s 324 charge. In the proceedings below, the prosecution submitted that an eight-week imprisonment term would be appropriate given that (a) the appellant had targeted and shot at the victim; (b) the offence was premeditated; (c) the offence was committed out of mischief and boredom; (d) the offence could have resulted in serious injury to the victim and (e) the appellant had shot at two other victims as reflected in the three other related charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
4       In their written submissions filed for the purposes of the appeal, the prosecution maintained that a custodial sentence would still be warranted for the s 324 charge. However the prosecution changed their position on the appropriate length of the custodial sentence, and submitted instead that a one-week imprisonment term would be sufficient. They highlighted a recent development, namely a test conducted post-sentence by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) that was inconclusive as to the degree of dangerousness posed by the airsoft arms in question
[note: 1]
.
5       The appellant accepted that the prosecution’s submission was extremely fair but nevertheless implored the court to consider the possibility of a probation order.
[note: 2]
 The appellant also urged the court to consider exercising its powers under s 390(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) to alter the charge from s 324 of the Penal Code to s 337 or s 352 of the same.
[note: 3]
 The principal reason for this was that the prosecution had not clearly established that any serious hurt was caused to the victim.
6       I did not think that probation was appropriate. However I was persuaded that it would be fair and just to alter the s 324 charge to a lesser charge under s 337 of the Penal Code and I accordingly gave the necessary order. The appellant was thus eligible to be considered for a Community-Based Sentence (“CBS”) or a suitable combination of CBSs. As the appellant was found suitable to perform community service, I concluded that a combination of a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) and a Community Service Order (“CSO”) would be the most appropriate order on the facts.
7       In allowing the appeal, I delivered a brief oral judgment. I now set out the full grounds of my decision. These grounds will focus primarily on why I altered the s 324 charge and imposed a combination of CBSs (as opposed to probation or some other sentence). I will also make several observations on the correctness of the sentences imposed in relation to the Importation Charge and Possession Charge. This concerned the issue of whether a fine 
and
 an imprisonment term were both mandated by law.
Whether the High Court has the power to alter the s 324 charge
8       Section 390(4) of the CPC permits the appellate court to frame an altered charge (whether or not it attracts a higher punishment), if the court is satisfied that, based on the records before it, there is sufficient evidence to constitute a case which the accused has to answer. A reading of s 390(3) of the CPC confirms that this is a power that applies even where an accused has pleaded guilty and has been convicted on such plea.
9       This interpretation was not disputed by the prosecution in the course of the hearing of the appeal. It is supported by a recent decision of Sundaresh Menon CJ in 
Koh Bak Kiang v Public Prosecutor
 
[2016] 2 SLR 574
 (“
Koh Bak Kiang
”). The facts of 
Koh Bak Kiang
 are as follows. On 29 November 2007, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges for trafficking in diamorphine and one for the possession of ketamine. He asserted in mitigation through his counsel that he did not know the precise nature of the drug he was trafficking. He had been led to believe that it was a drug other than diamorphine. He nonetheless maintained that he was not qualifying his plea.
10     Some six and a half years after the accused pleaded guilty, he filed a criminal motion seeking an extension of time to appeal against his convictions. Since his main complaint was that his convictions were unsafe because he had qualified his plea, the matter was remitted to the District Court for it to record evidence on the specific point of whether the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drug he was trafficking in. Subsequently, both the accused and the prosecution were in agreement that the most appropriate course was for the court to substitute, in the place of the earlier convictions, convictions on 
amended
 charges. The question that arose was whether the court had the power to substitute the convictions on the disputed charges with convictions on amended charges. The provision that was in issue was s 256(
b
) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC 1985”), the predecessor of s 390(4) of the CPC, which provided that the court may:
in an appeal from a conviction —
(i)    reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial;
(ii)   alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or
(iii)   with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence[.]
11     CJ Menon referred to the decision of 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 1 SLR(R) 95
 (“
Garmaz
”) in which the Court of Appeal confirmed that s 256(
b
) of the CPC 1985 empowers the High Court, when hearing an appeal from a 
conviction made after a trial
 to amend a charge and convict the accused person on the amended charge, subject to the safeguard that the amendment did not cause prejudice to the accused. In 
Koh Bak Kiang
, the prosecution and the appellant agreed that the charge should be amended. CJ Menon drew support from cases in which the power to amend the charge on appeal had been previously exercised where the accused had pleaded guilty in the court below (
eg
, 
Public Prosecutor v Henry John William
 
[2002] 1 SLR(R) 274
) and held that the High Court’s power to amend the charge in its appellate capacity under s 256(
b
) of the CPC 1985 extended to situations where the accused had pleaded guilty in the court below (at [55]). It was in this context that CJ Menon observed that any want of clarity in the CPC 1985 has been resolved by s 390 of the present CPC which sets out the powers of an appellate court in hearing an appeal against a sentence imposed following a plea of guilt (at [55]).
Whether the court should exercise its powers to alter the s 324 charge 
12     On the premise that the High Court has the power to amend a charge and convict an accused person on the amended charge in cases where the accused had pleaded guilty in the court below, the next question that arises is whether this power should be exercised. It has been held that the power must be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against prejudice to the defence: 
Public Prosecutor v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR(R) 112
 at [21]. Therefore, to avoid injustice and prejudice to the accused, the court must be satisfied that the proceedings below would have taken the same course, and that the evidence recorded would have been the same.
13     If there is no reason to impugn the correctness of the charge, there would correspondingly be no reason to alter it. Thus, in determining whether the s 324 charge should be altered in the present case, the first question to ask was whether the conviction under s 324 was correct. In my assessment, this question had to be addressed as there were material uncertainties in the prosecution’s case which caused concern: first, whether the airsoft gun was indeed as dangerous as suggested by the prosecution through the literature tendered, in spite of the inconclusiveness of recent HSA tests; and second, whether hurt was in fact caused to the victim (which is a distinct enquiry from whether hurt could potentially have been caused) and the extent of hurt involved.
14     The airsoft gun was accepted to be a dangerous weapon by definition only because s 324, which creates the offence of causing hurt with a dangerous weapon, defines such a weapon to include “any instrument for shooting”. But on a purely literal reading, without further reference to the requirement that hurt has to be caused in order to satisfy the requirements of s 324, even a “Nerf” gun (
ie
 a toy gun which fires soft foam darts), a “Laser Tag” gun (which does not discharge any projectile whatsoever) or a toddler’s water pistol is a “dangerous weapon”. Such a wide reading would be entirely absurd. In my view, an “instrument for shooting” cannot be said to be dangerous at all in the context of a s 324 charge unless there is clear evidence that hurt (
ie
 as defined in s 319 of the Penal Code as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”) was caused. Unfortunately the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) did not mention whether any hurt was in fact caused, let alone how extensive it was. It is not enough that hurt could potentially be caused if there is no evidence of actual hurt caused. And if there was only very minimal discomfort (or “no significant hurt”
[note: 4]
) thus suggesting it might have been 
de minimis
, would the facts truly warrant a s 324 charge?
15     In examining whether hurt was caused to the victim, I found nothing in the SOF to suggest that the victim had suffered any “bodily pain” or bodily injury. To that extent, it could be said that the SOF did not adequately support the s 324 charge even though the appellant was prepared to accept the charge that was preferred and to plead guilty to it. There was at least some lingering doubt whether hurt was in fact caused or whether the victim was merely annoyed or irritated by the fact that she became the unfortunate subject of the accused’s target practice.
16     The learned DPP, Mr Prem Raj Prabakaran (“Mr Prem Raj”), suggested that since a police report was lodged, this could permit a reasonable inference (by deduction) that the victim did suffer hurt and was sufficiently aggrieved to warrant her taking action to lodge a report. With respect, I could not agree. The mere fact that a police report was lodged does not give rise to the inexorable inference that the victim had suffered bodily pain. Police reports have been lodged over far lesser infractions or perceived slights.
17     In view of the prosecution’s concession that the level of danger posed by the airsoft gun could not be conclusively stated, the court was left to speculate on this material aspect. There was literature tendered by the prosecution to show that such guns 
can
 potentially be dangerous but they concerned tests which had been conducted on other airsoft guns which are not generic. Counsel was nevertheless prepared to concede that the airsoft gun in question can potentially be dangerous if the pellets struck vulnerable areas such as a person’s eyes. Much depends on the specifications of the gun in question, 
eg
 the nature of the gun firing mechanism (spring or gas 
etc
), the range of the weapon and the type of pellets used. Other factors such as wind conditions as well as the shooter’s skill would likely influence the level of danger posed by the gun. Even if one accepts that the airsoft gun can be dangerous, there was no reliable evidence that it was in fact as dangerous as suggested by the prosecution, especially in light of the literature tendered.
18     I was therefore minded to consider either of two options which I raised with the DPP and counsel for the appellant on 5 July 2016. The first option would be for the court to exercise its revisionary power to set aside the conviction since there were doubts whether a fundamental ingredient of the s 324 charge, namely hurt (
ie
, ‘bodily pain’), was established. In addition, the entire basis on which the prosecution had sought the custodial sentence of eight weeks before the District Judge was flawed if it cannot be said with any certainty how dangerous the airsoft gun was. Should this course of action be adopted, the prosecution could then review the appropriateness of the charge and if the appellant still wished to plead guilty, the plea could be taken afresh, perhaps on an amended charge if necessary.
19     Should any charge involving hurt as an ingredient still be tendered, then the SOF ought to contain a clear statement of the relevant pain and/or injury suffered (if any). The absence of any such statement in these circumstances lends itself to the strong inference that any pain or injury was either non-existent or minimal at most. The undesirability of this approach (
ie
 revision and re-taking the plea), however, was that it would protract the matter and effectively allow the prosecution the full benefit of a “second bite” to get it right when they ought to have done so in the court below. I was less inclined to adopt this course, and counsel and the DPP were of a similar view.
20     The second option, in line with what was suggested by Mr Shashi Nathan (“Mr Nathan”), counsel for the appellant, was for the court to alter the charge under s 390(4) and substitute a conviction on a lesser charge (
eg
, s 337 or s 352). This was the parties’ preferred course and mine as well. It would not operate to the prejudice of the appellant. The court would then also be permitted a wider range of sentencing options, including CBS or a combination of CBSs. A combination of a SDO and a CSO might be a more appropriate option as the offence involves antisocial behaviour and disturbance and possible danger to the community.
21     Mr Prem Raj’s disclosure of the recent HSA test results, despite their adversity to the prosecution’s case, was highly commendable as a demonstration of candour and even-handedness. The prosecution has an overriding duty to act fairly to advance the public interest and assist the court. Ideally, of course, this duty ought to have been performed at first instance. The HSA tests were said to have been a “recent development” but the airsoft arms ought to have been tested before the plea was taken, particularly since the prosecution intended to seek a significant custodial sentence. Those tests could and indeed should have been conducted before the prosecution proceeded with a s 324 charge at the plead-guilty mention and submitted for a lengthy custodial sentence of at least 8 weeks’ imprisonment.
[note: 5]
22     The prosecution might well have decided not to proceed with the s 324 charge had the results of the HSA tests been available before the plea of guilt was taken. With the benefit of hindsight and an opportunity to take a fresh look at the matter, I was of the view that it would be fairer to afford the appellant the benefit of doubt by replacing the original charge with a lesser charge. I formed this view after having regard to the crucial issue of whether the SOF adequately supported the ingredient of hurt under s 324.
23     In directing that the charge be altered, I was fully conscious that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion should not be lightly interfered with. The Public Prosecutor has an extensive discretion to decide on both the nature of the charges and the number of charges: 
Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v Public Prosecutor
 
[2012] 2 SLR 774
 (“
Kalaiarasi
”) at [4]. The court should be slow to substitute its opinion for what the prosecution considers to be the most appropriate charge in the circumstances. Otherwise, the court would risk usurping the discretion that has been constitutionally vested in the Public Prosecutor.
24     I was heartened to note Mr Prem Raj’s indication that an alteration of the charge would not meet with any objections from the prosecution. I had in fact requested Mr Prem Raj to propose what a more appropriate lesser charge ought to be. There was clearly no prejudice to the defence if the charge at hand was amended to a lesser one. Mr Nathan recognised that an alteration of this nature could only operate to his client’s benefit and thus had also concurred with this approach. I permitted a brief adjournment to 8 July and on that date, the parties informed me that they had reached agreement that a reduced charge under s 337(
a
) of the Penal Code, 
ie
 of doing a rash act endangering personal safety, was appropriate. Accordingly, an amended SOF was tendered in support of the altered charge.
25     The prosecution clarified in the amended SOF that while the victim did suffer hurt, the hurt caused was apparently not severe. It was common ground that the victim felt a “sharp pain” causing her to exclaim as she was hit just above her chest by the hard pellet fired by the appellant from his airsoft gun (see the amended SOF at [5]). No medical report was tendered as the victim did not seek medical attention. Nothing in the SOF indicated that the victim suffered any severe injury or trauma.
26     In the premises, I was satisfied that the alteration of the charge to the offence under s 337(
a
) of the Penal Code was fair and appropriate. Having confirmed that the appellant accepted the amended SOF, I proceeded to record a conviction on the altered charge.
Whether probation would be appropriate
27     In view of the alteration of the charge to a lesser one, it might then be contended that there is at least an arguably stronger case for probation to be considered. In 
Lim Li Ling v Public Prosecutor
 
[2007] 1 SLR(R) 165
, it was observed that while the archetype of the appropriate candidate for probation remains the young “amateur” offender, the court may exceptionally be persuaded to allow probation in cases involving older offenders (at [87]). The age of the offender is usually deemed relevant because the chances of effective rehabilitation in the case of young offenders are greater than in the case of adults and this generally makes probation more relevant where young offenders are concerned.
28     Having said that, I was also conscious that older offenders may in fact be more receptive to probation as they are generally more mature and better able to understand their responsibilities, the consequences of breaching probation, and the significance of being afforded a chance for reform. In the present case, the chances of effective rehabilitation for the 27-year-old appellant are no doubt still present but the nature of the offences is serious and deserving of strong disapprobation. A measure of general deterrence was also necessary. While the appellant’s age was not strictly a barrier to granting probation, I was also mindful that at his age, he really ought to have known better than to put members of the public at risk of injury by his conduct. As there were significant aggravating features as well, I did not think probation was a suitable option.
Aggravating factors
29     A number of aggravating features were clearly present. The acts were not one-off but deliberate and persistent. I did not think it was correct to characterise them as momentary lapses or as sudden, impulsive and immature acts. This was particularly so when there were four separate incidents in one month involving three victims who became hapless subjects of target practice for the appellant. One of them had the misfortune of being targeted twice and shot at on consecutive days. He shot at them as they walked along public areas below his second floor residential flat. The hard pellet even hit one of them at her temple, near her eye. Public safety and public disquiet was caused and the offences were difficult to detect.
30     The broader harm in terms of the risk of potential danger and serious injury could not be ignored. These were not mere toy guns. Though usually made of plastic, they were realistic, full-scale replicas of actual firearms. It was common ground that the hard pellets fired from the airsoft guns were capable of causing serious injuries, for example if they struck a person’s eye at close range. Therefore the appellant’s level of culpability remained high. He was very fortunate that no serious injuries were caused.
Mitigating factors 
31     I noted that there were also relevant mitigating factors: the appellant had pleaded guilty, was remorseful, and had compensated the victims. He had no previous convictions. His parents remained supportive. Some other factors raised on his behalf – the lack of any significant hurt, the suggestion that these were “less dangerous” weapons – were not truly mitigating but merely neutral. His reasons for committing the offence, 
ie
 that he acted on “impulse” or out of “boredom” or “mischief”, were certainly not mitigating in the circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, neither do I consider them to be aggravating factors.
32     The appellant was hardly a youthful or immature offender – he was over 26 years of age in January 2015 and was (until recently) gainfully employed as a bank officer. Although I did not consider probation to be suitable in the circumstances, a calibrated mix of deterrence and rehabilitation was in my view a necessary element of the appropriate sentence. The offences harmed the community by causing disquiet among persons in his neighbourhood. I was of the view that his likelihood of reoffending was low and hence a combination of CBSs was suitable.
Whether CBS would be appropriate
33     The crux of the issue was whether the appellant, who was over 26 years old at the time of offending, was a suitable candidate for a combination of CBSs. It is helpful to begin by identifying the legislative intent underlying the CBS framework. CBSs were introduced to allow greater flexibility in balancing the various sentencing principles in individual cases. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: 
ie
 regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions (
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs)).
34     I will now turn to consider some precedents where SDOs were ordered. I begin with a recent decision of the High Court in 
Public Prosecutor v Daryl Lim Jun Liang
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 9047 of 2014 (16 July 2015) (“
Daryl Lim
”). The facts of the case are set out in the District Court’s decision which is reported as 
Public Prosecutor v Daryl Lim Jun Liang
 
[2015] SGDC 144
. The offender, who was 17 years old at the relevant time, met up with his three accomplices and set out to look for foreign workers to assault. A foreign national worker was punched multiple times on the face and mouth by two of the offender’s accomplices. There was nothing to indicate that the offender had himself participated actively or assaulted the victim. It was accepted, however, that the two others had acted in furtherance of the common intention of the group of four and hence the offender was criminally liable.
35     The District Judge took the view that the need for a tough deterrent message could be outweighed by other considerations such as the offender’s rehabilitative capacity or the absence of any need for extended incarceration, or the principle of proportionality. He further observed that CBSs could serve as a midpoint of sorts for youthful offenders where the offence is relatively minor in nature and is not ruled out by the strictly exclusionary criteria. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the District Judge passed the following combination of three CBSs on the offender: (a) ten days’ detention in prison under an SDO; (b) 150 hours of community service to be completed within 12 months; and (c) a 12-month day reporting order with daily time restriction from 10pm to 6am and electronic monitoring.
36     On appeal to the High Court, Sundaresh Menon CJ observed that the real question in dealing with a youthful offender was whether the general emphasis on rehabilitation had been displaced. Given the specific circumstances of the case which included the offender’s role in the incident, as well as his favourable probation report and suitability report for day reporting, CJ Menon agreed that CBS was appropriate but adjusted the District Judge’s orders by directing that his parents should be bonded in a suitable sum to ensure his good behaviour.
37     In 
Public Prosecutor v Joachim Gabriel Lai Zhen
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 20 of 2015) (24 November 2015) (“
Joachim Gabriel
”), the offender was charged with and convicted of voluntarily causing hurt to a public transport worker. The offender was 21 years old at the time of offending. He had been drinking heavily at Clarke Quay before he boarded the victim’s taxi at about 3.30 am. He assaulted the victim after refusing to pay the taxi fare despite having been sent to his intended destination. After he was charged in 2013, the offender claimed trial. The District Judge imposed a 14-day SDO on the offender, chiefly because of his relatively young age at the time of the offence, and also due to his remorse and his capacity for reform and reintegration into the community.
38     On appeal by the prosecution, the issue before me was whether this was such an exceptional case that warranted a departure from the benchmark sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for offences involving violence against public transport workers as set out in the case of 
Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor
 
[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115
. In my oral judgment, I explained why I took the view that such a departure was not warranted on the facts. There was nothing to suggest that the offender’s capacity for rehabilitation was so demonstrably high that a CBS would suffice. His acceptance of responsibility through his belated plea of guilt and compensation made to the victim were apparent afterthoughts. Further, his intoxication and impulsiveness were aggravating factors in the context of such offences. Therefore, I allowed the prosecution’s appeal and substituted the 14-day SDO with a four-week imprisonment term.
39     In contrast, in 
Public Prosecutor v Gan Boon Kheng
 
[2016] SGDC 162
, a 25-year-old offender who had also committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt was assessed to be suitable for a combination of an SDO and a CSO. There, the offender punched the victim during an altercation which arose out of a basketball game. In sentencing the offender to a combination of an SDO and a CSO, the District Judge expressly rejected the prosecution’s submission that CBSs are meant only for young offenders and minor offences of a regulatory nature or for persons with mental disorders. He reasoned that CBSs also seek to offer offenders the opportunity to move on from their first mistake of committing a crime, one that is not so serious as to preclude rehabilitation (at [18]). Further, in his view, the SDO caters to the situation where the court finds that the threshold for imposing a custodial sentence has been crossed due to the nature of the offence, but that at the same time, the offender possesses the necessary characteristics and support for immediate re-integration into society (at [22]). The prosecution’s appeal against sentence was discontinued.
40     The important point that emerges from the above authorities is that the suitability of the various types of CBS orders depends on the type of offender and the type of offence. This calls for an open-textured assessment that is highly contextualised and the court must have regard to all the facts of the case. Some types of CBS may have greater relevance in the cases which involve youthful offenders since such offenders are often seen to have greater rehabilitative capacity. Nevertheless, I did not think that offenders over the age of 21 should 
ipso facto
 be denied the opportunity to be considered for CBS. The rehabilitative aim does not automatically recede into the background once the offender reaches 21 years of age. In every case, the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine whether rehabilitation should be given prominence notwithstanding any countervailing need for deterrence, retribution or prevention: 
Kalaiarasi
 at [39]. Thus, the appropriateness of CBS is a question which turns on 
all
 the relevant circumstances of each case, including the offence and offender in question.
41     This approach is consistent with ss 346 and 348 of the CPC which provide that persons above 16 years of age can be considered for CSOs and SDOs respectively; the provisions do not restrict the imposition of such orders to offenders below the age of 21. It is also in line with the broad policy objective that undergirds the CBS framework, that is, to enable offenders of less serious crimes to be dealt with in ways other than by imposing fines or imprisonment to enhance their chances of rehabilitation without diluting the deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardising the public’s sense of safety (
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume 1
 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
”) at p 77).
42     Returning to the present case, while probation was not appropriate, this was a case in which a rehabilitative approach should not be wholly disregarded. While the appellant had committed the same offence on four distinct occasions, he had not reoffended since the offences were detected. He had no prior convictions apart from traffic-related antecedents. In my view, he is unlikely to re-offend. While general deterrence remained relevant, it could be achieved with a carefully calibrated mix of CBS options. In any case, a short custodial sentence in the form of a SDO would likely be sufficient to keep him away from crime in the future.
43     The appellant’s conduct was clearly anti-social and harmful to the community. It was relevant however to note that the hurt caused in this case, while not 
de minimis
, was transient at best. The appellant is not beyond redemption but appears to be someone who has a good future and who can benefit from a second chance to put his life right. Looking at all these factors in totality, this was a sufficiently compelling case for CBS. A combination of CBSs in the form of an SDO and a CSO was therefore the outcome that would best reflect the interplay of sentencing objectives in this case.
44     An SDO carries a punitive and deterrent element and this would suitably address the issue of his culpability. The authors of 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 observe that through the principle of the ‘clanging of prison doors’, the SDO acts as a warning for the offender of a more severe experience of imprisonment if he were to reoffend (at p 90). I digress briefly to note that the “clang of the prison gates” principle originated prior to the introduction of CBS and in a slightly different context. The usual basis for the application of the “clang of the prison gates” principle is that the shame of going to prison is sufficient punishment for a person of eminence (
Tan Sai Tiang v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 1 SLR(R) 33
 at [39]–[40]). Given the limited scope that has been ascribed to the principle, it is arguable that it is not conceptually correct to apply the principle in the context of SDOs. I would, however, observe 
provisionally
 that the ambit of this principle could potentially be expanded to include SDOs having regard to the wider range of sentencing options currently at the court’s disposal. That said, this issue is best left to be decided on a future occasion since it did not arise in this case and the parties did not address me on it.
45     At the same time, I took the view that the appellant deserved an opportunity for a fresh start after he serves his sentence. Under s 7DA of the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed), his criminal record will be spent on the date he completes the CBSs. I was gratified to note that the prosecution had indicated that they would support such a sentencing approach as well.
46     Having regard to the CSO suitability report, in my view the appropriate sentence was for him to serve a one-week SDO and perform 150 hours of CSO. I had confirmed that the appellant was agreeable to perform community service if the court so ordered. Although the CSO suitability report recommended 240 hours of community service, I was of the view that this duration should be shorter as the appellant would also be ordered to serve a non-nominal SDO.
The AEA offences
Whether the AEA offences required both fines and imprisonment to be imposed
47     It bears recalling that the appellant was sentenced to fines of $8,000 and $4,000 for the Importation Charge and Possession Charge respectively. It was pointed out by Mr Prem Raj that the sentences imposed by the District Judge in respect of the Importation Charge and the Possession Charge were erroneous, as only fines were imposed. He submitted that properly interpreted, the relevant AEA provisions required both fines 
and
 imprisonment to be imposed. This was not disputed by Mr Nathan. For completeness, although the outcome of the appeal did not turn on these issues, I shall briefly state my observations in relation to these submissions.
48     The District Judge in the present case proceeded on the assumption that the starting point for the Importation Charge and the Possession Charge was a fine. This assumption, according to Mr Prem Raj, appears to have been based on the table of three unreported precedents tendered by the prosecution which indicated that:
(a)     Sentences for importation of “arms”, under s 13(2)(
a
) of the AEA, have ranged from a fine of $8,000 to two weeks’ imprisonment; and
(b)     Fines of $5,000 have been imposed for the possession of “arms” under s 13(4) of the AEA.
49     The District Judge’s assumption (in respect of s 13(4) of the AEA) finds support in the decision of 
Public Prosecutor v Zulkifli bin Mohamed
 
[2007] SGDC 139
 (“
Zulkifli bin Mohamed
”). In that case, 75 distress flares were found in the offender’s possession. The court considered s 13(4) of the AEA and held that the word “and” in s 13(4) should be taken to be used disjunctively:
41. I should note that in relation to the charge concerning the flares, my reading of s 13(4) Arms and Explosives Act is that since it provides that an offender ‘ shall be liable … to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years’. While most similar provisions would use the disjunctive ‘or’, rather than ‘and’ which usually means conjunction, I am of the view that here ‘and’ should also be taken to be used disjunctively. This is in particular because the phrase ‘shall be liable’ indicates that the offender is exposed to a potential sentence, rather than mandating that a specific sentence or type of sentence should follow invariably from conviction. This appears to be the approach taken in Hong Kong SAR where this particular phrasing is common: see for example 
Chung Yat and Ors v The Queen
 CACC 160 of 1978; and more recently in 
HKSAR v Cheng Hong Keung
 HCMA 78 of 2004. The cases cited by Counsel, namely 
PP v Lee Soon Lee Vincent
 
[1998] 3 SLR 552
 and 
Abu Seman v PP
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 338
 could also be used to support this interpretation, though neither dealt with the matter directly.
50     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the relevant AEA provisions required both fines and imprisonment to be imposed, and I now set out the reasons for my view. I begin with the relevant punishment provisions which are summarised in the table below:

a
) and 13(4) may be contrasted with six other provisions in the AEA which prescribe that the offender “
shall be liable
 on conviction… to a fine… 
or
 to imprisonment… 
or
 to both” [emphasis added in italics and in bold].
[note: 6]
 Such punishment provisions apply to other offences including those which involve resisting any person in the execution of power vested under the AEA (see s 25 of the AEA) and obstructing inspection of stock-in-trade (see s 26 of the AEA).
52     As a starting point, while I accept that the words “shall be liable” do not have any 
prima facie
 obligation or mandatory connotation (
Public Prosecutor v Lee Soon Lee Vincent
 
[1998] 3 SLR(R) 84
) and have been generally viewed as conferring a discretion (
Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] 4 SLR 892
 at [36]), the interpretive exercise must be guided by the textual and legislative context of the provision in question. I also accept that the word “and” may be used in a disjunctive sense (
Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd v Nam Hong Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd
 
[2015] 2 SLR 616
 at [24]) whereas the application of the word “or” may not always produce a disjunctive result (
Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183
 at [69]).
53     As pointed out by the learned DPP, there are three distinct types of punishment provisions under the AEA: (a) those providing for imprisonment 
and
 fines (“the AND Phrasing”); (b) those providing for imprisonment 
or
 fines 
or
 both (“the OR Phrasing); and (c) those providing for fines only. Given that the OR Phrasing is used elsewhere in the AEA, it is implausible that the legislative intention behind the AND Phrasing was to confer on courts the discretion to impose sentences of fines and imprisonment terms as alternatives. Further, the natural and ordinary meanings of the words “and” and “or” are clear and I see no compelling reason to depart from them. Therefore, it seems to me that the plain meaning of the word “and” as well as the variation in language of the punishment provisions under the AEA are powerful factors that militate against the disjunctive reading of the provisions that was preferred in 
Zulkifli bin Mohamed
.
54     My understanding of the provisions is reinforced by s 13(5) which makes it clear that imprisonment is mandatory under s 13(4). Section 13(5) provides:
(5) Upon the conviction of any person of an offence under subsection (4), if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court before which the conviction is had that the offender had possession or control of the arms, explosives, poisonous or noxious gas or noxious substance for the purpose of committing an offence punishable under the Penal Code (Cap. 224), 
the offender shall, in addition to the imprisonment prescribed by that subsection
, be liable to caning.
[emphasis in bold italics]
I agreed with the prosecution that the reference to “in addition to the imprisonment prescribed by [s 13(4)]” provides some support for the view that an imprisonment term is mandatory for an offence under s 13(4).
55     In view of the above, I concluded that the word “and” in both ss 13(2)(
a
) and s 13(4) should be read conjunctively, and this mandates the imposition of 
both
 fines and imprisonment terms on offenders convicted of offences under those provisions as well as other provisions under the AEA that adopt the AND Phrasing. I also note that the defence concurred with the prosecution’s submissions in this regard. Having said that, I agreed with the parties that the doctrine of prospective overruling should apply such that the conjunctive reading of the word “and” in ss 13(2)(
a
) and 13(4) should not apply in the instant case, and therefore had no bearing on the outcome of the appeal.
Whether the doctrine of prospective overruling applied 
56     The doctrine of prospective overruling was discussed extensively in 
Public Prosecutor v Hue An Li
 
[2014] 4 SLR 661
 (“
Hue An Li
”). There, a 3-Judge panel of the High Court held that judicial pronouncements are, by default, fully retroactive in nature save in cases where the appellate court exercises its discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to restrict the retroactive effect of its pronouncements. The exercise of this discretion is guided by factors such as the extent to which the law or legal principle concerned is entrenched, the extent of the change to the law, the extent to which the change is foreseeable and the extent of reliance on the law or legal principle concerned (at [124]). The court also stressed that in applying the framework, no one factor is preponderant over any other, and no one factor is necessary before prospective overruling can be adopted.
57     I was persuaded by the learned DPP’s submission that this was an appropriate case in which the court should exercise its discretion to limit the application of its pronouncement to future cases since the conjunctive interpretation is a significant and unforeseeable change in the law. Hitherto, a fine and imprisonment have never been imposed together for offences that are punishable under s 13(2)(
a
), and the sentencing structure under s 13(2)(
a
) has not been the subject of judicial attention. In respect of the s 13(4) offence, the only case that has dealt with the sentencing structure under this provision had held that the sentences of a fine and imprisonment were alternatives. In these circumstances, it was only fair to limit the application of the present decision to future cases. To borrow the words of the court in 
Hue An Li
, “it would have been grossly unfair if the rug had been pulled from under [the appellant’s] feet, especially as this concerned [the appellant’s] physical liberty” (at [125]).
Conclusion
58     For the above reasons, the appeal was allowed in the terms that follow. First, the appellant stood convicted for DAC 910467/2015 on the reduced charge under s 337(
a
) of the Penal Code. Second, in lieu of the imprisonment term of seven weeks originally imposed, he was sentenced to serve an SDO of one week and to perform 150 hours of community service, to be completed within six months. The fines paid in respect of the other two charges and the compensation paid were ordered to stand.

Factors taken into account in assessment
 
The plaintiff is, and was at all material times, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, an office he has held since 1959.
The defendant is, and was at the material time, a businessman and the secretary general of the Singapore United Front (SUF), a registered political party, and at the 1984 general elections was a candidate of his party for the election to Parliament for the constituency of Kampong Chai Chee. Polling day was 22 December 1984.
The plaintiff alleged that on 15 December 1984, at carpark 13, near Apartment Blk 425, Bedok North Road, Singapore, the defendant, while addressing an election rally of the SUF, falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff in the way of his said office and in relation to his conduct therein defamatory words in Fujian. The following is the literal translation of the said words: 
 
Is Phey Yew Kok a talented and qualified person? He had embezzled more than $6,000,000 of the union funds but the newspapers reported that he embezzled only over $100,000. He is now a rich man doing business in Taiwan. Do you know that nowadays, most of the PAP MPs and ministers are millionaires or at least half-millionaires. To avoid misunderstanding from the public, all the new MPs should declare their wealth for us to know. Let us know how much assets they have before they are elected. Declare it! How much can a MP earn each month? How do they become millionaires in ten years? Impossible! There must be other reasons. There are many opportunities. Just flatter Lee Kuan Yew, you will become wealthy in a short time. So, in this society, the Special Branch, this Corrupt Practice Investigation Bureau is under the Prime Minister`s control. You will not succeed if you want to complain against his MPs and ministers. He would simply brush it aside. Eat the `Angoli`, but catch the ikan bilis outside. To prove that to you: `I will arrest whoever is corrupt. Those committing serious corruption, let them escape.`
 
 
 
The plaintiff`s solicitors wrote to the defendant on 19 December 1984, asking the defendant whether he was prepared to publish, at his expense, an apology in the terms of the draft enclosed. The terms of the plaintiff were: 
 
... the apology (i) to be published immediately and with appropriate prominence in national Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil newspapers, and (ii) to be read by you at the next SUF rally following delivery of this letter. Mr Lee further requires you to give us your assurance and undertaking in writing that you will not repeat the same or similar statements concerning him.
 
 
 
We require to know if you are prepared to indemnify our client in respect of the costs to which he has been put in the matter, which we now estimate at $500.
Finally, we are further instructed to inform you that our client claims damages. If you proceed in accordance with the preceding two paragraphs, our client will accept nominal damages of $1,000.
In the meantime, it must be clearly understood that our client reserves all his rights in the matter.
The letter was delivered to the defendant on the same day.
The plaintiff issued a writ against the defendant on 21 December 1984, claiming damages for slander, an injunction to restrain the defendant, his agents or servants, from further speaking or publishing the said or any similar words defamatory of the plaintiff and interest pursuant to s 9 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) and costs.
The plaintiff pleaded that the words spoken by the defendant at the election rally, in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was guilty of corrupt and/or criminal and/or dishonourable conduct in the discharge of his office and that he contrived in that office the unlawful enrichment of sycophants and that the said words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his said office.
In his defence, filed on 11 April 1985, the defendant admitted that his statements made on 15 December 1984, were defamatory of the plaintiff. He pleaded that he accepted on 21 December 1984, the plaintiff`s terms as set out in the plaintiffs solicitors` letter of 19 December 1984 and that he proceeded with reasonable diligence to comply with those terms. However, before he could fully comply with all the terms of the plaintiff, the plaintiff on 28 December 1984, refused to accept the defendant`s further compliance. The defendant was still willing to comply with the remaining terms. The defendant pleaded that his acceptance of the plaintiff`s offer to compromise his cause of action and the defendant`s compliance of the terms of the plaintiff, operated as an accord and satisfaction and thereby the plaintiff`s cause of action had been discharged. The defendant denied that the plaintiff had suffered any damage or that he was entitled to any of the reliefs claimed.
The action came up for hearing on 16 May 1988. Counsel for the defendant at the beginning of the trial applied to amend the defence and the defendant withdrew the defence of accord and satisfaction. Counsel for the defendant then tendered a statement signed by the defendant (exh D1) and said that he was instructed to read it out to the court which he did. The statement read: 
 
The defendant admits making the allegations against the plaintiff as stated in the statement of claim. The defendant says that there is no foundation for any of these disgraceful allegations and apologises to the plaintiff for having made them and unreservedly withdraws all imputations upon him and thus upon the office the plaintiff holds.
 
 
 
The defendant is prepared to publish this statement of apology and withdrawal in all the major newspapers of this country as further proof of his repentance for making the allegations and hopes that the plaintiff will accept his apology and unconditional withdrawal of his allegations.
Liability was admitted. The only issue which was left to the court to try was the quantum of damages. The plaintiff claimed aggravated damages. The defendant submitted that only nominal damages be awarded.
The general rule is that damages are to be assessed on a compensatory basis. What may be included in compensatory damages is compendiously stated in para 1451 of 
 Gatley on Libel & Slander 
 (8th Ed) thus: 
 
In an action on libel `the assessment of damages does not depend on any legal rule`. The amount of damages is `peculiarly the province of the jury`, who in assessing them will naturally be governed by all the circumstances of the particular case. They are entitled to take into their consideration the conduct of the plaintiff, his position and standing, the nature of the libel, the mode and extent of publication, the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology, and `the whole conduct of the defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the very moment of their verdict. They may take into consideration the conduct of the defendant before action, after action, and in court at the trial of the action`, and also, it is submitted, the conduct of his counsel, who cannot shelter his client by taking responsibility for the conduct of the case. They should allow `for the sad truth that no apology, retraction or withdrawal can ever be guaranteed completely to undo the harm it has done or the hurt it has caused`. They should also take into account the evidence led in aggravation or mitigation of the damages. They should not take into account in assessing damages any part of the words complained of in respect of which the defendant has made out a defence, or any damage done to the plaintiffs reputation or feelings by any defamatory matter or other wrong for which the defendant is not responsible. They should not speculate on whether the defendant will be indemnified.
 
 
 
 
 
 Gatley on Libel & Slander 
 
 has this to say as regards aggravated damages. 
 
 
1452 
 Aggravated damages 
. The conduct of the defendant, his conduct of the case, and his state of mind are thus all matters which the plaintiff may rely on as aggravating the damages. `Moreover, it is very well established that in cases where the damages are at large the jury (or the judge if the award is left to him) can take into account the motives and conduct of the defendant where they aggravate the injury done to the plaintiff. There may be malevolence or spite or the manner of committing the wrong may be such as to injure the plaintiffs proper feelings of dignity and pride. These are matters which the jury can take into account in assessing the appropriate compensation.` `In awarding ""aggravated damages"" the natural indignation of the court at the injury inflicted on the plaintiff is a perfectly legitimate motive in making a generous, rather than a more moderate award to provide an adequate solatium ... that is because the injury to the plaintiff is actually greater, and, as the result of the conduct exciting the indignation, demands a more generous solatium.`
  
 
 
Let us examine the conduct of the defendant when he was asked to retract and apologize in December 1984. This can be gathered from the agreed statement of facts exh C. The defendant did not read out the apology at the next SUF rally held on 20 December 1984, although it was after the plaintiffs solicitors` letter was delivered to his residence on 19 December 1984. The plaintiff then issued the writ on 21 December 1984. The defendant`s counsel said that the letter was delivered to the defendant`s house on the evening of 19 December, but the defendant only knew of it on 21 December as the letter was misplaced by his son. When he became aware of the letter, that same evening at his party`s rally he read out the letter and apologized. But what did the defendant do at the rally? The defendant read the whole of the plaintiff`s solicitors` letter thereby repeating the slanderous statement of which it complained. Only having repeated the slanders did the defendant read out the apology so as to appear to comply with the plaintiff`s solicitors` demands.
After reading the apology in English, the defendant qualified it by stating: 
 
But at any time I might utter any error or mistake in my course of speech at the mass rally on 15 and 16 December, I would like to extend my apology to the Prime Minister of Singapore and his ministers, if I have uttered wrongly.
 
 
 
The defendant then proceeded to speak in Mandarin. After paraphrasing the apology, he stated: 
 
I think in an election, Singapore must practise democracy, allowing us to speak our mind. So I do not wish to suffer immediate loss. You can go back and think about it. There is still a lot to be done for Kampong Chai Chee, better not to waste time on fighting a court case. So I apologize to Prime Minister Lee and others.
 
 
 
The defendant agreed that by his statement he meant and was understood to mean that: 
 
 
(i) the statements of which the plaintiff complained were not defamatory, but were a legitimate expression of his opinion of the plaintiff`s conduct in office; 
 
(ii) by demanding an apology and retraction and threatening an action for defamation in default, the plaintiff was misusing the legal process to gag the opposition at election time; and 
 
(iii) the defendant had read the apology, not because it was properly due, but in order `not to waste time on fighting a court case`.
  
 
 
That same night, 21 December 1984, SBC telecast the defendant reading the whole of the plaintiff`s solicitors` letter including the slanderous statements and the defendant`s remarks quoted above at prime viewing time.
 The Straits Times 
 of 25 December 1984 carried a report under the caption: `No more polls for me, says Seow.` It dealt with remarks made by the defendant the previous day. The defendant, inter alia, criticized the plaintiff: 
 
 
(i) for having threatened the defendant with legal action during the election; and 
 
(ii) for not allowing `room to the opposition to criticize`. The defendant agreed that these remarks again imply that the statements, which are the subject of this action, were by way of legitimate criticism and not slanders.
  
 
 
It was implicit in the plaintiff`s solicitors` letter that the plaintiff would refrain from instituting proceedings against the defendant if, inter alia, the defendant was prepared to make a sincere and unreserved apology immediately, at the defendant`s next rally. This the defendant did not do.
When the defendant apologized at a subsequent rally, it is apparent that the defendant`s apology was neither unreserved nor sincere. They indicated an indifference to the plaintiff`s feelings. The same was true of the apologies that the defendant caused to be published in the press subsequently.
In addition to the above aggravating factors, these proceedings have been conducted, on the defendant`s instructions, in a vexatious manner: 
 
 
(i) the defendant entered a conditional appearance, and sought to set aside the writ and service thereof on the wholly unmeritorious ground that a note had been mistakenly included on the writ when it was not appropriate to the form used, and that this invalidated the proceedings; 
 
(ii) when this clerical error was amended by the plaintiff`s solicitors, as they were entitled to do, without leave, the defendant sought by a second application to set aside the amended writ and service of it. The application was dismissed with costs; 
 
(iii) the defendant questioned the plaintiff`s solicitors` authority to act for the plaintiff, and demanded the production of a formal warrant to act; 
 
(iv) the defendant then attempted to defeat the plaintiffs claim on yet another wholly unmeritorious ground by alleging accord and satisfaction. The defendant`s application to stay or dismiss the plaintiff`s claim on that frivolous ground was dismissed with costs by the registrar on 8 April 1985; 
 
(v) the defendant appealed against that decision. The appeal was dismissed with costs by the Chief Justice on 10 May 1985; 
 
(vi) the defendant appealed against the Chief Justice`s decision. The appeal was dismissed with costs by the Court of Appeal on 20 March 1986; 
 
(vii) in spite of the application and appeals failing, the defendant persisted in the frivolous defence of accord and satisfaction until by letter dated 3 May 1988, the defendant`s solicitors informed the plaintiffs solicitors that they were withdrawing this defence. The raising of this defence and the defendant`s persistence in it even after the dismissal of his appeal to the Court of Appeal on 20 March 1986, has denied the plaintiff an opportunity of obtaining a public vindication of his reputation for almost three and a half years, thereby substantially aggravating the injury to the plaintiffs reputation and feelings caused by the defendant in slandering the plaintiff.
  
 
 
The plaintiff did not do anything to provoke the defendant. This was a totally unprovoked and vicious attack on the plaintiff who has placed great importance on integrity in the government. In spite of the unprovoked and vicious attack, the plaintiff was content not to sue if the defendant published suitable apologies before polling day, paid the plaintiff`s costs and paid nominal damages. The plaintiff wanted the sting of the defendant`s slanders to be removed, as far as this was ever possible, by the publication of an apology while the election campaign was still in progress. In that way, the plaintiff felt that the damage done by the defendant might be mitigated somewhat.
The defendant`s slanders were of a particularly vicious nature. In their literal meaning the words spoken by the defendant meant that the plaintiff, as Prime Minister of Singapore and the person in control of the Corrupt Practice Investigation Bureau, had deliberately allowed Phey Yew Kok to escape from Singapore to Taiwan after embezzling more than $6m, had assisted or connived at or condoned PAP members of Parliament and ministers corruptly enriching themselves and would reject any attempt by members of the public to have the conduct of members of Parliament or ministers investigated. In their inferential meaning the words also meant that the plaintiff was guilty of corrupt and/or criminal and/or dishonourable conduct in the discharge of his office and that he had contrived in that office the unlawful enrichment of sycophants and, by implication, that the plaintiff is wanting in honesty and integrity and is unfit to hold the high office of Prime Minister as that office demands standards of the highest scrupulousness. Then allegations are totally baseless, and were directed at disparaging the plaintiff in his office as Prime Minister of Singapore.
The plaintiff has been injured in his credit and reputation as Prime Minister of Singapore and has been brought into public scandal, hatred and contempt. When the plaintiff came to learn of what the defendant said he was worried and outraged.
Allegations of corrupt and criminal conduct are very grave charges, especially if they are made against the Prime Minister of a country. Such charges unless challenged head on would destroy the plaintiff, as moral authority is the cornerstone of effective government. If this moral authority is eroded, the government cannot function.
The defendant knew that the slanders were insidious and would spread very quickly in an urban community like Singapore. It is impossible to prevent those who heard the speech from repeating it to their relatives, friends and acquaintances. People will think that as the defendant is the secretary general of SUF he would not say it unless it was true.
In May 1959, the PAP won a majority of seats in Parliament and the plaintiff formed a government and became the Prime Minister of Singapore. Since then the PAP has been successfully re-elected at each general election. The slanders were gross imputations upon a man who had held the highest political office since 1959 and whose integrity was unquestionable and whose character was unassailed.
The slanders were vicious and malicious charges of corruption and criminal acts. The defendant had no belief in the truth of his slanders when he published them on 15 December 1984. That he was actuated by malice is evidenced by the fact that the very next day, on 16 December 1984, he repeated the slanders at another rally. (This is the subject matter of Suit No 9331 of 1984 in which the Prime Minister and 14 Cabinet Ministers are the plaintiffs and the defendant, the defendant.) The whole conduct of the defendant, from the time when the slanders were published down to the judgment, shows malice.
Counsel for the defendant submitted that the statement of the defendant exh D1, which was read out, clearly put the position of the defendant today: he apologized and maintained there was no foundation of the allegations and he withdrew unconditionally all allegations against the plaintiff; it was a sincere statement, it was made because the defendant believed unconditionally the contents of the statement.
As regards the report by the 
 Straits Times 
 of 22 December 1984, counsel for the defendant said that it should be noted that it appeared on polling day and it headed `SUF chief issues public apology`. Such report also appeared in the Chinese and Malay newspapers and was also reported by SBC. Counsel submitted that nowhere in those reports could anybody say that it was an insincere apology; the message was quite clear; there was no basis for the allegations.
Counsel further said that an apology was published in the Straits Times of 28 December and similar apologies were published by the defendant in all the major newspapers on 27 and 28 December including the Tamil paper. Counsel submitted that there was nothing in the apologies which would make an ordinary man think or feel that the apology was an insincere apology.
Counsel urged the court to award nominal damages.
It was only at the commencement of the trial that the defendant by the statement exh D1 unconditionally withdrew the allegations. What had the defendant`s conduct been for the last three and a half years? He had at every turn aggravated damages. He has in the agreed statement of facts admitted that the apologies made at the election rally of 21 December and subsequently published in the press were neither unreserved nor sincere. He has also admitted that he repeated the slanders.
In January 1985 the defendant had refused to admit liability when his solicitors on his instructions tendered the sum of $1,500 being $1,000 damages and $500 costs. The offer was made without prejudice to the defendant`s right to set aside the writ and not to be taken as an admission of liability.
Counsel for the plaintiff cited a number of cases where damages were awarded to the plaintiff for libel and slander. The one that has relevance is 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam JB 
 
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 281
 . The slander there was that the plaintiff procured preferential treatment for his brother and wife to his own and their personal financial advantage and had thereby abused the office of Prime Minister of Singapore. The defendant had also aggravated the damages. Chua J awarded damages in 1979 at $130,000.
Counsel for the defendant, while conceding that the allegation made by the defendant was no less serious, sought to distinguish the 
 Jeyaretnam 
 case 
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 281
  by raising two points: 
 
 
(i) there was no apology in that case; and 
 
(ii) there was a protracted trial.
  
 
 
The slanders in the present case are more serious than that in the 
 Jeyaretnam 
 case 
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 281
 . It literally charged the plaintiff with corrupt and criminal conduct. In the circumstances of this case and on the agreed statement of facts the purported apologies in fact aggravated damages. The defence of accord and satisfaction was persisted in spite of there being no merits until two weeks before the date fixed for trial, with the result that the plaintiff had to wait three and a half years to vindicate his reputation. An apology is made to appease the plaintiffs hurt feelings. Here the plaintiffs hurt feelings have never been appeased because of the insincere apologies made.
Counsel for the defendant said that the defendant was a lesser individual than Jeyaretnam but the defendant had agreed in the agreed statement of facts that `people will think that as the defendant is the secretary general of SUF he would not say it unless it was true`.
The Court of Appeal in 
 Jeyaretnam 
 `s case 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 282
  said at p 285: 
 
In our opinion, for an incumbent Prime Minister of a democratic country who has continuously held office for over a decade to be publicly falsely accused by the leader of an opposition party at the final election rally of that party during a coming general election of corruption and nepotism for personal financial advantage must be the gravest of slanders, must cause the greatest indignation to him, and the gravest harm, if believed, to his political life. The gravity of such a slanderous accusation is enhanced if the standing of the accuser is such that people who hear the accusation are likely to take it seriously and are likely to repeat it to others.
 
 
 
The 
 Jeyaretnam 
 award was made nine years ago. Since then the value of money has diminished.
After taking all the relevant factors into account when assessing the award of damages, I was of the view that an award of $250,000 would be a fair and just compensation for this very serious slander.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 24 September 1990 the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of rape under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). At the time of the offence the appellant was 32 years old and had been employed as a technician by the same company for more than ten years. The victim was a 16-year-old secondary school student. They had been acquainted with each other because the appellant then had a girlfriend whose nephew was the victim`s boyfriend. They were on friendly terms.
On the evening of 31 December 1986 the appellant drove his girlfriend and the victim from his girlfriend`s house to a party at Changi Sailing Club. There he consumed at least five glasses of beer and a misunderstanding began between him and his girlfriend, which was to last through the night. On this occasion the victim was dressed in pantaloons and a gartered blouse with a bare midriff and to the appellant was looking provocative; further she conducted herself in a very adult manner and had been innocently physical with the appellant in the course of the evening`s hilarity. Thus the appellant saw her not as a girl but as an attractive and desirable woman whom he might succeed in persuading into intimacy with him.
At about 1am the victim left the club with the appellant and his girlfriend because the appellant was to drive them home in his car. The appellant`s girlfriend took the front passenger seat in the car and the victim the rear seat. The appellant first took his girlfriend home to Kallang Bahru. Thereafter the victim continued to occupy the rear seat of the car. Instead of driving her home the appellant drove to Surin Avenue where he parked at about 2am. He entered the rear passenger compartment of the car, locked all the doors and began to embrace and kiss the victim, who struggled and screamed for help, to no avail. When she tried to unlock a car door to escape the appellant stopped her and became ill-tempered. He completely undressed the victim forcibly, and then himself.
Thereafter, by threatening her with the loss of her virginity, he succeeded in making her masturbate him and then fellate him. When he subsequently began to perform cunnilingus on her, the victim again tried unsuccessfully to escape. Provoked by this attempt, the appellant began actual intercourse with her and, overcoming her struggles, eventually achieved complete penetration and ejaculation, after which he withdrew himself from her. When they had both put on their clothes, the appellant drove to a 7-Eleven store where he bought the victim a drink and afterwards drove her home. During this journey he apologized to the victim for what he had done and said he was `a bit mad` at times. The victim reached home at about 3.30am. Medical examination showed fresh hymenal tears at 4 o`clock and 7 o`clock positions. The next day she told her best friends and her boyfriend about the incident. When confronted the following day by his girlfriend and her brothers, the appellant immediately admitted what he had done. The victim reported the matter to the police on 3 January 1987 and the appellant was arrested the day after. He co-operated with the police and made a voluntary statement which he never thereafter sought to deny.
In mitigation the court was additionally told that the appellant had decided to plead guilty to spare the complainant the trauma of a trial and he was most remorseful. There was no pre-meditation, no violent assault, no weapon, and, it was contended, no real threat of hurt or death. The alcohol he had consumed, though not sufficient to make him lose control of himself, was enough to make him less inhibited and more licentious than normal. He had believed the victim`s conduct to be the demure behaviour or play-acting of a willing and consenting person. Despite this incident, his girlfriend married him in May 1987 when he was on bail pending trial and they now have an infant daughter. He was a first time offender and, though he lost his original steady job when in remand, he found other gainful employment when he was out on bail. He is the sole breadwinner of the family and, until his mother died recently, supported both his aged parents. His father is terminally ill with cancer. The victim has since found gainful employment and, it seems, has suffered no long-term ill effects from the incident.
The appellant was sentenced to eight years` imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane and appeals against this sentence.
The appellant was convicted under s 376(1) of the Code which reads as follows: 
 
Subject to subsection (2), whoever commits rape shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.
 
 
 
Subsection (2), which is not applicable to the present case, deals with the more serious rape offences and provides as follows: 
 
Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence of rape against any woman - 
(a) voluntarily causes hurt to her or to any other person; or 
(b) puts her in fear of death or hurt to herself or any other person,
 
 
 
and whoever commits rape by having sexual intercourse with a woman under 14 years of age without her consent, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 8 years and not more than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.
 
 
 
It can be seen from the above that rape is a serious offence for which a severe punishment is prescribed by law. In this connection it would not be out of place for us to follow the example of Lord Lane CJ in 
R v Billam
 
[1986] 1 All ER 985
[1986] 1 WLR 349
[1986] 8 Cr App R (S) 48
 in citing a passage from the Criminal Law Revision Committee`s 15th report on sexual offences in 1984 which he said reflected accurately the views of the English Court of Appeal, and which also accurately reflect the views of the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal. The passage was as follows: 
 
Rape is generally regarded as the most grave of all the sexual offences. In a paper put before us for our consideration by the Policy and Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences the reasons for this are set out as follows -
 
 
 
`Rape involves a severe degree of emotional and psychological trauma. It may be described as a violation which in effect obliterated the personality of the victim. Its physical consequences equally are severe: the actual physical harm occasioned by the act of intercourse; associated violence or force and in some cases degradation; after the event, quite apart from the woman`s continuing insecurity, the fear of venereal disease or pregnancy. We do not believe this latter fear should be under-estimated, because abortion would usually be available. This is not a choice open to all women and it is not a welcome consequence for any. Rape is also particularly unpleasant because it involves such intimate proximity between the offender and victim. We also attach importance to the point that the crime of rape involves abuse of an act which can be a fundamental means of expressing love for another, and to which as a society we attach considerable value. ...`
 
 
 
Although convictions for rape are by no means rare occurrences, there appears to have been no attempt in Singapore so far to lay down guidelines as to the sentences to impose. In rape cases, counsel often cite, as was done in the present case, unreported cases which offer little help as precedents because only the briefest of fact summaries are given to the court, and the judges` reasoning on sentence is not available. While the length and severity of sentence must be in the discretion of the judge in each case and depend on the individual facts of the case, it would be useful for this court to review the practice in sentencing in our courts and to state its views on this difficult area of the criminal law.
As in other areas of the law in which English authorities are often cited in our courts, reference has also been made frequently to the sentencing practice in England, although there are significant differences in the law. Thus, English courts have a power under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 to pass a sentence of imprisonment for life for rape or attempted rape in appropriate cases, while our courts may impose additional orders for fine and for caning; similarly, the offence of burglary in England includes the illegal entry to commit rape while the offences of theft in buildings, trespass and house-breaking, are strictly offences against property under our Penal Code. The strong presumption in the United Kingdom is that a conviction for rape merits a custodial sentence and that of some length, because of the inherent gravity of such an offence. Thus, in 
R v Roberts & Roberts
 
[1982] 1 All ER 609
[1982] 1 WLR 133
[1982] 4 Cr App R (S) 8
 the Court of Appeal emphasized that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, an immediate custodial sentence should be imposed following a conviction for rape, in order to mark the gravity of the offence, to emphasize public disapproval, to serve as a warning to others, to punish the offender and to protect women. An illustration of circumstances which might be considered to be most exceptional was provided by 
R v Taylor
 
[1983] 5 Cr App R (S) 241
 In 
R v Billam
 
[1986] 1 All ER 985
[1986] 1 WLR 349
[1986] 8 Cr App R (S) 48
 which is the present authority relied on in the United Kingdom for sentencing guidelines in cases of rape or attempted rape by adult offenders, Lord Lane CJ, while noting that the variable factors in cases of rape are so numerous that it is difficult to lay down guidelines as to the proper length of sentence in terms of years, said at p 987: 
 
For rape committed by an adult without any aggravating or mitigating features, a figure of five years should be taken as a starting point in a contested case. Where a rape is committed by two or more men acting together, or by a man who has broken into or otherwise gained access to a place where the victim is living, or by a person who is in a position of responsibility towards the victim, or by a person who abducts the victim and holds her captive, the starting point should be eight years.
 
 
 
At the top of the scale comes the defendant who has carried out what might be described as a campaign of rape, committing the crime on a number of different women or girls. He represents a more than ordinary danger and a sentence of 15 years or more may be appropriate.
Where the defendant`s behaviour has manifested perverted or psychopathic tendencies or gross personality disorder, and where he is likely, if at large, to remain a danger to women for an indefinite time, a life sentence will not be inappropriate.
Because the approach towards sentencing is governed by the objective in inflicting punishment, which in turn reflects the social environment in a country, it would not be appropriate for a court in Singapore to follow completely the approach and practice followed by English courts in sentences of imprisonment for rape.
In the present appeal, two decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Malaysia and Singapore were cited to us. In 
Mohamed Kunju v PP
 
 
[1966] 1 MLJ 271
  a Malaysian case, the appellant raped an 11-year-old girl and infected her with gonorrhoea and was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment. In sentencing him in the High Court, Raja Azlan Shah J said at p 274: 
 
The offence of rape is a serious one and the degree of seriousness of the offence must be reflected in the sentence. The present case is singularly peculiar in that the accused, knowing that he was infected with a notorious disease, passed it on to a girl of tender years thus ruining her name and health at an early age.
 
 
 
The Federal Court of Malaysia allowed his appeal against sentence and substituted a sentence of seven years` imprisonment. Thomson LP delivering oral judgment said at p 275: 
 
As regards the sentence of ten years` imprisonment, we do not wish to suggest that in our view there was any reason for leniency whatsoever. It was a very serious case and it had to be treated seriously. Nevertheless, we cannot overlook the fact that there was no violence used and the girl has not suffered physical damage that will impair her future chances of marriage. In the circumstances we feel justified in reducing to one of seven years` imprisonment.
 
 
 
In our view, whatever might have been the position in the 1960s, it would not be possible for a Singapore court on parallel facts today to follow this line of reasoning if an 11-year-old girl should lose her virginity and contract gonorrhoea on being raped. Even if her chances of marriage were not affected, that would not be a mitigating factor; if the rape did affect her chances of marriage, that would be an aggravating factor.
In 
Liew Kim Yong v PP
 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 323
  a Singapore case, the appellant was convicted of raping the complainant and abetting the rape of the complainant by another man and was sentenced to seven years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on the charge of rape, and another seven years` imprisonment on the charge of abetment, both sentences to run concurrently. In dismissing his appeal against sentence, Grimberg JC delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal said at p 328: 
 
We gave anxious consideration to what was said on the appellant`s behalf in the appeal against sentence. There had been no violent assault, no weapon, no threats; the complainant was a worldly young woman, the relationship between her and the appellant prior to the offence had been pleasant and easy-going; they had been drinking; and the appellant had driven her home after the offence and telephoned her the next day. Thus it is true to say that many of the aggravating features of a rape were absent. It was also urged upon us that the appellant is allergic to pain-killing drugs, and that the sentence of caning ought to be set aside on this ground as well, since the consequences would be very painful if that part of the sentence were carried out. In the event, we dismissed the appeal against sentence as well.
 
 
 
Consideration of the guidelines to be followed in sentences for rape in Singapore must take into account the fact that in addition to imprisonment a convicted person may be liable to caning under s 376(1) and must suffer a mandatory sentence of caning under s 376(2). The general impression is that caning is regarded by judges and by accused persons as a form of punishment that is more serious and more to be feared than imprisonment. It is seen as an individual deterrent and as a deterrent to everyone else in general. Even today there is a general belief that offenders with long records of non-violent crime still tell police officers that they are willing to have a longer prison sentence rather than be caned. There has been little written, however, on sentencing policy as it pertains to caning. One reason for this is that when an offender is charged and convicted for an offence for which there is a mandatory minimum of strokes, the question of whether to impose caning and how much to impose does not arise. The result is that in the other cases where caning is optional, subject to a maximum number of strokes, the sentences passed appear to have been at the court`s untrammelled discretion.
The general policy, where caning has been available as an optional order, has been that it would not be imposed unless the offence had been committed with substantial violence see Buhagiar J in the Malaysian case of 
Mohamed Ali v PP
 
 
[1956] MLJ 84
  This policy was also followed in Singapore in 
 Anwar v P 
 
P
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 63 
 in which Wee Chong Jin CJ accepted that `the court will normally not impose a sentence of caning unless violence has been used`, although 
 Mohamed Ali 
`s case6 was not cited and in the case itself the general policy was departed from, and a sentence of caning was confirmed. In that case, the accused had been arrested when a curfew was on during civil disturbances in Singapore and a knuckleduster was found in his possession. In 
Sia Ah Kew & Ors v PP
 
 
[1974] 1 MLJ 125
  the Court of Criminal Appeal also considered that a sentence of caning was appropriate even though no violence had been used, because the appellants, who were convicted of kidnapping, had been armed with pistols and a dagger and had apparently conducted a quasi-commando raid on the victim`s house, threatened the victim`s family and tied up his son in the course of the kidnapping.
In our opinion, even the offence of rape under s 376(1), without any aggravating or mitigating factors, in which sexual intercourse with a woman is constituted by penetration against her will, must by its very act contain an element of violence and a sentence of caning of not less than six strokes should normally be imposed in addition to a term of imprisonment. Any degree of violence amounting to hurt used in the commission of rape will render the rapist liable to a higher punishment under s 376(2), if he is charged thereunder.
In Singapore, the unreported cases show that for a long time sentencing practice in respect of adult rapists was not uniform, but in more recent years, the tariff has tended to move upwards and to stabilize at a level of nine or ten years. In our opinion, for a rape committed without any aggravating or mitigating factors, a figure of ten years` imprisonment should be taken as the starting point in a contested case, in addition to caning. The court should then consider in turn the mitigating factors which merit a reduction of the sentence, of which a guilty plea which saves the victim from further embarrassment and suffering will be an important consideration and will merit a reduction of one-quarter to one-third of the sentence; and whether there were other factors such as the victim`s youth or the accused person`s position of responsibility and trust towards her, or perversions or gross indignities have been forced on the victim, which justify a longer sentence.
In the present case, counsel for the appellant has contended that the sentence of eight years and eight strokes is manifestly excessive, and in support of this he has contended that there was no pre-meditation, no weapon and no violent assault on the victim; after the incident the appellant realized his folly and apologized to the victim while sending her home, he also thereafter admitted both to his family and to the police what he had done and thereafter pleaded guilty.
The role of the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appellate court when considering an appeal as to the sentence imposed by the trial court has been re-stated recently in 
Tan Koon Swan v PP
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 129
  The court can and will interfere if it is satisfied that (a) the sentencing judge has made a wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence; (b) there has been an error on the part of the trial judge in appreciating the material placed before him; (c) the sentence was wrong in principle; and (d) the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In the present case, it is clear that the trial judge could in no way be faulted in respect of factors (a), (b) and (c) and the only question which remains is whether the sentence which had been imposed was manifestly excessive.
In the present case, with a starting point of ten years and caning of not less than six strokes, and taking into account the mitigating factors, namely, his plea of guilt, his unvarying co-operation with the police, the unlikelihood that the offence would be repeated, the initial figure might have been reduced by three years. On the other hand, the appellant was in something of a responsible position of trust towards the victim, because he was in fact charged with the responsibility of conducting her safely home whereas he took advantage instead of that opportunity to commit the rape. This not only made violence unnecessary but also caused the victim to be less prepared for his advances and further made it more difficult for her to defend herself against him. He twice prevented the victim from escaping from the car before he raped her, and he also forced her to put up with the additional indignity of his masturbation and fellatio. Having taken all these factors into consideration, we are unanimously of the opinion that on the facts of this case the sentence was not manifestly excessive, and the appeal should be dismissed.

This is an originating motion taken out by Lim Cheng Peng, a former advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, under s 99 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161).
Lim Cheng Peng was admitted into the Honourable Society of Gray`s Inn in 1959, and called to the English Bar in 1964. He was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore in 1965 and immediately thereafter began his practice, He was also admitted to the roll of advocates and solicitors in Malaysia in 1966. On 9 April 1984, he was struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors here as he had been convicted, on his plea of guilty, on a charge of criminal breach of trust in respect of a sum of $148,213.27 belonging to his clients.
 Factual background 
In October 1977, Lim Cheng Peng was informed that the Law Society would like to inspect his clients` accounts. He made full and complete restitution of all moneys misappropriated from the clients` accounts to a firm of accountants appointed by the Law Society to investigate and report on the accounts relating to his practice.
On 31 January 1978, Lim Cheng Peng voluntarily ceased his practice as an advocate and solicitor. On 12 October 1979, he was made a bankrupt on the petition of Overseas Union Bank Ltd, which had obtained a judgment for a sum of $8,476.82 and $330.00 costs in the Subordinate Courts against him.
On 20 June 1980, the Secretary of the Law Society lodged a complaint against him with the Commercial Crime Division. In July 1980, upon receipt of a message from the Commercial Crime Division, Lim Cheng Peng surrendered himself and, on his own accord, handed over his passport.
On 28 February 1981, he was charged in the Subordinate Courts with the following: 
 
You, Lim Cheng Peng, m/46 years NRIC No. 2034738-D are charged that you between 7 August 1976 and 30 June 1977 at Ms Cheng Peng & Co, Room 1906 (19th Floor), Robina House, Shenton Way, Singapore, a law firm, being entrusted with dominion over property, to wit, money in the clients` account of Ms Cheng Peng & Co, in your capacity as an attorney, to wit, an advocate and solicitor of the said Ms Cheng Peng & Co, committed criminal breach of trust of $148,213.27 cts in respect of the said property and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103.
 
 
 
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight months` imprisonment.
Following on this conviction, a disciplinary committee was appointed on 7 May 1981. On 5 January 1982, the disciplinary committee made its report. In its report, the disciplinary committee found that Lim Cheng Peng had been convicted of a criminal offence implying a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession and that accordingly, cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed.
It was only on 15 October 1983 that an ex parte originating summons was taken out for Lim Cheng Peng to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. On 24 October 1983, an order was made for him to show cause.
The originating summons finally came before a court of three judges on 9 April 1984, when the court ordered that Lim Cheng Peng be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors.
We should perhaps say something about his employment since his conviction. Between 1 December 1981 and 31 December 1983, Lim, Cheng Peng worked for a company as an in-house legal adviser. Between 1 November 1984 and 31 July 1986, he was employed by another company as an in-house legal adviser and corporate planner.
On 24 April 1987, the receiving and adjudication orders made against Lim Cheng Peng on 12 October 1979 were rescinded and annulled. Proofs of debt had been lodged by 17 creditors for sums amounting to $123,163.65 which had been admitted and paid in full.
On 17 July 1987, Lim Cheng Peng took out this originating motion for an order that his name be restored to the roll of advocates and solicitors.
 The law 
The provision of law that relates to this application is s 99 of the Legal Profession Act, which reads: 
 
(1) The court may, if it thinks fit, at any time order the Registrar to replace on the roll the name of a solicitor whose name has been removed from, or struck off, the roll.
 
 
 
 
(2) Any application that the name of a solicitor be replaced on the roll shall be by originating motion, supported by affidavit, before a court of three judges of whom the Chief Justice shall be one. 
 
(3) Notice of the motion shall be served on the Society which shall appear at the hearing of the motion and shall place before the court a report which shall include copies of the record of any proceedings as the result of which the name of the solicitor was removed from or struck off the roll and a statement of any facts which have occurred since the name of the solicitor was removed from or struck off the roll and which in the opinion of the Council or any member of it are relevant to be considered or to be investigated in connection with the application.
  
 
 
Three points can be noted from this section:
 
 
(1) The court may order restoration `if it thinks fit`. A discretion is conferred by the legislature, which must of course be exercised judicially. 
 
(2) The court may order restoration `at any time`. There is no stipulation as to the period of tune that must elapse between the date of the order striking the solicitor off the roll and the date of his application for replacement on the roll. This should be contrasted with ss 46(4) and (5) of the Legal Profession Act, which are as follows:
  
 
 
(4) A practitioner member may, after a period of five years following the date of his conviction or the date he was reinstated to the roll or the date of the expiry of his suspension, whichever is the later, with the leave of a court of three judges one of whom shall be the Chief Justice, be eligible for election or appointment as a member of the Council.
(5) Where an application for leave under sub-s (4) has been refused, the applicant shall not be entitled to make another application under that subsection within a period of five years from the date the first-mentioned application was dismissed. 
(3) The court must consider the views of the Council of the Law Society of Singapore contained in its report placed before the court under s 99(3).
 
 
 
The court of three judges in Originating Motion 26 of 1982, entitled 
 Re 
 
 Chan Chow Wang 
 
 
 [1982-1983] SLR 413 
 said: 
 
In principle sentences of exclusion from the legal profession need not be exclusive for ever. On the other hand the court has a duty to perform to the suitors of the court and to the profession of the law to take care that those who are re-admitted to it are persons on whose integrity and honour reliance may be placed. The court should also, in the public interest, on all the material before it be satisfied that the applicant is not likely to repeat the same offence or any other offence of a similar nature in the discharge of his professional duties before restoring him to the roll.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Exercise of the court`s discretion 
 
 
  
 
 
In support of his application, Lim Cheng Peng filed in this originating motion eight affidavits by practising advocates and solicitors and three affidavits by company directors testifying to his good conduct and character both before and after the order striking him off the roll. We accepted these character references as they were not controverted.
In para 7 of its report, the Law Society set out its view thus: 
 
The Council of the Law Society of Singapore has considered the fact that the applicant has made full restitution and has on his own accord ceased practice since 31 January 1978 and considering other relevant circumstances will not oppose the present application.
 
 
 
Mr Fong Kwok Jen, who appeared for the Attorney-General, on whom the application was also served, indicated to the court that the Attorney-General had no objections to Lim Cheng Peng`s application.
We felt a measure of concern over one matter. Lim Cheng Peng was struck off the roll on 9 April 1984. This application was taken out on 17 July 1987. The intervening period between these two dates was therefore approximately three years three months only.
In 
 Chan Chow Wang 
 `s case, the court refused his application because it was premature. The court there said: 
 
After he was struck off the roll here in November 1974 he continued to practise in Malaysia until November 1979 having been permitted to practise there even though the Bar Council of Malaysia were aware that he had been disbarred here. In those five practising years in Malaysia there has been no complaint which would warrant disciplinary proceedings against him and from the affidavits of practising advocates and solicitors in Malaysia he had conducted himself honourably. Although it is now nearly nine years since his name has been struck off the roll, he has been effectively unable to practise his profession for only three and a half years.
 
 
 
In our opinion, having regard to all the material now before us, the application is premature and should not be allowed and accordingly it is dismissed. We make no order as to costs.
Subsequently, Chan Chow Wang took out another application (Originating Motion 87 of 1984) on 8 December 1984. That was heard on 11 February 1985 when the court ordered that he be restored to the roll.
In two other cases where the court ordered restoration to the roll, the intervening period in each case was at least five years. In 
 VKS Narayanan 
 `s case (OM 40/80) (unreported) the solicitor was struck off the roll on 4 July 1974. The application to restore him to the roll (originating motion 40 of 1980) was taken out on 23 June 1980. The order of restoration was made on 8 September 1980. In 
 S Santhiran 
 `s case (OM 67/84) (unreported), the solicitor was struck off the roll on 23 April 1979. The application to restore him to the roll was taken out on 15 October 1984. That was heard on 11 March 1985 when an order of restoration was made by the court.
We are of the view that unless there are exceptional circumstances, we would say that, as a general rule, no solicitor who has been struck off the roll ought to contemplate taking out an application under s 99 of the Legal Profession Act before the expiration of five years from the date of the order of striking off.
In the present case, however, we could not ignore the fact that Lim Cheng Peng had ceased practice since 31 January 1978 on his own volition. Moreover, some delay had been occasioned in the disciplinary proceedings. In the light of all the circumstances that prevailed in this case, we thought it fit, although not without some hesitation, that his name should be replaced on the roll. We would emphasize that this case turned entirely on its own special factual situation and should not be regarded as a precedent by those who might be minded to make such an application before the expiration of five years from the date of the order of striking off.
As counsel for the Law Society and the Attorney-General did not wish to have their costs of these proceedings, we made no order as to costs.

This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the sentences imposed by a district judge on the respondent who was convicted of administering a stupefying drug to facilitate the commission of an offence under s 328 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), and of an offence of theft of $460 under s 379, when the respondent was sentenced to ten months` imprisonment and three months` imprisonment respectively, the sentences to run concurrently.
Both in the district court and in this court the respondent appeared in person. The facts as found by the district judge were these: On 16 October 1991 at about 8.10am, a complainant called the police and informed them that a female Chinese had stolen his money after she had spiked his drink with a drug at a brothel near Lorong 12 Geylang. On the following day, 17 October 1991 at about 10pm, the complainant spotted the respondent at the junction of Lorong 12 Geylang and Guillemard Road. He called the police and the respondent was placed under arrest.
Investigations revealed that on 15 October 1991 at about 8.30pm, the respondent found that she did not have enough money to buy more Upjohn tablets to sustain her drug-taking habit. She decided to steal from anyone whom she could befriend that night. She proceeded to a nearby toilet where she broke some of her remaining Upjohn tablets into powder and kept it in a small plastic bottle. Her intention was to spike the drinks of the person whom she would befriend and thereafter steal whatever valuables that person had.
The same evening, at about 9.10pm, the respondent spotted the complainant walking along Lorong 12 Geylang. She approached him and offered him free sex. The complainant accepted her offer and they walked to a coffee shop nearby where the respondent bought a packet of coffee. Then the respondent led the complainant to a brothel nearby where they checked into a room. There, while the complainant was busy removing his clothes, the respondent poured the powdered Upjohn tablets from the small plastic bottle into the packet of coffee. She offered the coffee, spiked with the powdered Upjohn tablets, to the complainant who drank the coffee and moments later felt dizzy and then fell asleep. When the complainant was fast asleep, the respondent searched through his belongings and took $460 from his wallet. She then left the room.
When arrested, the respondent had finished spending the $460 on more Upjohn tablets and no other personal expenses. No part of the stolen money was recovered.
The respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
 
DAC13966/91: That you on or about 15 October 1991, at about 9.30pm at a brothel near to Lorong 12 Geylang, Singapore did administer stupefying drugs to one Ong Eng Liong, to wit, by putting sleeping pills to wit, Upjohn tablets into a cup of coffee which was consumed by the said Ong Eng Liong, to facilitate the commission of an offence of theft, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 328 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
MAC10815/91: That you on or about 15 October 1991, at about 10.30pm at a brothel near to Lorong 12 Geylang, Singapore did commit theft of cash amounting to $460 in the possession of one Ong Eng Liong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Under s 328 of the Penal Code, a person who is convicted shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to a fine. For the lesser offence of theft under s 379, a person who is convicted shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with a fine, or with both.
Before passing sentence, the learned district judge considered the plea of mitigation put up by the respondent. She said that she had three young children and was supporting her family because her husband had left her. The learned district judge noted, however, that the offence under s 328 was of a very serious nature which called for imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years. He found that the respondent had committed the offence because she needed money to buy more Upjohn tablets, and not because she needed the money for the support of her family. Further, he noted that the respondent had a string of similar previous convictions. Stating in his grounds of decision that it was for these above reasons, he passed sentences of ten months` imprisonment under s 328 and three months` imprisonment under s 379, and he ordered the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently.
Miss Jennifer Marie for the public prosecutor submitted that the sentence imposed by the learned district judge under s 328 was manifestly inadequate. The respondent was not a first offender who might profit by being given a second chance, but was in fact an unrepentant and undeterred repeat offender. She already had several previous convictions in her record: two convictions under s 328 in March 1989 and March 1990, for which she was sentenced to eight months` and nine months` imprisonment respectively; five convictions for theft under s 380 between August 1985 and December 1990, for which she received sentences ranging from one day`s imprisonment plus a $400 fine to 12 months` imprisonment; a conviction for unlawfully possessing an offensive weapon under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65) for which she was sentenced in March 1989 to three months` imprisonment; and a conviction for committing an affray under s 160 of the Penal Code for which she was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment in March 1989.
The question of whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate may be considered in relation to the classical principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation, as enumerated by Lawton LJ in 
R v Sargeant
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 74
Of these, rehabilitation is unlikely to feature as a reason for enhancing a sentence. As for the other three principles, it is stated in 11(2) H 
 alsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1188 that: 
 
The retributive element is intended to show public revulsion from the offence and to punish the offender for his wrong conduct. Deterrent sentences are aimed at deterring not only the actual offender from further offences but also potential offenders from breaking the law. ... However, the protection of society is often the overriding consideration.
 
 
 
In 
PP v Gursevar Singh
 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 16
  FA Chua J enhanced manifestly inadequate fines for three offences of theft of roadside plants because the magistrate in deciding to be lenient had failed to consider the public interest - the `first and foremost consideration` guiding a court in the imposition of sentences. In the circumstances of that case, FA Chua J concluded at p 17: `The fine is so low that the respondents would not feel the punishment and it would not serve as a salutary lesson to them and would not deter others from committing a similar offence.`
In the present case, the various sentences imposed on the respondent in relation to her previous convictions, including a term of imprisonment of 12 months, had failed to deter her from a life of crime. Indeed, her present offences were committed on 15 October 1991, less than two months after her discharge from prison on 4 September 1991. They were carried out systematically and with a considerable degree of deliberation. A deterrent sentence was called for. As Lawton LJ observed in 
R v Sargeant
 
[1974] 60 Cr App R 74
 at p 77, `[d]eterrent sentences may very well be of considerable value where crime is premeditated`. In the present case, the respon`s criminal record would justify a longer term of imprisonment than the ten months originally imposed by the trial judge, as it was unlikely that she would be deterred by such a short sentence.
It should also be borne in mind that in addition to deterring the respondent and other similarly-minded to commit such offences, a longer term of imprisonment would represent a longer period of protection for society from the depredations of the respondent.
From the retributive point of view, a sentence of only ten months` imprisonment was insufficient punishment for a third offence under s 328, nor would it adequately show society`s abhorrence of such crimes. It should be observed that an offence under s 328 is a serious one carrying a maximum sentence of ten years` imprisonment in addition to a fine. Indeed, administering a stupefying drug may well have harmful consequences for the victim, and it was fortuitous that in this case the complainant did not suffer serious harm.
The learned district judge rejected her plea in mitigation that she had a family including young children to support, and found that she had been motivated to commit the offences in question not to support her family but to feed her addiction to drugs. The law is clear that it is no mitigation if an offence is committed to support an addiction: 
R v Antonio Lawrence
 
[1988] 10 Cr App R (S) 463
 For all these reasons, I was of the view that the sentence passed in this case by the district court under s 328 was not realistic, and, in the interest of the public, the sentence of imprisonment under s 328 was increased considerably from ten months to three years, the sentence to run concurrently with the sentence of three months` imprisonment for theft under s 379.

The appellant pleaded guilty in the subordinate court to two charges. The first charge was that in October and November 1990, in furtherance of a common intention with one other person, he attempted to cheat one Ng Ser Miang by misrepresenting to the latter that an Indonesian company, PT Singa Jeya, had entered into an agreement to purchase a country club in Batam called Batam Fantasy Resort for the sum of S$10m and had paid S$2m to the vendors thereof with the intention of inducing Ng to invest S$3m in that club. The offence in that charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of six months or a fine or both. The second charge, which was totally unrelated to the first, was that in November 1989, he being an agent, namely, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department, Ministry of Finance, knowingly used, with intent to deceive his principal, Jaspal Singh, the Director (Corporate and Regulatory Affairs), Ministry of Finance, a false vehicle invoice which stated that Ching Dtien Co had sold to him a Subaru Legacy motor car for $73,500 which was intended to mislead his principal into granting him a vehicle loan of $65,000. The offence in the second charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years or a maximum fine of $100,000 or both.
Before pleading guilty to the charges, the appellant admitted without qualification two statements of facts relating to them respectively. With reference to the first charge, the facts admitted, in so far as material, were as follows. The appellant at all material times was the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department (`CAD`) of the Ministry of Finance, Singapore. In 1988, he and his wife started a car rental business on Batam Island and the business was operated at the premises of Batam Fantasy Resort (`the resort`). Later, they also started and operated a health centre and a lounge there. At that time, the resort was owned by an Indonesian company, PT Indo Cahaya Semesta, and was run by General Soedarsono Darmosoewito, the ex-governor of Batam Island and the chief executive of Batam Island Industrial Area Development Authority. The two businesses of the appellant and his wife were carried on at the premises of the resort under some arrangement made with General Soedarsono.
In August 1990, the appellant negotiated with General Soedarsono for the purchase of the resort, and an agreement was signed on 5 October 1990, whereby PT Singa Jeya agreed to purchase the resort from PT Indo Cahaya Semesta for S$3m which was payable in three instalments, namely, S$450,000 on the signing of the agreement, ie 5 October 1990, S$150,000 on 12 October 1990 and the balance of S$2.4m on 20 December 1990. PT Singa Jeya was presumably owned by the appellant and his wife, as the two persons who signed the agreement on behalf of the company were employees of the appellant and his wife. The first two instalments totalling S$600,000 were duly paid; they were substantially funded by two investors in the project: one was Koh Ah Kim who provided S$400,000 and the other was Susan Jacob who provided S$120,000. The shortfall came from part of the overdraft facilities obtained by the appellant from a bank in Singapore.
Before the agreement was signed, the appellant was already looking for persons who would be interested to make a substantial investment in the resort. One of the persons he approached was Ng Ser Miang (`Ng`), the managing director of Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd (`TIBS`) who was introduced to the appellant by his friend, Keith Tay of KPMG Peat Marwick. Keith Tay arranged for the appellant to meet Ng at a lunch at the Stables, Mandarin Hotel. Present at the lunch were also Bernard Tay, who is Keith Tay`s brother and the managing director of PB Packaging Systems, a fully-owned subsidiary of TIBS, and the appellant`s wife. Over lunch, the appellant told Ng that the total investment in the resort was S$10m and that he was looking for an investor to invest S$3m. Ng said he would like to have a feasibility study before considering investing in the resort. Thereafter, an arrangement was made for Ng to visit the resort.
On 17 November 1990, a Singapore company BIIMA Pte Ltd, was incorporated with the appellant`s wife and Susan Jacob as the directors. The paid-up capital was initially $2 and was subsequently increased to $5m by an allotment and issue of further shares as follows: 400,000 shares to Koh Ah Kim; 1,749,999 shares to the appellant`s wife; 2.6m shares to one Michael Ashe; and 249,999 shares to Susan Jacob. Michael Ashe is a barrister in London who had worked with the appellant in various cases. He held the shares as nominee for the appellant.
On 10 December 1990, the appellant furnished a business plan of the resort to Bernard Tay who presumably transmitted it to Ng. In the business plan it was misrepresented that PT Singa Jeya had entered into an agreement to purchase the resort for S$10m and that the company was entering into an arrangement with a group formed by the appellant`s wife to sell 80% stake in the resort for $8m. It was also misrepresented there that PT Singa Jeya had paid S$2m to the vendors of the resort and that BIIMA Pte Ltd had paid $5m `from shareholders` funds`.
BIIMA Pte Ltd had never paid S$5m to the vendors of the resort. The amount which was actually paid to General Soedarsono was only S$3m in accordance with the sale agreement. The only two shareholders of BIIMA Pte Ltd who in fact paid sums of money towards the purchase of the resort were Koh Ah Kim who paid $400,000 and Susan Jacob who paid $250,000. The 1.75m shares allotted to the appellant`s wife and the 2.6m shares to Michael Ashe were not paid up at all.
On 17 December 1990, Ng instructed Bernard Tay to inform the appellant that TIBS would not be investing in the resort.
As regards the second charge,the material facts admitted by the appellant were these: In 1988, the appellant took a car loan of $50,000 from Ching Dtien Co, a second-hand car dealer, to purchase a second-hand BMW735iA motor car No EC8888C for $70,000. Sometime in October 1989, the appellant asked one Jeffrey Woon Kai Ngen (`Woon`), the general manager of Motor Image Enterprises Pte Ltd (`Motor Image`), to help find a buyer for the certificate for the scrapping of his BMW motor car without the registration number. Woon found a buyer and the log book which was held by Ching Dtien Co was released to Woon on the understanding that Woon would settle the outstanding amount. In the following month, the appellant purchased from Motor Image a Subaru Legacy 1.8GL(A) motor car for $63,000. The appellant told Motor Image that he would be applying for a government loan. On 3 November 1989, the appellant submitted an application to the Permanent Secretary (Finance) for a loan of $65,000 for the purchase of the car; the vendor of that car was stated to be Ching Dtien Co. Later, Motor Image registered the Subaru Legacy purchased by the appellant and prepared an invoice to the government for $60,000. Some days later, however, Motor Image was informed by the appellant that he had decided to apply for a loan from a finance company. The appellant did apply to a finance company, namely, Focal Finance Ltd, and a loan of $61,000 was approved. In the meantime, CAD was informed by the Ministry of Finance that the appellant`s application for a loan of $65,000 was approved, and the appellant was required to produce the original vehicle invoice. He caused and procured Ching Dtien Co to make out an invoice showing that the purchase price of the Subaru car was $73,500, of which a deposit of $8,500 had been paid leaving a balance of $65,000. That invoice was false. On the basis of that invoice, Jaspal Singh, Director (Budget) of the Ministry of Finance, approved the release of the loan of $65,000 on 17 November 1989, and a cheque for $65,000 was issued to Ching Dtien Co. The cheque was handed by the appellant to Ching Dtien Co in settlement of his loan and interest amounting to $51,000 and the balance of $14,000 was returned to the appellant.
On the basis of these facts, which were admitted by him, his pleas of guilty to the two charges were accepted and he was convicted. He was sentenced in respect of the first charge to a term of imprisonment of two months and in respect of the second charge to a term of imprisonment of one month, both terms to run consecutively. In totality, the term of imprisonment was three months for the two offences. Against both the sentences, this appeal has been brought.
It is helpful at this stage to set out, in so far as relevant, the text of the first charge, which is as follows: 
 
You, Knight Glenn Jeyasingam, are charged that you, in the months of October and November 1990, at the Stables, Mandarin Hotel and elsewhere in Singapore and in Batam Island, in furtherance of your common intention with one other person, did attempt to cheat one Ng Ser Miang, ... and in such attempt did misrepresent to the said Ng Ser Miang that PT Singa Jeya, ... had entered into an agreement to purchase Batam Fantasy Resort at a price of S$10m and had paid S$2m to the vendors, with the intention of inducing the said Ng Ser Miang to effect an investment of S$3m in the said Batam Fantasy Resort, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 417 read with s 34 and s 511 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The charge specifically referred to misrepresentations made in the months of October and November 1990. The only misrepresentations made during this period were those made over the meeting at lunch at the Stables in Mandarin Hotel and probably at Batam when Ng visited the resort - as to the latter, however, the statement of fact was completely silent as to any misrepresentation made and to that extent the statement did not support the charge of misrepresentations made in Batam. The more serious misrepresentations - so the statement of fact said - were those contained in the hotel business plan which was made available and delivered to Ng in mid-December 1990 or thereabouts. But these were not part of the charge preferred against the appellant, and these misrepresentations fell outside the scope of the charge. The omission to include the misrepresentations made in December 1990 does not render the charge defective; it merely reduces the gravity of the charge. The appellant can only be punished for the offence with which he was charged and of which he was convicted. In my opinion, these misrepresentations cannot be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence as they were not part of the charge.
The offence with which the appellant was charged and convicted was simple cheating under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). Cheating is defined by s 415 of the Code as follows: 
 
Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to `cheat`.
 
 
 
By definition the term `cheating` prescribes two levels of criminality in deception: (i) deception by fraudulently or dishonestly inducing a person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, and (ii) deception by intentionally inducing the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. Now, the charge referred specifically to misrepresentations made to Ng with the 
 intention of inducing 
Ng to effect an investment of S$3m in the resort. It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that in framing the charge against the appellant, the prosecution has chosen the lower level of deception as provided in s 415 and that the appellant was guilty of `intentionally inducing` Ng to invest S$3m in the resort and that was the charge of which he was convicted. He was not charged for and was not convicted of `fraudulently or dishonestly inducing` Ng. I think this submission is well-founded. I accept that there are at least two levels of criminality in the concept of cheating as provided in s 415, and the prosecution has chosen the lesser one in framing the charge against the appellant; that was the charge to which he has pleaded guilty, of which he has been convicted and for which he should be punished. The learned DPP, however, has submitted that the element of fraud or dishonesty was implicit in the statement of facts. The appellant had made representations to Ng which he knew were false; those were fraudulent misrepresentations in the ordinary sense. Taking the charge in its entirety and in the context of the statement of facts admitted by the appellant, the charge fell within the first limb of s 415. I am unable to accept these arguments. It is the undoubted right of the prosecution to decide, firstly, whether or not to prosecute the appellant, secondly, under what section of the Code or other written law the prosecution should be brought and, thirdly, how the charge against him should be framed. The prosecution has decided to frame a charge against him adopting explicitly the words falling within the second limb of s 415 which is a lesser form of attempted cheating, and he has pleaded guilty to the charge so framed and was convicted. It is not open to the prosecution now to contend that on the basis of the statement of fact, the charge is one of attempted cheating by fraudulently or dishonestly inducing Ng, a charge falling within the first limb in s 415. That was not the charge against the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant mounted a detailed attack on various points of the judgment of the learned district judge. It is not necessary for me to deal with all of them; some of them have no merit. I need to consider only the following. I was referred to the following passage of the judgment of the learned district judge: `It was patent that the appellant had, with one other person intended to cheat Ng Ser Miang. The amount of $3m he hoped to derive from this act was by no measure a paltry sum.` Counsel for the appellant submitted that this finding was not borne out by the statement of facts, and what the learned district judge said was a grave misdirection. To some extent, counsel was justified in making this criticism. What the appellant did was to induce Ng to invest $3m in the resort and not to make a payment of $3m to him. If Ng had decided to invest the $3m, there would undoubtedly be negotiations and a proper agreement would be drawn up to protect his investment. There was no evidence that Ng would sustain a loss if he had, in fact, made the investment.
I now turn to the second charge against the appellant, which is as follows: 
 
You, Knight Glenn Jeyasingam, m/46 yrs, NRIC 0356370/G are charged that you, on or about 17 November 1989, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department, Ministry of Finance, Singapore, did knowingly use with intent to deceive your principal, to wit, one Jaspal Singh, the Director (Corporate & Regulatory Affairs), Ministry of Finance, a document, to wit, a vehicle invoice of Ching Dtien Co dated 9 November 1989, in respect of which the said Jaspal Singh was interested and which contained a statement which was false in a material particular, to wit, that Ching Dtien Co had sold to you a Subaru Legacy 1.8GL motor car for a sum of $73,500, which to your knowledge was intended to mislead your principal into granting you a government vehicle loan of $65,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
The charge preferred against the appellant was one under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (`the Act`). Section 6 provides as follows: 
 
If -
 
 
 
 
(a) any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business; 
 
(b) any person corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do any act in relation to his principal`s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal`s affairs or business; or 
 
(c) any person knowingly gives to an agent, or if an agent knowingly uses with intent to deceive his principal, any receipt, account or other document in respect of which the principal is interested, and which contains any statement which is false or erroneous or defective in any material particular, and which to his knowledge is intended to mislead the principal,
  
 
 
he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the hearing on Monday, 2 March 1992, I intimated to the learned DPP and counsel for the appellant my doubt on the correctness of the charge. I gave them an opportunity to prepare and submit written arguments, which they now did. I have considered their respective submissions and the authorities cited. I am satisfied that, on the facts as admitted, the charge under s 6(c) of the Act was properly brought against the appellant. I accept the submission of the learned DPP that at the time when the appellant presented the false invoice to the government for the purpose of obtaining a vehicle loan, he was an agent and that the government was his principal within the meaning of s 2 of the Act. It is true that the charge described Jaspal Singh and not the government as the principal; but the explanation for that was that the government must act through a person, and Jaspal Singh was the person, as he it was who approved the release of the vehicle loan relying on the false invoice submitted by the appellant. Assuming it was wrong to describe Jaspal Singh as the principal, the error is purely technical and does not affect the validity of the charge. The provision of s 6 is in pari materia with s 1(1) of the English Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, and it has been decided by the Court of Appeal in England in 
 R v Tweedie 
 1 that the false document referred to in the third paragraph of s 1(1) - the third paragraph is identical with s 6(c) of our Act - must be a document inter partes either in creation or use, and hence the words `or other document` should be construed as meaning a document which would pass inter partes. The false invoice of Ching Dtien Co submitted by the appellant was a document inter partes and fell within the meaning of `other document` in s 6(c).
The charge under s 6(c) of the Act does not imply any corruption at all. The word `corruptly` which is present in paras (a) and (b) of s 6 is absent in para (c). But the offence under s 6(c) does imply an element of dishonesty. In effect, it is an offence of cheating under a different statutory provision. On the facts admitted by the appellant, he could be charged for cheating under s 417 or s 420 of the Code. The prosecution, however, has brought this charge under s 6(c) of the Act and is fully entitled to do so. A charge under s 6(c) of the Act is more serious than that under s 417 of the Code. This is clearly evident from the penalty provided in s 6 as compared to that provided in s 417 of the Code. Under s 6, the maximum penalty is a fine of $100,000 or a term of imprisonment of five years or both, whereas under s 417 the maximum term of imprisonment is one year or a fine or both. In my opinion, the second charge is more serious than the first. It was, however, not dealt with on that basis below. Nor did counsel for the appellant or the learned DPP argue on that basis.
It was argued by counsel for the appellant that the learned district judge erred in holding that the punishment prescribed for an offence under s 6(c) of the Act is, inter alia, imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. I accept that there was a slight error here: the maximum term of imprisonment is five years and not seven years. But this is not a serious error: the discrepancy in the maximum term of imprisonment is not really significant or material.
It is not apparent to me that the learned district judge has considered adethe nature of the offence in this charge and the circumstances in which it was committed. In particular, there is one material circumstance which ought to be considered. This is not a case where the appellant was not entitled to or not eligible for a vehicle loan at all and resorted to a false invoice to obtain it. The appellant had applied to the Ministry of Finance for a vehicle loan of $65,000 and his loan was approved. What he did wrong was to submit a false invoice and obtain the full amount of the loan approved on the basis of that false invoice. If he had submitted the true invoice from Motor Image, which was for $60,000, he would have obtained only a loan of $60,000. By submitting the false invoice he obtained $5,000 more for the loan.
I now turn to an argument advanced by counsel for the appellant which is applicable to both the first and the second charges. The learned district judge, in deciding to impose a custodial sentence in respect of both the charges, relied on

It is a fact of our times, a fact which will be with us for as long as anyone can foresee, that white-collar crime is on the increase and it may well be that it is right that white-collar crimes should be regarded as just as serious and just as inimical to the public interest and public welfare as crimes involving physical violence. We think it ought to be made clear to those who commit this type of crime that imprisonment would be the norm and they should expect to be punished not by fines but by imprisonment, the terms depending on the particular circumstances of each case.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that the present case is a far cry from those cases and cannot on any basis be comparable to any of them and accordingly the learned district judge erred. I agree. These cases the learned district judge referred to were far more serious than either of the two charges. The cases of 
 Cho Jock Kim 
 2 and 
 Tan Koon Swan 
 4 involved criminal breach of trust of vast sums of money and the case of 
 Datuk Haji Harun 
 3 was a case of forgery for the purpose of cheating and of criminal breach of trust of securities in value amounting to over M$1m. With respect, the learned district judge has misdirected himself. The passage of the judgment of Wee Chong Jin CJ in 
 Cho Jock Kim 
 2 was not intended to be of universal application; there are white-collar crimes and white-collar crimes: some are serious and some are less serious. I do not think it was intended by Wee Chong Jin CJ that that passage of his judgment (which is plainly obiter) should apply to all white-collar crimes irrespective of whether or not they are serious. It is clearly wrong to group all of them into one category and say that custodial sentence is the norm for them.
Counsel for the appellant then referred to a very comprehensive list of cases of cheating under s 417 of the Code which have been dealt with by the courts, of which two or three of them were appeals to the High Court, and pointed out that in all these cases the offenders were fined and at most only a nominal custodial sentence of one day was imposed. Even in the more serious cases of cheating under s 420, only fines and nominal custodial sentence of one day were normally imposed. Only in very serious cases of cheating under s 420 was a substantive period of custodial sentence imposed. Those were all cases of cheating. Here, counsel submitted, is a case of attempted cheating where the penalty, in so far as custodial sentence is concerned, is only a maximum of six months.
With respect to the second charge, I have also obtained from the learned DPP a list of cases of offence under s 6(c) of the Act. Again, in all these cases the normal sentence was a fine.
I now turn to consider whether a custodial sentence in respect of each of the charges against the appellant is warranted. There is in this case an aggravating circumstance, and it is this. The appellant at the material time was the director of CAD of the Ministry of Finance, and that is the department specially formed to investigate and prosecute commercial crimes, including those crimes as the present ones which the appellant himself committed. As the learned DPP pointed out, he committed the same type of offences which he was entrusted to direct investigations and prosecute. The court undoubtedly takes a serious view of what the appellant did. As against that, however, I have also to consider the mitigating and other circumstances which are in his favour. Until his suspension from service in March 1991, he had a distinguished record of public service. He joined the Attorney General`s Chambers on 3 April 1970 and reached the position of a senior state counsel. On 16 October 1984, he was appointed Director of CAD and was responsible for the setting-up of the department and also for the success of that department in the investigation and prosecution of commercial crimes. In 1989 he received a strong commendation from the Minister for Finance for outstanding leadership in setting up CAD, and in 1990 he was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Gold). In addition, he had served, among others, the positions of a lecturer/tutor in the Faculty of Law, National University; a consultant in the Practice Law Course organized by the Board of Legal Education; vice-chairman of the Board of Governors for four Anglo-Chinese Schools, and vice-chairman of the Board of Management of Anglo-Chinese Independent School. In respect of both the offences, no one has suffered any loss. In particular, with regard to the second offence, the vehicle loan has been repaid in full to the government. He was suspended in March 1991 and disciplinary proceedings have been taken against him, and his service would be likely to be terminated, and he would thereby lose all his pension and other benefits which are not inconsiderable. There is no doubt that the investigation and prosecution initiated have taken a heavy toll on him and on his health. He has produced a medical report in support. Clearly his health has been impaired.
Taking into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances, both the aggravating and mitigating ones, and also the level or degree of criminality in respect of each of the charges, all of which I have discussed, I am of the opinion that the appellant would be adequately punished with the following sentences. In respect of the first charge, which is attempted simple cheating, a hefty fine would suffice. Accordingly, I set aside the term of the imprisonment of two months and impose a fine of $7,000, and in default of payment thereof a term of imprisonment of three months. In respect of the second charge, which, in my opinion, is a more serious one, I also set aside the term of imprisonment of one month and substitute a term of imprisonment of one day and impose a fine of $10,000, and in default of payment thereof a term of imprisonment of four months. I consider that the imposition of the nominal custodial sentence is appropriate in this case; I do not consider it at all a farce. It signifies that in the court`s view, the appellant must suffer a custodial sentence, albeit a nominal one, and also that, but for the very strong mitigating and other circumstances in his favour, a substantive term of imprisonment would have been meted out to the appellant.

On 18 June 1991 at about 3.25am, the appellant lost control of his car while driving along Bedok Reservoir Road. As a result, his vehicle mounted a grass verge and hit a tree.The appellant was thrown out of the car onto the road. He sustained injuries and was warded at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The car was extensively damaged. The blood sample of the appellant was analysed and was certified by a medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration of 164.5mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The appellant pleaded guilty on 15 October 1991 to a charge of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, which is punishable under s 67 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`). He was sentenced by the magistrate as a first offender to two weeks` imprisonment and was disqualified from holding a driving licence for three years. He served the sentence of two weeks` imprisonment and appealed only against the order of disqualification.
When a person is convicted of a first offence under s 67, he is liable to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, or to imprisonment of up to six months as provided by s 67(1). Pursuant to s 67(2), the court will also disqualify him from holding a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of his conviction or, where he is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of his release from prison, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the period of disqualification was excessive. He argued that the learned magistrate had erred in paying undue attention to two factors: that the level of alcohol concentration in the appellant`s blood was 164.5mg in 100ml of blood, and that a collision occurred as a result of the appellant`s loss of control of the vehicle.
The courts of the United Kingdom have emphasized precisely these two factors in deciding on the appropriate period of disqualification in a case of drunken driving. An order of disqualification is the chief penalty for most offenders, and there is a need to show a distinction between the period of disqualification for an offender only slightly above the limit whose driving ability is only slightly impaired, if at all, and that for an offender whose alcohol level is greatly in excess of the prescribed limit and whose driving has clearly been affected by his consumption of alcohol. In 
 Sakhuja v Allen 
 ,1 Lord Hailsham LC stated at p 318: 
 
... it may well be that circuit judges and recorders will do well to bear in mind that they have a discretion to impose longer periods of disqualification when bad driving and bad behaviour followed the drink. In this way they can differentiate between drivers whose excessive drinking is substantial and has led to actual danger and those where the drinking is only slightly above the limit and has not been accompanied by bad driving or bad behaviour.
 
 
 
The sentencing practice in the United Kingdom is especially relevant in view of the similarity in the statutory provisions relating to drunken driving. In the United Kingdom as in Singapore, the prescribed limit of blood alcohol concentration is 80mg in 100ml of blood. Likewise, in both jurisdictions, upon conviction the court is obliged to impose a period of disqualification of at least 12 months unless there are special reasons for ordering otherwise.
Counsel for the appellant submitted, however, that the level of alcohol concentration in the blood should not be used as a scale upon which the gravity of sentencing should be based. He said that different persons were affected diffeby alcohol, and the impairment of a person`s ability to control a vehicle on account of alcohol varies according to his or her sex, body-weight and many other factors; a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 80mg in 100ml of blood might in fact be less fit to drive a vehicle than another person with a blood alcohol concentration twice as high. He submitted that it did not therefore follow that a person who had twice that level of alcohol in his blood would be twice as incapable of having proper control of his vehicle and thus deserved to be punished twice as much. He referred the court to several cases: 
 PP v Elangovan 
 ,2 
 PP v Yew Teck Hong 
 ,3 
 PP v Robert Victo 
 
 r 
 4 and 
 PP v Oh Ching Siong 
 .5
In my opinion, these submissions have no merit at all. The appellant had a blood alcohol concentration of more than twice the legal limit and it would not in principle be appropriate to treat him as if he were an offender who was just over the limit. A person substantially over the limit is obviously in more flagrant violation of the Act than a person marginally over the limit. When a person has been arrested under s 67 of the Act, and the blood sample provided by him under s 69 is certified by a medical officer to have a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80mg in 100ml of blood, s 70 creates an irrebuttable presumption that he is incapable of having proper control of the motor vehicle. The possibility that he may have an unusual constitution with a great capacity for alcohol is not relevant. Once the offender was over the legal limit, the court would not entertain the argument that he was not in fact incapable of having proper control of the car. Moreover, in the present case the appellant did in fact lose control of his car.
Counsel for the appellant also argued that in this case the appellant had merely collided into a tree off the road; the only person who was injured was himself and there were no other aggravating circumstances. Counsel submitted that the disqualification of three years was therefore excessive in comparison with the cases cited by him. In my opinion, there was no merit in this submission. The appellant lost control of his car in a residential area and could have caused serious injury to other persons. It was only fortuitous that no one else was seriously injured. Moreover, counsel for the appellant was not aware that in one of the authorities cited by him, 
 PP v Oh Ching Siong 
 ,5 in which the accused was fined $1,800 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for one year, the public prosecutor appealed and the High Court substituted a sentence of imprisonment of 75 days and increased the period of disqualification from one year to three years.
In my opinion, the learned magistrate was entirely justified in his observation that `despite adverse publicity on drunken driving, the appellant chose to drive while intoxicated. The motor car in his hands was not just a motor transport, but had become a lethal weapon capable of inflicting mortal harm.` On the facts of this case, the learned magistrate was perfectly entitled in the exercise of his discretion to order a three-year period of disqualification. As this was not manifestly excessive, the appeal is dismissed.

On 28 August 1991, J Balasubramaniam, the respondent, was charged in the magistrate`s court that he, on or about 11 February 1991 at about 11pm, drove motor car EW5254X along Tiong Bahru Road whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the motor car. This is an offence under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`) and is punishable, on a first conviction, with a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. A conviction for this offence carries a compulsory disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of conviction, ` 
 unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise 
 `. The period of disqualification of not less than 12 months is without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification.
The respondent was also charged that on the same date and time and at the same place, he drove the same motor car otherwise than in an orderly and careful manner and with due regard for the safety of others, in that he collided into the rear of motor car EW1429K. This is an offence under r 27B of the Road Traffic Rules 1981 and punishable under s 131(1)(d) of the Act with a fine of $1,000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months, for a first offence.
The respondent pleaded guilty to the drunken driving charge and consented to the careless driving charge being taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. The learned magistrate who heard this case accepted the plea of guilty on the drunken driving charge on the statement of facts presented by the prosecution, which the respondent accepted, convicted the respondent of the drunken driving charge and after hearing a plea in mitigation, to which I shall refer later in some detail, sentenced the respondent by imposing a fine of $1,200 but did not order a disqualification as he found that there were `special reasons` for not ordering a disqualification.
The public prosecutor now appeals against that part of the sentence of failing to order a disqualification.
The statement of facts, after reciting the facts of the collision as stated in the careless driving charge, states that no one was hurt but when the police arrived at the scene of the collision, the respondent whose breath smelt of alcohol was placed under arrest and later taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he consented to a sample of his blood being taken for analysis, which was shown to contain 233.1mg of ethanol per 100ml of his blood. Investigations revealed that the respondent and some of his friends were celebrating the Chinese New Year at a restaurant along Cantonment Road on the day stated in the charges (11 February 1991) at about 10pm. The respondent and his friends consumed alcoholic drinks. At the time of the accident the weather was fine, the road surface dry, visibility fair and the flow of traffic light. Thus it was suggested in the statement of facts that the collision was due to the respondent losing control of his motor car as he was incapable of controlling it properly due to drink. There were no other contributing factors to the collision. The damage to the two motor cars was slight to moderate.
Since the respondent had pleaded guilty, the only facts before the learned magistrate were those contained in the statement of facts. Counsel for the respondent in making his plea of mitigation called no evidence at all but he made two statements of significance from the bar, both of which were not challenged by the prosecution. In fact at the hearing before me, the learned DPP was prepared to argue his appeal without attempting to dispute the two statements. These statements are that the respondent on the day in question had consumed only two glasses of draft beer followed by one double-peck of whiskey and that unknown to him, when he had gone to the toilet, one of his friends had `spiked` his whiskey with brandy. These two statements, learned counsel for the respondent contended, were contained in the respondent`s further statement to the police and in the statement given to the police by the respondent`s friend, Ler Chin Teck. However, there is no evidence in the record of appeal that these statements were before the learned magistrate. Nevertheless he accepted them. The learned DPP confirmed to me that these statements had been made.
I would pause here to note that no mention was made in the mitigation plea to the learned magistrate exactly how much brandy had been poured into the respondent`s whiskey; whether it was neat brandy that was poured into the respon`s whiskey or brandy which had already been mixed with water or some other mixer like ginger ale or other mixers people sometimes mix with brandy before drinking it; whether the respondent himself was drinking his whiskey neat or whiskey mixed with water or some other mixer like soda; whether the respondent had taken a meal or whether he was drinking on an empty stomach. As will be seen later, these details are extremely significant to the plea of mitigation in this kind of case a propos whether there are special reasons for not ordering disqualification. I would also note that the word `spiked` is learned counsel`s word which he used throughout his address to me and before the learned magistrate as well. Whether or not Ler Chin Teck used the word `spiked` in his statement can only be a matter of speculation. The learned DPP offered to read to me Ler Chin Teck`s statement. I did not allow this as I did not think it proper to have before me evidence not contained in the record of appeal and which was not before the learned magistrate.
This brings me to a matter of some importance and that is how a defendant in a drunken driving charge should set about discharging the onus of proving `special reasons` which is on him and which he is only required to do on a balance of probability that it was the additional alcohol, of which he was unconscious, that put him over the limit. Lord Widgery CJ in 
Pugsley v Hunter
 
[1973] RTR 284
 at pp 290A-291A gave some guidance which was adopted in 
DPP v Younas
 
[1990] RTR 22
 . He said at p 25: 
 
Then one comes to the next question, which is: how in practice is the onus to be discharged? It is easy enough perhaps to state what the onus is and the standard to which it must be discharged, but how in fact is it to be discharged? It must be discharged in practice by the calling of admissible and relevant evidence; like any other issue in litigation it depends on the calling of admissible and relevant evidence, and there are a number of different circumstances which may face the court when a defendant seeks to prove such special reasons ... Furthermore, I would recognize that there are some cases where it can be said to be obvious to a layman that the added drink, once its nature and quality have been discovered, was the cause of the commission of the offence. An example is where the alcoholic content in the blood is only marginally above the statutory limit and the added drink taken to the satisfaction of the court without the knowledge of the defendant is substantial. For example, if the defendant`s alcoholic content had been only 82mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood and the magistrate was satisfied that the defendant had received two double vodkas unknown to himself, any magistrate would at once conclude and could at once conclude that those two double vodkas were responsible for the excess of alcohol in the blood over the statutory limit. But there may be occasions in which such a conclusion is not obvious ... I am most reluctant to establish a rule which will be oppressive on defendants by requiring them to call, provide and pay for expert evidence in all cases of this kind, but I am eventually persuaded at the end of the argument that, unless the case is an obvious one, unless the case is one where a layman can reliably and confidently say that the added liquor must explain the excess of alcohol, the only way in which the defendant can discharge the onus is by calling medical evidence. One will assume and hope that these cases will not be very frequent, but I reach the conclusion at the end of the case that where the facts are not obvious to a layman in the medical sense, it will be necessary for the defendant to call medical evidence in order to discharge the onus of proof which rests on him.
 
 
 
All too often in our courts, the plea of mitigation is the `cinderella` of the trial and even less than that where a plea of guilty is entered. Rarely, if ever, do defence counsel call evidence to support a plea in mitigation; they make do with such mitigating evidence that may have come out at the trial or rely on statements from the bar in the hope that prosecuting counsel will not challenge them. That may well do in the ordinary type of criminal case, but when a defendant seeks to prove special reasons, for not ordering disqualification on a drunken driving charge most especially, I would venture to suggest, adopting the advice of Lord Widgery, that it is most essential that evidence of all the relevant facts and the surrounding circumstances both in respect of the defendant and of the adding of the additional alcohol to the drink of the defendant, both as to nature and quality, is placed before the court, and unless a layman can reliably and confidently say that the added alcohol must explain the excess of alcohol in the blood of the defendant, medical or scientific evidence must be called as well to explain it. Failure to adopt this course can well result in the court holding that the defendant has not discharged the burden of proving the special reasons.
The legal limit in Singapore is 80mg of ethanol in 100ml of blood (see s 70 of the Act). The blood alcohol or ethanol found on the respondent was 233.1mg per 100ml of his blood, that is to say very nearly three times the legal limit.
The submission made by respondent`s counsel to the learned magistrate was that in any event, disqualification should not be imposed on the respondent because his drink had been `spiked` or `laced` by Ler Chin Teck; that the respondent was `more a victim of circumstances rather than any wilful act on his part`. Two cases were cited to him in support of this submission, namely, 
DPP v Barker
 
[1990] RTR 1
 and 
DPP v Younas
 
[1990] RTR 22
 .
In the former case, the defendant who was not a habitual drinker, being depressed, had drunk two or three glasses of wine during an evening meal at a restaurant. Later that evening, she had attended a neighbour`s party where she was handed a full tumbler of what she thought was orange juice but, unknown to her, was approximately one-third vodka and two-thirds orange juice; the orange juice did not taste unusual to her; she could not detect the presence of alcohol in it and she was given at least one similar drink and possibly a third, all within 15 minutes. She remembered nothing after the first drink. She was unaware that she drove her car, that she was arrested, taken to a police station, provided a specimen of breath for analysis and was taken to her house by the police. The magistrates heard evidence from a chemist for each of the defendant and the prosecutor relating to the quantity of alcohol consumed, its effects on a person of the defendant`s sex and weight and that the effect was sudden rather than gradual. The magistrates, having considered the evidence, were of the opinion that the awareness of the presence of vodka when mixed with another drink was entirely dependent on that individual`s palate, that not for the alcohol in the drinks consumed at the party, her breath alcohol level would not have exceeded the prescribed limit and that she suffered a total loss of knowledge of her actions and was not aware that her condition was influenced by the consumption of alcohol. They were also of the opinion that the wine taken with the meal would have been ingested with the food.
The question for the divisional court on appeal was whether the magistrates having found that there were special reasons had properly exercised their discretion not to disqualify. There was a two-stage process as stated in 
 Pridige v Gran 
 
t
 
[1985] RTR 196
 which the prosecutor submitted had not been followed by the magistrates. The divisional court, without weakening the observations of Kerr LJ in 
 Pridige v Gran 
 
t
 
[1985] RTR 196
 at p 201G-J, held that the magistrates` finding `that the defendant suffered a total loss of knowledge of her actions and was not aware that her condition was influenced by the consumption of alcohol` indicated that the magistrates had clearly considered whether the defendant should have realized that she was not fit to drive due to the presence of alcohol in her body and therefore the discretion was properly exercised. Tudor Evans J went on to observe that `with such total loss of knowledge it seems to me inevitably to follow that the defendant could not have appreciated that she was unfit to drive through drink`.
It is also useful to set out the observations of Kerr LJ in 
Pridige v Grant.
 
[1985] RTR 196
 . He said at p 201G-J: 
 
I think that it was worth bringing this appeal so that similar cases may perhaps not occur in the future. Magistrates and other courts must bear in mind when considering a `special reasons` mitigation that it is not enough to conclude that a `special reason` existed but that there must, in addition, be a separate process of consideration as to whether the court`s discretion should be exercised in favour of the defendant. Where the `special reason` is one of laced drinks, then, on the authorities to which I have referred, the court must go on to ask itself, even in cases of non-alcoholic laced drinks, whether the defendant should have realized that he was not fit to drive due to the presence of alcohol in his body, and even though he had no reason to suspect at the earlier stage that he was taking in any alcohol.
 
 
 
The learned magistrate, in my view, failed totally to address himself to this second stage process in exercising his discretion not to disqualify the respondent. But more of this later.
The second case cited to the learned magistrate was 
DPP v Younas
 
[1990] RTR 22
 . In this case the defendant had driven to a public house half-a-mile from his house to buy some cigars. He then met some friends who invited him to stay. He asked for a lager and was given a pint of lager which, without his knowledge, was laced with a double Barcardi, as was the second pint asked for by the defendant. The magistrates heard evidence from the so-called friend who had laced his drinks and witnessed the lacing of another one. It seems that the reason why these friends had taken the course was that they thought the defendant would be walking home as he normally did and did not realize that he would be driving. No medical or scientific evidence was called by the defendant, but the magistrates employing their layman`s knowledge, held that it was obvious to them `that one-and-three-quarter pints of lager would not have taken him over the limit`. Although no medical or scientific evidence was called by the defendant, the divisional court held that this finding was not perverse.
The learned magistrate in his grounds of decision also referred to the case of 
Williams v Neale
 
[1971] RTR 149
 . He referred to it in a paragraph of his grounds of decision which reads as follows: 
 
The position in England seems to be that there is `special reason` for not disqualifying where the defendant had unknowingly consumed drinks which were `laced` or `spiked`. This is epitomized by the words of Lord Parker CJ in 
 Williams v Neale
 [1971] RTR 149: `... if that (ie a lacing of drink unbeknown to the driver) does not amount to a special reason, I do not think anything does.`
 
 
 
Not only has the learned magistrate quoted Lord Parker out of context but he has also shown a singular lack of understanding of the English cases dealing with this point. In all the reported English cases on this topic, including the two cited to him as well as in 
Williams v Neale
 
[1971] RTR 149
 , the `lacing` was the adding of a spirit like vodka or Barcardi which has a high alcoholic content to a non-alcoholic or a low alcoholic content beverage like beer. This is significant because a person who was already drinking a high alcoholic content drink like whiskey cannot be heard to say that unbeknown to him, more whiskey had been added to his drink which accounted for the excess over the permitted limit, or even that another spirit of equal alcoholic content like brandy had been added to his whiskey unbeknown to him which accounted for the excess over the permitted limit, without calling some medical or scientific evidence to prove especially in the latter case that the mixture of whiskey and brandy significantly increased its potency.
To return to 
Williams v Neale
 
[1971] RTR 149
 , the defendant on arriving at a party asked for `something soft ... a shandy or something like that`. He was given a fruit-cup mixture with some white wine in it and was told that the drink had been prepared for the younger girls from the office and for people who had to drive a distance. The defendant accepted the drink which he mentally judged its strength at less than that of a shandy. He drank probably five glasses in a period of over half- an-hour. He described the drink as having a `fruity flavour, strong and sharp ... a strong fruity flavour like a gooseberry juice`. The magistrates found that the drink which the defendant believed to have a low alcoholic content, had been rendered more potent by the addition of a quantity of spirits, and the defendant was not aware that spirits had been added to it. The drink had been `laced` unseen by the defendant.
In dismissing the appeal by the prosecutor, Lord Parker said at p 152: 
 
In my judgment that evidence was extremely thin, and the justices might well have found that the defendant really was consuming alcohol at his own risk, and should have realized that it was stronger than what he had been led to suppose. But the justices seem to have wholly accepted his evidence and held that he never had any suspicion at all, and that this was a true case of a drink being laced unseen by and unbeknown to the defendant.
 
 
 
As I say, I think I would have come to a different conclusion here, but I cannot say that a bench of justices properly directing themselves could not arrive at the conclusion which they did.
However, Mr Berry goes further and says that in any event a lacing of drink unbeknown to the driver cannot amount to a special reason. For my part all I can say is that, if that does not amount to a special reason, I do not think anything does.
In my view, Lord Parker was not epitomizing that a lacing of drink unbeknown to the driver by itself amounts to a special reason as the learned magistrate seems to have thought. Lord Parker could not have meant that having regard to the context in which he said those words.
Before turning to the findings of the learned magistrate in this case, I must say a word or two of the legislative intent on s 67(1) and (2) of the Act as it has a direct bearing on the exercise of the limited discretion it gives to the courts. It seems clear to me that the legislative intent is that those who choose to drink and drive must be prepared to suffer a minimum period of a disqualification of 12 months should they exceed the prescribed limit of alcohol in their blood or are shown to be otherwise incapable of being in control of a motor vehicle due to the presence of alcohol in their body, but at the same time the legislature has recognized that there may exist certain extenuating or pressing circumstances which may prevail upon the driver to take the risk of driving knowing that he was not fit to drive due to the presence of alcohol in his body. It is in this kind of situation when the offence is committed under some extenuating or pressing circumstances that the court is given the discretion not to disqualify or to disqualify for a lesser period than 12 months. The extenuating or pressing circumstances to be a special reason must relate to the offence itself and not to the offender. See 
Whittall v Kirby

 and 
Re Kanapathipillai & Ors
 
 
[1960] MLJ 243
  .
On the question of `laced drinks` or `spiked drinks` being such an extenuating circumstance and thus a special reason I can do no better than quote Lord Widgery CJ in 
Adams v Bradley
 
[1975] RTR 233
 at p 236: 
 
The principle on which this type of case has to be decided is now clearly laid down. It has been said over and over again that a man who chooses to combine in one evening both drink and driving a motor car does so at his peril, and it is for him to see that the amount of alcohol which he consumes does not bring the content in his blood above the statutory maximum. It is his duty to observe the quantity and quality of the drink he consumes, and if he makes a mistake and in fact takes more alcohol than is justified by the statutory limit, then he is guilty of the offence and prima facie has no excuse to offer against the suggestion that he be disqualified.
 
 
 
There has, however, grown up a gloss on this doctrine which is concerned with the so-called `laced drinks` cases. We have had in this court at least half a dozen cases in the last year or so in which a motorist with too much alcohol in his blood has pleaded as an excuse for what had happened that someone else has put strong spirit into an otherwise innocuous drink, or `laced it` as the vernacular would have it at the present time. In those cases, however, there has always been an element of intervention by a third party or a misleading of the motorist by a third party. They have all been cases in which the driver has been induced to take a stronger drink than he normally would by reason of someone having misled him or given him false information.
I now turn to the findings made by the learned magistrate in this case. Firstly, he found that `the added brandy was the cause of the commission of the offence ... The probabilities are that it was the mixing of brandy with the accused`s whiskey which accounted for the excessive blood-alcohol level.` I fail to see how the learned magistrate could have come to this finding when there was no evidence before him of the quantity of brandy poured into the whiskey of the respondent; when there was no evidence whether the brandy that was poured into the respon`s whiskey was neat brandy or brandy which was already diluted by the addition of a mixer such as ginger ale or some other mixer; when there was no evidence whether the respondent`s whiskey was neat or was already diluted with water or a mixer such as soda or some other mixer; when there was no evidence whether the respondent was drinking on an empty stomach or not; when there was no scientific evidence to explain whether the concoction of whiskey and brandy would produce a more potent drink than either whiskey or brandy both of which have about the same ethanol content (see 
 Forensic Medicine 
 by Keith Simpson at p 312 and 
 Drink, Drugs and Driving 
 by Walls & Brownlie, (2nd Ed) at p 6), and when there was no expert medical or scientific evidence to explain the effect of a concoction of whiskey and brandy following two glasses of beer on the respondent.
Secondly, he said: `I am further prepared to hold that it is more likely than not that the beer and whiskey alone would not have caused the accused`s blood alcohol to exceed the legal limit.` Again I fail to see how the learned magistrate could have come to this finding without the assistance of expert medical or scientific evidence. If he was placing himself in the position of the lay magistrates in 
DPP v Younas
 
[1990] RTR 22
 , I must say that he was wrong to have done so. A bench of lay magistrates in England function as a jury would on questions of fact. It is permissible for them to draw on their experience and knowledge so long as their findings of fact are not perverse. They are guided on the law by the clerk to the court. A magistrate presiding in our lower courts is a decider of both fact and law and is expected to make his findings of fact on the evidence before him. He may take judicial notice of what is obviously common knowledge. I cannot accept that it could be `reliably and confidently` said by anyone that under all circumstances two glasses of beer and a double whiskey would not exceed the legal limit of 80mg of ethanol in 100ml of blood.
Thirdly, he found that `it is common knowledge that the effect of alcohol increases drastically when alcoholic drinks, especially `hard liquor` like brandy and whiskey are mixed`. It may be a common belief but whether it has any scientific basis for its validity only expert scientific evidence can tell. In any case, as I have already pointed out, there are too many imponderables in the mixing of the brandy with the whiskey to give this assumption any credibility.
In fact, the whole of the learned magistrate`s findings were no more than assumptions which have no scientific or common sense basis and I have no hesitation in rejecting them. The result is that the respondent has not discharged the burden which was on him to prove on a balance of probability that he had been induced to take a stronger drink than what he was then consuming by the intervention of a third party without his knowledge to account for a near three-fold increase of his blood alcohol above the permitted limit. Furthermore, the fact is that the respondent on his own admission had taken two glasses of beer and had switched to a double whiskey. To his knowledge he was taking in alcohol into his body and on the authorities I have discussed in this judgment, there was a duty on the learned magistrate to address his mind to the question whether the respondent realized that he was not fit to drive due to the presence of alcohol in his body. Clearly the learned magistrate did not, and accordingly the exercise of his discretion not to disqualify the respondent was a wrong exercise of his discretion in law.
This appeal must therefore be allowed. It only remains for me to consider the period of disqualification I ought to impose. Having regard to the fact of the extraordinary high ethanol content in the respondent`s blood, and the fact that the collision occurred no sooner had he left the restaurant in Cantonment Road, that the accident occurred near Tiong Bahru Road, and notwithstanding that no one was hurt, I think an appropriate period of disqualification would be 18 months from today which I duly order.

Nathan Tse Po Chung (`Tse`), the first accused, 29 years of age, and his woman companion Cheuk Mei Mei (`Cheuk`), the second accused, 26 years of age, both of whom were Hong Kong nationals, were charged for importing a substantial quantity of diamorphine into Singapore on 28 February 1989. The charge against them was that Tse imported 2,178g of diamorphine and Cheuk, 2,190.3g of diamorphine into Singapore without authorization in contravention of s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). The punishment for unlawful import of diamorphine for more than 15g is death under s 33 of the Act.
The evidence presented by the prosecution was that on 28 February 1989 at about 2.24pm, Tse and Cheuk arrived in Singapore by Thai International Airways flight TG405 from Phuket. After the aircraft which brought them landed, they entered the transit lounge of the Singapore Changi Airport and remained there throughout. They did not make any attempt to pass through either the immigration or the customs counters. Their intention was to leave Singapore on the same day at about 9.55pm by fight KL838 departing from Singapore for Amsterdam. There was a booking on that flight for their intended departure.
A team of officers from the surveillance unit of the Singapore Customs and Excise led by Senior Customs Officer Michael Koh Keng Siang (PW23) and customs officers Tan Kay Hwa (PW24) and Juraimi bin Safie (PW21) kept close watch on both accused persons. They were kept under surveillance from the time they stepped out of the arrival gate until about 4pm on that day when they were arrested and searched. The customs officers noticed that Tse was walking with a slight limp and his trousers were bulky at the calves. The front part of Cheuk`s trousers appeared bulky at the thigh region. The search conducted on their persons revealed that both of them had several blocks of white substance, 24 blocks on each person, wrapped in cellophane paper secured by elastic guards and strapped around their calves and thighs and some hidden in their shoes.
When questioned about the nature of the substance found to be concealed on their persons, Tse, who did not respond initially said eventually that it was `Pak Fun` which we are told is the Cantonese phrase for `white powder`, which in turn is commonly understood to be heroin by people familiar with the Cantonese dialect and by people in Hong Kong.
An issue was raised and contested with some vigour as to whether Tse uttered the phrase `Pak Fun`. Counsel contended that Tse did not utter those words and that in any event, those words did not bear the meaning ascribed to them.We will return to that issue, whether such an utterance was made and if so, the purport and meaning of that particular phrase. Cheuk`s reply when asked about the substance discovered under her clothes was a simple `don`t know`.
Evidence given by Dr Saw Chwee Guan (PW3), a scientific officer from the Department of Scientific Services, was that the white substance seized from Tse contained 2,178g of diamorphine and the substance seized from Cheuk contained 2,190.3g of diamorphine. The nature of the substance and the quantity ascertained by Dr Saw were not in any manner challenged.
Senior Narcotics Officer Teo Chin Seng (PW25) who was the investigating officer in this case took over the investigations shortly after 8pm on 28 February 1989. After he had completed the routine including the labelling and securing of the substance seized, he proceeded to take statements from Tse and Cheuk in the early hours of 1 March 1989 between 2.25am and 3am. Charges under s 7 read with s 33 of the Act were read over to Tse and Cheuk. Both of them, pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) gave statements. The statement of Tse reads thus: 
 
... I owed a moneylender known as `David` HK$30,000. `David` told me to bring something from Phuket to Holland and that he would not collect from me the HK$30,000 and in addition would pay me another HK$20,000. `David` did not tell me that it was heroin. I then agreed to bring something from Phuket to Holland.

Cheuk also gave a statement as follows: 
 
... My boyfriend `Fei Chye` owed a moneylender some money. He told me to accompany him to Thailand and if he did not go, he would be chopped to death by the moneylender. Later, `Fei Chye` was found not suitable for the trip because his body and thighs were too fat. The moneylender then told `Fei Chye` that he had found another partner who would accompany me to Thailand. By going for this trip, `Fei Chye` did not have to pay back the loan to the moneylender.
 
 
 
On 23 February 1989 at Hong Kong Airport, I was introduced to another male Chinese known as `Tse Po Chung`. I was also told to accompany him to Thailand on the same flight. On 27 February 1989 we went to Phuket and on 28 February 1989 morning, a man unknown to me came to our hotel room and strapped something on both legs of myself and `Tse Po Chung`. This man never told us that it was heroin.
From Phuket, we flew to Singapore to connect another flight to Holland. We were then arrested at Singapore Airport.

Q: Do you know the moneylender`s identity and his whereabout? 
A: I do not know. 
Q: Is `Tse Po Chung` the one who was arrested together with you at Singapore Airport? 
A: Yes.

These two statements were tendered by the defence during the cross-examination of the investigating officer and were admitted as part of the defence. The statement of Tse was a mixed one whereas Cheuk`s statement was largely exculpatory. There was no suggestion nor any submission by defence counsel that those statements were given under threat, inducement or promise.
As regards the alleged utterance of the words `Pak Fun` by Tse to the customs officers, an objection was taken by counsel for Tse. Counsel made it known that his instructions were that Tse never mentioned the Cantonese phrase `Pak Fun` to any of the customs officers as alleged. It was also contended by counsel that the phrase `Pak Fun` did not necessarily mean heroin. The sole issue based on counsel`s submission was whether such an utterance was made.
Since the voluntariness of the statement was not in issue, we held that it was not necessary for us to hold a trial-within-a-trial. Support for our view could be found from the observations of Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
Seeraj Ajodha & Ors v The State
 
[1982] AC 204
 (an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from the decision of the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago) where at p 222D-E he said: 
 
For example, if the prosecution rely upon oral statements, the defence case is simply that the interview never took place or that the incriminating answers were never given ... . In this situation no issue as to voluntariness can arise and hence no question of admissibility falls for the judge`s decision. The issue of fact whether or not the statement was made by the accused is purely for the jury.
 
 
 
In the case before us, in deciding the issue of fact whether Tse did or did not utter those allegedly damning words `Pak Fun`, we reminded ourselves of the test in 
 Haw Tua Tau v P 
 
P
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  that, as deciders of fact, we must suspend our judgment as to the truth or otherwise of the prosecution`s evidence until we have heard the whole evidence. The only evidence we had heard at that stage was the evidence of the customs officers who claimed that Tse did indeed mention the phrase `Pak Fun`. Further, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses including DSP Ng suggested that the word `Pak Fun` is synonymous with `heroin` for people familiar with the Cantonese dialect and people in Hong Kong.
When the prosecution closed its case, counsel for both accused opted not to make any submission.
Having considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution and having addressed our minds to the issue whether the prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the accused, we called upon both accused to enter upon their defences. The two courses open to them were explained to them. Tse chose to remain silent whereas Cheuk elected to give evidence.
In her evidence, Cheuk said that she did not know that she was carrying diamorphine. She was under the impression that what she was carrying was gold jewellery. She said that her boyfriend, Fei Chye, owed someone some money and he was scheduled to go overseas to carry some goods. But he was found unsuitable and therefore on his behalf and persuasion, she took his place at the last minute and went to Thailand with Tse. Tse was a person whom she did not at that stage know well. Her evidence was to the effect that persons unfamiliar to her strapped some items onto her person in a hotel room and she boarded a plane thinking that she was carrying gold jewellery. Her evidence was that she did not know and was unaware when she took the flight out of Thailand that she was going to arrive in Singapore.
In his final submission on behalf of Tse, counsel submitted that Tse did not intend to import into Singapore the drugs seized from him at the Singapore Airport and that he did not know what he was carrying was diamorphine. It was submitted to us that whatever was found in Tse`s possession was intended for delivery outside Singapore. He was, we were told, in Singapore only on transit en route to Amsterdam. Counsel submitted that the prosecution had not satisfied the necessary ingredients of the charge preferred against Tse; in particular, it had failed to prove that Tse intentionally imported into Singapore the said 2,178g of diamorphine. Counsel also urged the court to reject the prosecution evidence that Tse mentioned to them when he was apprehended that what he was carrying was `Pak Fun`.
The submission on behalf of Cheuk was similar. It was submitted to us that she did not intend to import the drugs into Singapore and that what she was carrying was meant for delivery elsewhere and so long as she did not cross the immigration control at the airport, an offence of importing into Singapore under s 7 of the Act was not made out. Counsel submitted that her explanation that she did not know what she was carrying must be accepted as it was consistent with the s 122(6) statement she made to the investigating officer. It was put to us that she was in fact an innocent pawn who undertook this assignment of carrying the goods, believed by her to be gold jewellery, to assist her boyfriend who was in some mortal fear. It was also suggested that Cheuk did not know that she would be landing in Singapore.
In our view, the prosecution had proved that the accused persons had the quantities of diamorphine specified in the charge strapped to their calves and thighs and hidden in their shoes when apprehended at the Changi Airport on that day. There was no dispute concerning the nature or quantity of the drug, ie the diamorphine seized.
Various authorities were cited particularly in relation to the meaning of the word `import`. We heard substantially similar arguments in the case of 
 PP v Ng Kwok Chun & Ano 
 
r
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 877
  where we held that the word `import` as occurs in s 7 of the Act must include the bringing in of any merchandise from a foreign country for sale or use in Singapore as well as for transhipment or distribution overseas. For the reasons we have given in 
PP v Ng Kwok Chun & Anor
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 877
  we held that bringing drugs from elsewhere into Singapore albeit into the transit lounge of the Singapore Airport with a view only to proceeding to another destination would fall within the scope and ambit of the word `import` as used in s 7 of the Act.
The next issue is the defence of lack of knowledge on the part of the accused. It was contended by counsel for both accused that Tse and Cheuk did not know that they were carrying diamorphine on their bodies. As respects Tse, he chose not to give evidence in his defence and therefore what we had before us was only the evidence of the prosecution and the statement made by Tse under s 122(6) of the CPC.
The conscious choice of Tse in electing to remain silent did not assist his defence in any manner or form. On the contrary, such a silence on his part gives rise to an inference that he knew or ought to have known that the substance he was carrying was drugs.
As to the contention that he did not utter the words `Pak Fun`, again in the absence of his evidence, we are left with only the evidence of the prosecution that Tse did make that statement and the phrase `Pak Fun` meant `white powder` which in turn denoted heroin. Tse did not avail himself of the opportunity to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution evidence. We accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that when questioned about the nature of the substance found on him, Tse had said `Pak Fun`. We also accepted that the words `Pak Fun` in the Cantonese dialect denotes heroin.
As to the exculpatory parts of the mixed statement of Tse, we would like to add that it is settled law now that where a mixed statement is under consideration, the method most likely to produce a just result is to juxtapose the incriminating parts with parts that contain the explanations and excuses and proceed to consider where the truth lies. (See 
 Chan Kim Choi v P 
 
P
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  and the other cases referred to in the judgment.) With the above principle in the foreground, we scrutinized the exculpatory parts but came to the conclusion that the explanation by Tse that he did not know what he was carrying could not be the truth.
As to the defence of Cheuk, we considered extremely carefully the likelihood of her not knowing the contents of what she was carrying. Our conclusion at the end that the explanation given by her in her oral testimony and in her s 122(6) statement was simply not credible. Though she appeared somewhat tentative and inadequate in the witness box, we had no doubt that she was not that feeble-minded not to know that she was carrying drugs. It must have been apparent to her that the white powdery substance wrapped in cellophane paper secured by elastic guards around her calves and thighs could not, by any stretch of imagination, be gold jewellery.
The other aspect of her evidence was that she did not know she would be arriving in Singapore until she landed at Changi Airport. In this respect, it was her evidence that her plane tickets were kept throughout the journey from Hong Kong by Tse. This aspect of Cheuk`s evidence again is disbelieved by us as we had little doubt that she knew that she was going to arrive in Singapore. Her evidence that she did not make inquiries or ask her travelling companion, Tse, the next destination, is a concoction.
We found hardly anything to raise a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of both accused persons. It is our finding that they knew they were carrying drugs (which on analysis proved to be diamorphine of a huge proportion) and they knew that they were going to arrive in Singapore and in those circumstances, we are satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
We therefore found them guilty as charged and imposed the only penalty applicable in this case, ie the death penalty.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In April 1988, a request to take the evidence of certain persons with addresses in Singapore for use in criminal proceedings in the local court of New South Wales exercising federal jurisdiction, was received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore from its counterpart in Australia. The letter of request was eventually referred to the then Minister for Law, Mr EW Barker.
On 23 May 1988, the Minister for Law, in purported exercise of his power under s 43(1) of the Extradition Act (Cap 103) (`the Act`), issued a notice to the senior district judge purporting to authorize the senior district judge `or such other District Judge or Magistrate as you may nominate` to take the evidence as requested. The district judge nominated Mr Francis Tseng, a district judge, as the magistrate to take the evidence.
The respondents, who were defendants in the New South Wales criminal proceedings, challenged the authorization of the Minister for Law. They applied by Originating Motion No 132 of 1988 in the High Court for an order of certiorari to quash the authorization. On 15 May 1989, Chan Sek Keong J, in a carefully reasoned reserved judgment, allowed the respondents` application (see 
 Re Letter of Request from the Court of New South Wales for the Prosecution of Peter Bazos (Deposition Proceedings) 
 
 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 408
  ). From this judgment, the Attorney General, who was the respondent in the motion proceedings, appealed.
Section 43(1) of the Act provides as follows: 
 
The Minister may, by notice in writing, authorise a Magistrate to take evidence for the purposes of a criminal matter pending in a court or tribunal of a foreign State other than a matter relating to an offence that is, by its nature or by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed, an offence of a political character.
 
 
 
The issues raised in this appeal, as in the motion before Chan Sek Keong J, are: (1) whether the Minister had power to make the authorization under s 43(1) of the Act; and (2) if he did, whether he exceeded his power by reason of delegating the exercise of it to the senior district judge.
The short point that we have to consider in relation to the first issue is whether Australia is a `foreign state` for the purpose of s 43(1) of the Act. This is primarily a matter of construction of the Act as a whole and of this particular provision in the context of the Act.
 The scheme of the Extradition Act
The Act, which came into force on 1 August 1968, principally deals with the extradition of fugitive offenders. It is divided into five parts. Part I deals with definitions and general matters. Parts II and III deal with extradition to and from foreign states. Part IV deals with extradition to and from declared Commonwealth countries. Part V deals with extradition to and from Malaysia. Part VI provides for miscellaneous matters. It is in Pt VI that s 43 is found.
 Definitions
Section 2 provides that unless the context otherwise requires: 
 
`foreign State` means a foreign State between which and Singapore an extradition treaty is in force;
 
 
 
`extradition treaty` means a treaty or agreement made by Singapore with a foreign State relating to the extradition of fugitives, and includes any treaty or agreement relating to the extradition of fugitives made before 9th August 1965 which extends to, and is binding on, Singapore;
 
 
 
`declared Commonwealth country` means a country declared to be a Commonwealth country in relation to which Part IV applies.
 
 
 
It is accepted that Australia is a declared Commonwealth country for the purpose of Pt IV relating to the extradition of fugitives to and from declared Commonwealth countries. It is contended for the appellant that, nevertheless, Australia is a `foreign state` for the purpose of the evidence-taking provisions of Pt VI.
 Appellant`s arguments
The argument for the appellant consists of two alternative parts. Firstly, state counsel says that the words `foreign State` in s 43(1) should be given what he calls its natural meaning, and that means any sovereign state other than Singapore. Alternatively, referring to the definition of `foreign State` in s 2, he says that if any state has an extradition treaty in force with Singapore, it is a `foreign State`. Australia is such a state, he submits, because there are extradition arrangements between Australia and Singapore which amount to an extradition treaty between the two countries. A country, according to him, can be both a declared Commonwealth country and a foreign state at the same time for different purposes of the Act.
 First part of appellant`s argument
In regard to the first part of the argument, state counsel makes the following submissions. Firstly, state counsel says that the definition of `foreign State` in s 2 is in terms subject to context. Counsel analyses the provisions of the Act governing the extradition to and from `foreign States` on the one hand, and to and from `declared Commonwealth countries` on the other. He says that extradition to a foreign state is based on an antecedent bilateral arrangement with the state concerned, whereas extradition to a declared Commonwealth country is based on the less stringent requirements of the Commonwealth scheme for the rendition of fugitive offenders agreed by Law Ministers of the Commonwealth at their meeting in London in 1966 (`the Commonwealth scheme`). It is absurd, he says, to interpret s 43 in such a way that assistance is given to non-Commonwealth countries, with respect to which the requirements for extradition are more stringent, while being denied to Commonwealth countries. This, he says, could not have been the intention of Parliament when enacting s 43.
Secondly, state counsel says that it is significant that s 43 is found in Pt VI of the Act, and not Pt II, which deals with extradition to foreign states. If the intention was that its provisions were to apply exclusively to `foreign states` covered by the provisions of Pt II, the section should properly have been enacted as a provision in that part of the Act.
Thirdly, state counsel says that the Act is a consolidating Act, derived from separate sets of enactments. He refers to the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 and the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966, both Australian statutes, as the source for the extradition provisions of the Act, and he refers to certain Imperial legislation relating to the taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings abroad as the source for the provisions of s 43. He submits that different meanings may properly be attributed to the same words `foreign State` in different parts of the Act because of their different origins. In such cases, he submits, the earlier enactments are relevant to the construction of the provisions concerned. State counsel cites the case of 
R v Burt, ex p Presburg

State counsel submits that the words `foreign State` in s 43 should be given a wider meaning than the same words in those parts of the Act dealing with extradition. In the Imperial legislation from which s 43 is derived, `foreign states` referred to states other than `British possessions`. Substituting Singapore for `British possessions`, counsel says it follows that `foreign State` in s 43 must mean any sovereign state other than Singapore.
 Second part of appellant`s argument
The second alternative part of the argument of state counsel is this. Section 2 defines a `foreign State` as a foreign state with which Singapore has an extradition treaty in force. State counsel submits that if a state has an extradition treaty in force with Singapore, it is by definition a `foreign State`. Granted that Australia is a declared Commonwealth country, that does not, he says, prevent it from being a foreign state for the purpose of s 43 if, as he contends is the case, the extradition arrangements between Singapore and Australia in pursuance of the Commonwealth scheme amount to an `extradition treaty` within the meaning of that term in the Act.
State counsel devotes the rest of his written submission to an extensive discourse on the question whether there were extradition arrangements between Australia and Singapore as a result of the implementation of the Commonwealth scheme, and whether these amount to an `extradition treaty`. In view of the conclusions which we have come to, it is necessary for us only to state the gist of some of his submissions, without being exhaustive. State counsel refers to the definition of `extradition treaty` in s 2 as `a treaty or agreement made by Singapore with a foreign State relating to the extradition of fugitives`. He draws on a wealth of bibliographical sources, including works on public international law, case law, and the travaux preparatoires of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. He relies also on the Commonwealth scheme and the communique issued by the ministers at the end of their meeting in London in 1966, to show that there was an agreement among the countries, including Singapore and Australia, taking part in that meeting.
State counsel concedes that there is no formal extradition treaty or agreement between Singapore and Australia. But he submits that a treaty need not be in any particular written form. The mutual consent of the parties to be bound can even arise from conduct. In the case of Australia and Singapore, in relation to the matter of extradition between the two countries, something tantamount to a treaty was brought into being by the two parties subscribing to the Commonwealth scheme, and by their enacting parallel legislation and each declaring the other to be a country to which their respective legislation was made applicable.
Since there is thus an extradition treaty or agreement between Australia and Singapore, Australia, by definition, it is argued, is a foreign state for the purpose of s 43.
 Our views
We are of the view that Australia, having been declared a Commonwealth country to which Pt IV of the Act (relating to extradition to and from Commonwealth countries) applies, is incapable of being considered a `foreign state` for the purpose of s 43, any more than it could be considered a foreign state for the purpose of any other provisions of the Act. Consistent with the simplicity of the structure of the Act, our reasons are short and simple ones. They are as follows.
Firstly, the Act has evolved from certain Imperial statutes made applicable to Singapore when Singapore was a colony. It is a modern adaptation of the regime provided by these Imperial statutes for extradition and return of fugitive offenders and, incidentally, taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings pending overseas. The historical position is correctly analysed by Chan Sek Keong J in his judgment, and it is not necessary for us to repeat it here.
In the vocabulary of the draftsmen of the Imperial statutes, a clear distinction was made between `foreign states` on the one hand and `British possessions` and `Her Majesty`s dominions` on the other. That structural distinction is retained in the Act, although modern terminology is now used. The term `foreign State` is used throughout the Act, including in sections within Pt VI immediately preceding s 43, in contradistinction to a `declared Commonwealth country`, just as it was used in contradistinction to `British possessions` and `Her Majesty`s dominions` by draftsmen of the Imperial statutes. There is no basis, in our view, for the suggestion that `foreign state` in any part of the Act could mean simply any sovereign state outside Singapore, whether Commonwealth or foreign, any more than a `foreign state` under the Imperial statutes could have meant any country outside any one of the component parts of `Her Majesty`s dominions` as opposed to the dominions as a whole. It is, of course, conceivable that in an Act where the expression `foreign state` is used in contradistinction to Singapore, a `foreign state` may well mean any sovereign state outside Singapore. However, where, as in this Act, the expression is used throughout in contrast to a Commonwealth country, we can see no room for such a suggestion.
Secondly, the dichotomy between foreign states and Commonwealth countries is found not only in the Act but also in other legislation, particularly those providing for judicial co-operation. See, for example, the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264) and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Cap 265).
What is the Commonwealth? The learned editors of 6 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) at para 801 provide an answer as good as any other. They say: 
 
The term `the Commonwealth` ordinarily signifies ... the voluntary association of independent sovereign states which are recognized by each other as associated for purposes of consultation and co-operation, and which recognize the Queen as the symbol of their free association and as such the Head of the Commonwealth ...`.
 
 
 
For the purpose of our domestic law, which the courts have to administer, something more definite is required. The Interpretation Act (Cap 1) defines a Commonwealth country simply as `any country recognised by the President as a Commonwealth country`. The recognition of the status of a country as a Commonwealth country on the intra-Commonwealth level, and in our municipal law for general legislative purposes, must imply with it a degree of permanency, stability and consistency. It would be most inconvenient, unless the context clearly compels such a course, to treat a country as a Commonwealth country for the purpose of one Act and as a foreign state, ie a non-Commonwealth country, for the purpose of another Act. It would be even more inconvenient, unless the context clearly demands it, to treat a country as a Commonwealth country for the purpose of some parts of an Act, but to treat the same country as a foreign state for the purpose of some other parts of the same Act. This would only lead to unpredictability and incoherence in the law.
Thirdly, as the definition in the Interpretation Act shows, the question of the status of a country as a Commonwealth country or otherwise is a matter for the executive; it is rarely, if ever, necessary for the courts to be concerned with the question whether a particular country is a Commonwealth country or a foreign state where such a distinction is material. In the case of the Act, the Minister for Law, acting under s 18 of the Act, declared by gazette notification that Australia is a Commonwealth country for the purpose of Pt IV of the Act. This is evidence, good enough for the courts, that Australia is recognized by the executive as a Commonwealth country, as opposed to a `foreign state`. In regard to such questions, the view of the executive must be what matters.
Our conclusion, therefore, is that s 43 does not apply to a Commonwealth country and therefore does not apply to Australia, which is a Commonwealth country. It is our view that there is no provision in the Act for the taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings pending in a Commonwealth country. That appears to be still governed by the Evidence by Commission Act of 1885 for the reasons stated by Chan Sek Keong J in his judgment.
It is significant, as pointed out by Chan Sek Keong J, that while the Act repealed the Extradition Actsof 1873 to 1935 and the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 in so far as they applied to and operated as part of the law of Singapore, the Evidence by Commission Act1885 was not mentioned in the repeal provisions. It is also significant that when the Evidence (Civil Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act 1979 was enacted, it was provided that the Evidence by Commission Act, in so far as it applied to 
 civil 
 proceedings should cease to apply to Singapore, implying therefore that that Act continues to apply in so far as it concerns 
 criminal 
 proceedings pending in territories formerly part of the British dominions.
 The `treaty` point
In the view which we take, it is not necessary for us to consider the argument put forward by state counsel that there is something tantamount to an extradition treaty or agreement between Singapore and Australia. In deference to his arguments, however, we would make the following comments.
Firstly, a state does not become a `foreign state` because it has an extradition treaty with Singapore. Rather, for the purpose of the Act, a foreign state is a `foreign state`, ie a state outside the Commonwealth, which has in force an extradition treaty with Singapore. In other words, not all foreign states are `foreign states` for the purpose of the Act; only those which have extradition treaties with Singapore qualify. The same applies to Commonwealth countries. The relevant part of the Act applies not to all Commonwealth countries, only to those subject of the Minister`s declaration under s 18.
Secondly, should a Commonwealth country, for any special reason, enter into an extradition treaty with Singapore despite the existence of the Commonwealth scheme, that Commonwealth country, in the scheme of the Act as we see it, would be declared by the Minister as a Commonwealth country to which Pt IV applies. It would not, or should not, be treated by the Minister, properly advised, as a foreign state for any purpose of the Act, although s 18 in terms enables the Minister to declare any country to be a Commonwealth country to which Pt IV applies.
Thirdly, the question whether there is an extradition treaty in force between Singapore and a particular foreign state and therefore Pt II of the Act applies in relation to that state, is, or should be, settled by the executive. This appears to be the intention of s 4, read with s 5. It is consistent with the approach adopted in the reciprocal enforcement of judgments legislation mentioned above. It is consistent also with the approach in s 3 of the Act in respect of those foreign states subject of Orders in Council made under the Extradition Acts of 1870 to 1935.
Courts should not be concerned with the question whether a treaty subsists between Singapore and any state. The sort of detailed and involved examination which the learned state counsel undertook before us ought not to be necessary at all.
Finally, in cases that are dependent on the existence of a treaty, the Act clearly contemplates a treaty or agreement in a much more structured, definite and definitive form than is allowed by state counsel in his rather adroit argument. A cursory examination of the language of s 4 bears this out. What is contemplated is an instrument entered into by properly constituted representatives of Singapore and the foreign state concerned, embodying definite and readily ascertainable terms.
The sort of instrument contemplated in s 4 is probably similar in form, but no doubt in more contemporary language, to the many treaties concluded by the United Kingdom to which effect was given by Orders in Council made under the Extradition Acts 1870-1935. A collection of such Orders in Council and treaties may be found in Vol IX of the Statutory Rules and Orders and Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom (revised to 31 December 1948).
It would take a great deal of convincing to accept the proposition that by the mere fact of taking part, albeit through a Minister, in some international conference which concludes with a consensus recommending that the participating states should take a certain course of legislative action, and by taking legislative action along the general lines agreed, a state finds itself, willy-nilly, in a treaty relationship with any, some or all of the states which participated in the conference.
 Gaps in the legislation
State counsel`s arguments lead us to the question whether, having regard to the definition of `foreign State` in s 2, a `foreign State` for the purpose of s 43 means: (a) a foreign state with which there is in force an extradition treaty, whether or not that foreign state is the subject of an Order in Council referred to in s 3 or is gazetted under s 4; or (b) a foreign state with which there is in force an extradition treaty which is the subject of an Order in Council referred to in s 3 or is gazetted under s 4. If it is the former, the possibility remains for complicated arguments of the sort which were addressed to us whether in relation to any particular country an extradition treaty or `agreement` exists or not. If it is the latter, the gazette notification or Order in Council would be conclusive.
It appears, on an examination of the Imperial statutes (particularly ss 2 and 24 of the 1870 Extradition Act, and ss 1 and 5 of the 1873 Extradition Act), that the facility for taking evidence for use in criminal proceedings pending in foreign states was available in response to requests only from those foreign states subject of Orders in Council made under s 2 of the 1870 Act. This position appears to have been altered in the Act. This is because s 43 falls in Pt VI of the Act, whereas a gazette notification under s 4 has the effect of bringing only Pt II into force in relation to a foreign state. There is thus inherent in the present wording of s 43 the potential for controversy as to the existence or otherwise of an extradition treaty between Singapore and a particular foreign state, giving rise to the sort of arguments addressed to us in this case.
A difficulty of a similar sort is inherent in Pt III (relating to the extradition froma foreign state). It is not provided that Pt III applies only to states subject of Orders in Council under the Imperial statutes or gazette notification under s 4. Applying the definition of `foreign State` in s 2, it appears that Pt III applies to foreign states with which there is in force an extradition treaty, whether or not there is an Order in Council or a gazette notification. A controversy of the kind that was raised in the instant case could also arise when extradition is sought from a foreign state in pursuance of Pt III.
The difficulty arises principally from the provision that only Pt II is brought into operation by a gazette notification under s 4 or an Order in Council referred to in s 3.
Whether a state comes within the purview of the Act or any part of it should be determined beforehand. Otherwise, a request for assistance, instead of being promptly acted upon, is liable to be mired in preliminary arguments about the applicability of the Act. This would be a most unfortunate state of affairs, but it is something which could easily be put right by appropriate amendments.
 Delegatus non potest delegare point
In the view which we have come to, it is not necessary for us to consider the second issue raised in this appeal, whether the Minister`s purported authorization was invalid on the ground that instead of authorizing a particular magistrate to take the evidence requested, he delegated that power of authorization to the senior district judge. Chan Sek Keong J, in the court below, said [at p 416]: 
 
In my view, it is unarguable that on the facts the Minister did not make the appointment but the senior district judge did, in accordance with the direction of the Minister. This is not a case of the senior district judge recommending to the Minister the district judge to be appointed to take the evidence, and of the Minister accepting the recommendation and appointing the nominee. Accordingly, the Minister did delegate his power to make the appointment, which is not permitted by law.
 
 
 
In our view, although it might with force be argued that what the Minister is, or should be, concerned with is whether a request should be acceded to, and not which magistrate is to take the evidence, the wording of sub-s (1), particularly in the light of references in sub-ss (2) and (3) to `the` magistrate, however, suggests strongly that the magistrate who is intended to take the evidence should be designated in the Minister`s authorization notice. Although administrative practice is no guide to the interpretation of statutes, it is of interest that in the few reported cases under s 5 of the Extradition Act of 1873, which may be looked upon as the predecessor of s 43, the practice conformed to this view. In these cases, although the point did not arise, the order made by the Secretary of State requiring the taking of evidence appears to have been directed to the particular magistrate who was to take the evidence. (See 
R v Lord Mayor of Cardiff, ex p Lewis
 
[1922] 2 KB 777
 and 
R v Daye
 
[1908] 2 KB 333
 )
In these circumstances, we are not prepared to say that the learned judge was wrong in coming to the decision he did. Indeed, on the wording of the section, we think he was right.
We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
These are appeals against two decisions made under different interlocutory applications in the same action, viz Suit No 1399 of 1981. As they raised related issues of law on the same facts, we heard them one immediately after the other. We now give our judgment on both appeals.
In Suit No 1399 of 81, the plaintiffs are the personal representatives of Tay Kian Ho, deceased (TKH). The defendants are Seow Teck Ming and Lim Pin. The plaintiffs are claiming damages on behalf (a) of the dependants and (b) of the estate of TKH against the defendants arising from the death of TKH in a collision between a motor sampan of 79.11 tons, belonging to the second defendant and a motor sampan (bumboat) of 12.34 tons belonging to one of the plaintiffs. The collision took place at about 7.30am on 20 May 1978 at a stretch of the Singapore River in the vicinity of the Attorney General`s Chambers.
The writ was issued on 30 April 1981, just short of three years after the collision. The statement of claim was filed on 12 February 1982. By their defence filed on 11 March 1982, the defendants denied negligence and claimed that the collision was caused solely or contributed to by TKH who was then in control of the bumboat. Directions for the trial of the action were given on 21 August 1984. Notice of trial was given on 18 September 1984 and on 11 December 1987, a date of hearing was fixed for 4 August 1988. On 20 July 1988, the solicitors for the defendants applied to discharge themselves on the ground of inability to trace the defendants. The hearing of this application was fixed for 29 July 1988.
 Defence of limitation 
Instead of proceeding with the application to discharge themselves, the defendants` solicitors took out further directions on 26 July 1988 to amend the defence to add the defence of limitation based on s 8 of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 (the MCA 1911) which, if applicable, would have barred the action upon the expiration of two years from the date of the collision. On 1 August 1988, the assistant registrar gave leave to the defendants to amend the defence. The amended defence was filed on 2 August 1988 and the reply was filed on 3 August 1988.
On 4 August 1988, the plaintiffs gave notice of appeal against the order of the assistant registrar. The appeal was heard on 15 March 1989 by Rajah J who dismissed the appeal. On 21 March 1989, the solicitors for the plaintiffs requested for further arguments. Rajah J, after hearing further arguments, changed his mind and allowed the appeal. Civil Appeal No 76 of 1989 is the defendants` appeal against the order. The manner in which the defendants` solicitors proceeded to file this appeal is a matter on which we will make some observations at the end of this judgment.
Immediately after the defendants were given leave to amend their defence to plead limitation, the plaintiffs` solicitors took out a notice of motion for an order to try the issue whether s 8 of the MCA 1911 applied to this action, and if it did, for an order that the limitation period be extended and the plaintiffs allowed to proceed with the action. This application was heard before Chao Hick Tin JC on 4 August 1988 and 11 October 1988. Judgment was given on 14 February 1989, before Rajah J heard the appeal against the assistant registrar`s de. His Honour held that s 8 of the MCA 1911 applied to the action. He also refused leave to extend time. Civil Appeal No 18 of 1989 is the plaintiffs` apagainst this decision.
 Civil Appeal No 18 of 1989 - application of the MCA 1911 
The MCA 1911 is an imperial legislation enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament. It came into force on 16 December 1911 and pursuant to s 9 thereof, its application was on 1 February 1913 extended to the Straits Settlements as part of His Majesty`s dominions. In his grounds of judgment, Chao Hick Tin JC held that the MCA 1911 was still part of the law of Singapore as it had not been repealed by any local legislation. Counsel for the plaintiffs has not argued against this finding. In our view, the finding was undoubtedly correct. Section 4 of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54), which came into force on 1 March 1954, was enacted on the basis that the MCA 1911 was part of the law of Singapore then. When Singapore became independent, first as a constituent state of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 and then on 9 August 1965 as a sovereign republic, the MCA 1911 continued as part of the laws of Singapore under the relevant constitution: see 
 Butterworth & Co (Publishers) Ltd & Ors 
 
 v 
 
 Ng Sui Nam 
 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 196
 , affirmed by the Court of Appeal (
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 5
 ).
 Scope of the MCA 1911 
Counsel for the plaintiffs has raised two arguments on the scope of the MCA 1911. The first is that the MCA 1911 does not apply to common law negligence actions but only to admiralty actions in rem or in personam. He relies on the historical source of the MCA 1911 and also s 5 in support of this argument. Section 5 provides as follows: 
 
Any enactment which confers on any court Admiralty jurisdiction in respect of damage shall have effect as though references to such damage included references to damages for loss of life or personal injury, and accordingly proceedings in respect of such damages may be brought in rem or in personam.
 
 
 
On this basis, counsel maintains that as the present action was brought as a common law action, it was not subject to the limitation period of two years as provided in s 8 of the MCA 1911 but to the ordinary limitation period of six years under the Limitation Act (Cap 10, 1970 Ed) (as it stood in 1981).
We are unable to accept this submission. We are of the view that the MCA 1911 applies to all actions whether brought as admiralty or common law actions for the reasons following. Firstly, the MCA 1911 makes no distinction between admiralty actions and common law actions. Section 9(3) thereof provides that it applies to all cases heard and determined 
 in any court having jurisdiction to deal with the case 
 and in whatever waters the damage or loss in question was caused. This action was brought on the basis that the High Court has jurisdiction. Secondly, if it were necessary to refer to the terms of the Brussels Convention 1910 (the Convention), which was an international agreement, pursuant to which the MCA 1911 was enacted, one would not find nor expect to find in them any distinction between the two forms of curial proceedings simply because they are peculiar to the English judicial system. Moreover, as art 1 of the Convention expressly refers to collisions between vessels `in whatever waters the collision takes place`, any municipal legislation giving effect to the Convention would be made applicable to such collisions. In the present case, it has not been argued that the tidal part of the Singapore River (where the collision occurred) is not part of the `waters` of Singapore. Thirdly, in 
 The Vadne 
[1959] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 480, Lord Merriman P said that he had not the slightest doubt that the MCA 1911 would have been applicable even if the writ in that case had been issued in the Queen Bench`s Division.
The second point raised by counsel for the plaintiffs is that the MCA 1911 should be construed to apply only to collisions between sea-going vessels or between sea-going vessels and vessels of inland navigation, as that was the ambit of the Convention pursuant to which the MCA 1911 was enacted.
 The Brussels Convention 1910 - collisions between vessels 
Counsel has referred to the following articles of the Convention: 
 
Article 1. Where a collision occurs between 
 sea-going vessels or between sea-going vessels and vessels of inland navigation
, the compensations due for damages caused to the vessels, or to any things or persons on board thereof, shall be settled in accordance with the following provisions, 
 in whatever waters the collision takes place
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Article 4. If two or more vessels are in fault the liability of each vessel is in proportion to the degree of the faults respectively committed. Provided that if, having regard to the circumstances, it is not possible to establish the degree of the respective faults, or if it appears that the faults are equal, the liability is apportioned equally.
 
 
 
...
In respect of damages caused by death or personal injuries, the vessels in fault are jointly as well as severally liable to third parties, without prejudice however to the right of the vessel which has paid a larger part than that which, in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of this Article, she ought ultimately to bear, to obtain a contribution from the other vessel or vessels in fault.
It is left to the law of each country to determine, as regards such right to obtain contribution, the meaning and effect of any contract or provision of law which limits the liability of the owners of a vessel towards persons on board. 
 
Article 12. The provisions of this Convention shall be applied as regards all persons interested when all the vessels concerned in any action belong to States of the High Contracting Parties, and in any other cases for which the national laws provide.
 
 
 
Provided always that -
 
 
 
 
(1) As regards persons interested who belong to a non-contracting State, the application of the above provisions may be made by each of the contracting States conditional upon reciprocity. 
 
(2) Where all the persons interested belong to the same State as the court trying the case, the provisions of the national law and not of the Convention are applicable.
  
 
 
We agree with counsel that the Convention was intended to apply only to collisions between (1) sea-going vessels and (2) between sea-going vessels and vessels of inland navigation. It was not intended to apply to collisions between vessels of inland navigation, which were matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of each state.
 The MCA 1911 
As we have stated earlier, the MCA 1911 was enacted to give effect to the Convention. For the purpose of this appeal, the relevant sections of the MCA 1911 are ss 1(1), 2, 8, 9 and 10 which provide as follows: 
 
1(1) Where, by the fault of two or more vessels, damage or loss is caused to one or more of those vessels, to their cargoes or freight, or to any property on board, the liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault: ...
 
 
 
[Proviso not relevant]
 
 
 
2 Where loss of life or personal injuries are suffered by any person on board a vessel owing to the fault of that vessel and of any other vessel or vessels, the liability of the owners of the vessels shall be joint and several: ...
 
 
 
8 No action shall be maintained to enforce any claim or lien against a vessel or her owners in respect of any damage or loss to another vessel, her cargo or freight, or any property on board her, or damages for loss of life or personal injuries suffered by any person on board her, caused by the fault of the former vessel, whether such vessel be wholly or partly in fault, or in respect of any salvage services, unless proceedings therein are commenced within two years from the date when the damage or loss or injury was caused or the salvage services were rendered, and an action shall not be maintainable under this Act to enforce any contribution in respect of an overpaid proportion of any damages for loss of life or personal injuries unless proceedings therein are commenced within one year from the date of payment:
 
 
 
Provided that any court having jurisdiction to deal with an action to which this section relates may, in accordance with the rules of court, extend any such period, to such extent and on such conditions as it thinks fit, and shall, if satisfied that there has not during such period been any reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant vessel within the jurisdiction of the court, or within the territorial waters of the country to which the plaintiff`s ship belongs or in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business, extend any such period to an extent sufficient to give such reasonable opportunity.
 
 
 
9(1) This Act shall extend throughout His Majesty`s Dominions.
 
 
 
 
(3) The provisions of this Act shall be applied in all cases heard and determined in any court having jurisdiction to deal with the case and in whatever waters the damage or loss in question was caused. ...
  
 
 
10 This Act may be cited as the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 and shall be construed as one with the Merchant Shipping Acts 1894 to 1907.
 
 
 
 
 
 The Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (the MSA 1894) 
 
 
 
Section 742 of the MSA 1894 defines, inter alia, the expressions, `ship` and `vessel`, as follows, unless the context otherwise requires: 
 
`Ship` includes every description of vessel used in navigation and not propelled by oars;
 
 
 
`Vessel` includes any ship or boat, or any other description of vessel 
 used in navigation not propelled by oars

 Edwards v Quickenden & Forester 
 [1939] P 261 where there was a collision between a single-oared skiff and a racing eight in the Thames River, Henn Collins J held that by virtue of the said definitions in the MSA 1894, the said crafts, being propelled by oars, were not vessels within the meaning of the MCA 1911. Therefore, all vessels propelled by anything other than by oars are vessels for the purpose of the MCA 1911, whether they are sea-going vessels or vessels of inland navigation. Sailing ships would be vessels for this purpose. There is nothing in the context of each ss 1, 2 and 9 and of the MCA 1911 which requires the meaning of vessel to be modified. It must follow that the motor boats belonging to the parties in the present case are vessels under the MCA 1911, notwithstanding that they were only licensed to ply within the port limits of Singapore.
Counsel for the plaintiffs however argues that notwithstanding the effect of the statutory definition, the MCA 1911 should only be applied to collisions between the categories of vessels as set out in art 1 of the Convention. This argument is based on the premise that the MCA 1911 does not conform to the Convention in this respect and therefore, it is necessary for the court to construe the statute to conform to the Convention. Counsel cited the following authorities: 
 Ellerman Lines Ltd v Murray 
 
[1931] AC 126
; 
 Stag Line Ltd v Foscolo, Mango & Co Ltd 
 
[1932] AC 328
; 
 Salomon v Commissioners of Customs & Excise 
 
[1967] 2 QB 116
; 
 Post Office v Estuary Radio Ltd

[1968] P 341;

 Fothergill v Monarch Airlines Ltd 
 [1980] 2 All ER 696; 
 The Sandrina 
 [1985] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 181; [1985] 1 All ER 129. In 
 Salomon 
 `s case, Diplock LJ (at p 143) formulated the rule as follows: 
 
... there is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does not intend to act in breach of international law, including therein specific treaty obligations; and if one of the meanings which can reasonably be ascribed to the legislation is consonant with the treaty obligations and another and others are not, the meaning which is consonant is to be preferred.
 
 
 
This submission cannot be accepted. There is no conflict whatever between the MCA 1911 and the Convention with respect to their respective scopes of application. The construction that the MCA 1911 applies to collisions between motor boats, whether or not they are sea-going vessels, does not render it in conflict with the Convention. It simply means that the scope of the MCA 1911 is wider than that of the Convention. The MCA 1911 was consonant with the international obligations of the United Kingdom Parliament. Accordingly, there is no room for the rule of construction relied upon by counsel for the plaintiffs. It does not apply. In any event, it is settled law that the duty of the court is to give effect to a national law and not international law if there were a real conflict between them. In the case of the MCA 1911, there is contextual evidence to suggest that the UK Parliament had intended the MCA 1911 to have a wider scope than the Convention by the deliberate omission to re-enact art 1 of the Convention as part of the MCA 1911 and by the express direction that the statute be construed as one with the Merchant Shipping Acts.
The questions that has to be considered next is whether the motor boats in the present case were used in navigation. In 
 Weeks v Ross 
[1913] 2 KB 229
, a motor boat was used for carrying more than 12 passengers from Exeter along the River Exe for half a mile and for a further mile along a canal to the first lock, returning thence to Exeter. Below that lock the canal continued for two miles, through other locks, to the estuary of the river, and it was used by seagoing ships for the purpose of going to and from Exeter. The court (of three judges) held that the motor boat was `used in navigation` within the meaning of s 742 of the MSA 1894. Bray J in his judgment said:
A river is a place for navigation and a canal is a place for navigation, and they are none the less places for navigation because as it happens this vessel only used a portion of them.
We have no doubt that the Singapore River was and is a place for navigation and that the two motor boats were being used for navigation on the Singapore River at the time of the collision. No distinction can be made between inland waters and the sea for this purpose.
We must therefore conclude that s 8 of the MCA 1911 applies in this action and that the plaintiffs` cause of action was barred upon the expiration of two years from the date of the collision.
Before we leave this issue, we should like to observe that the MSA 1894 was never applied directly to the Straits Settlements as part of their law, although parts of it were re-enacted by local legislation from time to time. The current Singapore statute on merchant shipping, the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179), was a consolidating and amending O rdinance first enacted as Ordinance No 3 of 1910. As then enacted, it provided the same definition for the expressions `ship` and `vessel` as were provided in s 742 of the MSA 1894. Since then, Cap 179 has been amended on many occasions and the current definition of `vessel` is as follows: 
 
`vessel` includes any ship or boat or air cushioned vehicle or floating rig or platform used in any form of operations at sea or any other description of vessel.
 
 
 
The words `not propelled by oars` have been omitted, and the result is that if the MCA 1911 were read as one with Cap 179, collisions between rowing boats on the Singapore river or its coastal waters would be within the MCA 1911. However, this is not the law as s 10 of the MCA 1911 does not require the statute to be read with Cap 179 but with the MSA 1894.
 Extension of time 
We now turn to the appeal against Chao Hick Tin JC`s decision refusing the plaintiffs an extension of the limitation period. Chao Hick Tin JC held that the plaintiffs had not shown `substantial grounds or good reasons justifying the late issue of the writ`. He agreed that although the proviso to s 8 gave `the widest possible discretion to the court` (per Sir E Pollock MR in 
 The Arraiz 
 [1924] Ll L Rep 382; (1924) 132 LT 715), he decided that it was a discretion which should `only be used in favour of the plaintiff if there are special circumstances which create a real reason why the statutory limitation should not take effect` (per Hill J in 
 The Llandovery Castle 
 [1920] P 119 at p 125). Chao Hick Tin JC also considered the following decisions: (1) 
 The Kashmir 
 [1923] P 85 where the Court of Appeal refused to interfere with Hill J`s refusal of extension of time, the delay being more than four years; (2) 
 The Alnwick 
 [1965] 1 All ER 423 where extension of time was granted to the plaintiff to add the second defendant as a party after the first defendant filed a belated defence seeking to throw the blame on the second defendant; (3) 
 The Owenbawn 
 [1973] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 56 where the court renewed a writ on the finding that the correspondence between the parties evidenced an agreement between them that the writ should be deferred so long as negotiations were continuing; (4) 
 The Albany 
 [1983] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 195 where the court did not consider the negotiations between the parties as a sufficient reason to extend time. In that case, the delay exceeded a year.
On the basis of these decisions, Chao Hick Tin JC appeared to have held that any negotiations, to qualify as a sufficient reason, must induce the party into withholding action. He found that in the present case, the negotiations between the parties had not lulled the plaintiffs into not issuing the writ in time. On the evidence before him, this finding must be correct as the delay was, as admitted by counsel for the plaintiffs, caused by either ignorance or oversight of the MCA 1911. For this reason, the only material pre-writ consideration before Chao Hick Tin JC was whether ignorance or an oversight of the MCA 1911 was a good reason for extending time. He held it was not.
Counsel for the plaintiffs has contended that Chao Hick Tin JC was wrong in so holding as he had applied the test of `substantial grounds` or `special reasons`, which was more stringent than was required under the law. Counsel referred us to two recent English cases on s 8 of the MCA 1911 which were decided after Chao Hick Tin JC`s decision. In 
 The Zirje 
[1989] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 493, Sheen J, after reviewing the previous decisions on the point, said, at p 497: 
 
... in the light of the speech of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook [in 
 Waddon v Whitecroft Scovell Ltd
 
[1988] 1 WLR 309
, concerning the exercise of discretion to renew the validity of a writ under O 6 r 8], and by parity of reasoning, a judge who is invited to extend the time limit set by s 8 of the Maritime Conventions Act 1911 should grant an extension if in all the circumstances of the case it appears to him that there is good reason for doing so. The exercise of his discretion to extend time should not be confined only to those cases where there appear to be exceptional or special circumstances.
 
 
 
In 
 The Seaspeed America 
 [1990] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 150, Sheen J again said, at p 153: 
 
Parliament has not defined or sought to limit the circumstances in which or the extent to which the court may extend the time limit. Parliament has left those matters to the court and has given the court power to impose conditions. As Lord Brandon of Oakbrook said in 
 The Myrto (No 3)
 
[1987] AC 597
 at p622, it is not possible to define or circumscribe the scope of the expression `good reason`. Whether there is or is not good reason in any particular case must depend on all the circumstances of that case.
 
 
 
We accept the test formulated by Sheen J for the reasons given by him. Whether or not an extension of time ought to be granted depends on the circumstances of each case; they need not be exceptional or special. In the instant case, the circumstance was ignorance or oversight of either the MCA 1911 or its relevance to the claim. Although the said Act has been referred to in two local cases, viz 
 Ch`ng Kim Huat v Hamburg-Amerika-Nische Packetfahrt-Aktien Gesselschaft 
 
 
 
[1936] MLJ 171
  and 
 The Atlantic Faith 
 
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 187
  and was also specifically referred to in Cap 54, a 1954 statute dealing with contributory negligence, a perusal of these materials would not disclose their relevance to a case of a collision between two motor boats on the Singapore River. It is also common knowledge that up to 1980 the legal profession was inadequately served in the way of local legal digests and textbooks. Therefore, it was not surprising that both firms of solicitors were not aware of this imperial statute which was also not included in the 1970 edition of the revised Statutes of Singapore.
Chao Hick Tin JC did not accept ignorance or oversight of the MCA 1911 as a sufficient ground to grant an extension. He did not give any reason for so holding. We would say that as a general rule, ignorance or oversight of an applicable statute by a solicitor is no defence to a claim for negligence by his client when it leads to the claim being time-barred: 
 Fletcher & Son v Jubb, Booth & Helliwell 
 
[1920] 1 KB 275
 (where a solicitor was held negligent for overlooking the limitation period under the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893). In that case, Scrutton LJ said (at p 281): 
 
It is a question of degree and there is a borderline within which it is difficult to say whether a breach of duty has been committed ... Now it is not the duty of every solicitor to know the contents of every statute of the realm. But there are some statutes which it is his duty to know; and in these days when the defendants in so many actions are public authorities the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893, is one of those statutes.
 
 
 
In addition to the factors which we have mentioned which made the MCA 1911 inaccessible to the average solicitor, it was not so often or regular that motor boats collided with one another on the Singapore River that would have brought the MCA 1911 to mind. We think that these factors are relevant in determining whether an extension of the limitation should have been given. However, in view of what we decide later on whether the plaintiffs have been prejudiced by the conduct of the defendant, it is not necessary for us to decide whether Chao Hick Tin JC`s refusal was wrong.
Counsel for the plaintiffs has also contended that Chao Hick Tin JC exercised his discretion wrongly in refusing to take into account a crucial post-writ factor, ie the prejudice to the plaintiffs if leave to extend the limitation period is not granted. In an ordinary case where a plaintiff applies for extension of the limitation period before filing the writ or within a reasonable time thereafter in order to meet a plea of limitation, post-writ factors are not relevant to the court`s exercise of discretion under s 8 of the MCA 1911. However, the instant case is exceptional in that the defendants, at the time of Chao Hick Tin JC`s judgment, have been able to plead, by leave of the court, the defence of limitation more than seven years after the commencement of the action. In principle, the merits of the plaintiffs` application should be determined by the circumstances prevailing at the date of the application. If such circumstances show that the plaintiffs` right to recover damages from or in connection with the accidental death of TKH has been extinguished or diminished in some way, that, in our view, must be a material factor to be taken into account. Counsel for the defendants argues that as his clients are entitled to rely on the defence of limitation under the law, any prejudice that may flow from that plea should not be taken into account. In our view, this argument presupposes that a defendant may plead limitation at any time before the action is heard or disposed of. As we shall see, this is not the law.
At the date of the hearing of this appeal, Rajah J had reversed the assistant registrar`s decision allowing the defendants` application to amend the defence. Hence the defendants` appeal in CA No 76 of 1989. Accordingly, the plaintiffs` case is now put on a contingent basis, that if the defendants are now allowed to plead limitation two consequences will follow: (a) the plea will defeat the action, and (b) the plaintiffs will also be left without any cause of action for damages for negligence against their own solicitors as such proceedings are also time-barred. This prejudice would not have resulted if the defendants had pleaded limitation to the plaintiffs` action before the second limitation period had expired. Counsel for the defendants contends the delay has not prejudiced the plaintiffs for two reasons. Firstly, he says that the plaintiffs` solicitors are not liable to the plaintiffs as they have not been `grossly negligent`, citing 
 Purves v Landell 
(1845) 12 Cl & Fin 91; 8 ER 1332 and 
 Godefroy v Dalton 
(1830) 6 Bing 460; 130 ER 1357 in support of the argument. Counsel appears to be suggesting that whilst the solicitors might have been negligent, they certainly were not grossly negligent. If this is the submission, then it is wrong as, in the law of civil negligence, there is no difference between `gross negligence` and `negligence`. As Rolfe B said in 
 Wilson v Brett 
(1843) 11 M & W 115; 152 ER 737, one is the same as the other `with the addition of a vituperative epithet`. In our view, this argument is plainly inadmissible. First of all, it is a collateral issue. Secondly, the plaintiffs` solicitors are not before the court with respect to this issue. Thirdly, it is irrelevant to the point of the plaintiffs` case. The prejudice to the plaintiffs lies not in the loss of a good cause of action against the defendants but in the loss of a potentially good cause of action against their own solicitors. A successful plea of limitation by their solicitors will result in the dismissal of the plaintiffs` claim without the need for consideration of the merits of the claim. That, in our view, must constitute a material loss to the plaintiffs, who would thereby suffer injustice if leave to extend the limitation period is not granted to them.
In response to this, counsel for the defendants submits that there is no prejudice because the plaintiffs` action against their solicitors for negligence is not time-barred as they may claim in tort as well as in contract, citing 
 Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon 
 
[1976] 1 QB 801
 at p 819 (per Lord Denning MR); 
 Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd & Anor v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
 [1978] 3 All ER 571 and 
 Ross v Caunters 
 [1980] 1 Ch 297, and that whilst the claim in contract may be time-barred, the claim in tort is not as it does not arise unless damage is caused, and no damage can be caused until and unless the plaintiffs` action against the defendants is dismissed. In other words, time has not started to run. As this is also the basis of the defendants` case in CA No 76 of 1989, we propose to examine the argument in that appeal.
 CA No 76 of 1989 - application to amend defence 
The general rules which guide a court in exercising its discretion to allow an amendment to a defence 
 before 
 the trial of the action are succinctly set out in the speech of Lord Brandon in 
 Ketteman & Ors 
 v 
 Hansel Properties Ltd & Ors 
 
[1987] 1 AC 189
 at p 212 as follows: 
 
With regard to the principles on which his discretion to allow or refuse the applications to amend should be exercised, the judge referred to the notes to RSC O 20 r 5, in 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1982
 and to the authorities there cited. The effect of these authorities can, I think, be summarized in the following four propositions. First, all such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided. Secondly, amendments should be refused solely because they have been made necessary by the honest fault or mistake of the party applying for leave to make them: it is not the function of the court to punish parties for mistakes which they have made in accordance with their rights. Thirdly, however blameworthy (short of bad faith) may have been a party`s failure to plead the subject matter of a proposed amendment earlier, and however late the application for leave to make such amendment may have been, the application should, in general, be allowed, provided that allowing it will not prejudice the other party. Fourthly, there is no injustice to the other party if he can be compensated by appropriate orders as to costs.
 
 
 
In 
 Ketteman 
`s case, the House of Lords, by a majority decision, upheld the order of the lower court not to allow an application by the defence to plead limitation at the closing stages of the trial on the ground that it was too late to do so. In the present case, the application was made about a week before trial and counsel for the defendants accordingly submits that 
 Ketteman 
`s case does not apply and the defendants should be allowed to amend as there is no injustice to the plaintiffs which cannot be compensated in costs. He contends that Rajah J was wrong in finding that irreparable harm would be caused to the plaintiffs and also in relying on 
 Steward 
 v 
 North Metropolitan Tramways Co 
 as relevant to the present case. In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendants for damages for injuries suffered, occasioned by the failure of the defendants to maintain a road on which their tramway ran. Six months after the close of the pleadings, the defendants applied for leave to amend their defence by setting up a contract under s 29 of the Tramways Act 1870, whereby the liability to maintain the road was shifted to the vestry, the road authority of the district. At the time of the application, the limitation period within which the plaintiff could have sued the vestry had elapsed. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had been misled into continuing the action against the defendants and would be prejudiced if the amendment were allowed. Accordingly, they upheld the decision of the lower court not to allow the amendment.
In our view, 
 Steward 
 `s case is only an illustration of a case where injustice would be caused to the plaintiff if the defendants had been allowed to amend their defence. It was an application of the principles set out in the speech of Lord Brandon in 
 Ketteman 
`s case.
The next argument of counsel for the defendants is that limitation is a question of law and that the court must enforce it even if it is not pleaded. He says that a party is required to plead it in order to avoid surprising the other party. He relies on O 18 r 11 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and the authorities cited in para 18/11/1 of 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1988 
. This argument has no merit whatsoever. Order 18 r 8 expressly requires the defence of limitation to be pleaded. If it is not pleaded, the defence has to be amended before the court will consider the plea, and this brings us back to the application for leave to amend.
The most substantial argument raised by counsel for the defendants is that the tort of negligence is not completed unless there is damage, that up to now, the plaintiff has suffered no damage and will suffer no damage 
 unless and until 
the court grants the defendants leave to amend the defence. In 
 UBAF Ltd 
v 
 European American Banking Corp 
 
[1984] 1 QB 713
, Ackner LJ said (at p 725): 
 
To establish a cause of action [for negligence] they must establish not only a breach of duty, but that that breach of duty occasioned them damage. This is axiomatic.
 
 
 
We should add, logically, counsel should have gone further to say that the damage arises not when leave is granted but when the action is dismissed upon the ground of the procedural bar at the hearing. Counsel refers to the decisions of the House of Lords in 
 Pirelli General Cable Works Ltd 
 v 
 Oscar Faber & Partners 
 
[1983] 2 AC 1
 and 
 Ketteman 
`s case and a statement from 
 Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence 
 (8th Ed) para 3-136 which reads: 
 
Generally in negligence actions, the cause of action accrues at the time when the plaintiff actually suffers the damage, even though its consequences may not become apparent until later, and not at the date of the negligent act or omission. It is a question of fact in each case, whether actual damage has been established and, if so, when it had occurred. `Normally the injury is contemporaneous with the wrongful act but it is not necessarily so.` However, because negligence does not become actionable without proof of damage, it is only after damage has been suffered that the cause of action becomes complete and time begins to run.
 
 
 
The question when damage arises for the purpose of an action in negligence has taxed the minds of English judges since the 1960s in connection with latent injuries and defects. Because the common law principles relating to the tort of negligence have been built up on a case by case basis over a long period of time, the problems associated with latent injuries and damage which can be quantified in monetary terms for the purpose of awarding compensation do not lend themselves to solution under a comprehensive or single principle of law. The solutions have been pragmatic. In 
 Cartledge & Ors 
 v 
 E Jopling & Sons Ltd 
 
[1963] AC 758
, an industrial disease case, the House of Lords reaffirmed, albeit regretfully, the traditional doctrine that a cause of action accrued as soon as a wrongful act has caused personal injury beyond what could be regarded as negligible even when that injury was unknown to and could not be discovered by the sufferer. In 
 Pirelli 
`s case, Lord Scarman agreed (at p 19) that it was unfair and unjustifiable in principle that a cause of action should be held to accrue before it is possible to discover any injury or damage and that such a rule was harsh and absurd. So thought the Court of Appeal in 
 Sparham-Souter & Anor 
 v 
 Town & Country Developments (Essex) Ltd & Anor 
[1976] 1 QB 858
, a defective building case when it distinguished 
 Cartledge 
`s case and held that damage to the plaintiff occurred when he discovered or ought to have discovered the defect in the building and not when the defect occurred. In 
 Pirelli 
`s case, the House of Lords had to consider the problem again, this time in respect of a negligently designed factory. There were, in theory, four dates on which the House could have held that the damage had occurred for the purpose of the accrual of the cause of action in negligence: (1) the date when the design was completed; (2) the date when the f actory was completed according to the design; (3) the date when the physical damage to the building occurred; and (4) the date when the damage was discovered. Notwithstanding the harshness and absurdity of the established principle, their Lordships applied 
 Cartledge 
`s case and overruled 
 Sparham-Souter 
`s case. They chose solution (3) and suggested that the legislature should change the law. The United Kingdom Parliament enacted the Latent Damage Act 1986 to overcome the problem.
The above line of decisions has not been followed in a series of cases where the loss was purely financial or economic. A claim against professional advisers for negligence is one for financial or economic loss. In 
 Forster 
 v 
 Outred & Co 
 
[1982] 1 WLR 86
; [1982] 2 All ER 753, the Court of Appeal held that actual damage was suffered by the plaintiff as soon as she executed the mortgage on the negligent advice of her solicitors whereby her property was encumbered and she was subject to a liability which might mature into a financial loss. Dunn LJ, in his judgment at p 99 said: 
 
... I do not find the cases on physical and material damage very helpful. This is a case of economic loss ... I approach this case on the basis that it is sufficient that it is financial loss that should be foreseen, and I would hold that in cases of financial or economic loss the damage crystallizes and the cause of action is complete at the date when the plaintiff, in reliance on negligent advice, acts to his detriment.
 
 
 
 
 
 Forster 
 
 
 
`s case was referred to in the leading speech of Lord Fraser in 
 Pirelli 
but was not disapproved. It was considered and distinguished by the Court of Appeal in 
 UBAF 
`s case (which was decided on its own facts). 
 Forster 
 `s case was applied in 
 DW Moore & Co Ltd & Ors 
v 
 Ferrier & Ors 
 
[1988] 1 WLR 267
; [1988] 1 All ER 400 where the Court of Appeal, after reviewing all the relevant cases on economic loss caused by the negligence of solicitors, held that there was no presumption that on a solicitor`s advice damage occurred when the advice was acted on; that it was a question of fact in each case whether actual damage had been established and when. In that case, the solicitors drafted a restrictive covenant for the plaintiffs when they decided to take in F as a shareholder and director in 1971. F`s shareholding was increased in 1975 and a similar covenant was taken. F decided to set up his own business in 1980 when the plaintiffs discovered that the two covenants were not effective to bind F. The plaintiffs claimed damages for negligence against the solicitors in 1985. The solicitors pleaded that the action was time barred as the acts of negligence occurred in 1971 and 1975. The court agreed as the plaintiffs had received a worthless covenant rather than a valuable chose in action. The court did not accept an argument based on 
 Pirelli 
`s case. Bingham LJ, in his judgment applied the following test (at p 279): 
 
The matter may be tested. It is common ground, on the assumption that the plaintiffs` pleaded case is correct, that the defendants were in breach of contract when they negligently advised and settled documents in 1971 and 1975. A cause of action then arose. Suppose, 
 per impossible
, that the plaintiffs had sued at once and before the later difficulties with Mr Fenton arose. They would have been bound to succeed. If of opinion that the plaintiffs had suffered no damage, the judge would have awarded them nominal damages. But it seems to me plain that the judge would not have done that on these facts. He would have assessed as best he could on the available evidence the loss fairly and reasonably flowing in the usual course of things from the defendants` breach of contract, reaching a figure that might have been large or small but would not have been nominal. I think that the plaintiffs were in argument inclined to accept that. If, in a contractual claim for negligence, the court would have awarded other than nominal damages, I do not see how it can be said that an action in tort based on the same negligence would have been bound to fail for want of any damage as an essential ingredient of the cause of action.
 
 
 
 
 
 Forster 
 
`s case and 
 Ferrier 
 `s case concerned negligent advice given by solicitors and acted upon by clients. They have since been applied to negligent insurance brokers. In 
 JK Buckenham Ltd 
v 
 Iron Trade Mutual Insurance Co Ltd 
 [1990] 1 All ER 808, the defendant brokers had failed to procure effective re-insurance contracts for the plaintiffs, the contracts being voidable for non-disclosure of material facts. Counsel for the defendant argued that 
 Pirelli 
 had brought together the principles applicable to building contract cases and economic loss cases. The deputy judge, after a thorough analysis of the previous case law, accepted the solicitors` cases as constituting `a formidable body of modern authority` (at p 820) which was not affected by 
 Pirelli 
 `s case and which he was unable to distinguish from the case before him. Accordingly, he held that the cause of action against the defendant accrued as soon as the contracts were executed, even though at that stage the re-insurers had not repudiated liability and were unaware of their right to do so.
This decision was followed by Evans J in 
 Islander Trucking Ltd 
v 
 Hogg Robinson & Gardner Mountain (Marine) Ltd [1990] 
 All ER 826. He applied the test of commercial value to determine whether the plaintiff had suffered damage. Accordingly, he held that where a person failed to obtain a valid and effective policy of insurance as a result of a misrepresentation or non-disclosure by an insurance broker, that person suffered damage at the time when the insurance contract was executed and not when the insurers later discovered the material facts and elected to avoid the contract, since at the time of execution of the contract he had entered into a contract which was of less commercial value than that which he had engaged the broker to procure.
This court is not bound by any of the English decisions as to what the common law is in Singapore in relation to actions before us. We are free to depart from the principles laid down in the English cases if the circumstances of Singapore require. However, we do not think the local circumstances justify our departure from the principle applied in the insurance brokers` cases. In relation to the material facts, they are virtually identical to those in the present action. The negligence of the brokers lay not in giving advice but in effecting worthless insurance policies. In the present case, the negligence, if any, of the plaintiffs` solicitors lies not in giving advice or drafting a document but in commencing a worthless action. It may be argued that the action has value so long as limitation is not pleaded and only becomes worthless if and when it is pleaded, so that no damage is caused to the plaintiffs until it is pleaded. Such an agreement has been by implication rejected by the English courts. We do not think that this is the correct way to determine whether the plaintiffs have suffered damage. It was entirely foreseeable that the defendants would plead limitation. In our view, the action was worthless when commenced as it was time-barred and would only acquire some value should the defendants fail to plead limitation at all. It was entirely foreseeable that the defendants would plead limitation and therefore it was unforeseeable that the action would require any value. This case is extraordinary only because what was foreseeable did not happen for more than seven years. In principle, the instant case cannot be distinguished from the insurance brokers` cases. The plaintiffs have suffered damage when their solicitors commenced a defeasible action, just as the plaintiffs in the insurance brokers cases suffered damage when the brokers obtained voidable policies.
For the above reasons, we find that the plaintiffs will be prejudiced if the defendants are granted leave to amend their defence at this stage of the proceedings as whatever claim they may have against their solicitors for negligence has been time-barred. The loss of the opportunity to pursue a viable claim is sufficient prejudice to debar the defendants from obtaining leave to amend their defence. In our view, the decision of Rajah J was correct and the appeal against it must be dismissed.
In view of our finding that the plaintiffs will suffer prejudice if leave is granted to the defendants to amend their defence, the decision of Chao Hick Tin JC in not extending the limitation period is wrong. Although the prejudice to the plaintiffs is a post-writ factor, it has to be taken into account in an application for extension of the limitation period under the MCA 1911. In our view, Chao Hick Tin JC adopted too narrow a view of the ambit of s 8 thereof in limiting the relevant factors only to those occurring before the issue of the writ. The relevant factors must be those obtaining at the time the application is made or heard.
 Appeals from interlocutory orders - s 34 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) 
At the commencement of the hearing before us, counsel for the plaintiffs made a preliminary objection to the defendants` appeal in CA No 76 of 1989 on the ground that Rajah J had no jurisdiction or power to grant the defendants` application for extension of time to appeal on the ground that the application, having been made more than one month after Rajah J`s order reversing the assistant registrar`s order, could only be made to the Court of Appeal under O 57 r 17 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970. We held that this objection could not be raised in this appeal as Rajah J`s order had not been appealed against. However, as counsel has requested us to give our views on the point, we agree to do so as it is a point of general importance to the legal profession.
Section 34(2) of Cap 322 provides as follows: 
 
No appeal shall lie from an interlocutory order made by a Judge in chambers unless the Judge has certified, after application, within 4 days after the making of the order by an party for further argument in court, that he requires no further argument, or unless leave is obtained from the Court of Appeal or from the Judge who heard the application.
 
 
 
The section is clear. A party has no right of appeal against an interlocutory order of a judge-in-chambers except where: (1) within four days after the making of the order, he has 
 applied 
 for further argument 
 in court 
, and the judge 
 has certified 
 that he requires no further argument; or (2) he has obtained leave from the Court of Appeal or from the judge who heard the application.
Where the judge has certified that he agrees to hear further argument, he hears it in court and not in chambers. The use of the expression `in court` in contrast with the use of the expression `judge-in-chambers` makes this clear. However, the judge may, with the consent of the parties, treat his chambers as open court for this purpose. It is for each judge to decide, subject to the consent of the parties. In the present case, Rajah J adopted this procedure.
Where a party requires the right of appeal, time begins to run under O 57 r 4 for filing the notice of appeal, ie either when he is informed of the judge`s certification that he does not wish to hear further argument: see 
 Bank of America NT & SA 
v 
 Chai Yen 
 
 
 
[1980] 1 MLJ 198
  (a Malaysian decision on a similar provision), or, where there is rehearing, from the date of the order made on the rehearing. If the party fails to file his notice of appeal in compliance with O 57 r 4, he may apply to the Court of Appeal, but not to the court below, for extension of time under O 57 r 17.
Under s 34(2), the aggrieved party need not request further argument. He has the option of applying for leave from the judge or the Court of Appeal. By virtue of s 35 of Cap 322, he must first apply to the judge who heard the application. A further application may be made to the Court of Appeal under O 57 r 16(3). What is not provided is the period within which he must apply for leave.
Our disposition of these two appeals is as follows: (1) the appeal in CA No 76 of 1989 is dismissed with costs, and, in consequence (2) we make no order in CA No 18 of 1989, with no order as to costs, each having succeeded on one of the two main issues in this appeal.

The appellant pleaded guilty in the High Court to a charge of rape with hurt under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 68) (`the Code`) and to two charges of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Code. One of the s 377 charges concerned fellatio while the other concerned anal intercourse. The victim in all three charges was the same person. Lai Kew Chai J sentenced the appellant to 14 years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane on the first charge and to six years` imprisonment and eight years` imprisonment on the second and third charges respectively, with the imprisonment for the convictions on the first and third charges to run consecutively. No backdating was ordered and the terms were to run from the date of sentence, ie 31 May 1991. The appellant was thus sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison and 24 strokes of the cane. He appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was excessive. At the end of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal for the reasons which follow below.
The charges arose out of events that occurred over the course of two hours on 4 January 1989 in a toilet of a junior college. The victim, who was 17 years old at the time and a student in the junior college, had gone to the toilet and had entered a cubicle to change from her sports attire to her college uniform. Shortly after she entered and shut the cubicle door behind her, she heard a knock on the door, and thinking that it was one of her friends, she opened it. Instead, it was the appellant; he pushed his way in and locked the door. When she started to scream, he held her throat tightly with one hand and threatened her with the knife he held in his other hand. He warned her that he would kill her if she screamed, and he also used vulgar words on her and hit her continuously. The appellant then subjected the victim to various sexual acts. It is sufficient to recite that she was repeatedly raped and subjected to fellatio and anal intercourse. Throughout her ordeal, the victim was put in constant fear of being stabbed by the appellant.
After more than an hour, some of the victim`s friends came into the toilet to look for her. One of them climbed over the cubicle partition wall, and raised an alarm. The appellant opened the cubicle door, ran out holding his knife, and successfully made his getaway.
The appellant was arrested by the police on 14 January 1989 and charged two days later. On 31 May 1991, he was brought before the High Court where he pleaded guilty and was sentenced as stated above.
In considering the appeal, our first concern was whether the sentences in this case should run concurrently or consecutively as the offences took place in a short space of time and were against the same victim. At common law, this would be a situation where the sentencing principle commonly known as the one transaction rule would be likely to apply. The rule may be stated shortly: where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive. The difficulty, of course, is with the question of what constitutes one transaction and this question is necessarily one of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. In 
 R v Hussain 
 ,1 Hussain arrived at London airport in possession of three tins containing Indian hemp for which he did not have a licence. He was convicted of both unloading prohibited goods from an aircraft and possessing a dangerous drug without a licence, and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment. On appeal, the English Court of Criminal Appeal ordered the terms to run concurrently, although they also varied the terms so that the total period of imprisonment remained the same.
The general rule, however, is not an absolute rule. The English courts have recognized that there are situations where consecutive sentences are necessary to discourage the type of criminal conduct being punished: see 
 R v Faulkner 
 ,2 
 R v Wheatley 
 3 and 
 R v Skinner 
 .4 The applicability of the exception is said to depend on the facts of the case and the circumstances of the offence. It is stated in broad and general terms and although it may be criticized as vague, it is necessarily in such terms in order that the sentencer may impose an appropriate sentence in each particular case upon each particular offender at the particular time the case is heard.
The applicability of the principle of the one transaction rule in Singapore is qualified by s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) in cases where an accused is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for more than two distinct offences. The section provides: 
 
Where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted shall order that the sentences for at least two of those offences shall run consecutively.
 
 
 
While it may one day be necessary to identify the scope of the phrase `distinct offences`, we were of the opinion that the phrase clearly covered the circumstances of this case, as the three charges related to distinct sexual acts punishable under the written law. Accordingly, this was a case to which s 18 applies.
The sentencing direction given to the courts by virtue of s 18 is governed by the use of the verb `shall` and, as there is nothing in the context of the section to suggest that the prima facie effect of the use of that verb can be departed from, we were of the view that the direction is a mandatory one. We were supported in our view by the consideration that it is only if it operates as a mandatory direction that effect can be given to the clear legislative intention, implicit in the wording of the section, that offenders convicted of multiple offences at one trial ought to be more severely punished than offenders convicted of less than three distinct offences.
It should be observed, however, that the direction contained in s 18 is limited. The direction only requires that, at least two of the sentences imposed must run consecutively. The legislature has chosen to remain silent as to which of the sentences should run consecutively, and the sentencing court has been left with a discretion on this question. In our view, the sentencing court, when exercising its discretion, ought to have regard to the common law principles of sentencing applicable to the imposition of consecutive sentences, namely, the one transaction rule and the totality principle.
In this appeal, we considered first the question of whether all three terms of imprisonment should be made to run consecutively. The one transaction rule has been considered above, and, as stated, the facts of this case were clearly within the ambit of the notion of `one transaction`. Although the offences in this case were despicable, and have become common-place, we were not inclined to disturb the order of the learned judge that the term of imprisonment for the second charge run concurrently with the other two terms as we were of the view that two consecutive terms was appropriate punishment in this case.
We now turn to the question of whether the learned judge was right to combine the sentence on the first charge with the sentence on the third charge rather than order any other combination. When considering such a question, a sentencing court ought to have regard to the totality principle which requires the court to review the sentence and consider whether the aggregate is just and appropriate. The duty of the sentencer in this regard is to ensure that the sentence is not excessive.
We had to consider therefore if the order that the terms imposed for the first and third charges run consecutively was contrary to the stated principle. The High Court has stated the applicable test as being the broad question of whether the sentence is too much: 
 PP v Teo Heng Chye 
 ;5 
 PP v Chot Saik Kam 
 .6 Useful as the broad approach may be, we were of the opinion that it should, in appropriate circumstances, be further analysed. In this respect, we support the view of DA Thomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing 
 (2nd Ed) that the principle has two limbs. The learned author stated (at pp 57-58): 
 
The many decisions of the court in which the totality principle has been applied to explain the reduction of a cumulative sentence made up of correctly calculated individual parts suggest that the principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.
 
 
 
The above passage has received the approval of the High Court of Singapore in 
 Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP 
 .7 However, the first limb of the principle needs to be qualified in its application in Singapore where s 18 of the CPC is applicable. The following hypothetical example illustrates this: a public servant is convicted at one trial of four distinct charges of criminal breach of trust and is sentenced to six years` imprisonment on each charge. Section 18 requires the sentencing court to make at least two of the four terms run consecutively. This means that the offender will serve at least 12 years yet the statutory limit of 10 years imposed by s 409 of the Code means that the first limb of the totality principle is breached. To give full effect to the totality principle in such circumstances would be to frustrate the purpose of s 18 and, accordingly, the first limb of the principle has to be qualified. We note that the English courts have also departed from the full effect of the first limb of the principle in appropriate cases even though they are not bound by any equivalent of s 18 of our CPC: see 
 Thomas 
(op cit at p 59 and the cases cited at fn 1).
We then considered the question as to which of the terms should run consecutively in this case in the light of the above observations. The appellant in this appeal had a previous conviction for rape. The offence was committed in 1985 and he was convicted on 1 December 1987 in the district court and sentenced to six years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He appealed successfully to the High Court against the sentence of imprisonment and had it reduced to four years. He was released from prison in August 1988. For the purpose of sentencing in this case, the accused also had two other charges of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature taken into consideration. These offences took place on 26 December 1988, ie shortly before the offences in this case.
On the facts of this case, there were no special mitigating circumstances. The appellant`s plea in mitigation was that he was ashamed that he had committed the offences and that he did them out of passion. He said that he wanted to seek medical treatment (of an unspecified nature) to prevent any re-occurrence of such offences. He also said that he had been in remand since 14 January 1989, the date of his arrest.
In sentencing the appellant, Lai Kew Chai J stated that he had considered the appellant`s plea in mitigation but was of the view that the circumstances of the offence and the appellant`s other offences required that society be protected from him. We were of the view that the learned judge could not be said to have been in error in his decision, after taking these matters into consideration, in making the sentence on the first charge run consecutively with the sentence on the third charge, rather than ordering any other combination of the terms. Although the total term achieved by this combination was 22 years, which was in excess of the 20-year maximum term prescribed by s 376(2) for the charge of aggravated rape, the most serious charge, this could not be said to be wrong in principle in view of what we have said above of the relation between s 18 of the CPC and the totality principle. In view of the appellant`s antecedents, the charges of sodomy that were taken into consideration, and the nature and circumstances of the offences, it also could not be said that the sentence was a crushing one not in keeping with his record and prospects. We therefore did not disturb the order that the terms imposed for the first and the third sentences run consecutively
It remained for us to consider if the individual terms imposed for each charge were excessive. In view of the appellant`s antecedents, the charges of sodomy that were taken into consideration, and the nature and circumstances of the offence, we were of the view that the individual terms were not excessive. For the same reasons, we were of the view that the combined term did not offend the totality principle. It was our unanimous opinion that the appellant was a person who should be kept in prison for as long as possible and we accordingly dismissed his appeal.
Before we conclude, we wish to refer to the decision of the High Court in 
 PP v Rajendra Prasad 
 .8 The accused in that case was charged with and convicted of two counts of rape and one count of robbery. The victim in all three charges was the same female and all three charges arose out of the same incident. The accused had raped the victim twice in 15 minutes and then robbed her. The court sentenced the accused to 10 years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on the first charge but did not pass any sentence on the second charge as it was of the view that the second charge came under the purview of s 71 of the Code. The court sentenced the accused to two years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on the third charge of robbery and ordered that the sentence of imprisonment run concurrently with that on the first charge. It did not order the sentence to run consecutively with that of the first charge because the High Court was of the view that s 18 of the CPC did not apply to offences falling within the purview of s 71 of the Code.
The High Court`s view in that case that the second charge of rape came within the purview of s 71 of the Code is difficult to follow. The section reads: 
 
(1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. (2) Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or where several acts of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence constitute when combined a different offence the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the court which tries him could award for any of such offences.
 
 
 
We do not think that the section applies to two distinct acts of rape.
The High Court`s decision in 
 Rajendra Prasa 
 
 d 
 8 went on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but the point on the absence of a sentence on the second charge was not taken: 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 1
  . Accordingly, this court has not given its approval to the approach taken by the High Court in that case, and we are of the opinion that that approach should not be followed in subsequent cases.

We will now give our decision on the submissions that we have heard and we will give this with our reasons. The charge against the accused Lee Chin Guan is that he on or about 25 June 1989 at about 4.10am at the grass verge beside Block 4 Upper Aljunied Lane, Singapore, together with two other unknown persons and in furtherance of the common intention of them all committed murder by causing the death of one Ng Eng Hwa and thereby the accused Lee Chin Guan committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`) read with s 34.
The totality of the evidence of the prosecution in support of this charge is as follows. Ng Eng Hwa, the deceased, to whom we shall refer as Eng Hwa, was noticed by Diong Tiong Ngo, PW17, a worker at Lai Lai coffee shop, occupying a table at the five-foot way in front of the coffee shop at about 12.10am on Sunday, 25 June 1989. Lai Lai coffee shop is on the ground floor in a building next to Block 4 Upper Aljunied Lane. A friend of Eng Hwa, who has not been identified to us, is said to have treated Eng Hwa to two bottles of Tiger beer. The friend did not, however, join Eng Hwa to partake of the beer. According to PW17, Eng Hwa was joined by a female Chinese who was also not identified to us. She left at about 1am. At about 1.30am Eng Hwa left the coffee shop and returned about ten minutes later dressed in a pair of blue shorts. Earlier he was dressed in long pants. On his return he ordered a small bottle of Carlsberg beer. He also received a telephone call from a female.
Eng Hwa was also noticed by Tan Kiong Seng, PW18, whose father owns or runs the Lai Lai coffee shop. PW18 attends at the coffee shop to clean and guard it. On 25 June 1989, he arrived at the Lai Lai coffee shop at about 2.25am and saw Eng Hwa at a table at the front five-foot way of the coffee shop drinking beer. PW18 noted that Eng Hwa made several telephone calls from the coinphone installed at the coffee shop. When the coffee shop closed at 3am he left with PW17 to send PW17 home. Eng Hwa was still at the table at the five-foot way. He was alone. When PW18 returned to the coffee shop about 15 to 20 minutes later, Eng Hwa was still there. He then started to mop the floor and noticed that Eng Hwa had fallen asleep sitting in a chair with his feet resting on a stool.
The evidence of PW17 and PW18 is at variance, as to the times, with the evidence of Chu Tee Eng, PW15. PW15 is a bar waitress with whom Eng Hwa had an intimate relationship. Eng Hwa had rented a flat at Block 10, Joo Seng Road where they met. On Saturday, 24 June 1989, PW15 had received a telephone call from Eng Hwa. He had asked PW15 to go to the flat at Joo Seng Road. She had gone there at about 1.30am on Sunday the 25th. Eng Hwa was not there; she had paged him. Eng Hwa arrived at about 3am and asked PW15 to go with him to the Lai Lai coffee shop for a drink. She had refused and Eng Hwa left half an hour later. He was dressed in a light blue T-shirt and a pair of dark blue denim shorts. While he was in the flat he was paged three or four times.
This discrepancy is not material. PW15, PW17 and PW18 were not cross-examined. Their evidence was admitted in the form of written statements under s 371 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). The fact is that Eng Hwa`s presence at the Lai Lai coffee shop during the early hours of Sunday, 25 June 1989 around the hour of 3am was established without challenge. He was seen by PW18 at that time sleeping as described earlier.
The key prosecution witness is Kee Tiong Tat, PW21. He was a co-worker with the accused at Huk Seng Fresh Fruits Pte Ltd at Block 23, Pasir Panjang, #01-177/178 Wholesale Centre where PW21 worked as a driver and the accused as a sorter.
Sometime between 2am and 3am on Sunday, 25 June 1989, the accused had telephoned PW21 at his home at Block 406, Sin Ming Avenue, #11-257 and had wanted to borrow their employer`s lorry which PW21 had with him. The accused wanted PW21 to take the lorry to his home at Ang Mo Kio. PW21 agreed and drove the lorry to where the accused lived in Ang Mo Kio. The accused was waiting for him at the car park. PW21 had not asked why the accused wanted the use of the lorry at that hour. He had just complied with the accused`s request.
When PW21 arrived at the accused`s place at Ang Mo Kio it was about 3am. The accused said he had some matter with his girlfriend and wanted PW21 to take him to Tampines. PW21 said something about having to work at 7.15am and being tired. He then suggested that the accused use the lorry himself but in the end was persuaded to accompany the accused. They had left Ang Mo Kio with the accused driving the lorry purportedly to Tampines. PW21 occupied the passenger seat and fell asleep.
When the lorry came to a stop PW21 awoke and noticed that they had stopped at Upper Aljunied Road near a letterbox in the vicinity of Block 4 and the Lai Lai coffee shop. PW21 was familiar with this area as he had delivered goods there.
When the lorry stopped PW21 noticed a Chinese woman. She was standing on the road and was at the near side passenger door of the lorry. The letterbox was also on the near side of the lorry. The accused then told PW21 that they were there to get back a pawn ticket but did not say from whom or from where. He told PW21 to make a U-turn and park the lorry in Lichi Avenue and alighted from the lorry saying that he would wait at the letterbox. PW21 moved into the driver`s seat and drove off to park in Lichi Avenue. He then joined the accused at the letterbox. The Chinese woman was with the accused. He did not know the Chinese woman and had not met her before.
The three then went through a gap in the hedge to the staircase at Block 4 and waited. There was no conversation. Nothing was said by the accused or the Chinese woman save for the accused asking the woman whether the friend had arrived and the woman answering that the friend should have arrived. In a short while they were joined by another man whom PW21 did not know. He was dark-complexioned and PW21 referred to him as Ah Or in evidence.
As soon as Ah Or arrived the accused said, `Okay, let us move.` The Chinese woman led the way to Lai Lai coffee shop followed by the accused, Ah Or and PW21 in that order in single file.
When they arrived near the coffee shop they stopped on the grass verge near a tree whilst the woman went towards the coffee shop. PW21 noticed a man inside the coffee shop reading a newspaper and the radio was on. PW21 also noticed a man sleeping on a row of seven or eight chairs placed together with their back rests alternating outside the coffee shop. The Chinese woman went up to this man and called to him to wake up. When he did not, she shook him but he still did not wake up.
PW21 had not mentioned what time this was. The time can be fixed by reference to PW18`s evidence which was that at about 4.05am when he went to his car to get a newspaper and saw a Chinese female squatting in front of Eng Hwa who was sleeping in the chair at the five-foot way. PW18 had not taken further notice and had retired into the coffee shop after getting his newspaper.
It will be noted that PW18`s description of how Eng Hwa was sleeping in the chair was very different from the description given by PW21. In our view this discrepancy is of no great materiality in view of the position taken by the defence as will appear later.
When Eng Hwa did not wake up despite the efforts of the Chinese woman over a period of five minutes, the accused went forward followed by Ah Or. The accused took Eng Hwa`s head in the crook of his left arm around Eng Hwa`s neck whilst Ah Or gathered Eng Hwa`s body with his hands around Eng Hwa`s hip and they both carried him with his body facing downwards to the grass verge beside Block 4 and placed him on the ground face downwards near the furthest stone table seen in exh P74. All this time Eng Hwa still slept or did not waken.
Ah Or then pressed down on Eng Hwa`s buttocks with his knees. The accused squatted near Eng Hwa`s head. The woman squatted beside Ah Or`s left. Ah Or took out a sharp-pointed knife with a slightly curved blade about ten inches in length from the waistband of his trousers and handed it to the woman. The woman held the knife in both hands and stabbed at Eng Hwa`s back at least once. Ah Or then took the knife from her and whilst still kneeling on Eng Hwa`s buttocks, stabbed Eng Hwa three or four times in his back.
When PW21 saw Ah Or stab Eng Hwa in this way, PW21 who was standing on the footpath started to run away from the scene in the direction of Upper Aljuned Lane, that is to say, in the direction away from Block 4 and Lai Lai coffee shop. As he reached the bridge straddling the drain between the grass verge where the stabbing was taking place and Upper Aljunied Lane, he turned round to look back and saw the accused holding the same knife in both his hands pointing downwards.
PW21 went straight to where the lorry was parked in Lichi Avenue. A short while later, the accused, Ah Or and the woman also arrived at the lorry. All four got into the driver`s cabin of the lorry and the accused said, `The person had been killed.` PW21 then drove in the direction of Upper Serangoon Road where Ah Or and the woman alighted. The accused told them to get their passports and leave for Malaysia. PW21 then drove the lorry to his home where he got off and the accused drove the lorry away. At 6am when PW21 came down from his flat he found the accused there with the lorry.
Lo Tai Seah, PW10, lives at No 62 Jalan Mulia, a road off Upper Aljunied Road and runs alongside the building in which the Lai Lai coffee shop is. He had been to a midnight movie and was returning home at about 3.15am on Sunday, 25 June 1989. He was locked out. So to while away the time he cycled around to Lai Lai coffee shop. He found it closed but did see a man inside mopping the floor. He also saw a man sleeping in a chair outside the coffee shop and thought he was drunk. His description of how the man was sleeping was similar to the one given by PW18. Later at about 4.10am while he was cycling to Block 2 Upper Aljunied Lane, he saw three male Chinese and a Chinese woman running from somewhere near the bridge over the drain between the grass verge at Block 4 and Upper Aljunied Lane across Upper Aljunied Road into Lichi Avenue. He continued cycling to Lai Lai coffee shop and found that the man whom he had seen sleeping was no longer there. As he cycled along the footpath beside the Block 4 towards the stone tables seen in exh P74, he noticed three Chinese boys, PW7, 8 and 9, looking upon a male Chinese who was lying motionless face downwards on the grass verge bleeding from his back. He noted that this man was the same man he had seen earlier sleeping on the chair outside Lai Lai coffee shop. He then alerted the police.
At about 4.46am the ambulance arrived at the scene. The ambulance officer, PW4, examined the body of Eng Hwa and found no sign of life on him. Three open wounds and a smaller wound was found on his back.
The autopsy was carried out by Prof Chao Tzee Cheng, PW20, on 26 June 1989. His report was admitted in evidence as exh P44. PW20 had in fact been called to the scene at Block 4 Upper Aljunied Lane and had arrived there at about 6.30am on 25 June 1989. He viewed the body which he ascertained to be that of Eng Hwa lying face downwards on the grass verge with four stab wounds in the back and a cut in the neck. He estimated the death to have occurred about two hours earlier, that is to say, at about 4.30am.
During the autopsy, PW20 noted eight external injuries which he listed in his autopsy report, exh P44. Again, having regard to the position taken by the defence, which will become apparent later, it is only necessary to refer to three of these external injuries. They are: 
 
 
(a) Injury No 4, described in exh P44 as, `Horizontal stab wound at left side of the back, 4cm long with clean cut edges sharp end medially and blunt end laterally went into the chest cavity cut the top of the ninth rib slicing upwards through the eighth intercostal space and cut the posterior surface of the left lung 7cm and continued to cut the left side of the aorta 1.5cm. The depth of the wound was 10cm. This was the fatal wound.` This injury is seen in exh P31. 
 
(b) Injury No 5, described in exh P44 as, `Vertical stab wound lower down at the left side of the back measuring 4cm long with clean cut edges and a sharp end below and a blunt end above cutting into the chest wall through the ninth rib and the eighth and ninth intercostal spaces making a cut of 6.5cm on the chest wall and cut the lower edge of the left lower lobe of lung 4cm.` This injury is seen also in exh P31. 
 
(c) Injury No 8 described in exh P44 as, `Shallow stab wound at back of right upper arm 2.7cm.` This injury is seen in exh P28.
  
 
 
PW20 gave as his opinion that all eight injuries could have been caused by the same weapon which he thought was a weapon with a sharp edge and pointed end measuring ten inches in length. He certified the cause of death as `Haemorrhage from stab wound in lung and aorta`. This is injury No 4. In his view this injury alone could have caused the death in the ordinary course of nature within one to two minutes since the aorta was cut.
With respect to injury No 5 which had the same characteristics as injury No 4, PW20`s opinion was that it was most probable that it was caused by the same weapon that caused injury No 4 although he could not be sure whether both were caused by the same person. If left unattended, injury No 5 by itself would also result in death due to the bleeding.
Injury No 8 was a superficial wound which had affected only the skin and the muscle beneath. If this wound was isolated from the other seven injuries the victim would only have required outpatient treatment.
In PW20`s opinion, having regard to all eight injuries, and particularly injury No 8, it seemed most probable that all eight injuries were caused when the body was lying on the ground face downwards.
PW20 had also taken a blood sample from Eng Hwa`s body during the autopsy. It was found to contain 141mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. It showed that Eng Hwa was very much under the influence of alcohol such that his judgment, movement and speech would be greatly impaired. `Not in control of his body` is how PW20 described it. In his view this condition prevailed at the time of death.
As stated earlier, PW21 is the prosecution`s key witness. He gave his evidence viva voce and was cross-examined by defence counsel. He admitted that he was arrested in September 1989 in connection with this killing and had been in custody for about three months. Originally he too was charged with the killing of Eng Hwa but was later released and no charge has been preferred against him in connection with the killing of Eng Hwa. It was pointed out to us by defence counsel that when the accused was first charged after his arrest on 16 September 1989, the charge was that the accused together with one Kee Tiong Tat, PW21, and two others unknown and in furtherance of the common intention of them all had committed the murder of Eng Hwa on 25 June at about 4.10am at the grass verge beside Block 4, Upper Aljunied Lane.
PW21 undoubtedly is an accomplice. This is not denied by the prosecution. Be that as it may, defence counsel apart from highlighting some discrepancies in his oral evidence and his statement at PS16 which are not really material, elicited from him that no conversation had taken place between the accused and the Chinese woman from the time he joined them at the letterbox at Upper Aljunied Road and whilst they walked to and waited at the steps in Block 4 for Ah Or, except that the accused had asked the woman whether the friend had arrived and the woman had answered that the friend should have arrived. Also, that when Ah Or arrived again no conversation had taken place between any of them except that the accused had said, `Okay, let us move.` A further fact elicited from PW21 was that neither he nor the accused nor the woman was armed with a weapon of any kind and that the purpose in going to Block 4, Upper Aljunied Lane was to get back a pawn ticket from someone whose name was never mentioned. Yet another fact elicited from PW21 was that he and so far as he knew, the accused and the woman did not know that Ah Or was armed with a knife until he had pulled it out from the waistband of his trousers and handed it to the woman as described earlier. Further, that he was `dazed` when Ah Or had pulled out the knife as no mention of violence had been made at all before that. However, he maintained that the accused had held the head of Eng Hwa when the woman had stabbed the back of Eng Hwa and that he had seen the accused holding the knife when he was running away from the scene and did see a blow land on Eng Hwa`s right shoulder. He could not be sure whether the accused held the knife with one hand or with both hands and admitted to be confused. The accused made a s 122(6) statement on 16 September 1989 immediately following his arrest. This statement was admitted without challenge as being voluntary. In the s 122(6) statement all that the accused said was, `This is my first offence. I did it on impulse. I hope the judge will be lenient towards me.`
At the close of the prosecution`s case, Dr Myint Soe, counsel for the defence, made the submission that there was no case for the accused to answer. This submission was predicated on the assumption that even if the whole of the prosecution`s evidence is believed, the essential ingredient of the charge, namely, the common intention of the accused and the two other unknown persons, who could only be the Chinese woman and Ah Or, to commit murder by causing the death of Eng Hwa had not been proved.
Dr Myint Soe argued that the only common intention that had emerged from the prosecution`s evidence was the taking back of the pawn ticket. That is what the accused had told PW21 when they arrived at the letterbox in Upper Aljunied Road. That did not constitute a criminal act. It was necessary for the prosecution to prove that there was a common intention to commit a criminal act and that the criminal offence with which the accused was charged was committed in the furtherance of that criminal act. This was clear from the indisputable authority starting with the Privy Council`s decision in 
Barendra Kumar Ghosh v The King-Emperor
 
[1925] Privy Council 1
[1924] IA 40
 and 
Mahbub Shah v The King-Emperor
 
[1945] PC 118
 and to the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal decision in 
Mimi Wong & Anor v PP
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
  in which case Wee Chong Jin CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 78, second column, letter I: 
 
There is no doubt that for this section [s 34 of the Code] to apply there must be in existence a common intention between all the persons who committed the criminal act, and that a criminal act be done in furtherance of that common intention. When these two requirements are proved, each of such persons would be liable for the entire criminal act in the same manner as if he had done it alone.
 
 
 
He further argued, that is Dr Myint Soe further argued, that in all the decided cases under s 34 it could clearly be seen that there was a common intention to commit a minor offence, and that in the furtherance of that intention, a more serious criminal offence was committed. In this case, a common intention to commit a criminal act, that is to say, the minor criminal offence, is absent and therefore there could not be a furtherance of what there was not. In fact, Dr Myint Soe argued that there was no evidence at all to show that anything criminal was being planned before the killing and we agree with him. The prosecution also concedes this.
A further point made by Dr Myint Soe was that there was no evidence from the prosecution that until Ah Or pulled out the knife the accused knew or ought to have known that Ah Or was carrying a knife. There was no evidence that the accused or the Chinese woman or PW21 was armed with a knife or any other weapon. Thus the inference must be that the accused had no knowledge that a knife would be used when these four persons assembled at the steps of Block 4. Knowledge is an essential element in coming to a conclusion as to whether there was or was not a common intention. Further, the evidence shows there was only one knife, and that was the one Ah Or had. The collocation of this evidence or the lack of it, in our view, shows the lack of common intention for the killing.
Mr Hamid for the prosecution took a different view. Although he acknowledged that the prosecution had not shown a common intention prior to the killing, he submitted that the common intention was formed when Ah Or took out his knife. At that precise moment the accused must have realized that something violent was going to happen, that Ah Or intended to use the knife. This, coupled with the fact that the accused did not dissuade Ah Or, did not leave the scene immediately, but concurred in holding Eng Hwa`s head when the woman stabbed Eng Hwa showed that the accused not only participated in the killing but also acted with `community of purpose`, an expression he used in place of `common intention`. He further argued that the accused was the prime mover. This was shown by the accused asking of the woman whether the friend had arrived, and when Ah Or had arrived it was he who said `Okay, let`s move`. And finally when all four had returned to the lorry parked at Lichi Avenue, it was the accused who spoke. He said, `The person has been killed.` Mr Hamid submitted that all this shows that the accused was part of a joint enterprise. There was unity of criminal behaviour. Thus he submitted that the prosecution has clearly shown there was a common intention. If it was necessary for there to be a criminal act in furtherance of which the killing was done, the holding down of Eng Hwa`s head by the accused was that criminal act. He later changed this to the carrying of Eng Hwa by the accused and Ah Or from the chair on which he was sleeping to the grass verge beside Block 4 which he termed as an assault.
Mr Hamid argued that as a matter of law the common intention can be formed on the spot and acted upon immediately. This proposition cannot be seriously disputed. He relied extensively on the dicta of Desai J of the Allahabad High Court exercising appellate jurisdiction in the case of 
Bashir v The State
 
[1953] Cri LJ 1050
 We do not find this case of much assistance. We would, however, cite the Indian Supreme Court case of 
Krishna v State of Maharashtra
 
[1963] Cri LJ 351
 The judgment of the court of four judges was delivered by Subba Rao J, who at p 352 said that: 
 
It is well settled that common intention within the meaning of s 34 implied a pre-arranged plan and the criminal act was done pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. The said plan may also develop on the spot during the course of the commission of the offence; but the crucial circumstance is that the said plan must precede the act constituting the offence. If that be so, before a court can convict a person under s 302, read with s 34 it should come to a definite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence.
 
 
 
It is also appropriate to bear in mind the words of Sir Madhavan Nair who delivered the decision of the Privy Council in 
Mahbub Shah v The King-Emperor
 
[1945] PC 118
 At p 121 of the report he said and I quote: 
 
Care must be taken not to confuse same or similar intention with common intention; the partition which divides `their bounds` is often very thin; nevertheless the distinction is real and substantial and if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice. In their Lordships` view, the inference of common intention within the meaning of the term in s 34 should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
Thus, it is clear that the common intention has to be inferred from all the circumstances of the case. We are unable to draw such an inference. The evidence of PW21, who clearly was an accomplice must be approached with great caution. It was the evidence of PW21 that he witnessed the accused holding Eng Hwa`s head when the Chinese woman stabbed Eng Hwa`s back, that he witnessed Ah Or grab the knife from the woman and stab the back of Eng Hwa three or four times. It was at that point that he ran away from the scene, and when he was at the bridge straddling the drain between the grass verge beside Block 4 and Upper Aljunied Lane, he looked back and saw the accused with the knife in his hand, making a motion to stab Eng Hwa and that he in fact saw the blow land on Eng Hwa`s shoulder, injury No 8. This last part of his evidence simply cannot be true. We have previously referred to the evidence of the cinema goer who was cycling around that morning - the evidence of PW10. He gave oral evidence. When he referred to three male Chinese and the female Chinese running somewhere near the gate at the grass verge of Block 4, Upper Aljunied Lane, across Upper Aljunied Road, towards Lichi Avenue, he was asked to mark his position and the position of the three male Chinese and the female Chinese on exh P81. He marked his position in Upper Aljunied Lane and the position of the three male Chinese and the female Chinese at the corner of Upper Aljunied Road and Upper Aljunied Lane, on Upper Aljunied Road itself. His evidence also indicates that the four persons were in a group. So when PW21 said in evidence that he left first and ran to the lorry which was parked in Lichi Avenue and that the other three came a little while later, that statement could not be true.
We accept the evidence of PW10 in preference to the evidence of PW21 on this point. The result is that the inference of common intention that the prosecution wishes us to draw from the evidence of PW21 cannot be safely drawn. Furthermore, the attempt made by the prosecution to cast the accused in the role of the principal actor is to rely on mere conjecture. The other surrounding circumstances suggest that the woman was the principal actor. There is ample evidence that Eng Hwa was visited by an unidentified Chinese woman around 1am when he sat drinking beer at the Lai Lai coffee shop. There is ample evidence that he received telephone calls from some female persons while he sat drinking at the Lai Lai coffee shop. It was the woman who approached Eng Hwa and tried to wake him up when he was sleeping outside the Lai Lai coffee shop, and it was the woman to whom Ah Or handed the knife when he took it out from the waistband of his trousers.
For all these reasons, we are unable to accept the submission of Mr Hamid that a common intention to cause grievous hurt to Eng Hwa was formed when Ah Or took his knife out.
The matter does not, however, rest there. We have found that the common intention to commit the murder of Eng Hwa was lacking in the prosecution`s case. Accordingly we must find that the accused has no case to answer on the charge as framed. But when the accused was first charged together with Kee Tiong Tat, PW21, and two others in the furtherance of the common intention of them all, that the accused had committed the `murder` of Eng Hwa, he made a s 122(6) statement to which we have referred earlier. In his s 122(6) statement, he said, `This is my first offence. I did it on impulse. I hope the judge will be lenient towards me.`
What is he admitting to? Looking at the evidence of the prosecution presented so far, in the most favourable light to the accused, he is, in our view, admitting to having stabbed Eng Hwa. From the relative positions of the accused, the woman and Ah Or around the body of Eng Hwa lying face downwards on the grass verge beside Block 4, as described by PW21, and from the evidence of PW21 the most likely person to have caused the fatal injury, injury No 4, and the next most serious injury, injury No 5, is Ah Or.
Although, in our view, s 34 could not be applied to this case, s 38 can. Sections 33 to 38 of the Code must be looked at in a case like this where several persons are concerned in a killing, and not just s 34 alone. The inter-relations of ss 33 to 38 of the Code which are identical to ss 33 to 38 of the Indian Penal Code were explained by Lord Sumner in 
Barendra Kumar Ghosh
 
[1925] Privy Council 1
[1924] IA 40
 We refer to the report of the case in 1924, Indian Appeals, at p 40. At p 51, he explains these inter-relations of the various sections of the Code. 
 
As soon, however, as the other sections of this part of the Code are looked at, it becomes plain that the words of s 34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited sense. By s 33 a criminal act in s 34 includes a series of acts and, further, `act` includes omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being done before one`s very eyes. By s 37, when any offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes, as in other things, `they also serve who only stand and wait`. By s 38, when several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act. Read together, these sections are reasonably plain. Section 34 deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for `that act` and `the act` in the latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by `a criminal act` in the first part, because they refer to it. Section 37 provides that, when several acts are done so as to result together in the commission of an offence, the doing of any one of them, with an intention to co-operate in the offence (which may not be the same as an intention common to all), makes the actor liable to be punished for the commission of the offence. Section 38 provides for different punishments for different offences as an alternative to one punishment for one offence, whether the persons engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act are set out in motion by the one intention or by the other.
 
 
 
The inter-relations of ss 34, 35 and 38 of the Code are also commented on in 
 Ratanlal and Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
 (23rd Ed) p 117 as follows: 
 
Sections 34, 35 and 38 deal with the same subject and should be read together. Section 34 treats of acts done with a `common intention`, s 38 of acts done with different intentions. A quarrel arose between C on the one side and A and B on the other. C abused A, whereupon A struck him with a stick, and B struck him down with an axe on the head. He also received two other wounds with the axe on other parts of the body. Any one of the three axe-wounds was sufficient to cause death, more especially that on the head. It was held that B was guilty of culpable homicide, while A was guilty of voluntarily causing hurt.
 
 
 
Section 38 would cover two different situations. One is where several persons act together in furtherance of a common intention, as in the illustration to the section. In such a situation, the section provides that the court may convict each person of a different offence, according as circumstances operate to create legal extenuation in individual cases. The other situation is where there is action in common but a difference in the several intentions of the participants. In that case the section is a converse to s 34, and each person is to be found guilty of the particular offence constituted by his individual act. In the first case, however, the section is a supplement to s 34, not a converse. This section applies where a criminal act is jointly done by several persons and those persons have different intentions or states of knowledge.
Sections 34 to 38 lay down principles similar to the English law of `principles in the first and second degrees`.
Sections 34 and 35 deal with individual responsibility for a single criminal act perpetrated by a large number of persons who either share a common intention or possess the criminal knowledge (ss 34-35) and the third with co-operation between several accused in the completion of criminal act (s 37). Lastly, s 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of different grades according to the share taken by different accused in the completion of the criminal act, and this section does not mention anything about intention, common or otherwise, or knowledge.
And lastly, we would refer to the Indian Supreme Court case of 
Bhaba Nanda Sarma & Ors v The State of Assam
 
[1977] AIR 2252
 We refer to para 4 at p 2254 which states: 
 
To attract the application of s 34 it must be established beyond any shadow of doubt that the criminal act was done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. In other words, the prosecution must prove facts to `justify an inference that all the participants of the act had shared a common intention to commit the criminal act which was finally committed by one or more of the participants`. Section 38 of the Penal Code says:
 
 
 
`Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.`
 
 
 
In 
 Afrahim Sheikh v State of West Bengal
 (1964) Hidayatullah J, as he then was, has pointed out that it was possible to apply the ingredients of s 34 in relation to the commission of an offence under s 304, Part II, even though death is caused with the knowledge of the persons participating in the occurrence that by their act death was likely to be caused. The sharing of the common intention, as pointed out in that case, is the commission of the act or acts by which death was occasioned. With reference to s 38, the learned judge observed at p 178:
 
 
 
That is to say, even though several persons may do a single criminal act, the responsibility may vary according to the degree of their participation. The illustration which is given clearly brings out that point.`
 
 
 
Lastly, s 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of different grades according to the share taken by the different accused in the completion of the criminal act, and this section does not mention anything about intention, common or otherwise, or knowledge.
 
 
 
We are satisfied that the evidence led by the prosecution thus far prima facie supports a charge under s 299 read with s 38 and punishable under s 304(b) of the Code. The reduced charge is that you, Lee Chin Guan, on or about 25 June 1989 at about 4.10am at the grass verge beside Block 4, Upper Aljunied Lane, Singapore, together with two other unknown persons committed culpable homicide, by causing the death of Ng Eng Hwa, male, 30 years of age, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 299 read with s 38 and punishable under s 304(b) of the Code.
We call upon you to enter upon your defence to this reduced charge.

The accused, Lee Ngin Kiat, was tried in the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Lee Ngin Kiat, are charged that you on or about 13 August 1990, at about 9.10pm at Apartment Block 15, St George`s Road #11-168, Singapore did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 50 plastic packets of substance containing not less than 147.68g of diamorphine which were in your possession at Apartment Block 15, St George`s Road #11-168, Singapore, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have, thereby, by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, committed an offence under s 5(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
At the end of the trial, Amarjeet Singh JC found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him and sentenced him to the mandatory death sentence [see 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 181
  ]. The accused appealed to this court against the conviction.
 The facts
The facts in this case are substantially undisputed and for the purposes of this appeal need only be stated briefly.
On 13 August 1990 at about 7.47pm the accused was arrested by narcotics officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau. At about 9.10pm he was brought to his apartment at Blk 15 St George`s Road #11-168, Singapore and he indicated his room to the officers. The door of the room was unlocked with one of the keys which had been seized from the accused earlier.
One of the officers asked the accused as to the whereabouts of his drugs and the accused signalled with his head towards a wooden rack. A small metal container was recovered from the rack and another larger metal container was found at the foot of the rack. On being asked what was inside the containers the accused replied in Hokkien, `Peh Hoon` (heroin). The accused was questioned as to whether he knew the quantity of drugs he had and he replied that he did not know. He added that his friend Ah Seow had asked him to keep them. The containers were later found to contain 46 small sachets and eight large sachets of diamorphine with a total weight of not less than 147.68g.
During cross-examination, counsel for the defence put to some of the narcotics officers who gave evidence questions to suggest that the accused did not know the contents of the metal containers and that the diamorphine was recovered independently of any questions put to the accused. This was denied by all the prosecution witnesses. One of the prosecution witnesses also denied that the accused had told him that Ah Seow was a runner at the race course and that the accused had offered to bring him there to apprehend Ah Seow. Instead, the witness stated that the accused told him that he had met Ah Seow, whose address he did not know, in a gambling den.
Various other items were subsequently recovered from the rack as well as from a drawer in the room. These included stacks of small sachets of transparent plastic (similar to the 46 found to contain diamorphine), a daching, empty envelopes, an electric sealer, a pager, three passports, Chinese newspapers, masking tape, two large plastic sachets (similar to the eight found to contain diamorphine) and a polythene bag.
 The decision of the High Court
At the conclusion of the prosecution case, counsel for the defence submitted that no prima facie case had been made out against the accused.
The learned judge was of the view that the fact that the accused had the keys to the room in which the drugs were recovered gave rise to the presumption of possession under s 18(1) and (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)(`the Act`). As such, the burden fell on the accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. This was conceded by counsel for the defence.
However, counsel for the defence challenged the prosecution`s contention that the fact that the accused was proved to be in possession of the drugs meant that, by virtue of s 17 of the Act, a prima facie case of trafficking had been made out against the accused. Counsel for the defence argued that the evidence of the prosecution amounted at most to an offence of possession and not trafficking. Attention was drawn to the fact that the word `traffic` was defined in terms of several overt acts in s 2 of the Act. The argument was that the presumption in s 17 could not be invoked in a case where the accused, at the time that the drugs were proved to be in his possession, was not in a position to traffic in the drugs in any of the ways mentioned in s 2. In the present case, the accused could not have trafficked in the drugs found in his possession at the time and place alleged in the charge as he was then in police custody.
This argument was rejected by the learned judge who was of the view that the argument missed the point as to the main function and effect of a legal rebuttable presumption. The learned judge pointed out that a legal presumption implied the existence of one fact from the existence of some other fact founded upon a previous experience of their connection and provided that fact as proved, leaving it to the adversary to marshal evidence on a balance of probabilities to negative that fact. As such, s 17 obviated the necessity on the part of the prosecution to overtly prove the act or the state of affairs denoting the activity referred to in s 2 of the Act. The learned judge then ruled that the words `to traffic` as used in s 17 constituted compendiously a presumptive description of the several acts which constituted the definition of the word `traffic` in s 2 of the Act. Once correctly invoked, a presumption of trafficking came into operation without proof of any accompanying overt act as set out in s 2 of the Act.
The learned judge then held that the prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the accused. On his defence being called, the accused elected to remain silent and did not call any witnesses in his defence. The trial judge then reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accused had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking. The accused was accordingly convicted and sentenced to death.
 The issue of law
On appeal to this court, counsel for the appellant conceded that the drugs were in the possession of the accused but disputed that the offence of trafficking had been made out. He relied essentially on the same defence argument which had been rejected by the trial judge in the High Court. This argument is based on the interpretation of ss 2 and 17 of the Act and the relationship between the two sections.
The material part of s 17 of the Act provides: 
 
Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than -
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine;
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug.
 
 
 
Before its amendment which took effect on 15 February 1990, the corresponding part of the provision read: 
 
Any person who is proved or presumed to have had in his possession more than - 
... 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine (heroin) contained in any controlled drug;
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein.
 
 
 
Section 2 of the Act defines the word `traffic` in terms of several `overt acts of trafficking`. It reads: 
 
`traffic` means - 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a),
 
 
 
otherwise than under the authority of this Act or the regulations made thereunder; and `trafficking` has a corresponding meaning.
 
 
 
The appellant`s contention was that the evidence adduced by the prosecution clearly showed that the accused, being in police custody, was not in a position to perform any of the overt acts of trafficking as enumerated in s 2 at the time and place specified in the charge. As such, s 17 could not be invoked to presume that something impossible had been done. Alternatively, even if s 17 could be applied, the evidence had clearly rebutted the presumption that the accused was carrying out one of the overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2.
Counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand adopted by the trial judge in the High Court was correct and as such it was not necessary for the prosecution to further provide some evidence of an overt act as prescribed under s 2. This argument, though unquestionably correct, does not further the prosecution case in any way. It cannot be disputed that the effect of the presumption is to cast the burden of proof on the accused to rebut the presumption of trafficking; that much is clear from the words of s 17. The heart of the defence argument is not that the burden of proof does not fall on the accused, but that the burden has been discharged.
To resolve the issue, a close examination of ss 2 and 17 is necessary. This is the first time that this court is asked to decide on the effect of s 17 of the Act after the amendment which came into operation on 15 February 1990. The issue of law raised is a wide-ranging and important one and is best framed generally: what is the effect of the presumption of s 17 of the Act? The closely-related question is of course: how is it rebutted?
The wording of s 17 is deceptively simple. As noted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Syed Feisal bin Yahya v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 190
  the amendment appears to have been taken directly from the observations of Choor Singh J, also in the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Poon Soh Har v PP
 
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 126
 
The old s 17, when invoked, simply presumed the existence of the requisite mens rea for trafficking. Possession for the purpose of trafficking was (and is), not an offence under the Act and thus proof of any act of trafficking (that is, any of the overt acts enumerated in the definition of trafficking in s 2 of the Act) would still be required in order to establish a prima facie case against the accused: 
Poon Soh Har v PP
 
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 126
  
Wong Kee Chin v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 157
  
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  
Syed Feisal bin Yahya v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 SLR 190
 
One thing which has emerged clearly from the new wording in s 17 is that it now presumes from the fact of possession that the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug has been constituted, that is, it presumes both actus reus and mens rea to be present once possession is proved. Thus, once the operation of s 17 is properly triggered off, the accused has a burden to prove on a balance of probabilities that either the presumed actus reus or mens rea was not present.
The presumption of mens rea under s 17 can be rebutted, as was the case under the old s 17, if the accused shows on a balance of probabilities that he possessed the drugs for his own consumption, or for purposes other than trafficking. In the present case, the presumption of mens rea has not been rebutted, as the accused has not adduced any evidence to show that the drugs were in his possession for purposes other than trafficking. Even if he did try to rebut this presumption, it would be an uphill task for him in view of the large quantity of diamorphine recovered, the presence of a whole array of paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking in his room, and the absence of any evidence that he himself was a drug abuser. Counsel for the defence based his argument solely on the rebutting of the presumption of actus reus.
Before considering how the presumption of actus reus is rebutted, the exact nature of the actus reus presumed by the section must first be determined. This is where the weakness of the drafting of s 17 becomes apparent. The ambiguity is wholly caused by the seemingly innocuous statement that any person who is proved to have had more than a certain quantity of controlled drugs in his possession shall `be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug`. There are three plausible interpretations of this.
(1) The appellant`s argument
Counsel for the appellant argued that since s 17 presumes the person in possession of the drugs to traffic in them and the definition of `traffic` is given in s 2, the effect is that the possessor is presumed to be performing one of the overt acts of trafficking at the time he is found in possession.
In this respect, counsel for the appellant put forward the contention that the presumption of s 17 cannot be invoked when at the time possession is proved it was impossible for the accused to be performing one of the overt acts of trafficking. No authorities directly on the point were relied on but counsel for the appellant cited in support the English decisions of 
DPP v Nock
 
[1978] 2 All ER 654
[1978] 3 WLR 57
 and 
Haughton v Smith
 
[1975] AC 476
[1973] 3 All ER 1109
[1974] 3 WLR 1
 and the local decision of 
Munah bte Ali v PP
 
 
[1958] MLJ 159
  These authorities were decided in the context of an attempt or a conspiracy to commit an offence which was in the circumstances impossible to be committed and do not have any bearing on the question when a presumption can or cannot be invoked. The reasoning in those cases cannot be extrapolated to the present case which deals with a wholly different issue. Moreover, it is not at all clear that an attempt to commit an impossible offence is not an offence under Singapore law: see Penal Code (Cap 224), s 511, Illustrations (a) and (b).
The appellant`s argument that the presumption of actus reus is rebutted if the evidence shows on a balance of probabilities that the accused was not engaged in one of the overt acts of trafficking at the time specified in the charge is, in our view, more formidable. It makes a lot of sense to say that if the accused is by virtue of s 17 presumed to be performing the act of trafficking at a specified time and place, this presumption must be rebutted if the accused shows on a balance of probabilities that at the specified time and place he was not or could not be engaging in the act of trafficking as defined in the Act itself. Indeed, if the above interpretation of s 17 is correct, this conclusion appears inescapable. Counsel for the defence also sought to boost his argument with the well-established rule that statutes creating criminal liability are to be construed strictly in favour of the accused.
However, closer examination of the argument and its impact on the utility of s 17 casts grave doubts on its validity. If accepted as the law, the presumption of actus reus in s 17 would be rendered impotent in most cases. Section 17 is invoked when the prosecution can prove possession of the controlled drug but not an overt act of trafficking. The provision would be self-defeating if its correct interpretation is that the presumption can be rebutted simply by showing on a balance of probabilities that the accused at the time of possession was not engaged in an overt act of trafficking, as the inability of the prosecution to adduce evidence of something more than possession was precisely the reason why s 17 was amended in the first place. The anomalous consequence would be that the accused would be allowed to use the prosecution`s evidence of mere possession to his advantage by arguing that such evidence of mere possession clearly rebutted any presumption that he was performing one of the overt acts of trafficking.
Admittedly, the presumption of actus reus may come in useful in a situation where the conduct of the accused at the time he was found in possession suggests that he was trafficking or was consistent with trafficking. In such a situation the presumption would be of real assistance to the prosecution as the evidence by itself would be insufficient to establish a prima facie case of trafficking, and the accused cannot argue that the prosecution`s own evidence has rebutted the presumption. However, this sort of situation is not at all common.
The clear words of s 17 are that an offence of trafficking is presumed from the mere act of possession of more than a certain quantity of controlled drugs. It cannot be that this presumption serves no purpose in cases where the accused was only proved to be in possession and is usefully invoked only when there is the act of possession and some additional evidence of trafficking. As pointed out above, the absence of any evidence of trafficking was the main reason why s 17 could be invoked. The clear words of s 17 indicate that a real and effective presumption of trafficking comes into play whenever possession of more than a certain quantity of drugs is proved.
(2) Presumed to have trafficked
Another possible interpretation is that s 17 creates a presumption that the accused had trafficked in the drugs found in his possession, 
 but not necessarily at the time at which he was proved to have been in possession 
. Section 17 is construed as presuming that the accused must have trafficked the drugs at the time of his arrest or at some time prior to it. Thus the presumption of actus reus can be rebutted only if the accused proves that 
 he had not performed one of the overt acts of trafficking in the drugs at all, whether at the time at which he was proved to be in possession or prior to that 
. It would not be rebutted simply because the accused was not engaged or was not in a position to be engaged in an act of trafficking at the time possession is proved.
This interpretation would ensure that s 17 is not deprived of the teeth Parliament intended it to have. Once the accused is found in possession of controlled drugs, a burden is cast on him to show on a balance of probabilities that he had never performed one of the overt acts of trafficking in connection with those controlled drugs. The relevant evidence with regard to this would include the presence of paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking, the amount of drugs proved to be in the possession of the accused, whether the accused was a drug abuser himself, explanations of how the drugs came to be in his possession and corroboration of this, if any, and so on.
However, there are a number of objections to this interpretation. The most obvious one is that the interpretation does not seem to be borne out by the literal meaning of the words in s 17. The words used are `to traffic`, in contra-distinction to the words `to have trafficked`, and they strongly suggest that the effect is that the possessor of the drugs is presumed to be trafficking at the time he was in such possession.
(3) Act of possession presumed to be act of trafficking
This interpretation, though not an obvious one at first glance, is one which is in accord with both the wording and the intention of s 17. The clear words of s 17 presume the act of possession to be an act of trafficking. As the trial judge in the High Court pointed out, s 17 has the effect of escalating the act of illicit possession to one of trafficking. The provision when invoked thus presumes the actus reus of possession to be the actus reus of trafficking. As such it must presuppose that an act of possession can in certain circumstances amount to an act of trafficking. The presumption thus merely relieves the prosecution of the burden of proving the existence of certain circumstances which compel the act to assume a different legal character.
The overt acts of trafficking may be a continuous progressive act and possession may be an act in the course of performing any of these overt acts. The crucial proposition is that an act of possession can theoretically amount to an act of trafficking if it is committed in the course of such an ongoing and progressive overt act of trafficking. Thus, when s 17 is invoked, 
 the act of possession is presumed to be an act of possession in the course of selling, giving, transporting and so on, or offering to do so, and thus the act of possession is presumed to be the act of trafficking 
.
This interpretation is in fact the clear literal meaning of the words in s 17. The phrase `presumed 
 to traffic 
` clearly indicates that the accused is presumed to be in the course of trafficking at the time he is proved to be in possession. The interpretation is also consistent with the definition of `traffic` in s 2, as the act of possession is consistent with, though not an essential feature of, all the overt acts of trafficking listed in s 2.
The accused can rebut the presumption of actus reus in s 17 by showing on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were not in his possession in the course of an overt act of trafficking. The relevant evidence with regard to this would include the presence of paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking, the amount of drugs proved to be in the possession of the accused, whether the accused was a drug abuser himself, explanations of how the drugs came to be in his possession and corroboration of this, if any, and so on. Of course, this is highly similar to the proof required to rebut the presumption of mens rea under s 17, and in most cases if the presumption of mens rea has been rebutted the presumption of actus reus would also have been rebutted.
The only possible objection to such a wide reading of s 17 is that it may be potentially unfair to an accused, as an act of possession can be presumed to be any, or an offer to do any, of the seven overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2 of the Act. It would be unduly burdensome for the accused to show that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of performing any of these acts. Furthermore, s 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(`the CPC`) provides that where the nature of the case is such that the particulars as to time and place do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.
Therefore, if this interpretation is adopted, the particulars in the charge with respect to the manner of trafficking should be more specifically stated. The charge, in accordance with s 160 of the CPC, should state the form of trafficking, that is, which of the overt acts of trafficking in s 2 the accused is charged with. This requires a change from the old law but would be necessitated by the wide-ranging effect of s 17 introduced by the amendment. In 
 Lim Hong Yap v PP 
8 the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal held that, in a case of drug trafficking, it was not necessary for the charge to give particulars of the manner in which the trafficking of a controlled drug was committed. That case was premised on there being sufficient notice given to the accused of the matter with which he was charged, even if the manner of trafficking was not set out in the charge. This is no longer so with the effect of the presumption of s 17 as interpreted above.
The charge should thus be amended to specify the manner of trafficking which should be stated in the charge. The words ` 
 by offering to sell or distribute 
, ...` should appear in the charge immediately after the words `did traffic in`. The accused should therefore be charged that he `did traffic in, by offering to sell or distribute, a controlled drug ...`.
 Amendment of charge by Court of Criminal Appeal
Since the last interpretation would involve amendment of the charge by this court, it would be pertinent to set out the principles applicable.
It is clear that the Court of Criminal Appeal has the power to alter the charge. The trial court may alter any charge at any time before judgment is given: s 163(1) of the CPC. The Court of Criminal Appeal is empowered to make any order as it may think just, and may by such order exercise such power which the trial court might have exercised: Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)(`the SCJA`), s 54(1).
This power must be exercised judiciously. When the trial court alters a charge, certain procedures are provided for in ss 163 to 166 of the CPC. The Court of Criminal Appeal is not bound by these procedures as it is not subject to the CPC in this respect: see s 6 of the CPC. It derives its powers to decide criminal appeals solely by virtue of the SCJA. As such, the possibility of prejudice to the accused (or the prosecution) must be of utmost concern when this court decides on whether to alter a charge.
A similar power to alter a charge is given to the Malaysian Supreme Court (and previously, to the Federal Court) under the corresponding provision of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (`the CJA`), which for present purposes is identical to s 54 of the SCJA. This power was exercised by the Federal Court in 
PP v Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  where it substituted certain clauses in the charge. The accused in this case was the manager of a bank and had approved payment of cheques to another person in excess of the latter`s overdraft facilities, and the accused had no authority to give such overdraft facilities. He was charged with the offence of criminal breach of trust under s 408 of the Malaysian Penal Code. The charge stated that the accused had disposed of property entrusted to him in violation of the direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust was to be discharged. The accused was convicted by the High Court. The Federal Court pointed out that the act of the accused was not in violation of any direction of law but rather in violation of a legal contract touching the discharge of the trust. As such, the wrong limb of s 408 had been set out in the charge. The Federal Court substituted the clause accordingly. The court was of the view that the amendment would not occasion any injustice as the defence of the accused was that he had implied authority to do the acts and this defence if believed would be a complete answer to the charge. The court then upheld the conviction of the accused on the amended charge.
In 
Yap Sing Hock v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 MLJ 714
  the charge stated that the two accused were directors of a certain company but the prosecution failed to prove this beyond reasonable doubt. The Malaysian Supreme Court refused to exercise the power given by the CJA to amend the charge by deleting the words `to wit, directors` to preserve the conviction upheld by the High Court. The issue of whether the accused were directors had been one all parties had concentrated their energies on and the prosecution had never suggested an amendment. The court thus declined to amend the charge as it was of the view that it could not allow the amendment without being unfair or appearing to be unfair to one of the two sides.
In the present case, the principles in 
Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  would be applicable, and the amendment would simply specify the manner of trafficking. As in 
Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  such an amendment would not occasion any injustice. If the accused had actively tried to adduce evidence that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of trafficking the court might be slow to amend the charge and instead hold that the charge was defective. The fact that the charge was too widely framed may have made his task unjustifiably burdensome. However, in the present case the accused chose to remain silent and it cannot be said that the fact that the charge was widely framed deprived him of a chance to establish a defence. The charge can thus be amended and the accused convicted accordingly.
In our view, as the drugs were recovered in his room, the appellant in this case clearly had possession of the drugs, there was much more than two grammes of it, and by s 17 he was presumed to traffic in it. But we would exercise our power to amend the charge by inserting the words `by offering to sell or distribute`, after the words `did traffic in` in the charge. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

On 12 January 1993 the appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to a charge of giving false information to a public servant in 1989, contrary to s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). She had made a false police report stating that she had lost her Singapore passport, when in fact she had sold it for $500 while in need of money. The maximum penalty under s 182 of the Penal Code was a $1,000 fine and 6 months` imprisonment. She told the district court that she had to look after two children and had a heart ailment and a gastric ulcer.
She was convicted and sentenced to two months` imprisonment, and appealed against this sentence as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal and now give reasons for my decision.
Before this court, counsel for the appellant relied upon several arguments which had not been put before the district court, when the appellant had been unrepresented. She had made no financial gain and had in the past contributed voluntary public service. I considered these factors to be legitimate mitigating factors but of very little weight.
Counsel also contended that the district judge had taken into account matters that were irrelevant and adverse to the appellant, because he had said in his grounds of decision that traffic in Singapore passports was not only difficult to curb, but also prejudicial to the reputation of our passports and the convenience of Singapore citizens when travelling abroad. It was submitted that these were not facts before the district court and so could not be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence. I had no difficulty rejecting this argument for confusing what are plainly general policy considerations with factual considerations.
Of particular concern to me were two arguments, first, that the appellant had only been driven to commit the offence she pleaded guilty to as a result of financial hardship and, second, that as she was the mother of two young children, undue hardship would be caused by the sentence.
I considered a number of references in support of the legitimacy of financial hardship in mitigation of sentence. In 
 R v Oakes, 
 an unreported case of 1974, the UK Court of Appeal reduced from two years to 15 months the sentence imposed upon an appellant, a car salesman, who had pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of obtaining by deception. Apparently he had overstretched his financial resources in an attempt to regain his wife, who had left him. Having committed himself to debts he could not possibly repay, he kept back money paid to him on behalf of his principal, amounting to a total of Â£960. Boreham J said: 
 
It was urged upon us that this man is going through a period of deep emotional stress and severe financial stringency. There is no doubt that this court can accept that. He is put before us as a man who is capable and anxious to work hard in order to support himself and his family. He accepts, as this court understands, that he is a man who is capable of earning good money but he has very little knowledge or acumen in dealing with that money.
 
 
 
Counsel cited 
 Lim Kim Seng and Anor v PP, 
 where the appellants had been convicted of four charges of robbery. It seems that they had decided to rob after having lost at gambling. The district judge said as follows: 
 
In mitigation, the learned counsel for both the accused informed the court to the effect that his clients had had no alternative but to commit the offences in question as they had been under pressure from bookies and loan sharks to whom they had become heavily indebted from losses incurred in betting on horse-racing. In my view, if those were indeed the instructions received from both the accused they would have been better left unsaid, since they hardly provided anything that could be considered as being mitigatory of what they had committed.
 
 
 
Before the High Court, it was submitted that it was not unusual for persons in debt to be constantly harassed and threatened by bookies and loan sharks for the return of money. It was further submitted that the district judge had rejected this argument without considering whether it had merits. KS Rajah JC accepted this submission, saying as follows: 
 
The learned senior district judge`s view that the instructions given to counsel would have been better left unsaid, since they hardly provided anything that could be mitigatory suggests sufficient consideration was not given before the fact was rejected. I am not satisfied that there was an open mind when the sentencing judge assessed this factor ... 
 Financial difficulties, where present before the commission of an offence, may be considered in mitigation of a sentence but it is not likely to have much effect if the offence committed is a serious offence. It may, as in this case, counted [sic] for nothing, but it should have been considered
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Before me, counsel relied upon this highlighted passage, but it must be understood in context. With respect, it seems equally valid to construe the lower court as having in fact considered this factor but deciding that, far from being mitigatory, those particular financial difficulties did the appellants no service in the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, if the learned judicial commissioner had thus interpreted the lower court`s decision, he would not have said that financial difficulties fail to be effective mitigation only in cases of `serious offences`. He might well have found it necessary then to go on to say that they are ineffective in a much wider range of cases.
All too often, it is stated in mitigation of an offence, frequently an offence against property, that the offender was motivated by the need for money, perhaps to purchase drugs to feed an addiction, or to pay off gambling debts, or to relieve some urgent need that arose because he had been unwise or profligate. For my part, I find this argument to be entirely unmeritorious in these cases. The whole purpose of the law is to maintain order and discipline, and that is most necessary precisely when the citizen might be inclined to act to the prejudice of good order. Thus I am not inclined to follow 
 R v Oakes. 
 It may well be that some very exceptional or extreme circumstances may arise warranting the constitution of those financial difficulties as a mitigating factor, the weight attributed to it to be at the discretion of the court. However these circumstances will be very rare, if indeed they ever occur.
As for the argument that, the appellant being a divorcee with two young children, her imprisonment would cause hardship to the family, this is in my opinion not an argument which should normally be taken into account for the purposes of sentence. Most of the time, imprisoning the main or sole breadwinner of a family unavoidably causes hardship to his family. In 
 R v Ingham, 
 Lord Widgery CJ said as follows: 
 
... it is not altogether an easy case, but of course this always happens, time and time again, that imprisonment of the father inevitably causes hardship to the rest of the family. If we were to listen to this kind of argument regularly and normally in the cases that come before us, we should be considering not the necessary punishment for the offender but the extent to which his wife and family might be prejudiced by it. The crux of the matter is that part of the price to pay when committing a crime is that imprisonment does involve hardship on the wife and family, and it cannot be one of the factors which can affect what would otherwise be the right sentence.
 
 
 
We do not think this is a case which is so unusual in its individual factors as to justify us departing from the general principle. One cannot modify a sentence on the husband merely because the wife and family, or prospective family, will suffer.
I am fully in agreement with this passage. I have also considered 
 R v Parkinson, 
 in which the Court of Appeal reduced the imprisonment term of a young woman who was the mother of two young children, even though she was not a single parent. The circumstances which might persuade a court, in mercy, to reduce what would otherwise be the proper sentence cannot be prescribed and will vary not only from one jurisdiction to another but also from case to case. It seems to me that they ought to be quite exceptional before a reduction of the proper sentence would be justified.
In view of these conclusions, I was not inclined to reduce the sentence. Counsel cited previous similar cases in support of the argument of consistency in sentencing. There is one case from 1992, 
 PP v Leong Wing Fatt 
, in which the offender was fined either $900 or $1,000, and another from 1989, 
 PP v Yeo Buck Lim 
, where Wee Chong Jin CJ reduced a two-month imprisonment term to a fine of $1,000 and one day`s imprisonment. However, it is impossible to discern the detailed circumstances of each case and the reasons for the sentences. Accordingly I rejected this argument and dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiffs are the management corporation of a condominium known as Bayshore Park. In the development of this condominium, the defendants were the developers, the first third party were the building contractors, the second third party were the architects and the third third party were the structural engineers.
The plaintiffs claim damages arising from alleged faulty construction of certain areas of the common property. It is alleged that the faulty construction of the ceiling of certain basement car parks has resulted in the spalling of concrete. It is also alleged that the faulty construction of certain common areas and corridors around the lift lobbies has resulted in a problem of water ponding in those areas.
The defendants obtained an order for certain points of law to be determined as preliminary issues under O 33 r 2 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990. The questions as framed were in rather elaborate terms, but they can, I believe, be reduced to two basic questions. Firstly, is it competent for the management corporation to sue in its own name for the alleged defects in construction of these parts of the common property? Secondly, since the damages recoverable would be damages for a pure economic loss in the form of the cost of repair, is the management corporation barred from making such a claim on that ground?
At the hearing, plaintiffs` counsel objected to the participation of counsel for the third parties on the ground that the proceedings concerned only the plaintiffs and the defendants. On the counsel of the third parties undertaking that their respective clients would be bound by the decision of the court on the questions submitted for determination, counsel for all the third parties were allowed to take part in the proceedings.
 Relevant provisions of the Act
The ownership, control, management and administration of condominiums are regulated by the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed). The word `condominium` is nowhere used in the Act, but it is a popular and convenient term and I shall use it in this judgment. The concept is based on the subdivision of a building or buildings containing units for which separate certificates of title are intended to be issued. Physically, a condominium basically consists of two parts, the units owned by the individual owners and the shared facilities outside the individually-owned units referred to collectively as the common property. The individually-owned units are referred to in the Act as `lots`, and the building or buildings containing the units is, or are collectively, referred to as the `subdivided building`. The owners of the individual lots are referred to as `subsidiary proprietors`. The whole of the land comprised in the condominium is referred to as the `parcel`.
The developer of a condominium has to submit to the Commissioner of Buildings for his approval a schedule of share values allotted to the lots in the condominium. The share value attached to a lot is of importance in at least three ways. Firstly, it determines the voting rights of a subsidiary proprietor in meetings of the subsidiary proprietors or of the management corporation. Secondly, it determines his share of the amount of contribution to be made to the management fund of the management corporation. Thirdly, and of relevance to the matter at hand, it determines the subsidiary proprietor`s share in the ownership of the common property, for it is provided by s 13(1) of the Act that the common property is owned by the subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common in proportion to the share values attached to their respective lots.
The developer of a condominium is required to apply to the Registrar of Titles for registration of a strata title plan approved by the Chief Surveyor. The strata title plan is required to show, among other things, the share values of the lots comprised in the subdivided building, the boundaries of the lots and a legend of all the common property. Section 33(1) of the Act provides that upon the registration of the strata title plan by the Registrar, the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in the subdivided building shall constitute the management corporation.
 Common property: developers` contractual duty as to construction
Developers of condominiums are more likely than not controlled by the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act (Cap 130), and the sale and purchase agreements which they enter into with purchasers of the units in the condominium are in the standard form prescribed by the Controller of Housing. That is the position in the instant case. Of the provisions of the sale and purchase agreements entered into between the defendants and the purchasers, cll 8(1) and 9 are of special relevance. Clause 8(1) provides as follows: 
 
8(1) The housing unit and the building project together with all the common property thereto shall be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with the specifications described in the second schedule hereto and in accordance with the plans approved by the assistant director, or other competent authority, which specifications and plans have been accepted and approved by the purchaser as the purchaser hereby acknowledges.
 
 
 
Clause 9 provides as follows: 
 
(9) The vendor shall at its own cost and expense cause to be constructed the roads, driveways, car parks, drains, culverts, sewerage mains, water works, sewerage plant, serving the housing unit and the building project in accordance with the requirements and standards of the local authority. The vendor shall at its own costs and expense cause to be laid all necessary water, electricity and sewerage mains to serve the housing unit and the building project and cause the internal mains and the sanitary installations of the housing unit to be connected to the water, electricity and sewerage mains of the local authority or the sewerage plant for the building project.
 
 
 
 
 Maintenance of common property prior to taking over by management corporation
 
The initial responsibility for keeping the common property of a condominium under development, or immediately after completion of development, rests with the developer himself, and there are statutory provisions to ensure that he carries out this responsibility. Thus, under s 4 of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act (Cap 30), where any building or common property has not been kept or maintained in a state of good and serviceable repair or in a proper and clean condition, the Commissioner of Buildings may by notice require the owner to carry out such repairs or maintenance as he thinks fit. An owner who fails to comply with the notice is guilty of a offence. If the notice is not complied with to his satisfaction, the Commissioner or any person authorized by him may carry out the works required. The Commissioner may require the owner of the building or common property to deposit an amount necessary in his opinion for the purpose of carrying out the works required, and he may deduct from the deposit any cost incurred in carrying out the works required.
Under s 9 of the same Act, if the developer has sold units in the development to more than two purchasers, then, as soon as a temporary occupation licence has been issued in respect of any flat in the development, he has to set up a maintenance fund to be used for the maintenance of the common property. He has to pay into this fund all the maintenance charges which he is authorized by the Commissioner of Buildings to collect from the purchasers. He has himself also to contribute and pay into the management fund maintenance charges in respect of units which have not been sold. Upon the formation of the management corporation, any balance of the management fund must be transferred to the management corporation.
Section 16 requires the developer of a condominium to deposit with the Commissioner a sum determined in accordance with rules made under the Act, and the Commissioner is authorized to use the deposit for the purpose of carrying out any work which is necessary to rectify any defects in the common property of the development.
In summary, it can be seen that the developer of a condominium has a responsibility, both under statute and under his contracts with the purchasers, to see to the proper construction, management and maintenance of the common property in a condominium. The management and maintenance of the common property passes to the management corporation when the latter comes into being. There are transitional provisions concerning the common property before the holding of the first annual general meeting of the management corporation which, however, I do not need to refer to in any detail.
 Management corporation: Responsibilities and powers
The management corporation is charged by s 48 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed)) with the duties of controlling managing and administering the common property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors. It is required to properly maintain the common property and keep it in a state of good and serviceable repair, renewing and replacing any fixtures and fittings when necessary.
To enable the management corporation to carry out its duties under the Act, the Act empowers the management corporation in general meeting to determine the amount of contributions to the management fund (by reference to the share value of each lot) to be levied on the subsidiary proprietors .
There is provision in s 120 of the Act imposing a criminal liability for breach by the management corporation of its duties under Pt IV of the Act (containing inter alia provisions regarding the management corporation`s duties in relation to the common property). In the event of a breach of the duty to keep and maintain common property in good and serviceable repair, s 4 of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act, mentioned above, is also wide enough to enable the Commissioner to issue the necessary notice to compel the management corporation to carry out or pay for the carrying out of works required to keep it in good and serviceable repair; the word `owner` is defined in that Act to include a management corporation.
Section 120 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act also provides that any person for whose benefit a requirement or duty is imposed on a management corporation by Pt IV of the Act may apply to court to compel the management corporation to carry out the requirement or to perform the duty. Presumably, a subsidiary proprietor may resort to court if the management corporation fails to carry out its duties in relation to the common property.
Against all this legislative background, I turn to the questions at hand. The plaintiffs base their right to sue on ss 33 and 119 of the Act. I consider each of these sections in turn.
 Section 33 of the Act
The relevant provisions of s 33 are as follows: 
 
(1) The subsidiary proprietors from time to time of the lots in a subdivided building comprised in a strata title plan shall, by virtue of this Act, upon registration of the strata title plan - 
(a) constitute a body corporate capable of suing and being sued and having perpetual succession and a common seal; and 
...
 
 
 
(2) The management corporation may - 
(a) sue and be sued on any contract made by it; 
(b) sue and be sued in respect of any matter affecting the common property; 
(c) sue in respect of any loss or damage suffered by a management corporation arising out of a contract or otherwise, and 
(d) be sued in respect of any matter connected with the parcel for which the subsidiary proprietors are jointly liable.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs rely on sub-s (2) as giving them the right to sue. The defendants argue that that subsection only gives the management corporation the capacity to sue and does not deal with the causes of action for which the management corporation can sue. I respectfully disagree with the defence submission. It is clear that sub-s (1) already deals with the capacity question, in the sense that the management corporation can sue in its own name. The function of sub-s (2) is to list the matters in respect of which the management corporation can sue or be sued. These include, in (b), all matters affecting the common property and, in (c), any loss or damage arising out of contract or otherwise.
As stated above, the management corporation is under a duty to maintain the common property and to keep it in good repair. It follows, in my view, that where there is a defect in the common property capable of being made good by repair, it is the duty of the management corporation to carry out the repair. It is surely part of any good management of common property to effect necessary repairs to the common property, whether the necessity has arisen from ordinary wear and tear or from defects in the original construction of the common property. It cannot sensibly be argued that the management corporation`s duty is confined to the former and that it only needs to keep the latter from getting worse.
I find apposite the following dictum of Lord Patrick in at p 677: 
 
It is true that the primary meaning of the word `repair` is to restore to sound condition that which has previously been sound, but the word is also properly used in the sense of to make good. Moreover, the word is commonly used to describe the operation of making an article good or sound, irrespective of whether the article has been good or sound before.
 
 
 
Needham J in had to consider the effect of s 68(1) of the New South Wales Act, which is in similar (but not exactly the same) terms to s 48(1)(a) and (b) of our Act. Referring to the above dictum of Lord Patrick, Needham J said: 
 
I think that that interpretation should be applied to the word `repair` in s 68, firstly, because it is the ordinary meaning of the word but, secondly, because, if the power to make good that which was not good before does not vest in the body corporate under the legislation, there is a gap in the legislation which would mean that nobody had power to perform that duty, no matter how necessary it might be in any particular case.
 
 
 
I wholly and respectfully agree with these pronouncements.
The cost of repair incurred is defrayed from the maintenance fund made up of contributions from the subsidiary proprietors. It is the management corporation that thus sustains the loss in having to defray such cost, although it is the subsidiary proprietors on whom the contributions to the management fund are levied in the first place. If the defect has been due to the negligence in the design or construction of the building by the developer, then, prima facie, and subject to the economic loss argument below, the management corporation is entitled to sue the developer for the loss resulting from the defect.
 Common property: subsidiary proprietors` ownership
Defendants` counsel argues that because the ownership of the common property is by s 13(1) of the Act vested in the subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common and not in the management corporation, it is the subsidiary proprietors, rather than the management corporation, who have the right to sue the developer for any defects in the common property that might be attributable to the developer.
I respectfully disagree. In the first place, if counsel`s argument is correct, there would have been no necessity to enact s 33(2) giving the management corporation the power to sue in respect of any matter affecting the common property. The subsection contains no limitation as to the type of matters concerning the common property in respect of which the management corporation can sue or be sued or as to the circumstances in which such suits may be brought by or against the management corporation. Secondly, the common property is under the control, management and administration of the management corporation, and it is also the management corporation, rather than the individual subsidiary proprietors, who have the duty to keep it in good and serviceable repair. Thirdly, it is obviously more convenient for the management corporation, operating under well-defined decision-making procedures prescribed by the Act and bye-laws, to take proceedings in respect of any matter concerning the common property, rather than for the subsidiary proprietors as individual subsidiary proprietors to do so. There is no reason for any particular subsidiary proprietors whose property is not specially affected by defects in the common property, to take the initiative of suing. This is of special relevance in a large condominium with many subsidiary proprietors, some of whom might be more affected by the defects than others.
I am therefore of the view that it is consistent with the purpose and objective of the Act that, in regard to common property in general, it is the management corporation, rather than the subsidiary proprietors, which should normally be the party to sue and to be sued. Such proceedings are for the account of the management corporation as management corporation.
The fact that legal ownership of the common property by the Act vests in the subsidiary proprietors has very little practical significance in the ordinary functioning of a condominium. In ordinary circumstances, a subsidiary proprietor`s liability and obligation vis-a-vis the common property is merely to contribute to the management fund in the amount determined by the management corporation in general meeting. Unlike owners of property not subject to the Act, the individual subsidiary proprietors as subsidiary proprietors do not have any responsibility vis-a-vis the maintenance and repair of the common property. They also do not have to account to each other in respect of moneys expended on the maintenance and repair of the common property. It thus seems to me that in ordinary circumstances the subsidiary proprietors` ownership of the common property as tenants-in-common carries with it no incidents of ownership in any practical sense. It probably assumes a significance if and when the strata subdivision scheme is terminated in accordance with Pt V of the Act and the subsidiary proprietors` interest in the parcel is to be accounted for. See s 78, particularly sub-s (6).
 Building defects occurring before formation of management corporation
A question was also raised whether the management corporation is barred from suing the defendants on the ground that the defective construction alleged had taken place before the management corporation came into existence. No evidence was produced to me as to when the strata title plan was registered, that being the moment the management corporation came into being, as stated above. But I do not think that it matters. I would deal with the question on broader considerations.
The developer of a condominium knows from the moment he conceives of his plan to develop it that a management corporation will come into being as a matter of course on the implementation of the plan. The management corporation in fact is his own creation, although it does not come into existence by law until the strata title plan has been registered by the Registrar of Titles. The duty to construct the common property in a good workmanlike manner, if not implied as a matter of common law or common sense, is expressly provided in the standard terms of contract which he is required to use in selling the units to purchasers. The developer also knows, or should know, that if the common property is not properly constructed, the management corporation, which will surely come into being, will be exposed to liability for repair and to incurring cost in doing so. It seems to me that in these circumstances there is a clear duty on the part of the developer to the management corporation to see that the construction is properly carried out. If there is such a duty, it seems to me to be artificial and unreal in the extreme to seek to draw a distinction on the basis of whether the defects occurred before or after the formation of the management corporation, that is to say, before or after the moment the strata title plan is registered.
It is my view, therefore, that, again subject to the pure economic loss argument below, the management corporation can sue in respect of defects due to any improper construction of the common property, whether such defective construction took place before or after the management corporation was established. The only limitation is that provided by the Limitation Act (Cap 163).
 Section 116 of the Act
I now turn to s 116 of the Act. The section reads: 
 
(1) Where all or some of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in a subdivided building are jointly entitled to take proceedings against any person or are liable to have proceedings taken against them jointly (any such proceedings being proceedings for or with respect to common property), the proceedings may be taken by or against the management corporation as if it were the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned and any judgment or order given or made in favour of or against the management corporation in any such proceedings shall have effect as if it were a judgment or order given or made in favour of or against the subsidiary proprietors.
(2) Where a subsidiary proprietor is liable to make a contribution to another subsidiary proprietary in respect of a judgment debt arising under a judgment referred to in subsection (1), the amount of that contribution shall bear to the judgment debt the same proportion as the share value of the lot of the first-mentioned subsidiary proprietor bears to the aggregate share value.
 
 
 
I do not find it easy to interpret this section. Given that there are already provisions in s 33 enabling the management corporation to sue in respect of any matter concerning the common property, it is difficult to see that there should be any need for this section. I assume, however, that the legislature does not enact anything in vain. I should assume that s 116 is intended to serve a purpose different from that served by s 33.
The section has its parallel in s 147 of the Strata Tiles Act 1973 of New South Wales, but there are significant differences in wording. Instead of a reference to all subsidiary proprietors jointly in s 147, the reference in s 116 is to `all or some` subsidiary proprietors. There is scant authority on s 147. Furthermore, there does not appear to be any provision in the New South Wales legislation equivalent to s 33(2) of our Act (concerning the matters in respect of which the management corporation may sue or be sued), or at least my attention has not been drawn to any. So I have to attempt to determine the respective spheres of application of ss 33(2) and 116(1) quite unaided. I do not have all the answers, but the terms in which s 116(1) is cast leads me to think that it is probably intended to cover cases where individual lots affect specially, or are affected specially by, the common property. Note the words `as if [the management corporation] were the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned`, particularly the words `the lots concerned`. These words seem to be apt to cover situations where something exists in some or all of the individual lots which specially and adversely affects the common property, or where something exists in the common property which specially and adversely affects some or all the lots in the condominium. An example would be where a common roof has been so poorly constructed that water leaks through it and adversely affects all or some of the units in the condominium. The subsidiary proprietors of the lots affected could take action under their sale and purchase agreements against the developer. Instead of those affected taking individual actions against the developer or joining in one action with numerous plaintiffs, the management corporation may, under this section, take action in its own name but substantively on behalf of the subsidiary proprietors concerned. The proceedings would be for the account of the subsidiary proprietors.
This impression of the effect of s 116(1) is reinforced by the words at the end of the subsection referring to a judgment or order obtained in such proceedings as having effect as if it was a judgment or order given or made in favour of or against the subsidiary proprietors concerned. If the proceedings were about aspects of the common property which do not specially affect particular lots or which are not specially affected by something in the particular lots, then on my view of the matter as I have expressed it when discussing s 33 above, there is hardly any need for such a provision. The judgment would simply be for or against the management corporation as management corporation.
This impression of the effect of s 116(1) is also reinforced by the provision of sub-s (2) of that section, which speaks of a subsidiary proprietor making a contribution to another subsidiary proprietor in respect of a judgment debt arising under a judgment referred to sub-s (1).
The following section, s 117, provides that where the condition of a lot affects the support or shelter provided by that lot for the common property and the subsidiary proprietor of that lot neglects to take proceedings to get that condition rectified, the management corporation may take such proceedings as the agent of the subsidiary proprietor but at its own cost. It seems to me that this is an extension of the principle of s 116 to the situation where only one particular lot is specially concerned, an extension of `all or same` in s 116(1) to a single lot.
If my view is correct, then s 116 would have no application to situations where no particular lots are specially affected by, or specially affect, the common property. Take the case of a dust bin centre or a visitors` car park, or a swimming pool, not constructed properly. The defect affects no lots in particular but it does affect the general body of owners in their enjoyment of the common facilities and amenities of the condominium. In these situations, it would be unrealistic to expect individual subsidiary proprietors, as subsidiary proprietors, to take proceedings. The management corporation is the suitable party to sue. It sues in its own name, on its own behalf and for its own account, and it sues under s 33(2), not s 116(1).
In the recent case of , it was alleged that the water system serving a condominium had been constructed in breach of cll 8 and 9 of the standard sale and purchase agreement in similar terms to those of the clauses in the agreements in the instant case. It was further alleged that as a result of the breach the purchasers had to expend money to repair the pipe bursts. The suit was taken out by the management corporation on behalf of the purchasers. The defendants, who were the developers of the project, took a preliminary objection as to the management corporation`s title to sue. GP Selvam J held that s 116(1) of the Act enabled the management corporation to sue, provided the subject matter of the suit was limited to the common property. He held that the suit was not in the nature of a representative action under O 15 r 12(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990. He then said [at p 596]: 
 
The action, however, is properly brought for the subsidiary proprietors and their successors or assigns for it comes squarely under s 116 (1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. On the assumption that the claim relates only to common property, the plain words of s 116(1) entitle a management corporation to represent the subsidiary proprietors where the subsidiary proprietors have a cause of action whether it be an action in tort or contract. It is an action in a representative capacity authorized by statute.
 
 
 
The learned judge`s view and mine are one in that, in a proceeding under s 116, the management corporation represents the subsidiary proprietors. It is the subsidiary proprietors who are the substantive party, although the proceeding is in the name of the management corporation. GP Selvam J in that case appears not to have been called upon to express a view on the question which is before me, ie the respective spheres of application of ss 33(2) and 116(1).
My views on s 116 being what they are, it is not necessary for me to deal with the other points which have been raised in argument about s 116. However, in deference to the arguments of counsel, I would make observations on two points. Firstly, the defendants rely on the words `jointly entitled` and they submit that the subsidiary proprietors as purchasers from the defendants, under separate sale and purchase agreements, have, if at all, only several rights to sue, as opposed to a joint right to sue. They say the section does not allow the management corporation to take action in these circumstances.
It seems to me that the purpose of the section is to simplify the procedural, as opposed to the substantive, aspect of proceedings so as to avoid the need to name a large number of plaintiffs. I do not think that the operation of the section depends on whether the subsidiary proprietors concerned have a joint substantive right to sue. Neither is it affected by the fact that the subsidiary proprietors` ownership of the common property in a condominium is as tenants-in-common, rather than as joint tenants. I am of the view that the section could be given sensible application if the words `jointly entitled` are construed to refer to the procedural aspect of the proceedings sought to be taken rather than the substantive cause of action. Order 15 r 4 of the Rules of Supreme Court 1990, and the corresponding provisions in the Subordinate Courts Rules provide as follows: 
 
4(1) Subject to Rule 5(1), two or more persons may be joined together in one action as plaintiffs or as defendants with the leave of the Court or where - 
(a) if separate actions were brought by or against each of them, as the case may be, some common question of law or fact would arise in all the actions; and 
(b) all rights to relief claimed in the action (whether they are joint, several or alternative) are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions.
 
 
 
It is clear that under these procedural rules, joinder of parties as plaintiffs or defendants is dependent on whether common questions of law or fact would arise and whether the same transaction or series of transactions have given rise to the rights to the relief claimed. It does not depend on the rights to relief being joint. In fact para (b) of the rule specifically states that the rights to relief could be joint, several, or in the alternative.
My reading of s 116, therefore, is that if the subsidiary proprietors of the lots concerned may be joined as plaintiffs in proceedings in accordance with these procedural rules, then, instead of suing in their individual names in relation to anything to do with the common property, the management corporation may take proceedings on their behalf.
Secondly, again in response to a point raised in argument, it is my view that the subsidiary proprietors who wish to sue through the management corporation under s 116 need not be the original purchasers of the lots concerned, contrary to what has been suggested. There is nothing in the section that supports such a narrow reading. Seeing that sub-sales of units in a condominium, indeed of any real property, is a common occurrence, a reading like that suggested would drastically reduce the usefulness of the provision. The subsidiary proprietors referred to in the section must therefore be read to mean the subsidiary proprietors from time to time of the lots comprised in the subdivided building. This in fact is clearly provided in the definition of `subsidiary proprietor`, where the words `for the time being` are to be found.
Note that the prescribed sale and purchase agreement defines the vendor and purchaser as including their respective successors-in-title and assigns. In the case, GP Selvam J held that either direct purchasers or derivative title holders are the persons for whose benefit an action under s 116(1) may be brought.
There was also some argument as to whether cll 8 and 9 of the sale and purchase agreements contain covenants running with the land, and whether subsequent purchasers can rely on these covenants. What I have just said about s 116 makes it unnecessary to make any comment about this argument.
 Pure economic loss argument
The defendants contend that the loss which the plaintiffs seek to recover is in the nature of a pure economic loss in that it is a loss which has not resulted from injury to a person or damage to property. They rely on the House of Lords decision in . I do not intend to enter into a philosophical discourse on the general question whether a pure economic loss is recoverable in tort. I prefer to take the pragmatic route by simply asking myself whether the management corporation in this case should be allowed to recover the cost of putting right the alleged defects in the common property caused allegedly by the negligence of the defendants, such cost being admittedly in the nature of a pure economic loss as just defined.
In , the plaintiff bought a newly built house. Eleven years later, he noticed serious cracks in the internal walls and discovered that the raft foundation was defective. The plaintiff was unable to carry out the necessary repairs to the foundation. He sold the house subject to the defects for Â£35,000 less than what it would have fetched if it had been in a sound condition. He brought an action against the local authority claiming that it was liable for the consulting engineers` negligence in recommending approval of the plans and alleging that he and his family had suffered an imminent risk to health and safety because gas and soil pipes had broken and there was a risk of further breaks.
Although the case concerned a claim against a local authority, the liability of the builder came in for detailed consideration. Their lordships, overruling their earlier decision in , were unanimous in their view that, the loss being an economic loss, it was not recoverable in an action in tort against the local authority. Lord Bridge proceeded on the basis that the House had already held in that a builder in the absence of any contractual duty or of a special relationship of proximity introducing the 
 Hedley Byrne 
 [7] principle of reliance, owed no duty of care in tort in respect of the quality of his work. To hold that the builder owed such a duty of care to any person acquiring an interest in the product of the builder`s work would be `to impose on him the obligation of an indefinitely transmissible warranty of quality.`
Lord Keith agreed, saying: 
 
The existence of a duty of that nature should not, in my opinion, be affirmed without a careful examination of the implications of such affirmation. To start with, if such a duty is incumbent on the local authority, a similar duty must necessarily be incumbent also on the builder of the house. If the builder of the house is to be so subject, there can be no grounds in logic or in principle for not extending liability on like grounds to the manufacturer of a chattel. That would open on an exceedingly wide field of claims involving the introduction of something in the nature of a transmissible warranty of quality.
 
 
 
Notwithstanding these opinions, both Lord Bridge and Lord Keith recognized that where there is a relationship of proximity such losses would be recoverable. Lord Bridge put it thus: 
 
There may, of course, be situations where, even in the absence of contract, there is a special relation of proximity between builder and building owner which is sufficiently akin to contract to introduce the element of reliance so that the scope of the duty of care owed by the builder to the owner is wide enough to embrace purely economic loss.
 
 
 
In the Australian case of , Mason J said at p 32: 
 
The proposition that, in general, damages are not recoverable for economic loss unless it is consequential upon injury to the plaintiff`s personal property is by no means absolute or inflexible; it is a reflection of the law`s concern about endless indeterminate liability. In the absence of any such concern in a particular class of case there is no necessity to give effect to the proposition.
 
 
 
Deane J in the same case at p 63 said: 
 
In any general formulation of the ingredients of a cause of action in negligence which is intended to encompass cases involving mere omission or mere economic loss, `proximity` of relationship in this broader sense should be seen as a distinct general requirement which must be satisfied before any duty of care to avoid reasonably foreseeable injury will arise. ... In such case, as Mason J demonstrates in his judgment in this appeal, it is likely that the existence of the requisite element of proximity will reflect, among other things, reliance by the plaintiff upon care being taken by the defendant to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the plaintiff or his property in circumstances where the defendant had induced or encouraged such reliance or (depending upon the particular combination of factors) was or should have been aware of it.
 
 
 
These learned pronouncements in the two cases referred to are aptly applicable to the case at hand and I respectfully adopt them. It seems to me that the test of proximity is more than amply satisfied in the instant case. Short of actual privity, the relationship between the management corporation and the developer was as akin to contract as any relationship could possibly be. As pointed out earlier, the developer of a condominium knows that the management corporation will come into existence from the moment he conceives of a plan to develop it. He also knows that the management corporation will take over the control, management, and maintenance of the common property, and that if the common property is not properly constructed and is handed over to the management corporation in that state, the management corporation will have to incur cost to rectify the defects. Thus, the entity to which the duty is owed as well as the nature and extent of loss that is likely to be sustained by that entity are well known to the developer. In such circumstances, to hold that the developer has a duty towards the management corporation to construct the common property properly and is liable to the management corporation for a defective construction of the common property would not open a floodgate to unlimited claims by an unlimited class of persons. It would not carry any risk of introducing a transmissible warranty or quality, in the words of their Lordships in the case.4 I am therefore of the view that there is nothing in the case4 which stands in the way of the plaintiffs` claim in this case.
I hold, therefore, that the management corporation is entitled, subject to proof, to recover the cost of putting right the alleged defects in the common property caused by the alleged negligence of the defendants.
 Order accordingly.",1994-11-04 00:00:00,SG High Court

s 403 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to one charge under s 406(a) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed) and another charge under s 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The first charge alleged that the appellant, whilst an officer of a company known as Chabbra Corp Pte Ltd (the company) had, by dishonest means, induced UCO Bank, Singapore branch (the bank), to grant a term overdraft of $200,000 to the company. The second charge alleged that the appellant had dishonestly misappropriated the sum of $120,000. Having heard the appellant`s mitigation plea, the district judge imposed a sentence of nine months` imprisonment in respect of each charge and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. The present appeal was brought against sentence. Having reduced each sentence from nine months to six months (to run concurrently), I now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
In pleading guilty, the appellant admitted unreservedly to the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution below. This alleged that the appellant was at material times a director of the company which maintained accounts with the bank. On 21 April 1994 the company received in its fixed deposit account a sum of US$301,013.88 which had been wrongly credited as a result of a clerical error.
On 18 May 1994 the appellant applied for a temporary overdraft facility of $200,000 from the bank and proffered as security the sum of US$301,013.88 then lying in the company`s fixed deposit account. The statement of facts alleged that the bank granted the appellant the overdraft sought only because of this security and that the appellant offered the sum dishonestly, being fully aware that the moneys did not in fact belong to the company.
Shortly thereafter, on 24 May 1994, the appellant instructed the bank to close the company`s fixed deposit account and to credit US$100,000 of the moneys therein to the company`s current account. The remaining sum of US$201,013.88 was rolled over as a renewal fixed deposit and held by the bank as security for the temporary overdraft of $200,000. On 27 May 1994, however, the appellant instructed the bank to close the fixed deposit account and to credit the balance of US$201,013.88 to the company`s current account. These instructions were carried out on the same day and the appellant proceeded to withdraw a sum of $120,000 from the current account on 28 May 1994. The statement of facts alleged that this withdrawal amounted to a dishonest misappropriation of the moneys because the appellant knew at the material time that these moneys had been wrongly credited to the company`s fixed deposit account to begin with and that he was not entitled to them.
 The appeal
On appeal, the appellant contended that, although he had admitted to the above facts, the concurrent sentences of nine months` imprisonment were nevertheless manifestly excessive and that in fact the district judge had failed to accord sufficient weight to certain factors.
 (i) The appellant`s plea of guilt
Thus, for example, the appellant argued that the district judge had given insufficient weight to his plea of guilt in making the observation that `
 (a)lthough the [appellant] had pleaded guilty to the charges against him which is a mitigating factor, he did not do so at the earliest opportunity but on the day of the trial 
.` Assuming, however, that the remark indicated the district judge had given less weight to the appellant`s guilty plea, there was in my view justification for his so doing, having regard to the fact that the plea had come only before the commencement of the trial proper. One of the reasons credit is given to an accused for his guilty plea is, after all, the time and effort he saves the authorities, which time and effort would otherwise have to be expended on investigation and prosecution. In the present case, neither the police nor the prosecution had any indication that a guilty plea would be forthcoming until the day of the trial itself, so that a not inconsiderable amount of time was spent on investigative work and on getting up. It was said that the appellant had delayed his plea so that the fact of his having made restitution to the bank would be before the court when he eventually pleaded guilty. Even allowing, however, for the appellant`s anxiety to place the fact of restitution before the court, there was no reason why he could not have indicated to the prosecution before the trial his intention of pleading guilty. In any event it was open to the appellant to plead guilty first and then ask for sentencing to be deferred until after restitution had been completed.
 (ii) The appellant`s ignorance of the law
It was submitted also that the appellant was ignorant of the law and therefore believed his actions to be capable of attracting no more than civil liability. In my view, however, ignorance of the law can hardly ever be a mitigating factor. Quite apart from the fact that allowance for mitigation is not an entitlement of the accused, it has to be pointed out that a mitigating factor is something an accused is given credit for. It is difficult to see how credulity or ignorance might be said to be something for which the appellant should in this case be given credit.
 (iii) The appellant`s age
The appellant`s age (63 years) too was a factor canvassed in support of his appeal. There is, however, no general rule mandating the giving of a discount for offenders of mature years; and in , for example, a 70-year-old man was sentenced to two years` imprisonment for forgery.
 (iv) The appellant had no part in the mistake which caused the moneys to be wrongly credited to the company`s account
The appellant argued furthermore that he had played no part in the mistake which had led to the moneys being wrongly credited to the company`s account in the first place. In the context of the charges brought against him, however, I could not see how this in any way mitigated his culpability. The two charges in question were not concerned with the manner in which the moneys had found their way into the company`s account but with the appellant`s use of those moneys after they had been mistakenly credited to the account. The fact that the appellant had not induced the bank to effect this credit of funds simply meant that no additional charge of cheating could have been brought against him.
 (v) The charge under s 403 Penal Code is at the lowest end of the scale so far as offences against property are concerned
It was also contended by the appellant that the second charge under s 403 was one of the less serious offences against property provided for in the Penal Code. In itself, however, this was immaterial. So far as the question of sentence was concerned, there was no reason why the district judge should have speculated on the possibility of the appellant committing offences even more serious than those already charged.
 (vi) The appellant made full restitution of the moneys
Of more relevance, on the other hand, was the fact that the appellant had made full restitution to the bank.
Although in the court appeared at one point to be doubting the mitigating value of acts of restitution, a perusal of the entire judgment shows that the court`s concern was really directed at the apparent disparity in the sentences imposed on the two accused in the case. Only one of them had been financially able to make restitution and he received a suspended sentence, whereas the other accused received an immediate sentence. The court appeared particularly disturbed by the difference in their treatment, hence its remark that the fact that one accused had a source of finance while the other did not `[did] 
 not seem... to be a firm foundation for the administration of justice 
.` Regard should be had instead to the case of . The court in that case warned firstly that `
 this matter cannot be looked at simply from the point of view ... of people from whom money had been stolen 
` but then went on to reduce the accused`s three-year custodial sentence to 18 months on the ground that his attempts to make restitution of the stolen moneys demonstrated a `
 genuine, and we hope, continuous desire to pay 
` and reflected `
 this man`s character 
`.
Similarly, in the present case, it seemed to me that the appellant`s act in making restitution to the bank revealed on his part genuine remorse and basic good character, both factors of some mitigating force. I rejected the prosecution`s suggestion that the repayment had been made only under pressure. Whilst it is true that the appellant only made restitution of the moneys after police investigations had commenced, it is equally true that it was the police who informed him of the offence he had committed.
 (vii) The appellant`s status as a first offender
The appellant`s status as a first offender was another mitigating factor canvassed on appeal; and certainly, this is a factor generally accepted as having mitigating value: see for example .
 (viii) The tariff sentence
Most persuasive of all, however, was counsel`s argument that the sentences imposed on the appellant had been greatly in excess of the tariff sentences set for the offences in question. In particular, so far as the offence under s 406(a) of the Companies Act was concerned, counsel was able to cite to this court a precedent in which the chief executive director of a company dishonestly induced nine banks to give the company credit amounting to US$18m - a sum far larger than the $200,000 involved in the appellant`s case. This chief executive director too was a first offender and had managed to repay all moneys advanced. He was sentenced to nine months` imprisonment on each of the nine charges brought against him (first and second charges to run consecutively but concurrently with the other seven charges).
So far as the offence under s 403 of the Penal Code was concerned, it appeared also that a sentence of nine months` imprisonment went some considerable way beyond the tariff. It would seem that in most s 403 cases, a fine has been held to suffice, although it has to be noted that the amounts misappropriated in these cases were smaller than the sum of $100,000 misappropriated by the appellant. Thus in MA 362/93/02 for example, the accused, who faced two charges under s 403, was fined $4,000 in respect of the first charge and $8,000 in respect of the second.
In response the deputy public prosecutor contended that the nine-month sentences imposed on the appellant in this case were justified in view of the need to deter others from committing like offence. Of course, deterrence is a crucial factor in the sentencing process; and people should be deterred from dealing with moneys wrongly credited to them. Even allowing, however, for the deterrent effect called for, I was of the opinion that, on the facts of the case, the nine-month sentences exceeded by far the tariff sentences set for the two offences in question. This was especially so in view of the genuine mitigating factors prevailing in the appellant`s favour (which factors have been examined earlier in these grounds).
 Conclusion
Having regard to the foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal and reduced the sentences to six months on each charge (both sentences to run concurrently).

ss 109, 417 & 419 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The appellants were each convicted of two charges of abetment of cheating, an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). They pleaded guilty to the charges and had a similar third charge against each of them taken into consideration in sentencing. The first appellant was sentenced to two months` imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to run concurrently. The second appellant was sentenced to five months` imprisonment on each charge, the sentences likewise to run concurrently. Both appellants had been in remand for three weeks and this was taken into account by the learned judge. I dismissed the appellants` appeals against sentence and now give my reasons.
The essence of the charges was that the appellants had abetted two Chinese nationals in cheating an auxiliary police officer by the presentation of boarding passes in assumed names, in order that they would be allowed to board an aeroplane for a flight out of Singapore. These two Chinese nationals, Li Bao Quan and Wang Kong Xin, had been introduced by the first appellant to the second appellant for her to arrange for them to enter the USA with false passports. They handed their passports to the second appellant, who gave them to one Thomas Tham for their photographs to be substituted onto Singapore international passports. These passports were supplied by one David Ong Soon Peng. After the passports had been prepared, the second appellant purchased airline tickets and obtained boarding passes for the Chinese nationals in their assumed names. On the day of departure, the Chinese nationals passed through immigration with their genuine PRC passports, having also been checked in for a flight to Hong Kong which they had no intention of boarding. They then presented the boarding passes in assumed names for the SQ16 flight to the USA. They were discovered and arrested by the police.
The Chinese nationals were arrested, charged and convicted of cheating by impersonation under s 419 of the Code. They were each sentenced to three months` imprisonment. David Ong, who had supplied the passports, was convicted on three charges of abetting cheating by impersonation. He was sentenced to two years` imprisonment on each charge, with two of those terms to run consecutively. Twelve other charges were taken into consideration in sentencing.
 The first appellant
For the first appellant, it was contended in mitigation that there were strong extenuating circumstances in his favour. Counsel said that he had played a minor role in the abetment, merely introducing the two Chinese nationals to the second appellant. The Chinese nationals were relatives of members of the Foochow Hup Pek Association, of which the first appellant was an active committee member. Moreover, he had not committed the offences with the object of financial gain, nor had any financial loss been caused to any person. He had committed the offences only because he wanted to help the Chinese nationals to go to the USA because they could not bear living conditions in China. He had pleaded guilty. Furthermore, he was 63 years old, of good character and had contributed much to society, having spent much time in community service. An added consideration was the time that he had spent waiting for trial (though the appellants were charged in 1988, the case was only heard in February 1992).
Counsel`s main contention was that the `clang of prison gates` principle should be applied to the first appellant, and that the three weeks of remand was a sufficient period of custody. The principle was considered and applied by LP Thean J in 
 Siah Ooi Choe v PP 
 1 in which the learned judge said [at p 344]: `... the principle is that in the case of a man with an unblemished record, the fact that he has a criminal conviction and finds himself in prison is a very grave punishment and a short prison term should in certain circumstances suffice.` In that case, the appellant had been charged with inducing a bank, through deceitful means, to give credit to his company, an offence under s 406(a) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). The learned judge held that the charge preferred against the appellant was one of the lowest levels in terms of criminality under that section. The appellant was described as not only having an unblemished record but an admirable one. He had `placed Singapore on the world map` in the field of the manufacture and processing of plastic film. He had served in two of the nine sub-committees of the Economic Committee of Singapore in 1984/1985 and had been active in community work and development. The learned judge considered the circumstances `highly exceptional` and said that there were very strong extenucircumstances in his favour. Nonetheless, a custodial sentence was still justified. The accused had his sentence of nine months` imprisonment reduced to one of three months` imprisonment.
The `clang of prison gates` principle should not be overstated, as has often been the case in Singapore. It merely contemplates a 
 short 
 prison sentence as being appropriate in certain circumstances, and its correct application must depend on the facts of each case - in 
 Siah Ooi Choe v PP 
 ,1 the appellant was still sentenced to three months` imprisonment in the end. In the present case, the first appellant had only been sentenced to two months` imprisonment, the trial judge having taken account of the three weeks spent in remand. I was of the opinion that the sentence of two months` imprisonment could not be said to be `manifestly excessive`, especially since the facts were hardly as exceptional as those in 
 Siah Ooi Choe v PP. 
 1
It was also contended that the first appellant should not have been given the same sentence of imprisonment as the principal offenders, Li Bao Quan and Wang Kong Xin, who were convicted of cheating by impersonation under s 419 of the Code. This offence carried a higher maximum penalty of three years` imprisonment, in comparison with the maximum of one year under s 417 for cheating simpliciter.
Although it was true that the Chinese nationals were the principal offenders, the scheme of obtaining false passports for them was in a real sense initiated by the first appellant. In putting them in touch with the second appellant, the first appellant clearly showed that he was not an unwitting participant. He evidently knew whom to contact for the scheme to be effected. The fact that a man in his position was `helping` others in criminal activities could not be said to be a mitigating factor. If anything, it was an aggravating one.
It was also contended that the learned judge had failed to be consistent with other sentences passed in similar cases. In 
 PP v Lau Yin Choun 
, 
PP v Lau Yin Choun
 (Unreported) the sentence imposed was only a fine of $2,000. In 
 Koh Kee Seng v PP 
, 
Koh Kee Seng v PP
 (Unreported) the two accused were sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and two weeks` imprisonment respectively.
Counsel relied on 
Liow Eng Giap v PP
 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 10
  where Choor Singh J had said [at p 11]: 
 
... where there are no differentiating factors, as in this case, public interest demands that there should be some consistency in the imposition of sentences on accused persons committing the same or similar offences. Failure to observe this principle may, as in this case, lead to a legitimate complaint by an appellant that he has been dealt with more severely than another who committed an identical offence.
 
 
 
Admittedly, consistency in sentencing is a desirable goal, but it is not an overriding consideration, since the sentences in similar cases may have been either too high or too low. In this context, Grimberg JC observed in 
 Goh Moh Siah v PP 
 :5 `Although there is an obvious interest in consistency of sentencing, I see no reason why the learned district judge should have considered himself fettered by a sentence imposed by another court, which was drawn to his attention, and which he rightly regarded as inadequate ... .` In the present case, the learned trial judge said: `I am of the view that the mere fact that another offender had been lucky to have received a relatively lenient sentence did not mean that all others who committed similar offences were entitled to lenient sentences.` He took the view that the offence was not something that could be viewed lightly. It called for a deterrent sentence and a fine would not be appropriate. His judgment in this respect could not be faulted.
 Second appellant
For the second appellant, it was contended that she was a first offender. Counsel suggested that her only culpability was in handing over photographs of the Chinese nationals from the first appellant to one Thomas Tham, and that she had been a pawn in the whole scheme. Furthermore, no loss of property had been occasioned. Counsel said that the usual sentence in convictions under s 417 was either a fine or a short jail sentence. Thus the sentence of five months` imprisonment was manifestly excessive.
However, the second appellant`s involvement in the scheme was not confined to procuring the false passports. She was the one who booked airline tickets for the Chinese nationals in their assumed names. She helped them to check in and obtain boarding passes in those names. She was also to accompany them on the flight to the USA. Indeed, the second appellant also booked a ticket for her brother, Lee Kee Kheng, because she wanted him to assist her. The second appellant was to be reimbursed for these tickets. It was clear from the admitted facts that the second appellant was deeply involved in the scheme. Moreover, she stood to gain a free trip to the US for her part in the plan. She had played a much more active role than the first appellant. In my opinion, the sentence of five months` imprisonment was fully justified. It was definitely not manifestly excessive.
For all the above reasons, I dismissed both appeals.

Sentences below statutory minimum
 
The three appellants were each convicted of four counts of being jointly concerned in committing a robbery in the course of which hurt was voluntarily caused, an offence punishable under s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). The first and third appellants were also convicted of committing robbery in furtherance of their common intention, while armed with deadly weapons, an offence punishable under s 392 read with s 397 of the Code. The second appellant was also convicted of criminal intimidation, an offence punishable under s 506 of the Code.
On each of the four charges under s 394, the first appellant was sentenced to seven years` preventive detention and 12 strokes of the cane, the second appellant to ten years` preventive detention and 12 strokes of the cane and the third appellant to five years` corrective training and 12 strokes of the cane. These sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
On the charge of armed robbery, the first appellant was sentenced to five years` preventive detention and 12 strokes of the cane, and the third appellant to three years` corrective training and 12 strokes of the cane. The sentences were expressed to be consecutive to those under s 394. On the charge of criminal intimidation, the second appellant was sentenced to four months` preventive detention, which was similarly expressed to be consecutive to that under s 394.
The total number of strokes of the cane for each appellant was limited to 24 pursuant to s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). The appellants were also ordered to undergo police supervision for two years from the expiry of the sentences of preventive detention and corrective training.
In his grounds of decision, the learned trial judge noted that all three appellants had previous convictions for a variety of offences, but the first two appellants `outshone` the third in the number of previous convictions. The second appellant`s previous convictions were also somewhat more serious. The first appellant was in his early forties, the other two were in their early thirties. The learned judge said: 
 
... the accused were persons who deserved to be dealt with other than as ordinary criminals under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the Code`) relating either to corrective training or preventive detention (vide: s 12 of the Code). I therefore called for reports on the third accused as to his suitability to corrective training and on the first and second accused on their suitability to a term of preventive detention. A distinction was made in respect of the first and second accused, as compared to the third accused, as the parts they played in the present offences and their long list of previous convictions made it apparent, in my view, that they were a danger to the public for which they deserved to be placed in preventive detention, if suitable.
 
 
 
In the event, the reports showed the appellants to be suitable for the treatment proposed. In awarding terms of preventive detention and corrective training to the appellants, the learned judge did so for 
 each 
 of the charges, and expressed the terms to be consecutive or concurrent, in the same manner as if he were imposing terms of imprisonment. In so doing, the learned judge erred in two essential respects.
In the first place, in the case of each of the appellants one of the terms of preventive training or corrective training awarded was below the statutory minimum prescribed under s 12 of the CPC. On the charge of armed robbery, the third appellant was sentenced to three years` corrective training, which is less than the statutory minimum of five years. On the same charge, the first appellant was sentenced to five years` preventive detention, which was less than the statutory minimum of seven years. The sentence of four years` preventive detention against the second appellant on the charge of criminal intimidation was similarly below the statutory minimum of seven years.
More fundamentally, the learned judge erred in calculating the appropriate period of preventive detention or corrective training as if he were imposing sentences of imprisonment. Under s 17 of the CPC, when a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences and is sentenced to terms of imprisonment for those offences, the court may order the sentences to be consecutive or concurrent as it thinks fit. This is subject to s 18 which provides that where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court shall order that the sentences for at least two of those offences shall run consecutively. There are no provisions equivalent to ss 17 and 18 in relation to a sentence of preventive detention or corrective training.
Section 12, which deals with corrective training and preventive detention, is essentially directed towards habitual offenders - they must be over the age of 18 years for corrective training and over the age of 30 years for preventive detention. Corrective training is imposed with a view to the reformation of the offender and the prevention of crime, while preventive detention is imposed in order to protect the public.
Both these forms of custody are expressed to be `for a substantial period of time`, and this is reflected in the statutory parameters of five to 14 years for corrective training and seven to 20 years for preventive detention. In comparison, in ordinary cases the district court only has the jurisdiction to sentence an offender to up to seven years` imprisonment on any one charge - s 11(3)(a). Where the offender`s previous convictions or antecedents justify it, a sentence of up to ten year`s imprisonment may be imposed - proviso to s 11(3). In addition, the term of imprisonment which may be imposed is subject to the limits prescribed by the statute which creates the offence. In imposing a sentence of corrective training or preventive detention, the judge is only subject to the limits in s 12 of the CPC. Thus, for a single offence punishable with imprisonment of a term of up to two years, the offender might well be sentenced to corrective training or preventive detention (for at least five and seven years respectively). If he had been sentenced to imprisonment instead, it would obviously have been for no more than two years.
Furthermore, corrective training and preventive detention are meant to supplant a sentence of imprisonment which would otherwise be ordered. These sentences are passed `in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment`. It would appear that the sentencing court should simply address its mind to the appropriate period of custody merited by the offences for which the offender has been convicted before it, and his criminal record. Provisions such as ss 17 and 18 which relate to the ordering of consecutive or concurrent sentences of imprisonment clearly do not apply. I agreed with the submission of the learned DPP that corrective training and preventive detention should be ordered in lieu of the aggregate sentence of imprisonment which the court would otherwise have been minded to impose. The learned DPP drew the court`s attention to the fact that the it is the practice of district courts to impose a single term of probation or reformative training even though more than one distinct offence is involved.
Other than the increased length of custody in a regime of corrective training or preventive detention, there are different rules relating to the nature and termination of custody. Sentences of imprisonment are governed by the Prisons Act (Cap 247) and regulations made thereunder, whereas sentences of corrective training and preventive detention are governed by the Criminal Procedure (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Rules. For a sentence of imprisonment, a one-third period of remission is usual, whereas under corrective training or preventive detention, the offender is merely released on licence pursuant to Schedule C of the CPC.
Section 12 of the CPC, which empowers a court to order corrective training or preventive detention, is based on s 21(1) and (2) (repealed) of the UK Criminal Justice Act 1948. The UK authorities on that section are obviously relevant. It appears to have been the practice in the UK to pass a single sentence of either corrective training or preventive detention, although the accused may have been convicted of two or more offences at that trial - see, for example, the case of 
R v Albury
 
[1951] 35 Cr App R 12
[1951] 1 All ER 491
 where the accused was sentenced to two years` corrective training for the offences of burglary and larceny. The case is also instructive because the accused disclosed other offences while serving his sentence and was convicted for them. The English Court of Criminal Appeal felt that the period of corrective training should be extended to three years, and did so by passing a sentence of two years and eight months` corrective training, to run concurrently with the first sentence. It is evident from their approach that if the accused had been convicted of all these offences at one trial, a single sentence of three years` corrective training would have been appropriate.
In the circumstances, I altered the sentences imposed as follows: 
 
 
(1) In respect of the first appellant - period of preventive detention reduced from a total of 12 years to a single sentence of ten years. 
 
(2) In respect of the second appellant - period of preventive detention reduced from a total of 14 years to a single sentence of 12 years. 
 
(3) In respect of the third appellant - nature of sentence altered from a total of eight years` corrective training to a single sentence for the same period. (Under s 256(c) of the CPC, in an appeal as to sentence, the court may alter the nature of the sentence without having to reduce or enhance the sentence.)
  
 
 
I did not vary the trial judge`s sentence in relation to the 24 strokes of the cane and two years of police supervision ordered against each appellant.

This appeal raises an important but identical point to that raised in Criminal Appeal No 24 of 1991, which was recently decided by this court [see 
Ng Kwok Chun & Anor v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 55
  ]. It concerns the meaning of the word `import` in s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
The two appellants herein were tried and convicted before the High Court of the following separate charges:
First accused: 
 
That you, Nathan Tse Po Chung, on or about 28 February 1989, at about 4.05pm at Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 24 blocks of drugs containing not less than 2178.0g of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
Second accused: 
 
That you, Cheuk Mei Mei, on or about 28 February 1989, at about 4.05pm at Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, did import into Singapore, a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, 24 blocks of drugs containing not less than 2190.3g of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
They were sentenced to the mandatory sentence of death. [See 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 870
  .]
The undisputed facts of the case are as follows. On 28 February 1989 at about 2.24pm, the appellants, Tse and Cheuk, two Hong Kong nationals, arrived at Changi Airport from Phuket by Thai International Airways flight no TG 405. After they landed, they went into the transit lounge. They did not go through the immigration or customs checks. They intended to remain in the transit lounge until their connecting flight, KL 838, which was scheduled to depart from Singapore to Amsterdam, left at 9.55pm that same evening.
As the appellants arrived at the transit lounge they were being closely watched by customs officers. They were arrested at 4pm that day. A search of the persons of the appellants was carried out. They were found to have blocks of white substance wrapped in cellophane paper secured by elastic guards and strapped around their calves and thighs. Some smaller blocks were hidden in their shoes. The officers also seized from Tse`s clutch bag the following items: (i) two boarding passes for flight TG 405; (ii) a white ticket containing four passenger baggage checks for Thai International Airways; and (iii) a white envelope containing two passenger ticket baggage checks for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. When questioned by customs officers as to what were the blocks of white substance, Tse said, after some initial reluctance, that they were `Pak Fun` which in the Cantonese dialect literally means white powder but is slang for heroin. However, Cheuk, when questioned, said that she did not know what the substance in those blocks was.
Scientific evidence was tendered to show that the white substance seized from Tse contained 2178g of diamorphine and from Cheuk it contained 2190.3g of diamorphine.
In his s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code statement, Tse said: 
 
I owed a moneylender known as `David` HK$30,000. David told me to bring something from Phuket to Holland and that he would not collect from me the HK$30,000 and in addition would pay me another HK$20,000. David did not tell me that it was heroin. I then agreed to bring something from Phuket to Holland.
 
 
 
Cheuk`s s 122(6) statement was in these terms: 
 
My boyfriend `Fei Chye` owed a moneylender some money. He told me to accompany him to Thailand and if he did not go, he would be chopped to death by the moneylender. Later, `Fei Chye` was found not suitable for the trip because his body and thighs were too fat. The moneylender then told `Fei Chye` that he had found another partner who would accompany me to Thailand. By going for this trip, `Fei Chye` did not have to pay back the loan to the moneylender.
 
 
 
On 23 February 1989 at Hong Kong Airport, I was introduced to another male Chinese known as `Tse Po Chung`. I was also told to accompany him to Thailand on the same flight. On 27 February 1989 we went to Phuket and on 28 February 1989 morning, a man unknown to me came to our hotel room and strapped some thing on both legs of myself and `Tse Po Chung`. This man never told us that it was heroin.
From Phuket, we flew to Singapore to connect another flight to Holland. We were then arrested at Singapore Airport.
Both the statements of Tse and Cheuk were admitted in evidence. There was no allegation that the statements were not given voluntarily.
In respect of both the appellants, their main point of contention relates to the meaning of the word `import` in s 7 of the Act. They said that what they did did not amount to importing the diamorphine into Singapore.
This court has in a recent appeal, 
Ng Kwok Chun & Anor v PP
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 55
  decided this very point. After an examination of the relevant cases, both local and foreign, namely,

 and the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, to which Singapore is a party, this court came to the conclusion that the word `import` in the Act should be given the meaning defined in s 2 of the Interpretation Act, namely, `to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air.` The court further amplified the matter as follows: 
 
In view of the authorities and the considerations stated above, we were unable to accept the arguments of counsel for the appellants that Ko Mun Cheung was wrongly decided. In our view, the meaning given to the term `import` in s 7 of the MDA by this court gives effect to the intention and the policy of the MDA. We do not think that such meaning is contrary to international comity although it may in some instances result in the infliction of a punishment imposed by Singapore law which is heavier than that which would have been imposed by the country of ultimate destination... . The legislature has enacted the MDA to give effect to its obligations under the Convention and the courts would be frustrating the policy and the intention of the legislature to give the word `import` in the MDA a meaning which is different from the meaning given to it by the Interpretation Act.
 
 
 
The only additional case which has been cited to us here and which was not cited to the court in 
Ng Kwok Chun
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 55
  is the Australian case 
R v Bull
 
[1973] 131 CLR 203
 There, four men were charged with having committed certain offences against the Australian Customs Act 1901-1974. They were found guilty by the jury of, inter alia, importing into Australia a prohibited import, cannabis, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Act. The master of the vessel was also convicted of knowingly allowing the vessel to be used in the importation of goods contrary to s 233A of the Act. All the acts and events relied upon by the prosecution occurred at sea within three miles off the coast of the Northern Territory of Australia. While the vessel was within that limit, it was intercepted by a helicopter and a launch of the Australian authorities. The accused threw into the sea 31,000g of cannabis, which were being brought from Bali to Australia. Before pronouncing judgment, the trial judge stated a case for the consideration of the Australian High Court. Five questions were posed. However, for our present purpose, only question 5 is of relevance: 
 
If prohibited imports are voluntarily brought from a point outside a line three nautical miles from the low water mark of the Australian coast ... to a point within the area between the said low water mark and the said line have they been imported into Australia within the meaning of s 233B of the Customs Act 1901-1974?
 
 
 
Counsel for the second appellant, Cheuk, relied upon the following passages of Barwick CJ (at p 212/3 of the report) to contend that in our case here there was no `import`: 
 
The question is not what constitutes importation in an abstract or universal sense; the question is when, according to the provisions of the Act, are goods imported into Australia. However, in general, importation of goods, in my opinion, according to the natural meaning of the word, involves landing them, or bringing them within a port for the purpose of landing them in the country or place in relation to which importation is regulated...
 
 
 
In the present case, attention was drawn in argument to a difference between ss 233(1)(b) and 233B(1)(b). The latter speaks of importing into Australia whereas the former contents itself with a prohibition on importing. In my opinion, there is no significance for present purposes in the difference in expression in the two provisions, though introduced into the Act at the same time. The word `import` will have the same significance in each place, and if, as I think, it means in any case import into Australia, the words `into Australia` in s 233B(1)(b) add nothing of significance. `Importation` seems to have been treated as involving importation into Australia in 
 Wilson v Chambers & Co. Pty Ltd 
 (32)....
Argument was addressed to the court as to the territorial boundaries of Australia and I shall later say something as to that matter. But I presently observe that the meaning of the expression in the Act `import into Australia` cannot be determined by isolating `Australia` from the total expression. The question cannot be what are the boundaries of Australia for purposes other than the present. The question is what is involved according to the proper construction of the Act in the activity of importing into Australia.
Reference was also made by counsel to the judgment of Gibbs J where the learned judge said (at p 254): 
 
No definition of `import` or of any derivative of the word is contained in the Act. Its ordinary dictionary meaning is `To bring in, or cause to be brought in (goods or merchandise) from a foreign country, in international commerce` ( 
 Oxford English Dictionary
). In accordance with this meaning it has been said that the word `import` in various sections of the Act means `bring in to the Commonwealth`: 
 Lyons v Smart
(60); 
 Election Importing Co Pty Ltd v Courtice
(61). On the basis of these statements, and on the assumption that Australia includes the surrounding sea at least to a distance of three nautical miles, it was submitted by the Crown that to bring goods across the three-mile limit is to bring them into Australia and therefore to import them. However, whether or not the sea within three nautical miles of the coast should be regarded as part of Australia for other purposes, it is, in my opinion, clear that goods are not imported simply by bringing them within the three-mile limit. It does not conform to ordinary usage to say that goods are imported into a place if they are brought there in the course of transit but with no intention that they should be unloaded there. For example, in ordinary understanding goods would not be thought to have been imported into Australia if they were carried through the waters within three miles of the Australian coast by a ship which did not put into port. Even if goods are brought into port they are not necessarily imported; for example, a cargo being carried from England to New Zealand is not imported into Australia when the ship on which it is carried puts into an Australian port en route: 
 Wilson v Chambers & Co Pty Ltd
(62). Similarly, goods are not `imported into a harbour` by being carried through the limits of the harbour and then landed elsewhere: 
 Wilson v Robertson
 (63). However, if goods are brought into port with the intention of being discharged there they are imported: 
 Wilson v Chambers & Co Pty Ltd
(64); and see also 
 Forbes v Traders Finance Corporation Ltd
(65). The words of the Act themselves make it clear that the mere entry into port is not necessarily an importation.
 
 
 
In the passage cited above Gibbs J said that even though goods were brought within port limits, they could not be said to be `imported into Australia` where they had been brought there in the course of transit and were not to be unloaded at the port. In the context of that case, that view is obviously obiter.
It seems to us clear that the Australian High Court was not laying down any general definition of the words `import` or `importing`. The judges were merely construing the words `import` and `importation` in the context of the Australian Customs Act, which did not define those two words. This is also evident from these remarks of Barwick CJ: `It is necessary now to examine the Act in order to discover what meaning is required by the statute to be given to the expression ""import into Australia"" or ""importation into Australia"".` Similarly, Menzies J said (at p 248): `It is my opinion, upon a survey of the Act as a whole, that importing by a ship constitutes either landing goods or bringing them into port.`
The fact situation in 
Bull
 
[1973] 131 CLR 203
 is different from the present case: the issue there was whether there was an importation if prohibited imports were brought within a line extending three nautical miles beyond the submerged parts of Australia. The issue there was really quite special as can be seen from this passage of Stephen J (at p 265): 
 
Neither `import` nor `importation`, the words used in these sections, is defined in the Act so as to confer upon them any special meaning, but for the Crown it was submitted that to bring goods within three miles of the Australian coast is to import them into Australia. In my view `import` must be given its ordinary meaning and that meaning does not extend to the carrying of goods across any notional line separating the high seas from the `territorial sea`. Whatever may be the status of waters immediately off the Australian coastline they do not, I think, form part of Australia in the sense intended by a reference to the importing of goods into the country, Australia.
 
 
 
The objects of our MDA are clear, namely, to eradicate drug abuse and drug trafficking. There is a clear and simple definition of the word `import` in our Interpretation Act. There is nothing in the context or subject of the MDA which demands that that definition should not be applied to the MDA. In our view nothing said by the Australian High Court in 
Bull
 
[1973] 131 CLR 203
 has any bearing on the construction which we are asked to place on the word `import` in our MDA. To construe the word `import` in the restricted sense contended by the appellants here would mean that drug runners could use the Changi Airport transit lounge as a centre for international drug trafficking. This would be contrary to Singapore`s solemn obligation under the Single Convention: see in particular art 31, paras 10, 11 and 14. It may well be that the word `import` could have a technical or special meaning in other Acts (eg our Customs Act) or contexts but not here. Accordingly, we do not think there is any reason for this court to construe the word `import` differently from that in 
Ng Kwok Chun
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 55
 
Counsel for the second appellant quoted to us the book 
 Narcotic Offences 
 by Rinaldi and Gillies where the authors state at p 21: `... there seems to be no embargo upon charging transit passengers with possession of such prohibited imports as might exist in their luggage, even where the passenger is not free to leave a transit lounge.` We do not disagree with that statement per se. We would only add that whether such a person may also be charged with importing would depend on the relevant Act in question.
We now turn to some subsidiary points raised by the appellants.
Counsel for Tse said that the learned judges erred in fact in finding that Tse knew that the substance found on his person was in fact diamorphine. On this issue, there was before the learned trial judges the evidence of the customs officers who said that on being questioned what was the substance of the blocks strapped to his person, Tse answered `Pak Fun`. There was also evidence to suggest that the expression `Pak Fun` is synonymous with `heroin`. When called upon to make his defence, Tse chose to remain silent. The learned trial judges dealt with this point in their grounds of decision as follows [at p 875 of the report]: 
 
The conscious choice of Tse in electing to remain silent did not assist his defence in any manner or form. On the contrary, such a silence on his part gives rise to an inference that he knew or ought to have known that the substance he was carrying was drugs.
 
 
 
As to the contention that he did not utter the words `Pak Fun`, again in the absence of his evidence, we are left with only the evidence of the prosecution that Tse did make that statement and the phrase `Pak Fun` meant `white powder` which in turn denoted heroin. Tse did not avail himself of the opportunity to raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution evidence. We accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that when questioned about the nature of the substance found on him, Tse had said `Pak Fun`. We also accepted that the words `Pak Fun` in the Cantonese dialect denotes heroin.
As to the exculpatory parts of the mixed statement of Tse, we would like to add that it is settled law now that where a mixed statement is under consideration, the method most likely to produce a just result is to juxtapose the incriminating parts with parts that contain the explanations and excuses and proceed to consider where the truth lies. (See 
 Chan Kim Choi v PP 
 
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  and the other cases referred to in the judgment.) With the above principle in the foreground, we scrutinized the exculpatory parts but came to the conclusion that the explanation by Tse that he did not know what he was carrying could not be the truth.
There is in our view no merit in counsel`s arguments on the point.
Counsel for Cheuk submitted that the prosecution had not proven the necessary mens rea on the part of Cheuk in the following respects: 
 
 
(i) knowledge of the contents of the blocks strapped to her person; 
 
(ii) knowledge that the flight from Phuket would take her to Singapore; 
 
(iii) knowledge that by arriving in Singapore in transit and en route to Amsterdam she would thereby be importing drugs into Singapore.
  
 
 
In giving evidence in her own defence, Cheuk said that she did not know that she was carrying diamorphine. She thought she was carrying gold jewellery. In the words of the trial judges [at p 874 of the report]: 
 
She said that her boyfriend, Fei Chye, owed someone some money and he was scheduled to go overseas to carry some goods. But he was found unsuitable and therefore on his behalf and persuasion, she took his place at the last minute and went to Thailand with Tse. Tse was a person whom she did not at that stage know well. Her evidence was to the effect that persons unfamiliar to her strapped some items onto her person in a hotel room and she boarded a plane thinking that she was carrying gold jewellery. Her evidence was that she did not know and was unaware when she took the flight out of Thailand that she was going to arrive in Singapore.
 
 
 
Counsel for Cheuk submitted that she did not know that she was carrying diamorphine or that she would be landing in Singapore. She had nothing to do with the purchase of the air tickets and neither was she carrying them. She just followed Tse around. Counsel contended that her explanation should have been accepted by the trial judges.
The learned trial judges found, after very careful consideration, that the explanation given by Cheuk in her evidence in court and in her s 122(6) statement was `simply not credible`. They observed that while she appeared somewhat tentative and inadequate in the witness box, they had no doubt that `she was not that feeble- minded not to know that she was carrying drugs.` They also stated `it must have been apparent to her that the white powdery substance wrapped in cellophane paper secured by elastic guards around her calves and thighs could not, by any stretch of imagination, be gold jewellery.` The trial judges also disbelieved her when she said that she did not know that she was going to arrive in Singapore. They found that `her evidence that she did not make enquiries or ask her travelling companion, Tse, the next destination, is a concoction.`
Counsel argued that the trial judges had misdirected themselves when they referred to the packages as `white powdery substance` as the substance in those packages which were strapped onto her person were `hard` and not `powdery`. It was only when produced in court that it became powdery in form. Counsel also submitted that the trial judges did not give due consideration to Cheuk`s evidence that she could not see the contents of the packages strapped onto her person.
There is no basis for us to disturb the findings of the trial judges except to say that they made a mistake when they referred to `white powdery substance`. But it seems to us that the court below could not have been unaware that the substance strapped onto Cheuk`s person was in solid form. In fact towards the end of the trial, when Cheuk was giving evidence, the court even wanted a demonstration done to show how the substance, in blocks, was strapped to her body. This was abandoned when the DPP informed the court that the substance had become powdery as a result of scientific examination. This reference to `powdery substance` was probably an error made while writing out the grounds of decision. But even if one were to assume that the learned trial judges had in fact wrongly perceived the situation, thinking that the substance was in powdery form when it was in solid form, this court has still to ask the question whether Cheuk`s explanation that she thought the blocks contained gold jewellery was credible. The blocks are shown in photographs which were tendered in the court below. She said she thought it was not an offence to carry gold jewellery. Yet she allowed herself to be strapped up in great discomfort which she had to endure for the entire journey to Amsterdam, without asking a single question of those people who were strapping her with those solid blocks. She did not even protest. She did not ask her travelling companion, Tse, about the blocks either. When she was giving her s 122(6) statement, she did not say that she thought the solid blocks contained gold jewellery. Neither did she say that when she was questioned at the airport after being arrested. She merely said that she did not know what she was carrying. In our opinion the trial judges were correct not to have accepted her story - it is just too incredible. We would further add that having reviewed her evidence in court, we find that she was evasive on many crucial aspects.
Another point raised by Cheuk is that the trial judges should not have allowed a joint trial as it has in this case occasioned a miscarriage of justice. Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code permits a joint trial where more than one person is accused of the same offence or of different offences in the same transaction. Her counsel submitted that Tse and Cheuk were not charged for the same offence nor were the offences committed in the same transaction. He submitted that though the accused did not object to the joint trial it was no less a nullity. He said that the joint trial prejudiced Cheuk in two ways. First, the unfavourable view which the trial judges took of Tse`s case would have adversely affected hers. Second, since Tse chose to remain silent, Cheuk could not compel Tse to give evidence which would support her case.
Of course Tse and Cheuk were not charged for the same offence. So the question is whether their offences were committed `in the same transaction`. 
 Ratanlal on Criminal Procedure Code 
 (1985 Ed) at p 225 states that `the real and substantial test for determining whether several offences are connected together so as to form the same transaction depends upon whether they are so related to one another in point of purpose, or cause and effect, or as principal and subsidiary acts as to constitute one continuous action.`
 Mitra on the Code of Criminal Procedure 
 (16th Ed) states the tests in similar vein as follows at p 1385: 
 
The tests to decide whether different acts are part of the same transaction are proximity of time, unity of place, unity of purpose or design and continuity of action. It is not necessary that all of them should be present to make the several incidents parts of the same transaction. Unity of place and proximity of time are not important tests at all, but the main test is unity of purpose. If the various acts are done in pursuance of a particular end in view and as accessory thereto, they may be treated as parts of the same transaction. As to what is the same transaction must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. It is not the distance nor the proximity of time which is so essential in order to consider what is `the same transaction` as the continuity of action and purpose. The expression `same transaction` must be understood as including both the immediate cause and effects of an act or event, and also its collocation, or relevant circumstances, the other necessary antecedents of its occurrence, connected with it, at a reasonable distance of time space, cause and effect. For a joint trial under s 239, identity of purpose is sufficient. Community of purpose in the sense of conspiracy is not in any way necessary, though if it is present, its presence will be a further element supporting a finding that the offences are committed in the same transaction. Where the prosecution case alleges association and community of purpose among the accused, their joint trial is permissible. For s 223 it is enough if the different offences are committed in the course of the same transaction. The criterion which makes a joint trial allowable is what the prosecution case is, not what the result may be.
 
 
 
Under common law the position seems to be similar and we would just quote a passage of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
R v Assim
 
[1966] 2 QB 249
 at p 261: 
 
Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interest of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together.
 
 
 
On the charge which was brought against each of the appellants, it is clear to us that the act of each was so closely connected with the act of the other that each could be said to have been done conjointly with the other. There was a common or identity of purpose in the separate acts of the appellants. In our opinion the offences were committed in the same transaction. As the charges stood, they were, to all intents and purposes, acting in concert. There was also unity of place and proximity of time.
Next is the question of prejudice. The first complaint is that the judges` view of Cheuk`s case was likely to be affected by their unfavourable view of Tse`s case. As we said earlier, the trial judges rejected Cheuk`s evidence that she did not know what she was carrying and that she did not know that she was transiting in Singapore. As can be seen, the trial judges approached the matter by evaluating her evidence on the basis of whether it was inherently believable. It is difficult to see how any unfavourable view they might have formed of Tse`s case could have affected their evaluation of Cheuk`s case.
In the supplemental submission for Cheuk, it is also said that the trial judges failed to consider evidence admissible against each accused separately. In support, it is said that the learned trial judges made references to the two accused `both` importing the drugs into Singapore and to the two accused saying they did not know the contents of the packets they were carrying. We really do not see why it was wrong, when the trial judges were referring to elements of the facts or alleged facts which were common to both accused, for them to refer to the two accused together. There is nothing in these passages that suggests that the trial judges were importing into the case of one accused evidence admissible only against the other.
It is also submitted for Cheuk that as Tse was not compellable as a witness, the joint trial resulted in Cheuk being deprived of the evidence of Tse which could have supported her. However, we have not even been told what evidence Tse had in this regard, or what effect such evidence might have had on the outcome of the case against her.
We are therefore unable to see that Cheuk has been prejudiced at all or in a way which would nullify the joint trial.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. We affirm the verdict and the mandatory sentence passed by the trial judges.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The fourth appellant, Yee Kim Yeou (`Yee`) was charged in the High Court under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`) with trafficking in a substantial quantity of drugs, namely, six packets containing not less than 1,693.47g of diamorphine, on 6 May 1986 by transporting them from River View Hotel at Havelock Road to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. The other appellants, Tan Siew Chay (`Siew Chay`), Melvin Seet (`Seet`) and Tan Siang Leng (`Siang Leng`) and one Ng Teo Chye (`Ng`) were charged under s 5(a) read with s 12 of the Act with abetting Yee in the commission of that offence by intentionally aiding him in transporting the quantity of diamorphine from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. All the appellants and Ng were tried jointly. It was a very long trial spanning over 168 days and was probably the longest trial in the legal history of Singapore. At the close of the case for the prosecution the trial judges found that a case had been made out against each of the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction and called upon each accused to enter on his defence. Only the second appellant, Seet, elected to give evidence and also adduced evidence in his defence; the other accused elected to remain silent. The trial judges at the close of the case for the defence, after hearing arguments, found each accused guilty of the charge and convicted each of them. Against the convictions, the appellants have brought this appeal; no appeal, however, has been brought by Ng.
For the purpose of the appeal it is necessary to set out and deal in some detail with the evidence adduced by the prosecution and admitted in evidence, as the principal argument advanced on behalf of the appellants was that at the close of its case the prosecution had not made out a case against them which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions. We may begin with the events on 28 April 1986. On that day, a senior narcotics officer, Lim Chei Yoo (`SNO Lim`) with a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), acting on information, was at Woodlands Town Centre keeping a watch on a Malaysian registered car. In the evening, at 9.15pm SNO Lim saw Ng and another man entering the car. The other man drove off with Ng seated in the front passenger seat, and they were trailed to Block 17 Ghim Moh Road where Ng alighted.
On the following day, SNO Lim mounted surveillance on the flat #07-95, Block 17 (`the Ghim Moh flat`) where Ng was staying. It was ascertained that the flat was rented by his girlfriend, Ruth Poh Beng Khim. Nothing eventful was observed by the narcotics officers during the first three days. At 2.30am on 2 May, Ng and Siang Leng were seen entering the Ghim Moh flat, and they remained there until the afternoon. At 2.35pm, they were seen coming out and boarding a taxi. The taxi was trailed to Telok Ayer Street where both of them alighted; thereafter the narcotics officers lost sight of them. At 10.20pm, Ng was seen returning to the Ghim Moh flat with Ruth Poh. On the following day, at about 3.05pm, Ng left the Ghim Moh flat and went to the void deck and waited. About 20 minutes later, Seet drove up in a white Mazda RX-7, No EX1561E, and picked Ng up from the void deck. The narcotics officers trailed the car to Block 4 Queen`s Road where the car remained there for about ten minutes before it went off. The narcotics officers could not catch up with the car and soon lost sight of it. On 5 May at 3.55pm, Ng left the Ghim Moh flat and boarded a taxi which took him to Telok Ayer Street where he alighted. He went into a coffee shop located at the junction of Telok Ayer Street and Boon Tat Street (`the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop`), and there he met Siew Chay. A short while later the two were joined by Siang Leng. Later, Ng and Siang Leng left the coffee shop and boarded the car EX1561E which was parked along Telok Ayer Street. The car went off in the direction of Maxwell Road and the narcotics officers again lost sight of it.
We now come to 6 May 1986 - the day on which the offences were committed as found by the trial judges. On that day, at 3.30am, Ng was seen returning to the Ghim Moh flat in the car EX1561E. At 11.30am, Ng left the Ghim Moh flat and returned shortly carrying a blue bag and a polythene bag. At 3.55pm, one Lau Soh Siong (`Lau`) drove his car EH2144D with a bespectacled male Chinese as a passenger and arrived at the Ghim Moh flat. They were seen carrying bags and entering the Ghim Moh flat. About an hour later, the bespectacled male Chinese then wearing a suit came out of the Ghim Moh flat for a moment, and later he, Ng and Lau left the Ghim Moh flat. Ng was then carrying a bag. They boarded the car and Lau drove off and proceeded to River View Hotel at Havelock Road arriving there at about 6.10pm; they were being trailed all the way by the narcotics officers. The bespectacled male Chinese in the suit and Ng got out of the car and both went into the hotel, while Lau drove off. At 6.20pm, Seet was seen driving his car EX1561E coming out of King`s Hotel car park (which was opposite River View Hotel) and proceeding in the direction of Ganges Avenue. At 7pm, Seet was seen driving his car and arriving at River View Hotel. He parked his car outside the hotel some distance from the entrance, went into the hotel and took the lift up.
At 9pm, Siew Chay and Yee were seen leaving River View Hotel; Yee was wearing a suit. They boarded a taxi which took them to Changi Airport; they were trailed all the way by the narcotics officers. Soon after Siew Chay and Yee had left the hotel, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng came out of the hotel and got into the car EX1561E and Seet drove off. They also went to Changi Airport and were trailed by the narcotics officers. On arrival at Changi Airport, Siew Chay and Yee proceeded to the departure hall. Siew Chay went to the check-in counter 053 row 5 for the flight SQ24 departing for Amsterdam that night, while Yee stood outside at or near the railings. After Siew Chay had completed the checking-in, he joined Yee and they both walked to a row of seats nearby where they sat down. Seet, Ng and Siang Leng arrived at the airport later. On arrival, Ng and Siang Leng proceeded to the flight information board and stood there for a few minutes. They then walked through the check-in area to the end near the MPH Book Store and a short while later proceeded to the buffeteria on the next level by the escalator. Seet in the meanwhile went and joined Siew Chay and Yee. A short while later, Siew Chay, Seet and Yee walked towards the departure gate. When they reached the departure gate, Yee walked inside and proceeded to the immigration checkpoint and after that made his way to the boarding gate B27. He was trailed by the narcotics officers all the way. Yee was arrested at the boarding gate B27; Siew Chay and Seet were arrested at or near the departure gate, while Ng and Siang Leng were arrested at the buffeteria.
Siew Chay, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng were brought to the customs search room at the arrival hall where they were searched. The following items, among others, were seized from them, namely: 
 
 
(1) from Siew Chay: 
 
(a) a key to Room 1214 of River View Hotel; 
 
(b) a grey purse containing, among other things, the following: 
 
(i) a piece of The Glass Hotel note paper with `Gare De Nord` written on it and Chinese writing meaning `Amsterdam` and `467972` below it and the Chinese words `Mau` and `Vin` written on it; 
 
(ii) a card with numbers and Chinese writing on it and one of the numbers was `237531`; 
 
(iii) a cutting from a Chinese newspaper of train schedules between Johor Bahru and Singapore; 
 
(iv) a `Honey` name card with `Amsterdam` written on it; and 
 
(v) his Malaysian restricted passport. 
 
(2) from Seet: 
 
(a) a name card of Societeit Filmo, Amsterdam, with a number `279764` written on one side and `787111 Okura`, `Jim 2422686` and `Ah Lee 2727991` written on the reverse side; and 
 
(b) a piece of paper with the writing `Hasnah Tel: 3377255` written on it.

(b) River View Hotel Acknowledgment Receipt No 2553 dated `6 May` acknowledging receipt from `Mr Yee Kim Yeou` `Room/Account No: 1214` `Being payment of: Deposit` of $200; 
 
(c) River View Hotel `Welcome` card for `Mr Yee` of Room `1214`; and 
 
(d) a name card of `Edwin Wong Tailors`. 
 
(4) from Siang Leng:

(b) a purse containing, among other things: 
 
(i) a cigarette box paper with `237531` written on it; and 
 
(ii) another cigarette box paper with `Yee Kim Yeou` written on it.
  
 
 
After Yee was arrested at the screening room of boarding gate B27 he was brought out of the room and was physically searched by NO Lee Kiong Lock. He was then brought to the Oberoi Lounge. The following items, among others, were seized from him: 
 
 
(a) US$1,000; 
 
(b) SIA ticket in his name; 
 
(c) a boarding card for SQ24 on 6 May 1986; 
 
(d) his Malaysian international passport; 
 
(e) a leather jacket; and 
 
(f) a piece of paper with the words `Chinese Indisch Restaurant Oceania, Scheldestraat 77, 1078 GH` written on one side and the words `Hotel Okura` written on the other.
  
 
 
Seet was brought to his car EX1561E with Siew Chay by SNO Yeo Kiah Hee and ANO Tai Kwong Yong. SNO Yeo seized an OG plastic bag from the rear seat of the car directly behind the driver`s seat. The OG bag contained, among other things, two rolls of masking tape and some paper or plastic bags. SNO Yeo handed the OG bag to ANO Tai and drove the car to the car park in CNB. There SNO Lim seized from the glove compartment an air ticket folder with the words `For Yee Kim Yeou` written on it from MAS Travel Centre (Pte) Ltd. Inside the folder were written: `Departure: From Singapore-Amsterdam 6 May SQ24 2245-1100` and an invoice dated 5 May 1986 for $1,950 `payment for Mr Yee Kim Yeou` from MAS Travel Centre (Pte) Ltd.
All the accused were brought to CNB. Siew Chay, Seet, Siang Leng and Ng were at first left in the car porch, while Yee was brought to a room at the second level of CNB Building. There, Yee was searched and six packets of diamorphine weighing a total of not less than 1,693.47g were found strapped onto his legs. Bandages and strips of masking tape and cut-off ladies stockings were used to strap the six packets. Photographs were taken showing the packets strapped to his thighs and calves. The suit worn by Yee was also seized.
Later SNO Lim led a party of narcotics officers and officers of the Scene of Crime Unit, together with Siew Chay and Yee, to Room 1214 of River View Hotel from which the following items, among others, were seized: 
 
 
(1) from the rubbish bin - 
 
(a) six pieces of masking tape; 
 
(b) two toe pieces of ladies` stocking; 
 
(c) six pieces of `Elastolite` brand cottoncrepe bandage wrappers; 
 
(d) six bandage holders; 
 
(e) one empty garterless cling-hose wrapper; 
 
(2) one tall drinking glass from which a fingerprint mark was lifted; and 
 
(3) one short drinking glass from which a fingerprint mark was also lifted.
  
 
 
Thereafter, SNO Lim led a party of narcotics officers and officers of the Scene of the Crime Unit to the Ghim Moh flat. On this occasion, he brought Ng along. The following items, among others, were seized: 
 
 
(1) on the top of the coffee table:
  
 
 
 
(a) three rolls of masking tape and below the coffee table on the floor two rolls of masking tape, and from one of the rolls of masking tape a fingerprint mark was lifted; 
 
(b) a red plastic bag containing two AERON vouchers and a ladies` garterless cling-hose; 
 
(c) a kitchen scale from which fingerprint marks were lifted. 
 
(2) in the hall: 
 
(a) a coat hanger and two plastic coat covers of Edwin Wong Tailors; 
 
(c) a red plastic bag containing: 
 
(i) pieces of cut masking tape; 
 
(ii) five loose polythene wrappers; 
 
(iii) five bandage holders; 
 
(iv) eight pieces of `Elastolite` bandage wrappers. 
 
(3) in the kitchen: two rolls of masking tape. 
 
(4) in the bedroom: four rolls of masking tape.
  
 
 
Subsequently, the following exhibits, among others, were sent to New Scotland Yard in London for examination: 
 
 
(a) the six pieces of masking tape seized from the rubbish bin in Room 1214, River View Hotel; 
 
(b) the two toe pieces of ladies` stocking found in the rubbish bin in Room 1214, River View Hotel; 
 
(c) the strips of masking tape used to strap the six packets of drugs to the thighs and calves of Yee; 
 
(d) the two ladies` stockings with the toes cut off used to strap the six packets of drugs to the thighs of Yee; 
 
(e) the two rolls of masking tape which were in the OG bag and found in Seet`s car; and 
 
(f) a roll of masking tape found on the coffee table in the Ghim Moh flat.
  
 
 
There, TR Oliver, a forensic scientist attached to New Scotland Yard, examined the items, on the basis of which he wrote a report. His report was produced, and he gave evidence. His evidence on the findings he made from the examination was to the following effect: 
 
 
(1) The various pieces of masking tape used to strap the six packets of drugs onto Yee`s thighs and calves and the six pieces of masking tape seized from the rubbish bin in Room 1214 of River View Hotel fitted exactly together to form three larger strips (`the reconstructed tapes`). 
 
(2) The end of one roll of masking tape (P87A) which was in the OG bag in Seet`s car had a profile which matched that of one end of one of the reconstructed tapes. 
 
(3) The two rolls of masking tape found in the OG bag in Seet`s car and the one roll of masking tape (P110) found on the coffee table in the Ghim Moh flat had similar width and appearance as the loose strips. 
 
(4) The stocking with the toe cut off found on the right thigh of Yee, and one of the toe pieces found in the rubbish bin in Room 1214, River View Hotel, had a similar overall profile to the corresponding edges.
  
 
 
From these findings, TR Oliver concluded that the strips of masking tape from the right thigh and right calf of Yee and the pieces found in the rubbish bin in Room 1214, River View Hotel, must have originated from P87A, which was one of the rolls of masking tape in the OG bag found in Seet`s car. He also concluded that it was likely that one of the toe pieces of stocking found in the rubbish bin at the hotel was cut from the stocking found on the right thigh of Yee.
From P87A (which was one of the two rolls of masking tape found in the OG bag in Seet`s car) was lifted a fingerprint mark and from the short drinking glass, P109B, found in Room 1214 in River View Hotel was also lifted a fingerprint mark. Both these fingerprint marks together with others and the fingerprints of all the accused were sent to New Scotland Yard, London, and were examined by
CA Hookway, the senior fingerprint officer attached to the Fingerprint Branch of New Scotland Yard. He prepared a report which was produced, and he also gave evidence. His evidence was that, among other things, the fingerprint on P87A was that of Seet and the fingerprint on P109B was that of Siew Chay.
Mrs Ng Gek Kwee attached to the Document Examination Unit of the Department of Scientific Service was called. She had examined (among other things): 
 
 
(i) the piece of cigarette box paper, P105A, on which was written `237531`; 
 
(ii) the other piece of cigarette box paper, P105, on which was written `Yee Kim Yeou`; and 
 
(iii) specimens of the handwriting of Yee.
  
 
 
Her evidence was that the handwriting on P105 and P105A was that of Yee. Both P105 and P105A were in the possession of Siang Leng at the time of his arrest. Mrs Ng had also examined: 
 
 
(i) the piece of paper with the words `Chinese Indisch Restaurant Oceania, Scheldestraat 77, 1078 GH` written on one side and the words `Hotel Okura` written on the other, P106, which was found in the possession of Yee at the time when he was arrested; and 
 
(ii) specimens of the handwriting of Seet.
  
 
 
Her evidence was that the handwriting on P106 was that of Seet.
The prosecution also adduced evidence from other witnesses. First, Ng Yah Lee, the proprietor of Edwin Wong Tailors at Far East Shopping Centre, Orchard Road, and his cutter, Leong Chok Lun, were called. Ng Yah Lee identified the suit worn by Yee at the time of his arrest, P77, as having been made in his shop. He testified that on the afternoon of 2 May 1986, Siew Chay and Ng and a tall and slim male Chinese came to his shop. Yah Lee said that Ng ordered a three-piece suit to be made for the tall and slim male Chinese and gave instructions for the clothes, especially the trousers, to be made wider. A dark blue material was chosen for the suit. Leong took the measurement of the male Chinese and as the measurements were being taken Ng instructed Leong to make the knee, thighs and calves of the trousers wider. Yah Lee asked the male Chinese for his name and the latter replied `Yee` and Yah Lee wrote `Yee` in the order book. The price of the suit was $250 and Ng paid a deposit of $50. On 5 May 1986, Ng collected the suit from the tailor and paid the balance of $200 in cash.
Next, the travel agent of MAS Travel Centre (Pte) Ltd (`MAS Travel Centre`), one Hasnah bte Ismail was called. Her evidence, so far as material, was this. She knew Seet, and on 2 May 1986 at about 5pm, Seet and a male Chinese came to MAS Travel Centre at Prinsep Building, Prinsep Street. Seet booked the ticket on SIA flight SQ24 to Amsterdam for 6 May 1986. The male Chinese wrote the name of the passenger on a piece of paper and gave it to Seet who in turn handed it to Hasnah; written on the piece of paper was `Yee Kim Yeou`. Seet was told to return on 5 May 1986 to collect the ticket. Seet paid a deposit of $50. Hasnah could not identify the male Chinese at the trial. On 5 May 1986 at 5.30pm, Seet came to MAS Travel Centre alone to collect the ticket; he paid for it in cash. The ticket was placed in a folder, P88A, and handed to Seet. P88A was the folder found in the glove compartment of Seet`s car EX1561E after his arrest.
The prosecution sought to admit in evidence the following statements: 
 
 
(a) the oral statement made by Yee to NO Lee Kiong Lock outside the boarding gate B27 at the airport; 
 
(b) the oral statement made by Yee to CNO Teo Ho Peng at the fountain outside the Oberoi Lounge at the airport; 
 
(c) the oral statement made by Ng to CNO Teo Ho Peng on the night of 6/7 May 1986 at the car porch of CNB Building; 
 
(d) the cautioned statements of all the five accused persons; and 
 
(e) the long written statements of all the five accused persons.
  
 
 
After a lengthy trial-within-a-trial, the trial judges came to the conclusion that the oral statement of Ng and the two oral statements of Yee were made voluntarily and were admissible in evidence and that the long written statement made by Yee to SNO Lim was also made voluntarily and was admissible. The trial judges, however, rejected all the other statements, namely, the cautioned statements of all the accused and the long written statements of all the accused other than that of Yee on the ground that they were not made voluntarily.
The oral statement of Ng was made to CNO Teo Ho Peng in the following circumstances. According to CNO Teo, on his return to CNB from the airport, he spoke to Ng at the car porch of CNB Building. Ng was there together with Siew Chay, Seet and Siang Leng. CNO Teo spoke in Hokkien; he asked Ng who strapped the drugs onto Yee and Ng replied that all of them assisted him in strapping the drugs onto Yee`s legs. CNO Teo recorded the question and answer in his pocket diary.
The first oral statement of Yee was made to NO Lee Kiong Lock outside the boarding gate B27. The evidence of NO Lee was that after he had arrested Yee he brought Yee out of the screening room and physically searched him. After he discovered that there were some packages strapped onto his legs, he asked Yee two questions which Yee replied; both the questions and replies were recorded in his pocket diary and they were as follows: 
 
 
Q: How many packets were there? 
 
A: Six. 
 
Q: Six packets of what? 
 
A: Peh hoon.
  
 
 
The evidence of NO Lee was corroborated by ANO Quek Buk Tee who said he was present when NO Lee asked the two questions and he recorded the questions and answers in his pocket diary.
The other oral statement made by Yee was to CNO Teo Ho Peng outside the Oberoi Lounge at the airport. CNO Teo asked Yee three questions to which Yee replied, and the questions and answers were recorded in CNO Teo`s diary and they were as follows: 
 
 
Q: How many packets were there? 
 
A: Six packets. 
 
Q: Who strapped the drugs? 
 
A: Botak. 
 
Q: How much are you paid for the trip? 
 
A: $25,000.
  
 
 
By the term `Botak` Yee was referring to Ng.
SNO Lim recorded a very lengthy statement (referred to by the trial judges as `the long statement`) from Yee; it was in four parts. The first part was recorded on 10 May 1986 with the assistance of ANO Ng Say Liang. The material part thereof may be summarized as follows. He said he was a Malaysian residing in Johor Bahru. He had known Siew Chay for about two years and owed the latter four months` rent. Sometime in early April, he was asked by Siew Chay whether he was interested in being a drug courier to which he replied in the affirmative. Towards mid-April 1986, Siew Chay informed him that the party concerned wished to see him in Singapore. On the following day, he and Siew Chay took a train to Singapore, and he met Seet, Ng and Siang Leng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. During the meeting Siang Leng asked him whether he would agree to smuggle drugs to France and he replied in the affirmative. Siang Leng said that he would get in touch with Siew Chay when the arrangement for the consignment was finalized. After the meeting, he and Siew Chay returned to Johor Bahru by train. Sometimes towards the end of April, he was informed that Seet, Ng and Siang Leng wished to see him again, and accordingly on the next day he and Siew Chay came to Singapore by train and met the three of them at the same coffee shop. At that meeting, he wrote his name on the cigarette box paper and gave it to Siang Leng, and he told Siang Leng his telephone number which the latter wrote down on a piece of paper. Thereafter, he left the coffee shop with Siew Chay and Ng and they took a taxi to Far East Shopping Centre at Orchard Road where Ng brought them to a tailor shop and the tailor took his measurements for a suit to be made.
On 5 May 1986, he received a call from Siew Chay and was told that he would be leaving for Singapore, and on that occasion he was to bring some clothing. On the following day, he met Siew Chay in Johor Bahru and they took a train to Singapore; the train fare was paid by Siew Chay. When they arrived at the Singapore Railway Station they took a taxi to the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. Seet and Siang Leng arrived there later. The three of them, he, Siew Chay and Siang Leng then left in a taxi and went to River View Hotel at about 2.30pm. He checked into the hotel with the cash provided by Siang Leng and was given a key to Room 1214. The three of them went to the room. About an hour later, Seet came into the room. Seet asked him whether he had brought a jacket as the place he was going to was quite cold. He told Seet that he did not have one, whereupon Seet said that he had an old jacket at home and that he would go and bring it for him. Seet then ordered some food and drinks from the hotel coffee house which were brought to the room and Siew Chay signed the bill. After taking his drink, Seet left the room and he took a nap.
Sometime between 5 and 6pm he was awakened by Ng and Siang Leng. Ng asked him to strip down to his underwear. Ng then took out a few rolls of masking tape and drugs from the plastic bag and strapped them onto his legs. While Ng was strapping the drugs, Seet returned to the hotel and Seet then assisted in strapping the packets of drugs to his legs by cutting the masking tape. After the strapping was completed, Seet ordered food, drinks and cigarettes from the coffee house which were brought to the room and Seet signed the bill. After the meal, Seet handed to him the air ticket and told him that he would be going to Amsterdam. Siang Leng told him that there was a sum of US$1,000 in the suit for him to use at the Amsterdam airport. Seet gave him a piece of paper with the name of a hotel in Amsterdam and instructed him that on arrival at Amsterdam he was to take a taxi to the hotel. He told them that he did not know how to check in as he could not speak English. The group then asked Siew Chay to send him to the airport and assist him in checking-in. Siew Chay asked for taxi fare and also money to pay the airport tax and these were given to him by Seet on instructions from Siang Leng.
He and Siew Chay then left the hotel and took a taxi to the airport. On arrival at the airport, Siew Chay paid the taxi fare and went into the departure hall with him. Siew Chay then took the passport and air ticket from him and went to the check-in counter and a short while later returned and handed to him the boarding card, his passport and the air ticket. They then went and sat in front of the counter. About ten minutes later, Seet came and joined them and he handed the key to the hotel room to Siew Chay. At about 10pm, Seet told him to board the flight and he then walked to the immigration counter and proceeded to the boarding gate B27. He then went into the screening room where he was screened, and as he was about to enter the holding room, he was detained by a narcotics officer, handcuffed and asked whether he had anything with him. He told the officer that he had six packets of heroin strapped onto his legs. The officer seized his passport, boarding card and air ticket. He was subsequently brought to CNB office. This was the first part of his statement.
The second part Yee`s statement was made on 19 May 1986 and was recorded by SNO Lim also with the assistance of ANO Ng Say Liang. He was being shown two pieces of cigarette box papers, one of which was written `Yee Kim Yeow` and the other `237531` which were seized from the wallet of Siang Leng on the latter`s arrest. He said that the name was his name and that the number was his home telephone number in Johor Bahru, and that they were written by him at the second meeting with Siang Leng, Seet, Siew Chay and Ng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. At that time, the cigarette box papers were in one piece. Yee was then shown a slip of white paper with the words `Hotel Okura` written on one side and the words `Chinese Indisch Restaurant, Oceania, Scheldestraat 77, 1078 GH` written on the other side which was seized from his purse on his arrest. Yee said that the name of the hotel was written by Seet on the instruction of Siang Leng, and Seet told him to check into that hotel in Amsterdam and handed the slip of paper to him.
The third part of Yee`s statement was recorded on 27 May 1986 by SNO Lim with the assistance of NO Chew Kai Chow. On that occasion, he referred to the events which he had narrated in the first part of the statement and he made certain corrections. He identified the various bags that were seized. He also said that from the time he checked into Room 1214 in River View Hotel till the time he left with Siew Chay for the airport, there was no other person in the room besides him, Siew Chay, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng.
The fourth part of Yee`s statement was made on 3 June 1986 and was also recorded by SNO Lim. On that occasion he said that when he checked into the hotel, the receptionist issued him a hotel room card, a receipt for the deposit payment of $200 and a key to the room. When he left for Changi Airport, he left all these on a table in the room. On being referred to the piece of paper handed to him by Seet with the name of a hotel written by Seet, he said that that piece of paper was given to him by Seet in Room 1214 in the hotel and that piece of paper also had the address and name of a restaurant in Amsterdam written on it. That was the restaurant at which Seet told him that he could obtain food when he was in Amsterdam.
At the close of the case for the prosecution, all the counsel for the accused submitted that no case had been made out against their respective clients, which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions on the charges against them. Their arguments were rejected by the trial judges who held that a case had been made out against each accused and called upon each of them to enter upon his defence. In their grounds of decision the trial judges considered at great length the evidence adduced by the prosecution against each accused and came to the conclusion that the evidence had established the essential elements of the charge against each of them. It is against this part of their grounds of decision that counsel for the appellants have directed their main arguments. Before we consider their arguments and the evidence adduced by the prosecution, it is convenient at this stage to consider, first, the arguments of counsel for the defence against the admissibility of the long written statement made by Yee to SNO Lim, P155.
The first argument on this issue was advanced by Mr Lee of counsel for Siew Chay, with whom counsel for the other accused associated themselves. He submitted that at all material times Yee was in the police lock-up and was brought out on various occasions to make this long statement. He was therefore in police custody. That being so, the statement being a confession was not admissible under ss 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), which provide: 
 
 
(25) No confession made to a police officer who is below the rank of sergeant by a person accused of any offence shall be proved as against such person. 
 
(26) Subject to any express provision in any written law, no confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.
  
 
 
In his submission, the admissibility of this statement was governed by s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) and this section, so far as material, provides: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence ...
 
 
 
Provided that ...
However, the long statement was made to SNO Lim who at all material times was not a `police officer of or above the rank of a sergeant` as required by that section. In consequence, the statement was also not admissible under that section. He relied on the following Malaysian cases: 
PP v Zakaria bin Isa
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 35
  
Abdul Ghani bin Jusoh & Anor v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 25
  and 
MW Barret v PP
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 284
 
We have considered these cases, and we find that none of them are of any assistance to him or support his argument. In 
Zakaria bin Isa
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 35
  the accused was charged under s 7(1) of the Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act and s 10 of the Arms Act, and was acquitted at the conclusion of the trial. One of the questions decided by the trial judge was that the cautioned statement made by the accused was not admissible under s 75 of the Internal Security Act but admissible under s 113 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (which is in pari materia with s 122(5) of our Criminal Procedure Code). However, that statement was not admitted because the trial judge at the end of a trial-within-a-trial found that the statement was made under duress. The public prosecutor appealed and sought the ruling of the Federal Court of Malaysia on the issue whether the cautioned statement made by the accused charged under the two Acts was admissible under that section of the Internal Security Act. The Federal Court held that the cautioned statement was not admissible under s 75 but was admissible under s 113 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code and that that section applied to all persons charged with an offence under any law.
In 
Abdul Ghani bin Jusoh
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 25
  two accused were charged with and convicted of an offence under s 304 of the Malaysian Penal Code and the case against them rested mainly on the two cautioned statements made by them which were unsigned, and no explanation had been given for the failure to obtain the signatures or thumbprints of the accused. Further, one of the statements was made to a `probationary inspector` and not, as required under s 113 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code, to a police officer of or above the rank of a police inspector. The Federal Court of Malaysia held that both the statements were inadmissible. Wan Suleiman FJ who delivered the main judgment of the court said, at p 27: 
 
I would therefore hold that any statement recorded by someone who is a 
 probationary inspector
 is a statement not recorded in accordance with s 113, and in consequence inadmissible. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Lastly, in 
MW Barret
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 284
  the accused was charged with and convicted of the offence of trafficking in a quantity of cannabis under s 39(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance 1952. On appeal it was held that since the impugned statement was made to an officer of customs and not to a senior officer of customs, it was inadmissible as it was not made in accordance with s 37A of the Ordinance. Section 37A of the Ordinance provided: 
 
 
(1) Where any person is charged with any offence against this Act any statement, whether such statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after such person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by such person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of Inspector or any senior officer of customs and whether or not interpreted to him by any other police officer or senior officer of customs or any other person concerned or not in the arrest, shall notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any written law, be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if such person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit: 
 
Provided that no such statement shall be admissible or used as aforesaid - 
 
...
  
 
 
It is eminently clear that because the statement was not made to an officer as specified in that section it was held inadmissible. Syed Agil Barakbah J said at p 285: 
 
... The learned DPP submitted that the admissions are admissible under s 24 of the Evidence Act 1950 because they were made voluntarily without any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from any person in authority and the provisions of ss 25 and 26 of the same Act do not apply to customs officers. I agree with respect that the latter sections do not apply to customs officers on the ground that they are not police officers ( 
 Chua Beow Huat v PP
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 29
  ) and a confession or admission of guilt made by a suspect or an accused person to a customs officer is not ipso facto rendered inadmissible in evidence by the provisions of those sections ( 
 Abu Bakar Nazmeer v PP
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 216
  , 218). However the authorities relate to cases in which the accused person were charged under the Customs Act 1967 which does not contain expressed provisions as in s 37A of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. In the latter the functions and duties including the powers of inspection, seizure and arrest as provided in Pt VI are given to the customs as well as police officers. The words `police officer`, `officer of customs` and `senior officer of customs` are also defined therein. It is also provided under s 37A that any statement by an accused person at any time, whether before or after he is charged, whether it amounts to a confession or not or whether oral or in writing, to a police officer of or above the rank of inspector or to any senior officer of customs shall be admissible in evidence in his trial notwithstanding anything contained in any written law, subject of course to proviso ... . Similar provisions appear in s 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code and few other Acts. No such provisions appear in the Customs Act.
 
 
 
Construing the Ordinance as a whole it is clear that the provisions of s 37A apply to statements made to police officers of or above the rank of inspector and to senior customs officers, in cases falling within the ambit of the Act.
We are unable to accept Mr Lee`s argument both on principle and on authority. Under s 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act an officer of the CNB has all the powers of a police officer under the Criminal Procedure Code in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence, and under s 118 of the Code the powers of a police officer in respect of such offence are specified in ss 119, 120 and 121 of the Code. Section 121 empowers a police officer making a police investigation to examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and he is required to reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined. It was precisely under such provision that SNO Lim examined Yee and obtained the long statement from him. We agree with Miss Lee for the prosecution that it could not have been the intention of the legislature to vest in such officer a specific power of examining a person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and recording a statement from him and yet render such statement inadmissible in evidence. In our judgment, the admissibility of the long statement is governed by the Evidence Act. Under s 17 of the Evidence Act a confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the offence and under s 21 admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them or by his representative in interest; but a confession is not admissible if it was not made voluntarily as provided in s 24. The trial judges had held at the end of a trial- within-a-trial that the long statement was made voluntarily by Yee and admitted it in evidence.
It is settled beyond doubt that narcotics officers are not police officers and that statements made to a narcotics officer are not subject to s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code or ss 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act: see 
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  at p 360 and 
 Tan Boon Tat v PP 
 5 at p 9. In 
Loong Phong Hoy v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 55
  it was argued before this court that the oral statements made by the accused to the narcotics officer were not admissible in evidence by reason of s 121(1) (now s 122(1)) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This was rejected by the court. Wee Chong Jin CJ delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 56: 
 
We rejected this contention as the statements made by the appellant were not made `to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under [Chapter XIII] of the Criminal Procedure Code`. An officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau exercising any of his powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act is plainly not a police officer within the meaning of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 
 
Next, all the counsel for the appellants contended that the long statement of Yee recorded by SNO Lim was inadmissible in evidence on the ground that it was not made voluntarily and that the trial judges ought to have rejected it. In particular, Mr Fernando for Seet made a lengthy submission on this aspect of the appeal. He pointed out that there was an undisputed feature in the trial-within-the-trial which clearly showed that the statement was indeed the result of an inducement by SNO Lim and was not made voluntarily. In recording statements from the other co-accused, namely, Siew Chay, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng, SNO Lim and other narcotics officers had been found by the trial judges to have practised inducement on them and/or behaved oppressively towards them in recording the statements and all their statements had been held by the trial judges as having been made involuntarily. That was the striking feature, so he submitted. It was therefore imperative that the trial judges in considering the admissibility of Yee`s long statement should have borne in mind the conduct of SNO Lim and/or the other narcotics officers, but they had totally failed to do so. The evidence adduced at least created a doubt as to whether there was indeed inducement practised on Yee before recording the statement.
Mr Fernando then referred to an event which took place on 9 May 1986 which was the day before the first part of the long statement was recorded from Yee. On the morning of that day, SNO Lim was recording a long statement of Siew Chay in room #02-12 of CNB Building which commenced at 11.45am. It was in evidence that there was a break in the recording of Siew Chay`s statement at about 1pm when Siew Chay requested to see Yee. At that point SNO Lim stopped recording the statement and brought Yee from the lock-up to room #02-12 at 1.01pm. Siew Chay and Yee were then allowed to converse with each other and have lunch together during which time they were served with cakes and cigarettes; they were together until about 2.42pm - a total of 1 hour 41 minutes. It was submitted by Mr Fernando that despite this undisputed evidence the trial judges held that Yee had lied in court about the whole episode of 9 May 1986. He therefore submitted that the finding was against the weight of evidence and was wrong. The finding failed to take into account the inducement afforded by SNO Lim in allowing Siew Chay and Yee to have lunch together in that room and to remain there for 1 hour and 41 minutes. There was, therefore, a real probability that Yee was induced into co-operating with SNO Lim. In this connection, it must be borne in mind that Siew Chay`s long statement was rejected on the ground of involuntariness. Finally, Mr Fernando submitted that the trial judges were in error when they said: 
 
... having regard to the evidence that the drug was found strapped onto the legs of the fifth accused and the presumption which arose under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, it was improbable that any CNB officer would induce the fourth appellant to make a statement with a promise to get the DPP to reduce the charge to one of simple possession and that the fourth appellant would only get a prison sentence of three to ten years.
 
 
 
It was submitted that the reasoning here was erroneous, for though what was found strapped onto Yee`s legs was overwhelming evidence against him, it would still be necessary for the officers of the CNB to obtain sufficient evidence against the other accused.
True it is that the trial judges had found that the statements of Siew Chay, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng were not made by them voluntarily. However, it does not follow that these findings per se would be sufficient or afford any ground for rejecting the long statement of Yee. The long statement of Yee was recorded by SNO Lim in four parts. The trial judges considered in great detail the circumstances in which each part was recorded. The trial judges found that Yee had lied in the various allegations he made of the events that took place on 9 May 1986. In particular, they found that he had concocted the allegations and had shown himself to be evasive and inconsistent. They, therefore, disbelieved his allegations and held that there was no inducement made to Yee on 9 May 1986, the day before he made the first part of his statement. On this particular point, we too have grave doubt that what SNO Lim did at lunch on that day, ie allowing Yee to have lunch with Siew Chay and providing them with cakes and cigarettes, could really amount to an inducement falling within s 24 of the Evidence Act. With respect to the second part of the long statement, the trial judges found that Yee had again shown himself to be self-contradictory and lied. As for the third part of the statement, the trial judges did not believe Yee`s evidence that SNO Lim made up the statement. With respect to the recording of the final part of the statement, they found that there was no evidence of any inducement proffered to Yee to make the statement. The trial judges might well be incorrect in their reasoning that as the drugs had been found strapped onto Yee`s legs it would be improbable that the officers of the CNB would induce Yee to make the statement by any promise, for clearly at that time the officers were interested in securing evidence against the other accused. However, having reviewed the findings the trial judges had made and their reasons in support and having regard to the fact that they had seen and heard the witnesses, we are not persuaded that they had erred in any material respect. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the long statement was inadmissible in evidence on the ground that it was not given by Yee voluntarily.
We now turn to the main argument advanced by each of the counsel on behalf of the appellant concerned, and that is this: that at the close of the case for the prosecution, no case against his client had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction of the charge against him. We shall consider, first, this line of argument made on behalf of Yee, he being the principal offender. It was argued by Mr Gwee on his behalf that the prosecution had not established a case against Yee of trafficking in the six packets of drugs but only a case of possession and this argument was founded principally on the ground that the evidence of the narcotics officers was highly unsatisfactory. There is plainly no merit in this argument. Yee was trailed all the way from the time he left River View Hotel to the time he arrived at Changi Airport, and when he was in the airport, he was under constant observation and was trailed from the departure hall to boarding gate B27 where he was arrested. On his arrest, he was found to have strapped onto his thighs and calves six packets of diamorphine and the total quantity of diamorphine on analysis carried out subsequently was not less than 1,693.47g. There was no dispute that this quantity of drugs was found in his possession. It has therefore been proved that at the material time he had in his possession not less than 1,693.47g of diamorphine, and under s 18(2) of the Act he is presumed to have known the nature of that drugs, and further under s 17 of the Act he is presumed to have had that quantity of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. It has also been proved that he transported that quantity of diamorphine from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. Proof of the act of transporting plus the presumption under s 17 would constitute a prima facie case of trafficking which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction: 
Wong Kee Chin v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 157
  at p 161. In addition, there were the oral statements made by him to NO Lee Kiong Lock and CNO Teo Ho Peng, and the long statement he made to SNO Lim. At the close of the case for the prosecution, there had been established against Yee a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction of the offence with which he was charged.
We now turn to the appeals of Siew Chay, Seet and Siang Leng (`the three appellants`). There are certain aspects of the appeal which are common to all of them and to which we should address ourselves. First, the charge that has been brought against them was that they abetted Yee in the commission of the offence of trafficking in a quantity of drugs by intentionally aiding Yee in transporting the drugs from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 Changi Airport. On this point, we have at the forefront of our minds the precise charge that has been brought against them. The case for the prosecution and the evidence adduced in support should be considered with reference only to the charge. Tedious though it may be, it is necessary and convenient to set out here verbatim the charge against them, which is as follows: 
 
Tan Siew Chay, Melvin Seet, Ng Teo Chye, Tan Siang Leng, you are charged that you 
 on or about 6 May 1986
 in Singapore 
 did abet
 one Yee Kim Yeou in the commission of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by 
 intentionally aiding
 the said Yee Kim Yeou in transporting six packets of the controlled drug containing not less than 1,693.47g of diamorphine 
 from River View Hotel, Havelock Road, to boarding gate B27, Singapore Changi Airport
, Singapore, without any authorization under the said Act, or the regulations made thereunder, which offence was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a), read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
We have two observations on this charge. First, in framing the charge thus, the prosecution was not invoking s 34 of the Penal Code and alleging that in furtherance of a common intention they abetted Yee in trafficking in the quantity of drugs. Secondly, the prosecution was relying only on the third limb of abetment as defined in s 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which is as follows: 
 
A person abets the doing of a thing who - 
(a) ... 
(b) ... 
(c) 
 intentionally aids, by any act 
 or illegal omission, 
 the 
 
 doing of that thing 
. 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
To that limb the second explanation given in s 107 on aiding is relevant and is as follows: 
 
Explanation 2 - Whoever, 
 either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate
 the commission of that act, and 
 thereby facilitates
 the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The act of aiding therefore is not confined only to an act carried out or executed at the time of commission of the principal act, ie the act of transporting the drugs. The act of aiding may take place before the principal act so long as it was carried out or executed in order to facilitate the commission of the principal act and thereby facilitates the commission thereof.
On the charge so framed there are two essential elements which must be established, namely: (i) that the accused, either prior to or at the time of the transportation of the quantity of diamorphine by Yee from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport, did an act or acts 
 in order to facilitate the commission of the transportation of the drugs 
 by Yee, ie the intention of doing the particular act or acts, the 
 mens rea 
, and (ii) that by 
 that act or acts he facilitated the 
 
 commission of the transportation of the drugs 
 by Yee, the 
 actus reus 
. There must be active complicity which is the gist of the offence: 
Shri Ram v State of UP
 
[1975] 81 Cr LJ 240
The second important aspect common to the appeal of the three appellants is the evidence consisting of the oral statement of Ng and the long statement of Yee, P155 (which for reason of brevity we shall call P155). It is common ground that these statements were confessions made by two accused persons, and s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) governs the use of such statements in a joint trial of these accused and other persons charged with the same offence. That section provides: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
It was submitted by Mr Fernando that the oral statement of Ng and P155 cannot be treated as substantive evidence against his co-accused, ie Siew Chay, Seet and Siang Leng respectively. He relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of India in 
Hari Charan Kurmi v State of Bihar
 
[1964] SCR 623
 Gajendragadkar CJ said at pp 631-632: 
 
... In dealing with a criminal case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one accused person against another accused person, the proper approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be satisfactory and the court is inclined to hold that the said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said accused person, the court turns to the confession with a view to assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right.
 
 
 
He also referred to other authorities including the decision of the Privy Council in 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] AIR 36 PC 257 (folld
 at p 260 and an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in India in 
Kashmira Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh
 
[1952] SC 526
 at pp 529-530. This court has referred to these decisions in 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  at pp 357-358, and for our purpose it is sufficient if we refer to the following brief passages. In 
Bhuboni Sahu
 
[1949] AIR 36 PC 257 (folld
 Sir John Beaumont in delivering the judgment of the Board said, at p 260: 
 
... Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. Their Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most of the High Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction, is correct.
 
 
 
In 
Kashmira Singh
 
[1952] SC 526
 Vivian Bose J said, at p 530: 
 
... The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.
 
 
 
This narrow construction of the equivalent of s 30 of our Evidence Act has also been adopted by the courts in Malaysia: see 
Yusoff v PP
 
 
[1956] MLJ 47
  at pp 48-49 and 
PP v Nordin bin Johan & Anor
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  at p 222. Our High Court in 
PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 151
  at p 160 also followed the Indian decisions. In 
Sim Ah Cheoh
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  this court in obiter said that these cases are undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 and expressed agreement with those decisions. In the instant case the trial judges were fully aware of these authorities. After referring to s 30 of the Evidence Act, they said (at p 77 of their grounds of decision): 
 
We were of the view that the confession of an accused person in a joint trial was not evidence against a co-accused and such a confession could not alone support the conviction of a co-accused. It could be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction ( 
 Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 1949 AIR 36 Privy Council 257).
 
 
 
Relying on these authorities, Mr Fernando submitted that the proper approach to be adopted by the trial judges should be, first, to consider the other evidence against the co-accused excluding the confessions altogether and if the other evidence was satisfactory and they were inclined to hold that the other evidence sustained the charge, then and only then should they turn to the confessions to assure themselves. The confessions could not be used to supplement the other evidence which was insufficient. It was his submission and also the submissions of Mr Lee and Mr Abraham for Siew Chay and Siang Leng respectively that the trial judges had fundamentally erred in treating the oral statement of Ng and P155 as substantive evidence against their clients and relied on these statements to supplement the other evidence.
Miss Lee for the prosecution accepted the legal propositions laid down by the authorities and consequentially the approach that should be adopted in treating the oral statement of Ng and P155. This court has not been invited to consider afresh the question of the proper construction of s 30 of the Evidence Act and for the purpose of this appeal would accept the construction of this provision as decided by the authorities as correct, as such construction operates in favour of the defence. But Miss Lee joined issue with Mr Fernando and the other counsel in their submissions that the trial judges had in error relied on the oral statement of Ng and P155 as substantive evidence. There is therefore no dispute between the prosecution and the defence on the principles governing the use of a confession under s 30 of the Evidence Act. The dispute between them only lies in the use of the confessions made by the trial judges.
We now turn to examine the extent to which the trial judges had made use of the oral statement of Ng and P155 in their findings against Siew Chay, Seet and Siang Leng respectively. The trial judges at the close of the case for the prosecution reviewed the evidence against each of them separately. In coming to their finding implicating Siew Chay the trial judges made use of P155 in the following instances: 
 
 
(a) They said that P155 revealed to the court `the relationship of the first accused [Siew Chay] with the fifth accused [Yee] and the other accused persons`, and that by that statement Yee revealed that Siew Chay was `instrumental` in Yee`s agreeing to be the drug courier. 
 
(b) They further said that P155 revealed that Siew Chay was the one `who was clearly guiding the fifth accused in this matter` and that he `accompanied the fifth accused on all occasions and acted in collusion with the second, third and fourth accused`. 
 
(c) They finally relied on P155 as the basis for finding what took place in Room 1214 of River View Hotel on the afternoon of 6 May 1986 and described the events involving Siew Chay on the basis of P155. 
 
(d) They also relied on the oral statement of Ng that Siew Chay assisted in strapping the six packets of diamorphine onto the thighs and calves of Yee.
  
 
 
In their consideration of the evidence against Seet, the trial judges referred to P155 in the following instances: 
 
 
(a) They said that P155 revealed what Seet was doing with Siew Chay, Ng and Siang Leng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. 
 
(b) They relied on P155 as showing what took place in Room 1214 of River View Hotel on 6 May 1986 and described the events involving Seet again on the basis of P155. It is clear that their findings of Seet`s participation or involvement in Room 1214 on that day were based mainly on P155.
  
 
 
As regards the evidence against Siang Leng the trial judges relied on P155 and held that it revealed the part played by him in this affair. They set out in detail the part Siang Leng was alleged to have played and the entire account was substantially based on P155.
In our opinion, the trial judges, with respect, erred in their treatment and use of the oral statement of Ng and P155: they relied on those statements to supplement the other evidence adduced by the prosecution. They ought to have considered first the other evidence adduced and determined whether such evidence had established the essential elements of the charge against the accused, and only after that should they refer to the statements to support such evidence or for assurance.
The next question is whether in view of this error there was a substantial miscarriage of justice occasioned in calling for the defence. The answer depends on the evidence adduced: evidence of the primary facts and the inferences that would reasonably be drawn. The evidence adduced by the prosecution against Siew Chay and Seet at the close of its case is partly direct and partly circumstantial, and the evidence against Siang Leng is wholly circumstantial. Whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial, the test to be applied in determining whether at the close of the case for the prosecution a case has been made out against each of them, which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction is that propounded by Lord Diplock in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  Lord Diplock said, at p 51: 
 
The crucial words in s 188(1) are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 188(1) 
 the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true
, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; 
 and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Later, he said at p 52: 
 
... At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is 
 some evidence
 (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, 
 would establish each essential element
 in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). 
 Where he has not so found
, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Adopting the approach as laid down, we now turn to examine the evidence adduced and determine whether at the close of the case for the prosecution a case had been made out against Siew Chay, Seet and Siang Leng respectively, which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions of the charge.
The following evidence was adduced against Siew Chay at the close of the case for the prosecution: 
 
 
(a) There was an immigration stamp on his passport showing that on 22 April 1986 he came to Singapore, and that stamp was the same as or similar to the stamp appearing on the passport of Yee for that day. There was therefore evidence that both of them came to Singapore on the same day, though not necessarily at the same time. 
 
(b) There was also an immigration stamp on his passport showing that he came to Singapore on 2 May 1986 and that stamp was again the same as or similar to the stamp on Yee`s passport for that day. Again, this shows that they came to Singapore on the same day. 
 
(c) There was the evidence of Ng Yah Lee, the proprietor of Edwin Wong Tailors, that on 2 May 1986, Siew Chay and Ng and a male Chinese came to his shop and Ng ordered a suit for the male Chinese and gave instructions for the suit, especially the trousers, to be made wider. 
 
(d) There was also the evidence of Leong Chok Lun, the cutter at Edwin Wong Tailors, that Ng gave instructions that the trousers be made as wide as possible. 
 
(e) The evidence of Yah Lee and Leong showed that Siew Chay was present when the instructions were given by Ng. 
 
(f) On 5 May 1986, Siew Chay was seen by narcotics officers with Ng and Siang Leng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. 
 
(g) There was an immigration stamp on Siew Chay`s passport showing that he came to Singapore on 6 May 1986 and that stamp was the same as or similar to the stamp appearing on Yee`s passport for that day. 
 
(h) There was the evidence of the immigration officer, Tay Yong Heng, that he was the one who stamped the two passports and that his duty ended by 3pm on 6 May 1986. Hence, there was evidence that Siew Chay and Yee came to Singapore on that day and they arrived not later than 3pm. 
 
(i) The evidence adduced showed that Yee checked into the hotel on that day at 2.40pm and was allocated Room 1214. 
 
(j) There was the evidence of the room service chit which showed that food was ordered for one person and coffee for four persons at 3.49pm and the order was brought up to the room. 
 
(k) At about 9pm, Siew Chay and Yee were seen leaving River View Hotel and boarding a taxi which took them to Changi Airport. The entire trip was trailed by the narcotics officers. 
 
(l) The evidence of the narcotics officers was that Siew Chay sat in the front seat next to the taxi driver, and it was the evidence of the taxi driver, Tan Thiam Peng, that the passenger who was seated in front gave instructions to him to take them to the airport and who paid the fare for the journey. 
 
(m) At the airport, the narcotics officers saw Siew Chay checking-in for flight SQ24 for Amsterdam that night. 
 
(n) After the checking-in, Siew Chay joined Yee and sat at the departure hall, and they were subsequently joined by Seet. They waited until it was time for Yee to board the plane and they walked with Yee to the departure gate. 
 
(o) When Siew Chay was arrested, he was found to have the key to Room 1214, a card with a telephone number, a newspaper cutting with train schedules between Johor Bahru and Singapore and a card with the word `Amsterdam` written on it. 
 
(p) After the arrest, a search of Room 1214 resulted in the seizure of, among other things, a drinking glass which was found to have Siew Chay`s right fore-fingerprint on it.
  
 
 
Clearly, there was direct evidence that Siew Chay had aided Yee in the latter`s transportation of the drugs from River View Hotel to the departure hall at Changi Airport. One essential element of the charge, ie the actus reus, has been established. The other essential element, ie the mens rea, is one of inference, and the question is whether from the primary facts which we have narrated, assuming that they are true, an inference can reasonably be drawn that Siew Chay had intentionally aided Yee in the transportation of the drugs. In our opinion, the answer is undoubtedly in the affirmative. First, the immigration stamps on Siew Chay`s and Yee`s passports showed that they came to Singapore on the same day on those occasions. Secondly, Siew Chay was with Ng and a tall and slim male Chinese at Edwin Wong Tailors where a suit was ordered by Ng, and that was the suit worn by Yee when he was arrested. There is no doubt that Yee was the male Chinese for whom the suit was ordered. Siew Chay was there when instructions were given by Ng to make the trousers wider. Thirdly, Siew Chay was in Room 1214 on 6 May as his fingerprint was on the glass in that room. At about 9pm he was seen coming out of the hotel with Yee and boarding a taxi which took them to Changi Airport. Yee was then wearing a suit, and that was the suit ordered by Ng and made by Edwin Wong Tailors of which Siew Chay had knowledge. Lastly, he gave instructions to the taxi driver to drive to the airport and he paid the fare for the trip, and at the airport he did the checking-in for Yee. From these primary facts, the inferences that would reasonably be drawn are: (i) that he came to Singapore from Johor Bahru with Yee on 22 April, 2 May and 6 May; (ii) that he went to River View Hotel with Yee when the latter checked in; (iii) that the strapping of the drugs onto Yee`s thighs and calves took place in the hotel; (iv) that he was aware of such strappings; and (v) that he was aware of Yee carrying the drugs from the hotel to the airport. Applying the test laid down in 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  we must act on the presumption that `there will be nothing to displace these inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation`. Hence, without relying on the oral statement of Ng and P155, the two essential elements of the charge against Siew Chay have been established at the close of the case for the prosecution and he ought to be called upon to enter on his defence. There was therefore no miscarriage of justice at all in the trial judges calling for his defence.
We now consider the case against Seet. It was submitted by Mr Fernando that at the close of the case for the prosecution, the evidence adduced was wholly circumstantial and the circumstantial evidence did not irresistibly prove the essential ingredients of the charge. He relied in support on the decision in 
Sunny Ang v PP
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
  where the Federal Court approved the following direction of the trial judge to the jury on circumstantial evidence: 
 
... one of the points about circumstantial evidence is its cumulative effect. Any one of these points taken alone might, you may think, be capable of explanation. The question for you is: where does the totality of them, the total effect of them, all lead you to? Adding them together, considering them, not merely each one in itself, but altogether, does it or does it not lead you to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed this crime? Or is there some other reasonably possible explanation of those facts?
 
 
 
The prosecution case is that the effect of all this evidence drives you inevitably and inexorably to the one conclusion and one conclusion only: that it was the accused who intentionally caused the death of this young girl.
He submitted that the circumstantial evidence against Seet was not such that it would inevitably and inexorably lead to the conclusion that Seet intentionally aided Yee in transporting the drugs from the River View Hotel to Changi Airport. We are unable to accept this submission. First, as we have held, the evidence against Seet consisted of direct and circumstantial evidence. Secondly, the test in 
Sunny Ang
 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
  is relevant and applicable at the close of the trial in considering whether the prosecution has proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and in that connection, where the evidence against the accused consists wholly of circumstantial evidence, the court will have to consider whether the evidence, looked at in its totality, would lead inevitably and inexorably to the one conclusion, and one conclusion only, that the accused has committed the offence with which he was charged. The test is not relevant or applicable at this stage, ie the close of the case for the prosecution, when the court is not considering whether the prosecution has proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Lord Diplock in 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  said, at p 51: 
 
Section 188(1) states the conditions precedent to the right and duty of the judge of trial to call on the accused to enter on his defence. ... 
 it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty
. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Later, at p 52, his Lordship said: 
 
... in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore in the case of 
 Ong Kiang Kek v PP
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 283
  there are certain passages that seem, upon a literal reading, to suggest that unless at the end of the prosecution`s case the evidence adduced has already satisfied the judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, the judge must order his acquittal. But this can hardly have been what that court intended, for it ignores the presence in the section of the crucial words `if unrebutted`, to which in other passages the court refers, and it converts the hypothetical question of law which the judge has to ask himself at that stage of the proceeding: `If I were to accept the prosecution`s evidence as accurate 
 would
 it establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt?` into an actual and quite different question of fact: `Has the prosecution`s evidence already done so?`
 
 
 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock, which we have set out earlier. We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and in drawing such inferences the court looks at the totality of the evidence and consider what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But in considering any inference to be drawn the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
We now turn to the evidence adduced against Seet at the close of the case for the prosecution. There was evidence of his association with Ng prior to 6 May 1986. On 3 May 1986 he was seen driving his car, Mazda RX-7, No EX1561E, to the void deck of the Ghim Moh flat, picking up Ng, and driving to Block 4 Queen`s Road and waiting there for ten minutes. He then drove off and the narcotics officers lost sight of his car. There was the evidence of Hasnah bte Ismail that Seet and a male Chinese went to MAS Travel Centre at Prinsep Street at about 5pm on 2 May 1986 and a ticket for one Yee Kim Yeou for flight SQ24 to Amsterdam was booked. The evidence of Hasnah was that it was Seet who made the booking and when she asked for the name of the passenger, a piece of paper with the name `Yee Kim Yeou` written by the male Chinese was handed to her by the male Chinese through Seet. Hasnah also told the court that there was some discussion as to what flights were available and haggling of prices and Seet translated this discussion for the male Chinese. It was also the evidence of Hasnah that on 5 May 1986 Seet collected and paid for the ticket for Yee; the folder of MAS Travel Centre with the invoice/receipt was found in the glove compartment of Seet`s car EX1561E. On 5 May 1986, he was seen picking up Ng and Siang Leng at Telok Ayer Street and driving off in the direction of Maxwell Road. The narcotics officers lost sight of his car.
There was evidence that on 6 May 1986 the narcotics officers in their surveillance near River View Hotel spotted his car turning out of King`s Hotel car park. They lost sight of his car. However, at about 7pm the narcotics officers saw Seet coming to River View Hotel, parking his car along the driveway of the hotel, alighting from the car, going into the hotel and taking the lift up. He was seen carrying a paper bag. On that evening, after Siew Chay and Yee had left the hotel in the taxi, the narcotics officers saw Seet, Siang Leng and Ng leaving the hotel and entering Seet`s car. They saw Seet driving off, and they trailed him to the airport. After Seet had parked his car, Ng and Siang Leng came out first followed by Seet. When they reached the departure hall, Seet was seen joining Siew Chay and Yee at the departure hall. All three of them were seen later walking towards the entrance leading to the immigration checkpoint. Yee went through the entrance to the checkpoint, while Seet and Siew Chay waited at the entrance where they were arrested.
After the arrest of Yee, a piece of paper with the word `Hotel Okura` was found in Yee`s wallet and the handwriting on that piece of paper was examined by Mrs Ng who expressed her opinion that that handwriting was Seet`s. After Seet`s arrest, a name card with the writing `787111 Okura` was seized from Seet and it was the evidence of SNO Lim that his investigation revealed that number 787111 was a telephone number of Hotel Okura in Amsterdam.
After Seet`s arrest, an OG plastic bag, in which, among other things, were two rolls of masking tape, was found on the rear seat of his car. The evidence of TR Oliver, the forensic scientist from New Scotland Yard, was that the two rolls of masking tape, P87A and P87B, found in Seet`s car and that one roll of masking tape, P110, found on the coffee table in the Ghim Moh flat, were similar in width and appearance to the loose strips of masking tape used to strap the six packets of drugs onto Yee`s thighs and calves. It was also his evidence that the end of the masking tape, P87A (one of the rolls in the OG bag found in Seet`s car) had a profile which matched that of one end of the reconstructed tape, P115A. The reconstructed tapes were from the various pieces of masking tape used to strap the six packets of drugs onto Yee`s thighs and calves and the six pieces of masking tape seized from the rubbish bin in Room 1214 River View Hotel. Further, the evidence of TR Oliver was that strips of masking tape from the right thigh and the right calf of Yee and the piece found in the rubbish bin in Room 1214 River View Hotel must have originated from the roll of masking tape P87A, which was found in Seet`s car EX1561E. A fingerprint - a thumbprint - was lifted from P87A and was examined by CA Hookway of New Scotland Yard and his evidence was that this fingerprint was that of Seet.
There was direct evidence that Seet aided the transportation by Yee of the drugs from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. The aiding consisted of carrying out or doing of the following acts: (i) the booking or assisting in the booking of the air ticket for flight SQ24 for Amsterdam, (ii) collection and payment for the air ticket and (iii) delivering or handing it to Yee. There was no direct evidence that he delivered or handed the ticket to Yee. But the irresistible inference is that he delivered or handed it to Yee either directly himself or indirectly through someone either in the evening of 6 May 1986 in Room 1214 of River View Hotel or before that time. These acts facilitated the commission of the transportation of the drugs by Yee from River View Hotel to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. Without the air ticket Yee would not be going to the airport on the evening of 6 May with a view to taking flight SQ24 for Amsterdam. Even if it can be argued that these acts did not truly facilitate the transportation of the drugs by Yee from the hotel to the airport but only provided a reason for Yee making the trip to the airport, they did in fact facilitate the transportation of the drugs by Yee for that part of the journey, from the departure hall to the boarding gate B27. With the ticket, Siew Chay checked in for Yee and obtained the boarding card for the flight and with that boarding card Yee was enabled to enter the immigration checkpoint and proceeded to the boarding gate B27. By these acts, Seet had facilitated the commission of trafficking in the drugs by Yee. As we have held, the act or acts of aiding under s 107(c) need not take place on 6 May 1986; they could be act or acts carried out or done prior to that date. In our opinion, the essential element of the charge, the actus reus, has been established by the evidence.
On the totality of the evidence of the primary facts, which we assume at this stage to be true, there are inferences that can reasonably be drawn of Seet`s involvement in the strapping of the drugs onto Yee`s legs. There was no direct evidence that Seet on his arrival at the River View Hotel went to Room 1214; but the irresistible inference is that he did and was in the room for two hours. As we have held in dealing with the evidence against Siew Chay, the strapping of the drugs onto Yee`s legs took place in the room. After Seet`s arrest, two rolls of masking tape were found in a paper bag in his car and the evidence was that the strips of masking tape from the right thigh and the right calf of Yee originated from one of the two rolls and on that roll was found the thumbprint of Seet. We are unable to accept Mr Fernando`s submission that the thumbprint impression of Seet on the roll of masking tape did not have any direct nexus with the strapping of the drugs on Yee`s legs. From the totality of the evidence of the primary facts the inference is that Seet handled that roll of masking tape in Room 1214 in the course of or in connection with the strapping. The other inferences are that Seet knew the purpose for which Yee would be taking flight SQ24 to Amsterdam and that he knew that when Yee left the hotel for the airport he was carrying the drugs strapped onto his legs. Again, applying the test laid down in 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  we act on the presumption that `there will be nothing to displace these inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of further explanation`. On this basis, both the actus reus and mens rea - the essential elements of the charge - have been established against Seet without relying on the oral statement of Ng and P155. In our judgment, on the evidence adduced by the prosecution, Seet ought to be called upon to enter on his defence and the trial judges were, notwithstanding the error, correct in arriving at that conclusion.
We now come to the appeal of the third appellant, Siang Leng. At the close of the case for the prosecution, the following evidence was adduced: 
 
 
(a) Siang Leng was with Ng when the latter returned to the Ghim Moh flat at 2.30am on 2 May 1986. At 2.35pm they left the Ghim Moh flat and boarded a taxi which was trailed by the narcotics officers to Telok Ayer Street where they alighted and were lost sight of by the narcotics officers. 
 
(b) On 5 May 1986, Siang Leng met Siew Chay and Ng in the late afternoon in the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. Shortly thereafter, Ng and Siang Leng left the coffee shop and boarded the car EX1561E which was parked along Telok Ayer Street. The car went in the direction of Maxwell Road. 
 
(c) On 6 May 1986 at 9.10pm, Siang Leng, Seet and Ng left River View Hotel and got into Seet`s car EX1561E and proceeded to the airport. At the airport, they went to the departure hall. Ng and Siang Leng went directly to the flight information board, stood there for a while and then proceeded to where MPH Book Store was. They were there for a while and then they proceeded to the buffeteria on the next level via the escalator. They were arrested while they were having some drinks there. 
 
(d) Upon his arrest, the following exhibits were seized from him: 
 
(i) cash of 50 Dutch guilders; 
 
(ii) a piece of cigarette box paper with the name `Yee Kim Yeou` written on it, P105, and 
 
(iii) another piece of cigarette box paper with the number 237531 written on it, P105A.
  
 
 
The evidence of Mrs Ng was that the handwriting on those two pieces of paper was Yee`s.
As regards the piece of paper, P105, Miss Lee for the prosecution submitted that Hasnah bte Ismail, the travel agent of MAS Travel Centre, said in evidence that when Seet and a male Chinese came to book the air ticket and she asked for the name of the passenger, Seet handed to her a piece of paper which was given to him by the male Chinese and she identified that piece of paper as P105, and Miss Lee therefore relied on this evidence as showing that Siang Leng was the male Chinese who went with Seet to MAS Travel Centre to book the air ticket. We have two observations on this evidence. First, it was not the case of the prosecution that the piece of paper handed to Hasnah at that time was P105. Secondly, we find it extraordinary that Hasnah could identify P105, and yet could not identify the male Chinese who went to MAS Travel Centre with Seet. There was nothing remarkable or unusual about that piece of paper that would enable her to identify it after such a long lapse of time: she first saw that piece of paper on 2 May 1986 and did not see it again until 15 May 1989 when she gave evidence. This evidence was given by her during the cross-examination by
Mr Gwee, and from the very elaborate and rather confused way questions were put at that point of time, it does not appear that she really understood those questions. Her evidence given during this part of the cross-examination was highly unsatisfactory. We are therefore unable to accept her evidence as to the identification of P105. If her evidence on the identification of P105 is accepted, we do not see how the prosecution can reconcile this with her earlier evidence given during her examination-in-chief when she said in no uncertain terms that when she asked Seet who the person was who was travelling, Seet turned to the male Chinese and asked the name, and the male Chinese wrote down the name on a white piece of paper and then passed that piece of paper to Seet who then passed it on to her. In fact, she said twice that the male Chinese wrote the name on the piece of paper. But the evidence adduced by the prosecution was that the handwriting on P105 was that of Yee and not Siang Leng. No evidence therefore has been adduced that Siang Leng was the male Chinese who went with Seet to book the air ticket for Yee.
Miss Lee submitted that Siang Leng was present at `the second meeting` at the Telok Ayer coffee shop on 2 May 1986 and that it was at that meeting that Siang Leng obtained the full name and telephone number of Yee which were written by Yee on the cigarette box papers, P105 and P105A, and that this was proved by the fact that these exhibits were found in Siang Leng`s purse after his arrest. This submission, however, is not supported by evidence of primary facts and the inferences that would reasonably be drawn. It is true that as Siang Leng and Ng were trailed by the narcotics officers to Telok Ayer Street at about 2.35pm on that day, it can be inferred that they went to the coffee shop. Also as P105 and P105A were found in Siang Leng`s possession after the arrest, it can be inferred that these were given to him. But it cannot be inferred from these facts that there was a meeting between Siew Chay, Yee, Seet, Ng and Siang Leng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop and that at that meeting Yee wrote on P105 and P105A his name and telephone number and gave P105 and P105A to Siang Leng.
Miss Lee made further submission on the following facts on the basis that they had been proved, namely, that as Siang Leng was seen by the narcotics officers at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop on 5 May 1986 with Ng and Siew Chay, the `obvious conclusion` was that Siang Leng `must have imparted the information to Siew Chay` in respect of the proposed departure of Yee for Amsterdam on 6 May 1986; that Siang Leng `assisted Ng to strap the drugs onto Yee` in Room 1214; that it was Siang Leng who provided Yee with the cash of US$1,000; that it was Siang Leng who instructed Seet to provide Yee with the name of the hotel in Amsterdam, and that after `the group` had decided that Siew Chay should bring Yee to the airport, it was Siang Leng who instructed Seet to give Siew Chay the money for the taxi fare and airport tax. We are unable to accept this submission. The whole of this submission was based on the oral statement of Ng and P155. There was no other evidence in support; nor can it be supported by any inference that can reasonably be drawn from the primary facts.
At the close of the case for the prosecution, there was direct evidence giving rise to the inference of Siang Leng`s association with Ng, Seet, Siew Chay and Yee, but there was no sufficient evidence giving rise to an inference of any act or acts that he did which facilitated Yee in transporting the drugs from River View Hotel to Changi Airport. The evidence of the actus reus was lacking. It is true that he emerged from the hotel together with Seet and Ng at about 9.10pm and they went to the airport, but there was no evidence as to what time he went to the hotel. The inference that can reasonably be drawn was that he was in Room 1214, River View Hotel, with Siew Chay, Seet, Ng and Yee. But, in our opinion, no inference can reasonably be drawn that he participated in the strapping of the drugs onto Yee`s legs or that he did any other act or acts that facilitated Yee`s transportation of the drugs. Apart from the oral statement of Ng and P155, there was no evidence that he participated in the strapping of the drugs onto Yee`s legs which, as we have said, took place in the hotel, or that he did any other act or acts that facilitated the transportation of the drugs by Yee from River View Hotel to Changi Airport. As the prosecution has accepted, these statements cannot be used to fill the gaps in the other evidence and can be used only in support of `other evidence` and the `other evidence` was lacking.
On the totality of the evidence, leaving aside the oral statement of Ng and P155, we find that the essential elements of the charge against Siang Leng have not been established at the close of the case for the prosecution. In our judgment, without relying substantially on the oral statement of Ng and P155, the prosecution has not established a case against Siang Leng which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The trial judges reached the finding that the prosecution had established the case by relying substantially on the oral statement of Ng and P155 and in effect using the contents of the latter to supplement substantially the other evidence adduced. This, in our opinion, is not correct. Accordingly, in our judgment, Siang Leng ought not to have been called to enter on his defence and the trial judges ought to have acquitted him. We accordingly so order.
After the trial judges had called for the defence, only Seet elected to give evidence; the others elected to remain silent. Seet`s own evidence was extremely lengthy and it is sufficient here to refer to the material parts thereof. He gave a long narrative of his association with Siang Leng. He said that on 2 May 1986 at about 3.30pm, Siang Leng telephoned him and asked him to fetch Siang Leng at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. He went there at about 4.30pm and that was the first time he went to the coffee shop. There he met Siang Leng and Ng who were with Siew Chay and Yee. He joined them. He said he ordered food for himself and sat at the next table, and later he was called over to Siang Leng`s table where he was asked about flights to Amsterdam. He told Siang Leng that he could bring him to a travel agent where he could then make enquiries. At that time he was not introduced to Siew Chay or Yee. Later, at the request of Siang Leng he brought Siang Leng to MAS Travel Centre at Prinsep Building. That was about 5pm. There he saw Hasnah bte Ismail whom he knew and who attended on them. Siang Leng made enquiries about flights to Amsterdam which he translated to Hasnah and Siang Leng handed to him a piece of paper to pass to Hasnah on which was written the name of Yee. They booked the ticket there and Hasnah requested them to collect the ticket on 5 May 1986 and handed back to him the piece of paper which he passed on to Siang Leng.
On 5 May 1986, some time in the afternoon, while he was driving Siang Leng to MAS Travel Centre, Siang Leng asked him to stop at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop. He took Siang Leng there and parked his car at the parking lot and waited for Siang Leng who came a short while later with Ng. He then drove them to MAS Travel Centre and parked his car just beside Prinsep Building. There, Siang Leng handed him two $1,000 notes and asked him to check the ticket to see that his passenger`s name and the flight number were correct. He went into the travel agency alone. He saw Hasnah and paid for the ticket which cost $1,950 and Hasnah handed him the change and gave him the ticket in the folder. The receipt was in the folder. When he returned to the car he handed the folder containing the ticket and the $50 change to Siang Leng who took out the ticket and checked the name with the piece of paper. Siang Leng then put the air ticket in his purse and left the folder in the glove compartment of his car. He then drove off and dropped Ng at Zion Road as requested.
On 6 May 1986 at about 1pm, he and Siang Leng went to the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop for lunch. As they walked towards the coffee shop, he saw Siew Chay and Yee coming out of the coffee shop and waiting outside. Siang Leng told him to have lunch at the coffee shop as he, Siang Leng, had to go somewhere. Siang Leng arranged to meet him later at 4pm at the River View Hotel coffee house. He had lunch at the coffee shop and after that he went to the River View Hotel coffee house at 3.20pm. He ordered a cup of coffee and waited there for Siang Leng who arrived later and then ordered some food. Siang Leng told him that his friends, the ones who were earlier at the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop, were staying at the hotel and invited him to go to the hotel room with Siang Leng. Siang Leng then took him to Room 1214 and that was the first time he had been to that room. Siew Chay and Yee were in the room. Later, Siang Leng asked him to order a cup of coffee for each of them and a plate of `chai tow kueh`, which he did. The coffee and food were brought later and Siang Leng signed the bill. Thereafter, in the course of conversation, he was asked by Siew Chay to recommend jobs in Amsterdam and after repeated requests he gave a false contact number in Amsterdam which Siew Chay noted. About this time, Yee asked about the weather in Amsterdam and whether it was cold. He said that though it was summer he had experienced cold weather in the evening. Yee mentioned that he had no jacket to which Siang Leng suggested that he, Seet, should give Yee his jacket. The jacket was at Bukit Batok. He told Yee that he could give him an old jacket. Yee also asked him what was the cheapest food available in Amsterdam and he told Yee about the Oceania Restaurant which was owned by a friend. He said that that was a good restaurant serving Singapore food and was cheap. He recommended that restaurant to Yee. He left them and spent about an hour at the hotel health centre.
Seet said that he left the hotel at about 6pm and drove to Bukit Batok. He went to his Bukit Batok flat and took out the leather jacket and put it in a Cloud Train paper bag. He then looked for the Oceania Restaurant name card but could not find it and he obtained the address of the restaurant from his girlfriend which he wrote down on a piece of paper. He left the Bukit Batok flat at about 7.15pm bringing along with him an Isetan bag and the Cloud Train bag. When he arrived at River View Hotel, he noticed that it was 7.45pm; he drove his car to the hotel driveway and parked his car behind the bus stop about 10m away from the hotel entrance. He then went up to Room 1214 and placed the Cloud Train bag containing the jacket on the bed. He also took out from his wallet the piece of paper on which he wrote the address of Oceania Restaurant. At that point of time, Siang Leng asked him also to write the name of Okura Hotel which he mentioned earlier; that he did. He then handed the piece of paper to Siang Leng who passed it to Yee. Thereafter, they decided to have some food and he placed the order for food. After they had had the food, Siew Chay and Yee left the room, Yee carrying the soft bag. A short while later, he, Ng and Siang Leng left the hotel. Siang Leng asked him to drop them at the airport and also suggested that they should go to the cafeteria there for some food. He agreed. He drove them to the airport. On arrival at the airport, Siang Leng asked that he and Ng be dropped off first. After dropping Ng and Siang Leng, he drove the car to the car park and as he was reversing the car he saw a bag behind the driver`s seat. After he had parked the car he turned around and took the bag to see what was in it. He found that it was a polythene bag and inside the bag were two folded paper bags and some articles; he put his right hand into the polythene bag and rummaged through and saw two rolls of masking tape and a hotel key. He took out the hotel key as he remembered Ng saying that Siew Chay would have a problem of getting into the hotel room. He then placed the polythene bag on the rear seat and then went to the departure hall of the airport. There he joined Yee who asked him to show the way to the departure gate, which he did. Not long thereafter, boarding time was announced and he, Yee and Siew Chay walked towards the departure gate. Yee went through to the immigration checkpoint. As he was about to go up to the cafeteria, he and Siew Chay were arrested by the narcotics officers.
Seet`s counsel called one PG Dunlop to give expert evidence on the fingerprints produced by the prosecution. He testified that he could not say that the fingerprint mark SC563/86 lifted from the roll of masking tape found in the OG bag in Seet`s car was the fingerprint of Seet. He said that there were insufficient details for evidential purposes. He was asked whether if one were to rummage through a polythene bag where there was masking tape, a print could be left thereon like the fingerprint mark SC563/86 to which he replied that it would be possible to leave an impression on any object handled in the bag.
Another witness for Seet was called and she is Patricia Leong Fang Yee. Her evidence was not helpful. The only part of her evidence that had any materiality was her testimony of Oceania Restaurant in Amsterdam.
At the conclusion of the case, the trial judges made their findings as follows. They found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution had established all the essential elements of the charge against Yee. It was in evidence that Yee was trailed from the time he left River View Hotel at about 9pm on 6 May 1986 to his arrival at the airport in the taxi SH1879R, and at the airport Yee was kept under constant surveillance until his arrest at about 10.25pm in the screening room of the boarding gate B27 where he had entered to board the flight SQ24 for Amsterdam. He was found to have strapped on his legs six packets of drugs which on subsequent analysis were found to contain not less than 1,693.47g of diamorphine. It had therefore been established that he transported these six packets of drugs from River View Hotel up to the boarding gate B27 at Changi Airport. In addition to the evidence, s 17 of the Act applied and a rebuttable presumption arose against Yee in the circumstances. The trial judges also referred to the two oral admissions made by Yee soon after the arrest which showed that he knew that the six packets he was carrying contained drugs. Further, his long written statement had been admitted in evidence. The trial judges found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that Yee was guilty of the charge. In our opinion, the finding made by the trial judges is unimpeachable. The evidence against him was overwhelming. His appeal is therefore dismissed.
We now turn to the finding by the trial judges against Siew Chay. Siew Chay elected not to give evidence or adduce any evidence when he was called upon to enter on his defence. The trial judges commented on this election made by Siew Chay which they were entitled so to do. The evidence adduced against him was also overwhelming. We have dealt with this evidence and it is unnecessary to recount it. It is true that in their finding that Siew Chay was guilty of the charge the trial judges also relied on the oral statement of Ng and P155. However, even discounting these statements entirely, there was ample evidence which showed that the trial judges were correct in arriving at the conclusion that Siew Chay had abetted Yee in the commission of the offence of trafficking in the quantity of diamorphine from River View Hotel to Changi Airport. In particular, we find correct the following finding made by the trial judges: 
 
It had been proved that the first accused brought the fifth accused to the airport by taxi and paid the taxi fare, thereby assisting the fifth accused to complete the act of transporting the drug from the River View Hotel to the airport.
 
 
 
It had been proved that the first accused assisted the fifth accused to check in and he paid the airport tax and thereby obtained the boarding pass which enabled the fifth accused to enter the boarding gate B27 where passengers of SQ24 were boarding for Amsterdam.
After the first accused had checked in for the fifth accused he waited with the fifth accused up to the time of boarding and walked with the fifth accused to the departure gate to ensure the departure of the fifth accused for Amsterdam.
From these primary and the other primary facts which we have discussed earlier, the inference that he knew that Yee was transporting the drugs from the River View Hotel to Changi Airport is irresistible and the essential elements of the charge have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The oral statement of Ng and P155 clearly lend support and assurance to the other evidence adduced against him. We dismiss his appeal.
We now consider the defence of Seet, and deal first with the very material piece of evidence, namely, the fingerprint mark SC563/86 (`the disputed mark`) lifted from the roll of masking tape, P87A, which was in a paper bag found in Seet`s car on 6 May 1986. The evidence of the prosecution was that the disputed mark was the thumbprint of Seet. There was the evidence of Inspector Lau Yeow Koon of the fingerprint section of the Criminal Record Office, Criminal Investigation Department. He testified that he traced the disputed mark to the right thumbprint of Seet but that owing to lack of sophisticated equipment and techniques he was unable to mark out sufficient points for positive identification. Accordingly, the disputed mark and other fingerprint marks and the fingerprints of all the accused were, on his recommendation, sent to New Scotland Yard, London and were examined by CA Hookway who was the senior fingerprint officer there. Hookway`s evidence was that he found 16 identical ridge characteristics between the disputed mark and Seet`s right thumbprint. He prepared a report of his findings which was produced. He also brought along comparison charts to support his analysis and findings and indicated to the trial judges the points of identification. Seet challenged the evidence that the disputed mark was his. He called PG Dunlop whose evidence was that the disputed mark was a bad print and that there were only six good points of similarity of ridge characteristics and not 16 as found by CA Hookway and that there were two more points of similarity which probably were correct but not extremely good. However, Dunlop could not say that the disputed mark was Seet`s; nor could he say that it did not belong to Seet. The trial judges found the evidence of CA Hookway eminently satisfactory and in answer to a submission made by counsel for Seet on a defect or weakness in Hookway`s evidence said: 
 
Hookway had more than adequately dealt with the manner by which he had made his findings during his examination-in-chief, which he elaborated in cross-examination.
 
 
 
On the basis of the evidence before them, the trial judges found that the disputed mark was that of Seet. In our opinion, the trial judges were amply justified in arriving at this finding.
We now turn to the evidence of Seet. The trial judges had considered his evidence and found that in certain respects he confirmed the evidence adduced by the prosecution. On that the trial judges were correct. In particular, Seet confirmed that on 2 May 1986 he went to the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop and he saw Siew Chay, Ng and Siang Leng and whilst he was there he saw a piece of cigarette paper with the name `Yee` written on it; that on 5 May 1986 he went to the Telok Ayer Street coffee shop with Siang Leng and drove off with Siang Leng and Ng; that he went to Room 1214, River View Hotel in the afternoon of 6 May; that he placed an order for food; that he went home to get his leather jacket and brought it back to Room 1214 and gave it to Yee; and that he gave the slip of paper with the address of Hotel Okura to Yee. In one material respect his evidence was at variance with that given by the narcotics officers: he testified that on 6 May 1986 he went to River View Hotel and arrived there at 7.45pm, whereas the evidence of the narcotics officers was that he arrived at the hotel at 7pm. The trial judges disbelieved him and accepted the evidence of the narcotics officers. The trial judges were justified in reaching this finding. Seet confirmed that on arrival at the hotel he went to Room 1214 and was there until about 9.10pm when he left with Ng and Siang Leng for the airport. The trial judges had considered the whole of the evidence of Seet and found that `his evidence was very cleverly contrived and tailored to meet the evidence of the prosecution`. They found his evidence on various material aspects concocted and incredible, and they disbelieved him. The trial judges were entitled to make these findings, and we can see no reason for not accepting them. Mr Fernando has not made any submission that their findings were wrong and ought to be rejected.
We agree with the trial judges` finding that Seet was guilty of the charge. We have discussed the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the inferences which we drew. Neither his evidence nor other evidence, whether adduced by the prosecution or the defence, has displaced any of these inferences. Looking at the oral statement of Ng and P155 we find that they lend support and assurance to the other evidence adduced. His appeal is therefore dismissed.
We allow the appeal of Siang Leng, set aside his conviction and the sentence, and order his acquittal.
 First, second and fourth appellants` appeals dismissed; third appellant`s appeal allowed

The respondent was tried with one Wong Wai Hung in the High Court on the following charge: 
 
That you, 
(1) Wong Wai Hung 
(2) Ho So Mui
 
 
 
on or about 5 November 1988 at about 11pm at the Departure Hall Gate C35, Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did attempt to export from Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 32 blocks of drugs containing not less than 4,594.65g of diamorphine without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under
 
 
 
ss 7 and 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), read with s 34 of the Penal Code
 
 
 
(Cap 224), and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
At the close of the prosecution`s case, a submission of no case to answer on her behalf was upheld by the learned judicial commissioner, Mr MPH Rubin [see 
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 927
  ]. The public prosecutor appealed against her acquittal and at the end of the hearing before us, we dismissed the appeal for the reasons which follow.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was contained in the respondent`s statements to the narcotics officers after her arrest (` the statements`) and on the evidence given by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) who kept surveillance on the respondent and Wong Wai Hung (`Wong`) from the time the two arrived at the check-in counter at Changi Airport on 5 November 1988 in order to board flight SQ36 to Zurich.
The statements showed that the respondent, a Hong Kong national, befriended one John Wong (later identified as one Say Ngan Chai) socially in Hong Kong. About two weeks before her arrest in Singapore, John Wong asked her to tea and on that occasion, she was introduced to Wong. During tea, John Wong told her of Wong`s intention to smuggle `Du Pont pens and lighters into Switzerland` via Singapore. John Wong asked her to accompany Wong on the trip as Wong`s wife as Wong was not well versed in English while she, presumably, was better at the language. She was told that Wong would pay for her return air ticket for the trip and that she would receive HK$20,000 for the errand. She accepted the proposal.
The respondent arrived alone in Singapore as prearranged on the evening of
3 November 1988 carrying with her a brown LV bag, a shoulder sling handbag and a plastic bag containing her winter coat. She checked into the Supreme Hotel and attempted to call John Wong in Hong Kong but did not reach him. She tried again the next morning and left a message for him to return her call. This he did around noon. He told her that Wong was already in Singapore and staying at the Strand Hotel. He also confirmed the earlier arrangement that she was to meet Wong at the restaurant in the Supreme Hotel at 11pm that day. The respondent then checked out of the Supreme Hotel as it was noisy and, being unable to get a room at the Strand Hotel, checked into the Bencoolen Hotel.
She then occupied herself for the rest of the day and met Wong at the Supreme Hotel in the night. They then went to Wong`s room in the Strand Hotel where she asked to see the Du Pont pens and lighters. Wong told her that the things were deposited at the left luggage counter at Changi Airport. They then agreed that the respondent should check out of her hotel room at noon the next day and go to Wong`s room in the Strand Hotel and wait there until it was time to go to the airport. She then returned to her hotel.
On the next day, she joined Wong as arranged and they stayed in the hotel room until 7.30pm when they checked out and had dinner at the hotel. They then left for the airport together by taxi. At the airport, she checked in on behalf of Wong and herself. Wong was at this time seated away from the check-in counter. She did not check in any luggage.
After checking in, they proceeded directly to boarding gate C35. She was carrying the three bags she had when she arrived from Hong Kong and Wong carried a grey bag. At the boarding gate, Wong left her with all the bags and went to the left luggage counter. He returned about 20 minutes later with a black Gucci bag, a brown plastic bag and a grey suit jacket. The latter two were handed to the respondent who placed the brown plastic bag into Wong`s grey bag. She also took out the winter coat in her plastic bag and placed it in Wong`s grey bag.
Wong then took the Gucci bag to the male toilet near the boarding gate. He returned ten minutes later perspiring. He commented that his grey bag was overloaded. The respondent then took out the winter coat from the grey bag and gave it to Wong who placed it in the Gucci bag. They then continued to wait for the boarding date to open.
About half an hour later, the boarding gate opened and the respondent went in ahead of Wong. She carried her LV bag, her handbag and the plastic bag which now contained only a Chinese magazine. She passed through the screening room and waited in the holding area for about five minutes before boarding the aircraft. She was about to take her seat when she was arrested and taken out to the holding area where her bags were searched. Nothing incriminating was found in them. She then learnt that Wong had been arrested and that drugs had been found in the Gucci bag.
The account of the events that occurred at Changi Airport on 5 November 1988 contained in the statements was corroborated by the testimony of officers from the CNB who had kept surveillance on Wong and the respondent at the airport. None of the officers could testify to the respondent examining or in any way touching the Gucci bag during the time she and Wong were at the boarding gate. The diamorphine forming the subject matter of the charge against the respondent and Wong was found in cloth pockets sewn onto the insides of a cloth vest and a panty girdle carried in the Gucci bag. It was also found in a secret compartment at the bottom of the same bag.
No independent evidence was put forward to corroborate the account of the events in Hong Kong contained in the statements. The respondent`s statement made pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) said little: 
 
I did not carry heroin. There was no heroin on my body. I was not with the male Chinese who was arrested together with me. That is all.
 
 
 
Reference need be made to Wong`s statements only for the purpose of completing the picture as the prosecution rightly did not seek to rely on the contents of those statements for the purpose of making out its case against the respondent. In his statements, Wong sought to lay the blame entirely upon the respondent. He claimed that she was his wife or woman and that the Gucci bag was hers and he was only carrying it for her.
 The decision below
The learned judicial commissioner held that the prosecution failed to make out a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the respondent [see 
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 927
  ]. In his view, the prosecution had not adduced any primary evidence of a common intention on the part of Wong and the respondent to export the diamorphine and that the circumstantial evidence adduced did not show or lead to an inference that she knew of the diamorphine or that the bag contained diamorphine. He held that her admission to being a party to a plan to smuggle Du Pont pens and lighters did not form a proper basis for a case to answer on a charge of attempting to export controlled drugs. He found that the `Achilles heel` in the prosecution`s case was the absence of any evidence that the respondent handled the Gucci bag at any time.
The prosecution had also sought to prove that the respondent was in joint possession of the Gucci bag in order to invoke the presumptions in ss 18(1) and (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the MDA`) that she was in possession of the diamorphine and knew of its nature. It should be noted that the prosecution had abandoned any reliance on the presumption in s 18(4) of the Act, namely: 
 
Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
 
 
 
The learned judicial commissioner held that the prosecution failed to prove that the respondent was in joint possession as it had contended that the Gucci bag belonged to Wong and the evidence adduced showed that the respondent never handled or came into contact with the Gucci bag. Further, the plan to smuggle pens and lighters to Switzerland `had no perceptible connection to a drug charge`.
The learned DPP submitted before us that the learned judicial commissioner was wrong to hold that the elements of common intention and joint possession had not been made out. He accepted that reliance had to be placed on the plan, revealed in the statements, to smuggle Du Pont pens and lighters for the purpose of proving both these elements and he conceded that without that evidence there was no case against the respondent. It will be convenient to set out our reasons for rejecting his submissions under each element separately even though, as will be seen, there is considerable overlap between the two issues.
 Joint possession/custody
The learned DPP put his contention that there was sufficient evidence of joint possession or joint custody of the Gucci bag to invoke the statutory presumptions in ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA at the forefront of his submissions. In a sense, this was somewhat wider than the submission below which was based solely, it would appear from the transcript and the judgment below, on the ground of joint possession. No objection was taken by counsel for the respondent and since the facts relied on were the same, we dealt with both matters.
It was said that the following facts showed joint possession or joint custody of the Gucci bag: 
 
 
(1) the plan to smuggle Du Pont pens and lighters into Switzerland with the respondent acting as Wong`s wife; 
 
(2) the respondent and Wong checked in together at the airport; 
 
(3) they walked together to the boarding gate and waited there together before attempting to board the aircraft; 
 
(4) a panty girdle was found in the Gucci bag; and 
 
(5) the respondent`s failure to ask about the Gucci bag or its contents after Wong had collected it from the left luggage counter and had it by him while waiting with the respondent to board the aircraft.
  
 
 
Joint possession or custody of the Gucci bag would invoke the presumptions in
ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA as they provide, where material: 
 
 
(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control - 
 
(a) anything containing a controlled drug;
  
 
 
... 
shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. 
(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
 
 
 
As a result, it was submitted that joint possession of the diamorphine had been proven.
We were unable to accept that submission for several reasons. The reliance upon the plan to smuggle the Du Pont pens and lighters depended upon that plan being true. The DPP at this point attempted to divide the respondent`s statement into two parts: (1) the plan to smuggle, and (2) the contraband being Du Pont pens and lighters. He then contended, on the authority of 
Chan Kin Choi v PP
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  that the court should not, at the close of the prosecution`s case, assume (2) to be true. He was silent on whether (1) could be taken to be true. In 
Chan Kin Choi
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  this court stated (at pp 263-264): 
 
We should now refer to an astonishing submission made by former counsel of the appellant. In contending that there was no case to meet, he submitted that the explanations of the appellant given by the appellant in his voluntary statement should be accepted as true on the ground that the voluntary statement had been tendered by the prosecution as part of its case against the appellant. This extravagant submission not unexpectedly received short shrift from the trial judges. They ruled that it was not the law in Singapore that exculpatory statements in a confession used by the prosecution as part of its evidence were admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents thereof. That ruling was patently correct. Otherwise, prosecution could never put in a confession of murder if they are bound to accept the truth of an accused`s explanations and thus defeat the purpose of using the confession.
 
 
 
The distinction is thus between inculpatory and exculpatory parts of a statement. We did not see how the statements as regards the plan to smuggle contraband could be taken as inculpatory with reference to a charge of attempting to export controlled drugs. If the truth of her statement that the contraband was Du Pont pens and lighters could not be accepted at this stage, then equally we could not accept that there was a plan to smuggle. On that basis, by the DPP`s own concession that the events in Singapore alone did not prove joint possession of the diamorphine, the prosecution had not made out its case.
Even, however, on the assumption that there was in truth a plan to smuggle, we were not convinced that there was sufficient evidence to show joint custody or joint possession of the Gucci bag. While the respondent clearly knew that the Gucci bag was present, there was no evidence that she had any power over the bag. In 
Leow Nghee Lim v R
 
 [1956] MLJ 28 
 Taylor J defined `custody` in the following language (at p 29): 
 
Custody means having care or guardianship; goods in custody are in the care of the custodian and, by necessary implication, he is taking care of them on behalf of someone else. You cannot take care of goods unless you know where they are and have the means of exercising control over them. Custody therefore implies knowledge of the existence and whereabouts of the goods and power of control over them, not amounting to possession.
 
 
 
This definition was approved of in 
PP v Ang Boon Foo
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 40
 
Possession was described in 
Leow Nghee Lim v R
 
 [1956] MLJ 28 
 as differing from custody in the sense that a possessor of property has the power of disposal over that property while a custodian has no such power. The point was put somewhat differently by Thomson J in 
Chan Pean Leon v PP
 
 
[1956] MLJ 237
  where the learned judge said (at p 238): 
 
Of course there can be no possession without knowledge and there can be no possession without some power of disposal but an essential ingredient of all possession is that there must be an intention as owner in case of need to exercise that power to the exclusion of other persons.
 
 
 
In 
 R v Strong 
, 
R v Strong
 (Unreported) the English Court of Appeal had to consider the question of what the prosecution has to prove in order to make out the charge of joint possession of cannabis where the cannabis was found concealed in the car in which the accused were travelling. Lord Lane LCJ is reported as having said: 
 
It had to entail that, although no one of them had the packages or any of them on his person or in his pockets, yet each had the right to say what should be done with the cannabis - a right shared with his colleagues.
 
 
 
As Lord Widgery, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said in 
 R v Searle 
 (unreported, 5 July 1971): `The sort of direction to which the deputy recorder should have opened the jury`s mind was to ask them to consider whether these drugs formed a kind of common pool from which all had the right to draw.`
If Strong might not have known about the presence of the cannabis in the car - in other words, unless he was proved to have known about the cannabis - he could not be in joint control of it. It stood to reason that knowledge in such circumstances was a sine qua non of possession.
However, even if he did know about its presence, that was not enough. The mere fact that someone, for instance, had told him that there was cannabis in the car would not be enough to saddle him with possession.
In short, mere presence in the same vehicle as the drug and in particular where there was no evidence of knowledge could not amount in the circumstances of the present case to evidence from which the jury could properly infer possession, whether individual or joint.
There was no evidence which could properly be said to call for an explanation from Strong.
What evidence was there in the present case that the respondent had joint care or guardianship, much less joint power of disposal over the Gucci bag? When she asked to see the Du Pont pens and lighters while in Wong`s room in the Strand Hotel, she was told that the things were at the airport where, on the prosecution`s case, they had been deposited by Wong before the respondent`s arrival in Singapore. After Wong had collected the bag from the left luggage counter the next evening, prosecution offered no evidence that she came into actual physical contact with the Gucci bag. However, the learned DPP contended that the fact that she did not ask about the bag during the time she and Wong were at the boarding gate and the fact of the presence of the panty girdle when viewed with the plan conceived in Hong Kong could form the basis for an inference that she had some control over the bag. He relied on the decision in 
KJ Barlow v PP
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 104
  We do not need to deal with that decision as the question is one of fact and necessarily varies from case to case. It must be remembered, in the present case, that the evidence showed that the plan was for the respondent to assist Wong through any difficulties he might have with the English language. There was simply no evidence that her role involved any control over or care for the Gucci bag at all. Her failure to ask about the bag was of no assistance to the prosecution`s case and, in the absence of any admissible evidence that the panty girdle was hers or was meant for her, the presence of the panty girdle in the bag was of no relevance. It was elicited from witnesses called by the prosecution that the panty girdle was in fact much too large for the respondent.
 Common intention
The learned DPP conceded in his reply that the appeal would fail if we found against him on the issue of joint custody or joint possession of the Gucci bag. However, in view of counsel`s arguments on the question of common intention, we will deal briefly with the views we formed on this element of the charge against the respondent.
There was little dispute as to the applicable law. On a charge involving common intention, the prosecution has to show that there was a prearranged plan to commit a criminal act and the crime forming the subject of the charge was done in concert pursuant to that prearranged plan: 
Mahbub Shah v Emperor
 
[1945] PC 118
 
Mimi Wong & Anor v PP
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
 
The first difficulty here was the fact that the existence of the plan to smuggle contraband into Switzerland via Singapore was known only from the statements. As pointed out before, there was no logical basis for accepting the existence of the plan as being true while rejecting the assertion that the contraband was Du Pont pens and lighters.
Secondly, even if it was assumed in favour of the prosecution`s case that the plan to smuggle was true, we agreed with the learned judicial commissioner`s view that no `unity of criminal behaviour` had been proven. In 
Mimi Wong & Anor v PP
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 75
  this court stated (at p 79): 
 
If the nature of the offence depends on a particular intention the intention of the actual doer of the criminal act has to be considered. What this intention is will decide the offence committed by him and then s 34 applies to make the others vicariously or collectively liable for the same offence. The intention that is an ingredient of the offence constituted by the criminal act is the intention of the actual doer and must be distinguished from the common intention of the doer and his confederates. It may be identical with the common intention or it may not. Where it is not identical with the common intention, it must nevertheless be consistent with the carrying out of the common intention, otherwise the criminal act done by the actual doer would not be in furtherance of the common intention.
 
 
 
The above passage clearly indicates that the prosecution cannot simply allege a plan to smuggle in vacuo. Indeed, the prosecution was in some difficulty in this case. They could not assert, without first proving joint possession or joint custody of the Gucci bag, that the common intention was to carry drugs from Hong Kong to Switzerland via Singapore. If they were prevented from doing so, the assertion of a common intention to smuggle contraband pens and lighters was clearly an assertion of a common intention at variance with that of carrying drugs. The appellant thus failed to establish the element of common intention.
 Events after the acquittal
Before we leave this judgment, we should comment on the events which occurred after the respondent`s acquittal on 1 September 1992. On that evening, the respondent`s solicitors received a telefax from the appellant asking that the respondent remain in Singapore as she might be needed as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution in its case against Wong. On 2 September 1992, after receiving legal advice, she agreed to co-operate with the prosecution and was interviewed by the CNB later that day. She was released by the CNB that evening but was re-arrested the following evening after a notice of appeal was filed against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner. We should say that no allegation of mala fides has been levelled at the appellant and the learned DPP clarified that the interviewing of the respondent before a final decision was taken on whether to appeal against the decision below was due to miscommunication in the appellant`s chambers.
Mr Sant Singh submitted on behalf of the respondent that by interviewing the respondent, the appellant had irreparably prejudiced her chances of a fair trial and urged this court, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction over its procedure, to prevent such an abuse of powers by staying the proceedings against the respondent (if we were minded to allow the appeal). Reliance was placed on dicta in the cases of 
Jago v District Court of New South Wales
 
[1989] 87 ALR 577
 and 
Attorney General`s Reference (No 1 of 1990)
 
[1992] 3 All ER 169
We would record our grave doubts over the correctness of the appellant`s actions in the days after the respondent`s acquittal below. However, in view of our decision to dismiss the appeal, and in the absence of full argument on the nature and extent of the court`s inherent jurisdiction over its criminal procedure, we would decline to express any definitive view on Mr Sant Singh`s contentions although we are of the preliminary view that such a power to stay criminal proceedings in circumstances where it can be shown that the accused could not have a fair trial exists.
There is one further matter. After the decision to dismiss the appeal was announced, counsel for both sides informed us that under the present procedure adopted by the immigration authorities, the appellant had to spend the night in the custody of these authorities as an illegal immigrant because of her lack of immigration papers. The unsatisfactory nature of such an arrangement must be obvious to all as her lack of immigration papers was due only to her remand in prison because of these proceedings and not because of any voluntary overstaying in this country.

Both appellants were jointly tried and after a very protracted trial were convicted in the High Court on 26 November 1993 of their respective charges. We dismissed their appeals on 18 April 1994 and now set out our reasons.
 Prosecution case
At about 4.30pm on 31 May 1989, at the Kiong Xi Lounge of the Tai Pan Ramada Hotel, under the surveillance of a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) officers, NO Lee Kiong Lock (`NO Lee`) was introduced as `Mike` by a CNB agent to the second appellant as an interested buyer of drugs. NO Lee queried the second appellant as to what was on offer. The second appellant replied that his connection had 1.5kg of brown sugar (common jargon for heroin from South America and the Golden Crescent) and 450g of pure white heroin for sale. After some haggling over the price, NO Lee offered a price of $50,000. The second appellant was given NO Lee`s pager number and he said that he would get in touch with his connection in India. The second appellant was staying in Room 1808, Dai-Ichi Hotel, and he gave NO Lee the telephone number of the hotel. NO Lee was told that, upon confirmation of the order, delivery would be effected within 48 hours but, if more drugs were required, it would take about 12 days.
After a number of telephone calls, a second meeting was held at the Sea Breeze Coffee House of the Dai-Ichi Hotel at 7.45pm on 1 June 1989. At this meeting, the second appellant informed NO Lee that his connection`s lowest price was $85,000 and also that the connection could arrive in Singapore on 2 June 1989. The price was agreed to. When told by NO Lee that he intended to export the drugs for resale in the United States, the second appellant said that he could also arrange for the drugs to be delivered in the States. The meeting ended with NO Lee asking the second appellant to contact him when his connection arrived so that he could get his money ready. A series of telephone conversations followed concerning the arrival date of the second appellant`s connection. Finally at about 8.15pm on 6 June 1989 the second appellant confirmed to NO Lee that his connection had arrived. NO Lee said that he would contact him the following day at about 10.30am.
On 7 June 1989 at 10.30am, NO Lee telephoned the second appellant at the Dai-Ichi Hotel and said that the money would only be ready after 1pm, whereupon the second appellant said that he had kept the day free for the transaction and also had samples which NO Lee could view to satisfy himself. At about 1.40pm on the same day, NO Lee arranged with the second appellant to meet him at the Luna Coffee House of the Apollo Hotel at 2pm that same afternoon. NO Lee arrived there at about 1.50pm and was watched by two parties of CNB officers. At about 2pm, NO Lee noticed a male Indian (whom he later identified as the first appellant) walking into the coffee house and occupying a table close to him. The second appellant arrived at 2.05pm. NO Lee asked him for the sample. The second appellant took out a Dai-Ichi matchbox from a black pouch which he was carrying and gave it to NO Lee. NO Lee then excused himself to go to the toilet. He opened the matchbox and saw one packet wrapped in silver foil and one wrapped in brown paper. He tested the drugs in the toilet with his Narcoban drug test kit and, although both samples produced reactions, only the brown powder tested positive for heroin. Nonetheless, he decided not to quibble with the second appellant over the authenticity of the white powder as that would only expose his cover since only CNB officers carried Narcoban drug test kits. Upon his return to the table, NO Lee was informed by the second appellant that he had not brought the drugs for security reasons and that they would be delivered by a person named `Kumar` in two hours` time. When asked why such a procedure had to be adopted, the second appellant replied that some precautions were necessary as the punishment for trafficking in drugs was hanging. All this while, the first appellant had been sitting at the next table having a meal alone. NO Lee queried the second appellant as to how he would identify this `Kumar` but the second appellant told him not to worry. NO Lee and the second appellant then parted company.
Two hours later, the first appellant arrived at the coffee house with a bag slung over his shoulders. He introduced himself as `Kumar` to NO Lee. NO Lee asked him if he had the drug. The first appellant said it was in the bag and placed the bag under the table. The first appellant agreed to NO Lee inspecting the drug in the toilet. In the toilet, NO Lee examined the bag. There were ten mangoes on top of two packets. One packet was a transparent polythene packet containing a whitish powder while the other packet was a brown cloth-like packet with some brownish powder on the outside of the packet. He did not test either packet as he assumed that they were representative of the matchbox samples he had tested earlier on. NO Lee returned to the table, gave the pre-arranged signal and the first appellant was promptly arrested by the CNB officers.
The second appellant was arrested on the same day at a coffee shop in Hougang having a drink with a business associate, one Naser bin K Ismail (`Naser`). The CNB officers had trailed the second appellant from the Dai-Ichi Hotel. Naser was a prosecution witness who testified that on that day, at 4.20pm, the second appellant had paged him and requested the use of his van to collect some fax machines from Jalan Ampas and to store them at Naser`s store at Jalan Pelikat. After the errand was completed, they had gone to Hougang to have a drink when they were arrested by CNB officers.
On the evening of the same day, SNO Lim Chei Yoo (`SNO Lim`), the investigating officer, and other officers were taken by the first appellant to 12-A Upper Dickson Road, a lodging house where he had been staying, to see the two bags. He had told SNO Lim that the drugs had been hidden in the false bottom of the bag with the combination number `018`. He had collected that bag from the President Merlin Hotel in January 1989 and had left it with an employee of the lodging house for safekeeping. The second bag had been given to him by the second appellant. Although the appellants made certain statements to the CNB officers, the prosecution chose not to rely on them. They were instead admitted as defence exhibits and will be referred to later on. The matchbox with the samples that was given to NO Lee by the second appellant at the Luna Coffee House was to be the bone of contention both here and below. NO Lee had handed it over to SNO Lim only the following day and he explained that he had kept the matchbox in his pocket and only realized that oversight the following day. Counsel below had urged the trial judge to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution from this delay on NO Lee`s part. The contents of the brown packet were analyzed by Dr Saw Chwee Hock of the department of scientific services and found to contain not less than 325.7g of diamorphine. However, the contents of the transparent white packet was analyzed to be trimprazine, which is
 not 
 a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`MDA`). Dr Lee Tong Kooi, who analyzed a urine sample of the first appellant on 8 June 1989, found that it contained morphine.
 First appellant`s defence
The first appellant admitted to delivering the two packets to NO Lee on 7 June 1989 at the Luna Coffee House. In essence, his defence was that he only delivered them to NO Lee on behalf of the second appellant because he had actually tasted the packet containing trimprazine and, from his experience, was convinced that it was not heroin. As such, he also assumed that the other packet, similarly, did not contain heroin.
The first appellant said that his real name was Chockalingam Vishwanathan. The discrepancy in names was because the second appellant had arranged for him to travel on a passport belonging to one Govindarajulu Murali and had simply replaced the latter`s photograph in the passport with that of the first appellant. Govindarajulu`s occupation was listed as `engineer`, which was most convenient since engineers and other professionals did not require permission from the immigration authorities to leave India. The first appellant was 27 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. He had studied commerce at Annamalai University but had not graduated. He then worked as a medical sales representative in a pharmaceutical company in Tamil Nadu. In 1984, he managed a dairy farm run by his father`s friend and also did house-brokering as a part-time business. It was at that time that he was introduced to the second appellant. The second appellant was running a business in Madras called `Big Boss` which dealt in fax machines and electrical goods. He sold electrical products and fax machines for the second appellant on a commission basis. The second appellant also gave him loans and provided financial assistance for his wife`s studies in medical college.
In 1987, the first appellant came to Singapore as a tourist, travelling under his original passport. On 23 April 1988, he travelled under Govidarajulu`s passport to meet a person called Selva in order to purchase goods which he brought back to India for the second appellant. On 26 November 1988, in Madras, the second appellant handed him a baggage claim tag of the President Merlin Hotel and told him to go to Singapore and collect a blue bag with combination number `018`, and to inform him by telephone once that had been done. He collected the bag and brought it to a boarding house at Upper Dickson Road where he was staying. At the boarding house, he opened the bag and saw clothing in it. He handed it to an employee of the boarding house, one Jabamalai Marian, who subsequently told his son, Marian Darlas, to look after it. When he informed the second appellant that the bag had been collected, the second appellant said that he would be arriving in Singapore the next day and asked the first appellant to meet him at the airport.
The next day, he went to the airport with one of his Singaporean friends, Haridas, to meet the second appellant. When the second appellant arrived, they waited in vain for one of his friends, Balraj, to arrive from the United States but the latter did not turn up. Haridas dropped both appellants at Peninsula Hotel, where the second appellant was staying. He told the second appellant that he had collected the bag and that it was in the store at his boarding house. The second appellant said he would take the bag when he needed it. The next day, Balraj arrived. Two or three days later, on 4 December 1988, the first appellant returned to India on the same flight as Balraj and his family.
When the second appellant returned to India, he paid him a courtesy call at the former`s house. The second appellant asked if the bag was safe and secure, and told him that it contained precious stones and other valuables. Although he had opened it and seen only clothing, he did not tell the second appellant of that fact and just kept quiet.
On 17 December 1988, the second appellant instructed him to go to Singapore, where he would give further instructions as to the handing over of the bag. The second appellant came to Singapore, stayed at the Peninsula Hotel but did not give any instructions as to the bag. They both returned to India on 3 January 1989. A few days later, the second appellant informed him that he was arranging for him to go to Singapore on 10 January 1989 to hand over the bag. It was at that point that the second appellant revealed that the bag had a false bottom in which there were raw materials for making medicinal tablets which were to be exported to India. This confused him as he had earlier been told that there were precious stones and other valuables. He did not question the second appellant about this but spoke to one Dr Chitravelu who assured him that it was all right to carry such things as the former had done it when he was in a UN Peace Keeping Force.
The next trip he made to Singapore was in June 1989. On 3 June 1989, the second appellant, who was then in Singapore, sent for him. The second appellant told him that he had obtained ten fax machines and he wanted him to bring them and other goods back to India. He then took a flight to Singapore on 6 June 1989. On arrival in Singapore, he stayed at the boarding house at Upper Dickson Road. The second appellant was staying at the Dai-Ichi Hotel. He met the second appellant at his hotel room at about 7.30pm. The second appellant then showed him a blue bag similar to the one he had earlier collected and showed him where the false bottom was. The second appellant revealed that within the false bottom of the first blue bag there were two packets. He was then asked to dispose of the bag after the second appellant put into it some articles that he no longer wanted. He took the bag away with him.
On the next day, 7 June 1989, at about 9am, he was summoned by the second appellant to the Dai-Ichi Hotel. Whilst at the hotel room, the second appellant received some calls and the first appellant overheard him saying that he would be at the Apollo Hotel at 1.45pm. The second appellant then asked the first appellant to go with him and initially handed him a matchbox, but then changed his mind and took it back. He was told to go to the coffee house at the Apollo Hotel and observe the person whom the second appellant would be meeting. He left for the Apollo Hotel by taxi. He went into the coffee house there at about 1.30pm and sat at a table. The second appellant then appeared and sat at a table occupied by a male Chinese. Ten to 15 minutes later the second appellant left and he followed suit five minutes later, returning to the Dai-Ichi Hotel. At the Dai-Ichi Hotel, the second appellant told him that the Chinese man he had seen was his friend from whom the second appellant had asked financial assistance. Furthermore, he was the one who was going to help him export the raw materials in the bag. He was to obtain a dozen mangoes as a gift and deliver them together with the raw materials to the Chinese man at the same coffee house within one and one and a half hours. He was told that the Chinese man`s name was `Mike` and that he was to introduce himself to Mike as `Kumar`. He was told that Mike would then give him S$85,000, consisting of US$20,000 and S$45,000, and this would be the loan which Mike had extended to the second appellant. He was worried that Mike would not hand over such a large sum of money to him but the second appellant told him that he had to collect some fax machines that afternoon and assured him that, if he introduced himself as Kumar, Mike would hand over the money. The first appellant confirmed that Mike was NO Lee.
The first appellant`s cautioned statement and four other statements were admitted at his counsel`s request. In reply to a joint charge of trafficking that he and the second appellant had offered to sell 1,588.47g of diamorphine for $85,000 to NO Lee, he stated as follows: 
 
I was just asked to deliver the bag and to obtain $85,000. I do not feel guilty as I was told that the stuff is going to be re-exported to Europe. It was not me who brought the stuff to Singapore. The stuff was not to be used in Singapore. They convinced me.
 
 
 
The contents of his statements made to the CNB on 12, 13, 20 and 22 June 1989 were as follows:
 
 
(1) How he came to travel on another person`s passport (in accordance with his evidence in court). 
 
(2) That he was not a heroin addict and had never tried any kind of drugs, explaining that the drug in his urine might have come from his inhaling the powder from the false bottom of the suitcase in which the two packets were stored. 
 
(3) That the second appellant told him that the bag had precious stones but later stated that it contained powder for making medicinal tablets which were of not much value in Singapore and would be handed over to someone who would re-export it out of Singapore. 
 
(4) The second appellant`s instructions to him regarding the delivery of the packets and how he removed the two packets from the false bottom of the blue bag and delivered the packets to NO Lee. The following passage from his statement of 13 June 1989 is reproduced in full in order to compare it with the first appellant`s evidence in court:
  
 
 
Inside the room, Naidu [the second appellant] asked me whether I had seen the other man and I answered that I did. He then told me that this man`s name was Mike and that his friend who would be assisting him financially (sic). He would be the one who would re-export the tablets in the false bottom of the suitcase left at the boarding house. He also told me that the amount was about $85,000 and that $20,000 would be in US currency and the rest in Singapore currency. He told me to return to Dickson Road and pack the tablets found in the false bottom into another bag and to place some mangoes on top as a gift to this friend of his. He also told me that the meeting time was one to one and a half hour`s away, and I was to introduce myself to Mike as `Kumar`.
 
 
 
I then left the hotel and took a taxi to Dickson Road. Inside the boarding house, I asked a small boy to carry the suitcase from the store to my room. While inside the room, I opened the false bottom of the suitcase and saw a packet containing white powder and another packet plastered all over. I then took out both the packets and placed them inside a black canvas bag of mine. I then placed some mangoes on top of the two packets. These mangoes were brought from India by me. From Dickson Road, I took a taxi to Apollo Hotel and arrived there at about 4.15pm.
It will be noted that there was no mention at all of any tasting of the contents of the packet. In his evidence in court, the first appellant testified that the brown packet was very dusty whilst the transparent packet was not. When he dusted the brown packet, the dust had a very strong and irritating smell. He told the court that when he saw the white powder he became suspicious as the second appellant had initially told him that the bag had precious stones and he suspected that the white powder might be heroin. He made a slight tear just below the centre of the plaster and tasted a bit of the powder. It tasted very bitter. He left the room to purchase a piece of `Elastoplast` to cover the hole as well as to buy some sweets to counter the bitterness in his mouth. He told the court that, after tasting the powder, he was satisfied that it was not heroin. He was sure of this because he had previously tasted and smelt heroin at university through a friend of his. He had also learnt during his stint at the pharmaceutical company about opiates and drugs. However, he did not taste the contents of the brown packet as he had assumed that it was the same as the transparent one, ie not heroin. He, therefore, proceeded with the second appellant`s instructions to deliver the packets.
The first appellant did not dispute NO Lee`s account of what then happened at the Luna Coffee House but he denied that NO Lee had used the word `drug` and said that he had used the word `things` instead. Haridas was called to testify for the first appellant but was unable to add much to the first appellant`s evidence, save that he corroborated some details and added that, to his knowledge, the first appellant had come to Singapore to take electronic and other goods back to India for the second appellant.
 Second appellant`s defence
The second appellant`s defence was essentially to dissociate himself from the first appellant`s delivery of the drugs as much as possible and to claim that his negotiations with NO Lee were for the sale of hydraulic and lithographic printing machines. In his evidence in court, he stated that he was introduced to the first appellant in mid-1988 by a mutual friend so that he could help the first appellant secure some lorry contracts from the government of Tamil Nadu. He said that he was only a consultant to one Chendur Pandian, who was the actual proprietor of the Big Boss and a close friend of his. In fact, he visited Big Boss only a few times a year. He denied that he had arranged a passport for the first appellant, or that he had given him any financial assistance other than on one occasion, when he lent him 40,000 rupees, or that he had left any blue bag at the President Merlin Hotel or any bag at all. He denied having asked the first appellant to come to Singapore. He denied that the first appellant had called at his room on 6 June 1989. He said that the first appellant had only called on him the next day on 7 June 1989 to assure him that he would repay the 40,000 rupees within the next days.
He testified that the meetings with Mike were for the purchase of some second-hand hydraulic and lithographic printing machines and had been set up by a person known as Quah. It was in this context that Mike had been given his pager number. While he admitted that Mike had discussed brown sugar, he thought that Mike was referring to jaggery (coarse brown Indian sugar made from palm sap) and was surprised that Mike wanted jaggery as it was mainly used by rural folk. Mike then enlightened him that brown sugar referred to drugs, whereupon the second appellant claimed that he said he was not interested in the drug business and did not know anyone who was. In the various telephone conversations, Mike had kept on trying to interest him in drugs, whereas he was only interested in lithographic machines. On 4 June 1989, he was so tired of Mike`s continuous pestering regarding drugs that he lost his temper and shouted at him. However, he explained that, on 6 June 1989, he responded to Mike`s pager call because he thought that, after being shouted at, Mike might finally be interested in printing presses rather than drugs.
He had intended to leave Singapore for Batam on 7 June 1989. As he was checking out of the hotel, Mike paged for him and asked to meet up with him for lunch. He claimed that he only agreed in order to use the opportunity to get rid of Mike once and for all and to tell him that he was leaving. At about noon that day, the first appellant had turned up to tell him that he would be repaying the 40,000 rupee loan. A while later, the fax machine salesman arrived. When the salesman left, the first appellant asked him for a loan of $500. This angered him as the first appellant had not fully repaid the initial loan. It was at this time that Mike called to confirm the lunch venue at the Luna Coffee House. At about 12.30pm, the first appellant left and he did not see him again until he was arrested. After that, Naser came for a casual visit but he was unable to talk with him as he had the appointment with Mike. He arranged to meet up with Naser at 3pm regarding the fax machines. (Significantly, when Naser was called as a witness, he made no mention of being in the second appellant`s hotel room on 7 June 1989 nor was the matter put to him by counsel for the second appellant.)
When he met up with Mike at the Luna Coffee House, the conversation centred on drugs once again. He denied having anything to do with a matchbox although he admitted that Mike did go to the toilet. He then left to meet Naser at the lobby of the Dai-Ichi Hotel so as to pick up the fax machines and to store them with Naser. His hotel bill listed numerous phone calls to a number `612880` which was the telephone number of Big Boss, but he denied making these calls as the owner of Big Boss and claimed that he had called his brother-in-law who worked at Big Boss.
The second appellant made several statements to the police which was admitted at his counsel`s request although he qualified their contents stating that, when he made these statements, he was `sweating` and `not completely alert`. Significantly, in one of the statements, he emphasized when shown a photograph of NO Lee that he had never seen NO Lee. He tried to explain this discrepancy with his evidence in court by saying that the photograph shown to him was not Mike`s but was someone else`s. In his statement recorded on 21 June 1989, he denied having gone to the Apollo Hotel on 7 June 1989 but stated that he had been there on an earlier date. His explanation in court was that he thought he had been arrested on 6 June 1989 and so, when asked if he had been at the hotel on 7 June 1989, he replied that he had not been there.
 Trial judge`s findings
As regards the first appellant, the trial judge set out, based on the first appellant`s own account, the `highly suspicious` circumstances leading to the delivery of the drugs to NO Lee. These can be summarized as follows:
 
 
(1) The second appellant initially told him that the bag contained precious stones and other valuables but later changed this to raw materials for making medicinal tablets. 
 
(2) Later, the second appellant demonstrated where the false compartment was in a similar bag and the first appellant was asked to dispose of this bag. 
 
(3) The first appellant was initially given a matchbox by the second appellant who later changed his mind and took it back. 
 
(4) The first appellant was instructed by the second appellant to observe NO Lee at Luna Coffee House at the Apollo Hotel. 
 
(5) The first appellant was instructed to remove two packets from the false bottom of a bag and deliver them under the fictitious name of `Kumar` to NO Lee for $85,000, which was financial assistance to the second appellant.
  
 
 
In dealing with the first appellant`s evidence that he was an innocent courier, the trial judge held at pp 47-48: 
 
The fact that a tear existed on the transparent plastic bag lends support to the first accused`s claim that it was only after being satisfied that the substance was not heroin that he proceeded to deliver the two packets to Mike. But it does not of course follow from the evidence of the tear that the first accused is to be believed when he claimed that he made the tear for the purpose of testing the white powder. As submitted by the DPP, there can be other explanations for the tear.
 
 
 
Without the rather unusual circumstances of this case, I may have been prepared, in view of the tear, to accept the first accused`s claim that he had, before delivery, tested the white powder. However, considering the circumstances enumerated above and, in particular, his presence at the Luna Coffee House to secretly observe Mike, his introducing himself to Mike under the false name `Kumar` and the instructions he received from the second accused that he was to collect $85,000 from Mike after handing over the two packets, I find it difficult to believe the first accused`s protestations that he would never get involved in trafficking in illicit drugs and that he delivered the two packets only because he was satisfied from the sample he took that the white powder was not heroin.
The trial judge also took into account the fact that the first appellant`s cautioned statement was markedly different from his evidence in court and that his later detailed statements to the CNB did not give any account of how he had tasted the powder.
In respect of the second appellant, the trial judge held that it was `entirely unbelievable` that the continual meetings and telephone conversations with NO Lee were for the purpose of discussing second-hand printing machines while NO Lee persistently attempted in vain to interest him in drugs. The trial judge accepted NO Lee`s account of the meetings and the telephone conversations as the true version, in particular that NO Lee had negotiated the purchase of drugs with the second appellant for $85,000 and that the eventual delivery of the drugs to NO Lee by the first appellant was arranged by the second appellant pursuant to an agreement reached between him and NO Lee. In this respect, the trial judge did not take into consideration the first appellant`s evidence which implicated him as the former was an accomplice. He also accepted that the failure of NO Lee to hand over the matchbox to the investigating officer was simply oversight and nothing more.
 Arguments on behalf of the first appellant
Counsel for the first appellant conceded before us that there was no dispute that the first appellant had committed the actus reus of trafficking by delivery. The only question that arose was whether he knew that he was delivering heroin to NO Lee. Counsel agreed with the trial judge`s observation that, as the first appellant was in possession of more than 2g of diamorphine, s 17 of the MDA operated so that he was presumed to traffic in that quantity. This may have been an oversight as the charge stated that the offence was committed on 7 June 1989, whereas the recent amendments to s 17 only took effect from 15 February 1990. The old s 17 only presumed possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking, ie it only presumed the mens rea of trafficking. For the present appeal, however, the only issue was the first appellant`s state of mind. As the first appellant was in possession of a packet containing heroin, s 18(2) of the MDA presumed that he knew that he was delivering heroin and the onus was on him to rebut that presumption on a balance of probabilities.
In this regard, counsel contended that the trial judge had not given sufficient attention to the first appellant`s defence that he had actually tasted the white substance and had satisfied himself that it was not heroin (which it was not), which was why he did not taste the substance in the other bag which did contain heroin. We had no doubt that, if the trial judge had accepted the first appellant`s story that he had tasted the white powder and thereby satisfied himself that both packets were not heroin, then he would have successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. However, given that this `tasting episode` was the most material part of his defence, we agreed with the trial judge that his failure to mention it 
 at all 
 in his cautioned statement or in the very detailed statements which he later gave to the CNB dented his credibility severely. For instance, his defence in his s 122(6) statement was a very different one in that he thought that the `stuff` was for re-export and that theme was followed up in his 13 June 1989 statement. We agreed with the trial judge`s decision to reject his explanation in court that the reason why he omitted to mention the tasting episode was because he did not think it important and that he was embarrassed to suspect the second appellant. In our view, these were flimsy excuses as his entire statement had clearly implicated the second appellant in asking him to deliver heroin and there was no question of his being embarrassed to mention the tasting episode because it would show that he suspected the second appellant. Secondly, the first appellant, being an intelligent person, would have considered this a very important detail, not to be missed out in trying to acquit himself to the CNB, as he had even offered explanations as to why there was morphine in his urine. The exhortation in a s 122(6) statement for an accused to mention his defence immediately when charged is exactly the purpose for which that provision was drafted: 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, 
 you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general.
[Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
We concurred with the trial judge`s findings that he was entitled to rely on this material omission in the first appellant`s police statements to disbelieve him over the tasting episode.
It was SNO Lim`s evidence that the first appellant had volunteered spontaneously to him information as to where the drugs were hidden. No mention was made to SNO Lim that he thought it was raw materials for making medicinal tablets. Rather, his counsel`s instructions were that the first appellant told SNO Lim that the drugs were hidden in the false compartment of the bag 
 in response 
 to the latter`s question as to where he kept the drugs. It was also the first appellant`s evidence that there was minimal conversation between NO Lee and him, which was confirmed by NO Lee. Given that the first appellant was an intelligent person, his suspicions would not have been totally assuaged by that tasting episode (assuming that it happened) and he would have at least tried to get more answers from NO Lee as to what this transaction of handing over two bags of powder taken from a false bottom in a bag in exchange for $85,000 was exactly about. After all, there was no fear of offending the second appellant as the latter was not present. As it turned out, the transaction proceeded with the fewest of words and in a most surreptitious manner (with the bag containing the drugs being placed under the table). In our view, it was reasonable to infer from that encounter that it was a transaction in which the first appellant knew exactly what was happening rather than one in which the first appellant thought that he was delivering raw materials for making medicinal tablets. We, therefore, agreed with the trial judge`s finding that, on a balance of probabilities, the first appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge.
 Arguments on behalf of the second appellant
Counsel for the second appellant raised three issues. First, he argued that the evidence as adduced by the prosecution did not answer the charge. His submission read thus: 
 
There was no evidence adduced in court to prove beyond a reasonable doubt ... the averments in the charge preferred against the second appellant, ie intentionally aiding in the delivery of the diamorphine by the first appellant.
 
 
 
He contended that the trial judge had failed to address the averments of the charge when considering the evidence against the second appellant and, in accepting NO Lee`s evidence, had proceeded in terms of a sale of the drugs and not in terms of abetting the first appellant`s delivery of the drugs to NO Lee. The only portion in the grounds which did relate to the charge was a bald statement at the very end of the judgment that he was satisfied that the prosecution had proved the charge against the second appellant. Counsel argued that the second appellant should have been charged under s 5(b) of the MDA of offering to traffic by selling not less than 325.7g and the first appellant should have been charged with abetting the second appellant in the sale of that quantity of heroin. Although counsel conceded this court has powers under s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) to amend an irregular charge as we did in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat v PP 
 and 
 Koh Aik Siew v PP 
, he contended that the power should not be exercised in this instance as the amendment at such a late hour would result in a radically different offence being preferred and would seriously prejudice the second appellant.
Secondly, counsel submitted that as the charge preferred against the second appellant was one of abetment by intentionally aiding, it necessarily reflected his role as a secondary one to that of the first appellant, who was the principal offender, and the second appellant`s conviction would turn on the state of mind of the first appellant. If the act contemplated by the first appellant was clearly different from that performed (the first appellant had claimed that he was an innocent courier) the abettor could not be said to have abetted the principal. Counsel relied on the authority of 
 Madan Raj v State of Rajasthan 
 for the proposition that, as a general rule, a charge of abetment fails when the substantive offence is not established against the principal.
Thirdly, counsel attacked the prosecution evidence with regard to the nexus established between both appellants. The first nexus was with regard to the matchbox that had not been delivered by NO Lee to SNO Lim until the following day. The second nexus was the mention of the name `Kumar` which NO Lee stated in court. However, `Kumar` was not mentioned in his pocket book or statement in the preliminary inquiry. The third nexus was regarding the bag with the false bottom which the first appellant had collected, allegedly on behalf of the second appellant, at the President Merlin Hotel in November 1988, from where the drugs had originated. The first appellant had handed the bag to one Marian Darlas, the son of an employee at the Dickson Road boarding house, who, in his statement, stated that it was only in January 1989 that he met the first appellant, who asked him to keep a blue bag with yellow and red coloured stickers on it. It turned out that the bag with the red and yellow stickers was the one without the false bottom, ie the second blue bag which the second appellant had given to the first appellant. In Marian`s father`s statement, however, there was no mention of any yellow and red coloured stickers on the bag. Counsel submitted that this discrepancy raised a doubt as to whether the second appellant had really asked the first appellant to collect the bag for him, and this meant that the first appellant could have been on a frolic of his own in delivering the drugs to NO Lee and not under prior instructions from the second appellant.
We dealt first with the question of the charge and whether the evidence as adduced by the prosecution had answered the charge of abetment by intentionally aiding. In 
 Sinniah Pillay v PP 
, the appellant was convicted under s 326 of the Penal Code of abetment and conspiracy to cause grievous hurt by the use of formic acid on the victim, which caused his death. His co-conspirators were convicted under s 4 of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65). Chao Hick Tin J, in delivering the judgment of this court, held at p 230 that: 
 
... the fact that the appellant was charged under a different Act was neither here nor there. It was not unusual to find that a given set of facts can give rise to a number of different charges. It is the prerogative of the prosecution to decide which charge to prefer.
 
 
 
Therefore, whether or not the facts in the present case could also give rise to charges under s 5(b) of the MDA and whether the prosecution should have charged the second appellant under that section was irrelevant. A trial court must concern itself with the charge at hand and decide at the end of the day whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the charge. Counsel appeared to suggest that, since the prosecution had presented the second appellant as the `mastermind` of the whole affair, it was wrong to charge him with abetment and treat the first appellant as the principal offender. In our view, it is not for a court of law to consider the moral complicity of each accused person and question the prosecution`s absolute discretion in deciding what charge to prefer. In any event, we failed to see how any prejudice could have arisen as against the second appellant in charging him with abetment, given that his defence was a total denial of anything to do with drugs.
As for counsel`s argument that if the principal charge against the first appellant was not proved, the second appellant could not be said to have intentionally aided the first appellant, the proper approach for a trial court to adopt when trying an abettor has been considered by Yong Pung How CJ in
 Ong Ah Yeo 
 
 Yenna v PP 
 at p 77, where he made the following observations: 
 
In my view, the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentionally aiding an offence must direct its mind towards a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed ...
 
 
 
It is, therefore, necessary in an abettor`s trial for the prosecution to establish that the act aided must have been committed. At the same time, Yong Pung How CJ also held that the conviction of an abettor turns on the evidence against him, which may be different from that admitted against the principal, such that an acquittal of the principal may still result in a conviction of an abettor. In other words, the verdicts against them are not interdependent as many factors and interests are operative and the conviction or acquittal of the first appellant is irrelevant when considering the case against the second appellant.
Reverting to the present case, at no time was it disputed that the first appellant had delivered the drugs to NO Lee and therefore the principal act had been committed. As to what constituted the aiding of this principal act, explanation 2 to s 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) reads: 
 
Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
 
 
 
We rejected counsel`s submission that the Penal Code could not be used to interpret the meaning of `abets` under s 12 of the MDA, as s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) provides that the word `abet` as appearing in statutes is, unless otherwise expressly provided, to have the same meaning as in the Penal Code.
In deciding whether the second appellant had facilitated the delivery of the drugs, it was necessary to consider counsel`s third submission which challenged the trial judge`s finding of fact that there was a clear nexus between the second appellant`s negotiations and the first appellant`s delivery of the drugs to NO Lee. In this regard, we were mindful of the fact that, in convicting the second appellant, the trial judge had specifically chosen not to rely on the evidence of the first appellant which implicated the second appellant since the first appellant was an accomplice. Instead, he accepted the evidence of NO Lee, which had not been discredited. In our view, even without the matchbox and the mention of the name `Kumar`, NO Lee had given evidence that there were telephone conversations and meetings regarding the sale of two quantities of brown and white heroin and the second appellant had also mentioned the arrival of a connection from India. Two hours after the deal was concluded, the first appellant arrived in the same coffee house with two packets of white and brown powder, albeit one of them was not heroin. There was also evidence that the second appellant had called the first appellant in Madras from the Dai-Ichi Hotel and that they had met up on the day of the delivery. The second appellant was quick to point out that the telephone calls and the meetings were for totally innocuous purposes. However, it seemed clear to us that the contradictions between his evidence in court and his previous statements were so material that the trial judge was fully justified in disbelieving him and declaring his story `entirely unbelievable`.
We were of the view that nothing turned on the discrepancy between the two blue bags and whether the drugs originated from the blue bag with the false bottom or not. What was material was that the drugs actually delivered to NO Lee were not less than 325.7g of diamorphine and there was no evidence to show that there had been a break in the chain of possession after the CNB seized those two packets. We had no doubt that it was as a result of the second appellant`s negotiations with NO Lee that there resulted the delivery of the drugs by the first appellant to NO Lee. Such negotiations could clearly be said to have facilitated the delivery of the drugs to NO Lee by the first appellant.
Accordingly, we dismissed both appellants` appeals and confirmed the convictions and sentences of death.

The charge against the appellant was for the rape of a girl on 24 December 1990 at Marina Park, an offence punishable under s 376(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He was tried in the High Court, convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years and to caning with four strokes of the cane. Jointly tried with him, but under a separate charge, was Yong Kou Lin. He was charged with abetting the appellant to rape the girl, and was duly convicted and sentenced. He has not appealed against his conviction and sentence; only the appellant has.
The evidence in support of the prosecution`s case against the appellant, leaving aside for the moment the statements of the appellant, both oral and written, consists of that of Ong Hong Kee, a curry puff seller; a passer-by, Abdul Rashid bin Ramli; the police officer Cpl Raai bin Hassan; and the findings of Dr Lee Seong Tuck on his medical examination of the girl immediately following the rape. Their evidence is largely uncontroversial and may thus be summarized.
On the evening of 24 December 1990 at about 11.30pm, Ong Hong Kee, who was selling his curry puffs from his parked bicycle along the pedestrian mall somewhere near the Benjamin Sheares Bridge in Marina Park, saw two men approach him from the sea front, dragging the limp figure of a girl between them. He thought that the girl was drunk and that the two men intended to buy his curry puffs. Instead, they went past him into the wooded area of Marina Park. The pedestrian mall is set back from the sea front and is between the sea front and the wooded area. At trial, Ong Hong Kee identified the girl as the raped victim and Yong Kou Lin as one of the two men. However, he was unable to identify the other man.
About 15 to 20 minutes later, he heard a female voice crying out for help come from the wooded area of Marina Park. The sound came from behind where he was selling his curry puffs. He went into the wooded area to investigate. He described what he saw - two shadows fleeing in different directions from a body lying on the ground near a tree.
Just then, Abdul Rashid bin Ramli, who was taking a stroll through the wooded area of Marina Park, was making his way in the direction from where the sound came. He, too, came upon a body lying on the ground near a tree. Both he and Ong Hong Kee arrived at the body at about the same time. Abdul Rashid bin Ramli lit his cigarette lighter and, from the light of its flame, both he and Ong Hong Kee saw that the body was that of a girl with her skirt drawn up above her waist, not wearing any underwear, lying prostrate and motionless. They both noticed smears of blood on the inside of her thighs. Ong Hong Kee recognized the girl as the girl whose limp figure he had seen about 15 to 20 minutes earlier being dragged by the two men into the wooded area of Marina Park.
Abdul Rashid bin Ramli rushed off to summon the police and soon returned with Cpl Raai bin Hassan and Constable Chiong Beng Hui. Cpl Raai bin Hassan described what he saw when he arrived at the scene. He saw a girl lying under a small tree and she was in a drowsy state. She was naked from the waist down. Her skirt was raised to her waist and her inner thighs were smeared with blood. A pair of panties, a pantihose and a pair of shoes were found nearby. These were later identified by the girl as hers. Cpl Raai bin Hassan found the upper portion of a fishing rod nearby. He also recovered a wallet from beneath the body of the girl. Inside the wallet was an identity card and a driving licence.
Ong Hong Kee, who was standing by the girl`s body whilst Cpl Raai bin Hassan, Constable Chiong Beng Hui and Abdul Rashid bin Ramli went in search for possible suspects, was alerted by a red light being shone about nearby and a voice saying `what bad luck, lost my IC`. Shortly thereafter, Cpl Raai bin Hassan and Constable Chiong Beng Hui came upon two persons dressed in T-shirts and shorts searching for something on the ground. One of them was shining a light on the ground and the other was holding portions of a fishing rod. When Cpl Raai bin Hassan approached them, they tried to run away but he arrested them nevertheless. On arrest, Yong Kou Lin was identified from the identity card found in the wallet recovered from beneath the girl`s body. He was holding a search light and a torch light. The other man arrested was holding two pieces of a fishing rod and a torch light. The upper portion of the fishing rod found near the body of the girl fitted one of the two pieces of fishing rod carried by him.
The girl was subsequently sent to the Singapore General Hospital where she was examined by Dr Lee Seong Tuck. He found fresh blood stains on both sides of her vulva. There was an abrasion of the vulva and fresh hymenal tears.
It transpired that the girl and her boyfriend had gone to the Marina Park and had sat on the sea front near where Ong Hong Kee was selling his curry puffs. They had bought a mango drink from an itinerant hawker and, on drinking it, both of them had passed out.
The foregoing evidence, although it establishes most clearly that the girl was raped, falls short of satisfying s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and the test enunciated by Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 and the cases following it that, at the end of the prosecution`s case, it must be shown that a case against the appellant has been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. It is not surprising, therefore, that the most resolute efforts were made to keep certain incriminating statements the appellant is alleged to have made to the investigating officer, Inspector Low Kim Bock (`Insp Low`), from being admitted in evidence. These were oral statements allegedly made on 30 December 1990 by the appellant to Insp Low at the scene of the alleged rape at Marina Park, referred to hereafter as `the oral statements`, and three statements recorded by Insp Low from the appellant at the Central Police Station on 28, 29 and 30 December 1990 (`the three written statements`). However, the learned judicial commissioner, holding that a trial-within-a-trial was not necessary in relation to the oral statements, and after a trial-within-a-trial in respect of the three written statements, admitted in evidence the oral statements and the three written statements. The necessary incriminating evidence having thus been admitted, a case against the appellant was made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. Accordingly, the appellant was called to enter upon his defence. The appellant elected to remain silent. The learned judicial commissioner, after evaluating all the evidence, including that of the oral statements and the three written statements, duly convicted the appellant and sentenced him as stated above.
There was no question but that once the oral statements and the three written statements were admitted in evidence, the conviction of the appellant could not be assailed as the appellant chose not to give evidence himself and did not call other evidence. Hence, the sole question addressed before us by appellant`s counsel was on the admission in evidence of the oral statements and the three written statements.
Now, it seems clear from the transcript of the proceedings that the appellant had intimated before the commencement of the trial that objections to the admission in evidence of the three written statements would be taken on the ground of `
 voluntariness 
`. No such intimation had been given in respect of the oral statements. It is necessary to narrate how the oral statements came to be admitted in evidence at the trial before the High Court.
As is the practice nowadays, written statements of witnesses are admitted at the preliminary inquiry before the magistrate under s 141 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). At the trial before the High Court, such written statements are admitted as evidence under s 371 of the CPC. This procedure was followed at the trial of the appellant. So it was that, when Insp Low`s written statement was being read into the evidence at the trial under s 371 of the CPC, certain paragraphs that had been objected to earlier were not read. These were paras 17, 19 and 21 of Insp Low`s written statement. These three paragraphs dealt with the recording of the three written statements of the appellant.
When Insp Low came to para 24 of his written statement, he paused and the following dialogue took place between the learned judicial commissioner, the learned deputy public prosecutor and Mr Fernando, the learned defence counsel.
 
 
DPP: Your Honour, I do not know whether my learned friend is objecting to para 24. 
 
His Honour: That is not a statement. Is para 24 a statement? 
 
DPP: It is not a statement. 
 
His Honour: So that is not going to be a subject matter of the trial-within-a-trial. 
 
DPP: Yes. 
 
His Honour: So you can read it. 
 
Mr Fernando: Your Honour, may I say, Sir, that we are objecting to this part being led in evidence in this manner because our clients inform us that they never did these things with the officer. He pointed out the places to them and made them admit that this is where it happened. 
 
His Honour: No, no, Mr Fernando, let`s get the basis correct. This being led does not imply that you are admit to it (sic). I am not taking that to be the position. The question is, do you want this to be led through the form of a statement or do you want this to be brought in orally? And in either case, of course, you totally reserve your right to dispute this. 
 
Mr Fernando: Yes. 
 
His Honour: I mean, that is not in dispute. There is no question about your being unable to deny anything that has been read. 
 
Mr Fernando: But we prefer it, Sir, in fairness, really, to our clients that this part of the evidence where they are alleged to have shown the inspector what allegedly took place, to come from his own testimony in court rather than the DPP reading it out. 
 
His Honour: All right then, you take out para 24 but on a different basis and not for the trial-within-a-trial. 
 
Mr Fernando: Yes, your Honour.
  
 
 
Paragraph 24 was not read.
After the remainder of Insp Low`s written statement had been read out, but nevertheless excluding the controversial paragraphs of his written statement, he began to give his evidence viva voce. We think it is necessary for us to recite the whole of his evidence which relates to what is alleged to have happened and what the appellant was alleged to have said to Insp Low when he took the appellant on 30 December 1990 to the scene of the alleged rape. The significance of this will become clear later.
 
 
Q: Can you tell the court what happened when you arrived at the park together with the second accused. 
 
A: Your Honour, on arrival at the park, the second accused led me to the place where he started fishing on the night of 24 December 1990. He told me that he fished there for a short while but was not successful in catching any fish. After that, he walked down towards the direction of where the victim and her boyfriend were seated that night. He stopped to fish for a while. The place where he indicated to me was in front of lamppost marked M41. It is somewhere just below the Benjamin Sheares Bridge 43/41 that place. He was not successful either. So he moved further down. And somewhere at the slope in front of the lamppost M47, he stopped there to fish again. 
 
The accused told me that the place where he stopped this time he met his friend, Ah Yong, referred here as first accused. 
 
His Honour: You mean subsequently established? 
 
A: Subsequently established to be the first accused. 
 
So he stopped here and fished for about an hour or an hour and a half or so. This is where he laid down his fishing rod on the ground and he strolled. He told me he strolled along the slope towards the direction of where the victim and her boyfriend were seated. 
 
The accused also told me that when he looked up towards the park, the Marina Park, from where he was standing, he saw the victim and her boyfriend both appeared like wanting to vomit, and subsequently both lying on the ground. On seeing the victim and her boyfriend in this condition, he walked over towards the first accused. 
 
His Honour: He walked? 
 
A: He walked towards the position, the place where he placed his fishing rod, and told the first accused what he saw. He then suggested that they bring the victim to the park and finish her off. What he meant was to have sex with the victim. 
 
Mr Fernando: May I at this stage say that everything he is saying needs challenging? 
 
His Honour Mr Fernando, just because this evidence is being admitted doesn`t, as I have already told you, relied on (sic). You will have your opportunity to cross-examine. I am aware that if we need to admit any of this ... 
 
Mr Fernando: Yes, because my client denied saying anything of that sort to this inspector. 
 
His Honour There is no need to remind me of that. I am aware of it. 
 
Mr Fernando: Because it is very damaging, Sir. 
 
His Honour: Carry on. 
 
Q: Now what else did the second accused say? 
 
A: Both he and the first accused then walked towards the direction where the victim and her boyfriend were. The second accused also told me that both he and the first accused then sat at the slope which is, as one faces the victim, on the victim`s left. That means on the victim`s left side on the slope. 
 
... 
 
A: It was here that the first accused asked him to go and find out whether the victim was conscious. So the second accused went up to the victim and shook her shoulder. But she was motionless and there was no response. He then went back to the first accused and told him exactly how the girl reacted. 
 
The second accused then went up to the victim and carried her up and held her by her ... by both hands lifted her up and then subsequently supported the girl by holding her right hand. 
 
The second accused also told me it was at this point that the first accused came and assisted him and held the girl by the left hand, held the girl`s left hand. They then walked towards the pedestrian mall and across the pedestrian mall towards the park. 
 
And when he and the first accused together with the victim arrived at a small tree at an open space, they laid the girl on the ground with her face facing skyward, her head towards the direction of the Singapore River. 
 
It was here at the scene that both the second accused and the first accused decided who should start having sex with the victim. And it was here that the second accused told me that they used a $1-coin to toss, who won the toss and proceeded first.
  
 
 
At this juncture the court adjourned for the day. On resuming the next day, Insp Low continued with his evidence viva voce as follows:
 
 
Q: Now witness, aside from what you told the court, what else happened when you brought [?] to Marina Park? Your last sentence ends: `It was here that the second accused told me that he used the $1-coin to decide as to who should go first. 
 
A: After that, accused told me that the first accused ... 
 
His Honour: After that the second accused told you? 
 
A: The second accused said that the first accused had sex with the girl first and after that he took over and they ran away from the scene when they noticed someone approaching the place. The second accused then indicated to me the direction in which both he and the first accused ran. The direction indicated was towards northeast direction.
  
 
 
The foregoing then is substantially the evidence of Insp Low of the oral statements said to have been made to him by the appellant on the visit to Marina Park on 30 December 1990 at about 9.30am. It is most pertinent to note that before this visit, Insp Low had already, on 28 and 29 December 1990, recorded two statements in writing from the appellant. These two written statements together with a third, recorded from the appellant after the return from Marina Park at about 2.15pm on 30 December 1990, were the subject matter of a trial-within-a-trial as to their admissibility in evidence. Before we deal with that question, it is important to know what Insp Low had learnt from the two statements he had recorded from the appellant on 28 and 29 December 1990, since it is the appellant`s case, as put by his counsel at the trial, that, on 30 December 1990 at Marina Park, he was taken from place to place and asked whether this was the place, to each of which the appellant merely nodded his assent. It was maintained on his behalf that he did not communicate anything to Insp Low by word of mouth on that visit to Marina Park.
We now set out some extracts from the statement of the appellant recorded by Insp Low on 29 December 1990: 
 
On 24 December 1990, at about 7.30pm, ... at the Singapore River, I started to put in the prawns onto the fishing hook. I then began fishing ... . From the place I was fishing, the Benjamin Sheares Bridge was on my left. I fished at the said place for about an hour but was not able to catch any fish. I then took my two fishing rods and proceeded towards the direction of the Benjamin Sheares Bridge. I walked past under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and proceeded further down to change my fishing location. Whilst I was walking along the slope by the seaside, my friend, Ah Yong, came from the opposite direction ... . Ah Yong and I then chitchatted at the seaside and at the same time we continued with our fishing. We fished for about another 11/2 hours or so but still we did not have any luck and did not catch any fish. Ah Yong and I then walked further down the seaside intending to change our location. I walked in front whilst Ah Yong followed behind me. Whilst I was walking along the slope by the seaside, I saw a couple on the step leading down to the slope. The said couple were lying on their backs. From where I was standing, the girl was lying on my right, ie the girl was lying on the left side of the man ... . Curious to know what the couple were doing, I walked up the slope to the said couple. When I was there, I could see that the girl appeared to be drunk and she wanted to vomit. I then called out to Ah Yong and told him what I saw. Ah Yong came and joined me and together we stood beside the couple. Both of us then discussed bringing the girl to the park and having sex with her. However, before we brought the girl to the park to have sex with her, Ah Yong told me to check whether the girl was sleeping or the girl was really drunk. I was the one who told Ah Yong that the girl might be drunk. I then tapped the girl on her left upper arm to check whether she was conscious before we carried out what we planned to do. Having confirmed that the girl was not conscious, I put my fishing rods and lines in their fishing position and proceeded to carry up the girl ... . Initially I tried to carry the girl myself by putting both my hands under her armpits, but I was not able to do so. Because of this, Ah Yong came to my assistance to carry the girl up. I helped the girl to stand up by holding her right upper arm with my left hand while Ah Yong held the girl by the left upper arm. The girl could hardly stand and both Ah Yong and I had to support her otherwise she would drop ... . Ah Yong and I then supported the girl and, half dragging her, we brought the girl across the road [recorder`s note: the road refers to Marina Promenade] and walked straight into the park, which was very dim as there were trees around. We brought the girl to a small tree (I believe it is a young plant), about 50m from where we found her, and there we let the girl lie on her back.
 
 
 
While the girl was lying on the ground, Ah Yong asked me who would start having sex with the girl first. I then took out a $1-coin (Singapore currency) and told Ah Yong that if it was `Head`, he would start, but if it was `Flower`, I would start. I held the $1-coin in my right hand and when I opened it, it showed `Head`. Therefore, I told Ah Yong to start first ... . After I had sex with the girl, Ah Yong and I ran from the scene as there were people approaching the place.
According to Insp Low`s evidence, the time spent on the visit to Marina Park on 30 December 1990 with the appellant was one and a half hours. No record of the places where the appellant is alleged to have taken Insp Low during this visit or what the appellant is alleged to have said to Insp Low was recorded by him in a field book or indeed by anyone of the police party accompanying Insp Low and the appellant. Insp Low gave evidence at the trial on 6 January 1993. Yet, it was made to appear that Insp Low was recalling from memory what had transpired between the appellant and him on that visit to Marina Park on 30 December 1990 with such meticulous detail. We must say that this stretches one`s credulousness to the extreme. The fact of the matter is, and we can say it without any fear of contradictions, that Insp Low was paraphrasing from the appellant`s statement recorded by him on 29 December 1990.
What has happened in this case is that the contents of the three written statements of the appellant, which had been objected to by the appellant by reason of the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC had been admitted in evidence through the oral testimony of Insp Low even before the court had considered the admissibility in evidence of the three written statements. We find this most disquieting.
What, in our judgment, led to this unhappy state of affairs is the application of what Lord Bridge said in 
 Seeraj Ajodha v The State 
. This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago to the Privy Council in London. The question was whether a confession statement signed by the accused had been made 
 voluntarily 
 when the accused at trial claimed that his signature had been obtained by force or by a trick. It was held that this raised the issue of 
 voluntariness 
 of the statement itself and that that was an issue which had to be determined by the trial judge; and that, accordingly, the judge ought to have ruled on admissibility and, since the accused had been wrongly deprived of the safeguard of such a ruling, the trial had been materially defective and the convictions should be quashed. In delivering the reasons for the decision of the judicial committee, Lord Bridge considered four hypothetical situations in which the issue of 
 voluntariness 
 could arise. Of one of those hypothetical situations, he said at p 222: 
 
On the face of the evidence tendered or proposed to be tendered by the prosecution, there is no material capable of suggesting that the statement was other than voluntary. For example, if the prosecution rely upon oral statements, the defence case is simply that the interview never took place or that the incriminating answers were never given: in the case of a written statement, the defence case is that it is a forgery. In this situation, no issue of voluntariness can arise and hence no question of admissibility falls for the judge`s decision. The issue of fact whether or not the statement was made by the accused is purely for the jury.
 
 
 
The learned judicial commissioner relied on the above statement of Lord Bridge and was persuaded by the learned deputy prosecutor`s submissions based on Mr Fernando`s own statement during the dialogue that we have set out above that what was being contended on behalf of the appellant in this case was, not that the visit to Marina Park did not take place on 30 December 1990 as contended by the prosecution, but that the appellant never made any incriminating statements at the places where the appellant had taken Insp Low during that visit. Accordingly, he ruled that the question of 
 voluntariness 
 was not in issue and that the only question in issue was whether or not the appellant had made incriminating statements at the places where he had taken Insp Low. This, he ruled, was simply a question of fact for him to determine.
With due respect to the learned judicial commissioner, this was entirely the wrong approach since it was plainly evident that the oral statements were allegedly made during the same time frame as the three written statements which were being objected to as to their admissibility and it could not be said that the oral statements, in these circumstances, were not subject to the same objections. We cannot refrain from saying that defence counsel, by his own equivocality, also misled the learned judicial commissioner for, had he been more forthright as to his objections instead of conjecturing in the manner he did, which is evident from the extracts of the transcript we have set out above, this unhappy situation would never have arisen. We find this again in the dialogue between the learned judicial commissioner and defence counsel in another part of the transcript to which it is not necessary to refer in any detail.
We have spent some considerable time on this aspect of this appeal and we have been somewhat critical of those concerned for a very good reason. The admission of evidence otherwise inadmissible, particularly in criminal proceedings, could, we do not say that it will, result in the whole of the proceedings being vitiated. In our view, it behoves all those who are concerned with the conduct of criminal proceedings - judges, prosecutors and defence counsel, and also investigating officers who give evidence at the trial - to be vigilant at all times to see to it that oral statements as well as written statements which are of the nature of admissions or confessions are not admitted in evidence without going through the time honoured and tested procedures that are part and parcel of our criminal justice system. These procedures are well known to all those who are concerned with the administration of criminal justice in our courts and we do not propose, indeed it is undesirable, to lay down guidelines of the manner laid down by Lord Bridge in 
 Ajodha 
.
It follows from the foregoing that, in our judgment, the evidence of Insp Low on the oral statements allegedly made to him by the appellant during the visit to Marina Park on 30 December 1990, which, as we have said, were undoubtedly oral statements made during the course of police investigation, had occasioned an irregularity of these proceedings. No statement, written or oral, made by any person to a police officer in the course of police investigation can be used in evidence (see s 122(1) of CPC) unless it has been made to a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant and admitted pursuant to the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC.
Unfortunately for the appellant, however, the matter does not end here for, even if the whole of Insp Low`s evidence is expunged from the record, there is still the evidence of the three written statements which were admitted in evidence after a voir dire, to which we now turn.
The main objection taken by the appellant is that he was subjected to oppressive means and psychological methods of interrogation from the day of his arrest on 25 December 1990 to 27 December 1990; that his will was sapped to such an extent to make the statements recorded from him by Insp Low on 28, 29 and 30 December 1990 involuntary and thereby render them inadmissible in evidence by reason of the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC. There were also allegations that the appellant had been subjected to brutal treatment on 27 December 1990 by Cpl Mah Singh who could not communicate with the appellant in the language of the Chinese dialect Hokkien, that being the language in which the appellant was most familiar and best able to communicate.
Before dealing with the evidence, we should state what, in our judgment, is the proper test to be applied in determining admissibility under the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC and how that test should be applied. We set out below s 122(5) of the CPC with the relevant words of the proviso we should bear in mind for present purposes emphasized: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence ...
 
 
 
Provided that the Court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the Court to have been caused 
 by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him 
.
It cannot be overemphasized that, in considering the admission of a statement, oral or written, made by an accused person, the proper test to be applied is laid down in the proviso to s 122(5) (which incidentally is in identical terms to the test enunciated by s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). In our judgment, the satisfaction of that test is a precondition to the admissibility in evidence of the statement. It is for the court to satisfy itself before the statement is admitted in evidence that the statement, in the words of the proviso, was not caused by an inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against him which would lead him to suppose that he would gain some advantage or avoid some evil. Once that test has been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the court, the statement made is admissible in evidence. Courts have constantly and consistently used the word `
 voluntary 
` or `
 voluntariness 
` in admitting or rejecting a statement in evidence. These are convenient expressions, and, so long as `
 voluntariness 
` is understood in the sense as laid down in s 122(5) of the CPC (and s 24 of the Evidence Act), that is to say by relating directly to the words of s 122(5) in the proviso and not in the sense as the word is understood in common parlance, the use of such words is not objectionable.
The historical background to s 122(5) of the CPC, by reason of which all statements, both oral and written, made by an accused person during police investigation, including a s 122(6) CPC statement, are admitted in evidence, was dealt with by LP Thean J (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Sim Ah Cheoh v PP 
, at p 360: 
 
The next question is whether, by reason of such cross-examination, the statements made by Tan and Lim are admissible. The trial judges appeared to take the view that where an accused person makes a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC, questions asked by the recording officer by way of cross-examination are improper and render the resultant statement inadmissible and accepted the case of 
 Cheng Seng Heng v PP
 [
 
 
[1949] MLJ 175
 ] as authority. That was a case decided by the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya on the basis of reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations 1948, and Spenser-Wilkinson J, in delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to some English and local authorities, said at p 178:
 
 
 
`On the principles enunciated in the above-quoted authorities, we hold that under reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations the police have no right to elicit statements from accused persons by means of cross-examination or anything in the nature of cross-examination. The only safe rule to be followed when statements are being taken from accused persons by the police under reg 33 is r 7 of the Judges` Rules set out above, and any departure from this rule will render the statements inadmissible in evidence.`
 
 
 
The Judge`s Rules referred to in the judgment are the Judges` Rules then in force in England, and r 7 thereof was identical with r 8 of Sch E to proviso (b) of sub-s (5) of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force. But sub-s (5) (which was the precursor of the existing sub-s (6) of s 122) and Sch E were introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1960. Section 121 (now s 122), by sub-s (5) thereof, for the first time allowed a statement made at any time by a person who is charged with an offence in the hearing of a police officer of or above the rank of inspector to be admissible in evidence at his trial, but such admission was expressly made subject to two provisos, namely: (i) proviso (a) which was in pari materia with the proviso to the existing s 122(5), and (ii) proviso (b) which is as follows:
 
 
 
`in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provision of the rules set out in Schedule E to this Code.`
 
 
 
And r 8 of the Rules as set out in Sch E to the Code provided:
 
 
 
`A prisoner making a voluntary statement must not be cross-examined, and no questions shall be put to him about it except for the purpose of removing ambiguity in what he has actually said. For instance, if he has mentioned an hour without saying whether it was morning or evening, or has given a day of the week and day of the month which do not agree, or has not made it clear to what individual or what place is intended to refer in some part of his statement, he may be questioned sufficiently to clear up the point.`
 
 
 
By the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1976 (which came into force on 1 January 1977), among other things, the proviso (b) to the then s 121(5) and Sch E were repealed, and the present sub-s (6) of s 122 was introduced. Hence, with the repeal of those provisions, there is nothing in s 122 to say that a statement recorded from an accused under s 122(6) is inadmissible in evidence if, in the course of or after recording the statement, the accused is cross-examined thereon by the recording officer. In our opinion, cross-examination per se does not render the statement inadmissible, if it is otherwise admissible. The admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is not governed by that subsection but, in the case where a statement is made to a police officer, is governed by s 122(5) of the CPC: see 
 Tsang Yuk Chung v PP
 [
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
 ], and in the case of a statement made to a narcotics officer, as in this case, by the Evidence Act: see 
 PP v Tan Boon Tat
 [
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 ]. In 
 Tsang Yuk Chung
, Wee Chong Jin CJ, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said, at p 266:
 
 
 
`Section 122(6) itself does not provide for the admissibility of statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation.
 
 
 
That s 122(5) governs the admissibility of statements made under s 122(6) is confirmed by s 122(7), which reads: 
 
""No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to sub-s (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by an inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to sub-s (5), if it is otherwise voluntary.""
 
 
 
In our judgment, a statement, whether or not it is purported to have been made under s 122(6), is admissible in evidence so long as s 122(5) is satisfied. There is no doubt that an inculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein.`
 
 
 
So the sole criterion for the admissibility in evidence of a statement made by an accused person during the course of police investigation is, 
 firstly 
, whether the statement was made as a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise, and, 
 secondly 
, whether in making that statement, the accused person did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage to himself or would avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are questions of fact and are matters of judicial evaluation.
We now turn to consider the question of oppression in relation to the admissibility of statements made by an accused person during police investigation. Oppression in this context relates to the methods and manner of interrogation preparatory to and during the making of statements. It has been said that oppressive questioning may be described as questioning which by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances, including the fact of custody, excites hopes, such as the hope of release, or fears, or so affects the mind of the person being interrogated that his will crumbles and he speaks when otherwise he would have remained silent - questioning in circumstances which tended to sap and did sap, the free will of the person interrogated: per Edmund Davis LJ in 
 R v Prager 
. At the same time, it has been said that the court`s approach should not be such so as to form `a clog on the proper exercise by the police of their investigating function, and, indeed, on the administration of justice itself: per Lord Hailsham in 
 DPP v Ping Lin 
 at p 183. Robust interrogation is, in our opinion, an essential and integral aspect of police investigation. However, as was observed by LP Thean J in 
 Sim Ah Cheoh 
 at p 361, if the questioning is too vigorous or prolonged, it becomes oppressive, with the result that a doubt arises as to whether the statement or the answers have been caused by any fear or threat so as to render the statements or answers to the questions inadmissible.
Whether the questioning of the person interrogated has been oppressive and whether his will has crumbled such that he speaks when he would have otherwise remained silent is basically a question of fact. As was said by Sachs J in 
 R v Priestley 
:6 
 
What may be oppressive as regards a child, an invalid or an old man or somebody inexperienced in the ways of this world may turn out not to be oppressive when one finds that the accused person is of a tough character and an experienced man of the world.
 
 
 
It is to the facts that we must now turn to ascertain whether the three written statements made by the appellant were obtained by any inducement, threat or promise, or were made by him when his will had crumbled contrary to the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC. We can do no better than reproduce hereunder the learned judicial commissioner`s evaluation of the evidence and his findings thereon. 
 
At the end of the voir dire, I had to decide whether, on the evidence adduced, the statements were made voluntarily. In the absence of clear evidence, this is often a difficult question to decide, because bare charges of inducement, threat or promise, and bare denials are easy to make. A court must take care to examine all the evidence and to seek verification wherever possible.
 
 
 
When the evidence was examined, some flaws were revealed. He alleged that Insp Low slapped him and forcibly opened his mouth on the night of his arrest in the presence of the first accused and a Chinese corporal who was on duty in the lockup. The station diary, however, showed that there was no Chinese corporal on duty at that time. Secondly, he alleged that the first accused was also slapped at that time, though the first accused did not say this in his voir dire. ...
In respect of the allegation of assault by Cpl Mah Singh, he said that he was slapped on the right cheek and then said it was the left cheek, and finally that he was not sure which cheek it was. On all the occasions, when he was examined by doctors, he had not mentioned to any of them that he had been assaulted, and they did not find any evidence of assault.
His evidence that the session with Cpl Mah Singh ended with him nodding to confirm that he was prepared to make a confession was contradicted by the fact that Cpl Mah Singh reported to Cpl Ong that there was no progress.
In fact no statement was recorded after the interrogation session ended at 10.05am. Insp Low did not record his statement till the following evening at 7.34pm, although he was present in the station when the interrogation ended.
On the issue of the language of the interrogation, I accepted that the accused was not proficient in English. However, as he had been taught English when he was in school, and had passed it as a subject in primary four, I did not believe him when he said he has no knowledge of English beyond words like `good morning`. I found that the accused and Cpl Mah Singh were able to communicate with one another in English at a basic level, sufficient for Cpl Mah Singh to know whether he was admitting the offence. That was all the corporal needed to know, as he was not required to record the accused`s statement or even to take notes of what was said.
After reviewing all the evidence adduced at the voir dire, I did not believe the accused`s complaints of inducement, threat and promise, and I accepted Insp Low`s evidence on the manner in which the statements were recorded.
With regard to the omission to state that the first statement was read back and explained to the accused, it is to be noted that there is no statutory requirement for that to be recorded, although it is good practice for this to be done. The Court of Criminal Appeal had ruled in 
 Vasavan Sathiadew v PP 
 [1992] 
 CLAS News 
 28 that non-compliance with s 121(3) of the CPC to record an oral statement does not render it inadmissible. A fortiori, a departure from a rule of practice should not affect the admissibility of a statement, though it has a bearing on its weight.
I therefore admitted the three written statements.
We are in entire agreement with the approach adopted by the learned judicial commissioner on the voir dire. His approach is consistent with what Lord Hailsham said in 
 DPP v Ping Lin 
 at p 182. He said: 
 
I cannot myself help regarding the issue as basically one of fact. The trial judge should approach his task by applying the test enunciated by Lord Sumner in a common sense way to all the facts in the case in their context much as a jury would approach it if the task had fallen to them. In the light of all the facts in their context, he should ask himself this question, and no other: `
 Have the prosecution proved that the contested statement was voluntary in the sense that it was not obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage excited or held out by a person in authority or ... by oppression?
` [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
See also what Lord Salmon said in the same case at p 187, when he too counselled a similar approach. Both these passages from 
 DPP v Ping Lin 
 were cited with approval by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Tan Boon Tat v PP 
 at p 9.
The conclusion we have reached is that although there were irregularities in the admission of the appellant`s oral statements, the proceedings were not vitiated because the three written statements were correctly and properly admitted in evidence. In our judgment, the appellant, having chosen to remain silent when he was called upon to enter on his defence, was rightly convicted of the charge of rape.
We have not been addressed on the sentence passed on the appellant by the learned judicial commissioner of ten years` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. In our judgment, the sentence was most appropriate in all the circumstances of this case.
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentence.

This was an appeal by the public prosecutor against the respondent`s acquittal on a charge of abetment by conspiracy of trafficking in diamorphine (heroin). The respondent was jointly charged in the High Court with Tee Seh Ping (`Tee`) and Yeo Choon Chau (`Yeo`) under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`) for engaging with one another and one Lai Kam Loy (`Lai`) to abet Lai in trafficking not less than 197.03 g of diamorphine. The charge against the respondent, Tee and Yeo read as follows (respondent`s name highlighted):

At the end of the trial, the trial judge acquitted the respondent of the charge. The public prosecutor appealed against the respondent`s acquittal and at the end of the appeal, we allowed the appeal, convicted the respondent of the charge and sentenced the respondent to death. We now state our reasons for so doing.
 The facts
On 13 May 1991 Sgt James Ooi Hock Aun (`Sgt James`) of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) received information that a drug syndicate had five pounds of diamorphine for sale. Together with his assistant Cpl Ben Ey (`Cpl Ey`), they decided to pose as potential buyers to meet representatives of the syndicate, who would be accompanied by a CNB informer known as `Ah Hai`, at the Luna Coffee House in Apollo Hotel.
The respondent, Yeo, Tee and Lai had come into Singapore that morning from Johor. The respondent was driving his Proton Saga JBU 365 with Yeo his younger brother in the front passenger seat. Lai came in alone driving his red Mazda and Tee came in a blue Honda Accord driven by Ah Hai.
Sgt James and Cpl Ey duly met up with Yeo, Tee, Lai and Ah Hai at the Luna Coffee House. Discussions followed regarding the sale of five pounds of heroin. Lai informed Sgt James that the drugs were not at the coffee house but were somewhere in Geylang, that the key to where the drugs were kept was held by someone in Geylang, and that Sgt James was to follow him to take delivery of them. He also asked if they had brought the money to pay for the drugs whereupon in response Cpl Ey took out a stack of flash notes (genuine notes on the outside with photocopied notes in between). The deal concluded, Lai told Sgt James that he was unsure of the way to Geylang whereupon Tee volunteered to lead the way.
Lai, Tee and Sgt James then left in two cars, with Lai driving his red Mazda accompanied by Tee in the passenger seat and Sgt James driving his Honda Prelude. Yeo remained behind with `Ah Hai` and Cpl Ey to collect payment once the drugs were delivered. At all times, both the group that remained behind and the group that left had their movements closely monitored by two teams of CNB officers.
The unchallenged evidence of the CNB officers who trailed the two vehicles was that at Guillemard Circus (near Lorong 22, Geylang) Lai`s red Mazda overtook Sgt James`s car and led him to Lorong 22. On arriving at Lorong 22, the respondent was waiting at a coffee house. Lai got out of his car and went up to the respondent who handed him the key to his car JBU 365 which was not there, but was parked in a car park at Aljunied. The two cars then went off leaving the respondent behind. Lai`s car led Sgt James`s car to the carpark of Block 109 Aljunied and, on arrival, Lai parked his car alongside the respondent`s Proton Saga JBU 365. He used the respondent`s car key to open the car boot. Inside were two plastic bags. Sgt James took possession of the plastic bags from Lai and both cars headed back towards Apollo Hotel. The contents of the two plastic bags were later seized and scientifically analysed and found to contain not less than 197.03g of diamorphine. When Lai, Tee and Sgt James returned to Apollo Hotel, Lai and Tee were arrested by CNB officers.
In the meantime at the Luna Coffee House, Cpl Ey had been discussing details of how to sell drugs and future drug deals with Yeo. Yeo gave him his pager number for the purpose of the future transactions. Upon Cpl Ey being informed of the arrest of Lai and Tee, he relayed this information to Yeo. Then, on the pretext of calling Sgt James, he separated himself from Ah Hai and Yeo, and returned to CNB headquarters. After Cpl Ey left, Ah Hai drove Yeo in his blue Honda Accord to Lorong 22 to pick up the respondent. From there, they went to the Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurant in Woodlands where they were arrested by CNB officers.
 The respondent`s statement
After his arrest, the respondent gave a long statement on 27 May 1991 which was recorded by Insp Sivakumaran and interpreted to the respondent by Wu Nan Yong. It was not challenged by the respondent`s counsel and was admitted as evidence at his trial. In it the respondent related the following events.
 
 
(1) The respondent entered Singapore with Yeo at about 10am on 13 May 1991. After crossing the Causeway they stopped by the side of the road. Meanwhile, two cars had parked on the other side of the road. One was a red Mazda, the other a blue Honda Accord. There were two persons in the red Mazda and three or four persons in the Honda Accord. Yeo crossed the road to speak to both drivers. On returning, he instructed the respondent to follow the two cars. 
 
(2) The convoy of three cars then travelled along the Bukit Timah Expressway in the order of the red Mazda, the blue Honda Accord and the respondent`s Proton Saga. As the vehicles approached the exit leading to the Pan Island Expressway in the direction of the Changi Airport, Yeo told the respondent to exit and to follow the red Mazda. However, the blue Honda Accord did not exit and proceeded straight on. 
 
(3) The red Mazda led them to a car park in Aljunied. Yeo went over and spoke to the occupants of the Mazda. The driver of the Mazda (Lai) reversed his car and parked it beside the respondent`s car. He then said to Yeo that they should not use the respondent`s car as `the person` would not be able to recognize it. Yeo replied that they would drive Lai`s red Mazda there instead. Lai spoke to the respondent and said that he wanted to put two bags of things in his car and he would come and collect them later. Lai then took out two blue plastic bags. The respondent was under the impression that they contained clothing and gave his car key to Lai who opened the car boot and put them in. The respondent and Yeo then got into Lai`s red Mazda and they drove to an Indian coffee house in Geylang to have a meal. 
 
(4) Later, two male Chinese arrived and entered the Chinese coffee-shop next door. Lai, his friend and Yeo all went to join them. The respondent remained seated where he was. Twenty minutes later Lai, his friend and Yeo returned. Yeo told the respondent to wait there for him whereupon everyone left, leaving the respondent behind. 
 
(5) More than an hour later, Lai returned with his friend. Yeo was not with them. Lai asked for the respondent`s car key saying that he wanted to collect the things from the respondent`s car. The respondent gave him the car key and told him not to take too long. Lai assured him that he would not and left. 
 
(6) While waiting for Yeo, the respondent paged for him but there was no reply. Two to three hours later Yeo arrived in the blue Honda Accord. The respondent scolded Yeo and asked him why Lai was taking so long and why his car key had been taken away. The driver of the blue Honda Accord (Ah Hai) assured him that they would be back soon. The respondent said that there was no reason for them to take so long and he did not know what they were doing with his car. He then said that his bank passbook and his passport were in the car and he wanted to make a police report. Ah Hai said that he would ask his boss to settle the car matter with him. Both the respondent and Yeo then boarded Ah Hai`s car and left for Woodlands where they were arrested. 
 
(7) In the concluding paragraph of his statement, the respondent said that, from the beginning when he drove Yeo down to Singapore, he did not play an active role in the entire transaction and that he was merely listening to their conversation and following them. He maintained that he did not know Lai or Tee.
  
 
 
 
 Prima facie case
 
The trial judge held that the respondent had possession of the key to the boot initially, and was the owner of the car where the drugs were found. Accordingly, by virtue of both ss 18(1)(b) and 21 of the Act he was presumed to be in possession of the drugs and by s 18(2) he was presumed to have known the nature of the drugs. This was sufficient to call for his defence to rebut these presumptions against him.
 Respondent`s defence
The respondent`s defence was that he was an innocent bailee of the drugs and had merely followed his brother Yeo`s instructions to the letter. He worked as a pirate taxi cab operator in Johor Bahru. On the morning of 13 May 1991, as he was taking his mother and sister to a clinic, he was paged by Yeo who told him that he had to collect a debt from someone and requested that the respondent take him to Singapore. The respondent explained that he had been to Singapore many times at the behest of customers.
The respondent attempted to retract parts of his long statement of 27 May 1991. He denied all references to the blue Honda, or that Lai had asked for his permission to put the bags in his car boot. His evidence was that Yeo told him that the two bags were his clothes and that Yeo opened the boot and put them in himself. He maintained that all the while he did not ask any questions when instructed by Yeo to do these things. He did not talk to either Tee or Lai as he did not know them and he did not want to get involved with them.
 Trial judge`s findings
In finding that he had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge, the trial judge made the following comments.
In his view, the case against the respondent rested primarily on his being in the company of Tee, Lai and Yeo, his handing of the key to his car to Lai, his long statement to the police and the fact that drugs were found in his car. Unlike the case against the other accused persons, he was not at the meeting at the Luna Coffee House and he did not meet or speak with any CNB officer until he was arrested at the Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurant in Woodlands.
The trial judge recognized that the respondent was not a good witness and gave an example with regard to the recording of the long statement: 
 
He was not a good witness. He alleged that on 27 May 1991, after he had signed a statement (P78) [the long statement] which he made that day, he was persuaded to sign the first long statement that he had not made. This was quite incredible because P78 referred to the first long statement. I do not believe his explanation that he signed a fabricated statement just because the recording officer told him it was for record only and that he should not worry about it. There was also confusion as to when the first long statement was shown to him on 27 May. His counsel put to the recording officer and interpreter that it was shown before P78 was recorded, and they confirmed it. When he gave evidence, he said that the first long statement was only shown to him after P78 was recorded and signed. Having found his evidence on the first long statement to be unsatisfactory, I cannot accept his evidence on the recording of P78 to be any more credible.
 
 
 
The trial judge nonetheless went on to consider the other evidence in his favour. He found that his evidence that he was asked to come down by Yeo on 13 May 1991 was unchallenged. The respondent did not know Lai except as Yeo`s friend and he had not seen Tee or Ah Hai before. There was no suggestion that the contents of the bags were visible or that the respondent had looked inside them or that he had reason to be suspicious about them. He kept out of all the discussions, and there was no evidence to show that when he remained behind at Lorong 22 he knew that someone was coming to collect his car key from him to gain access to the bags. The trial judge found that the respondent had succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act, and following this that a reasonable doubt had arisen as to whether he was engaged in a conspiracy to traffic drugs with the others. Accordingly he acquitted him.
 Arguments on appeal
Before us Mr Reddy raised three grounds of appeal, namely, on the law relating to abetment by conspiracy, the effect of a confession of a co-accused implicating an accused, and the serious misdirection by the trial judge in his consideration of the evidence against the respondent. In reply Mr Low submitted that the evidence against the respondent was circumstantial and `slender`. The trial judge had found as a fact that he had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2), and an appellate court should not lightly interfere with this finding of fact.
 Abetment by conspiracy
The charge against the respondent was that of abetment by conspiracy. The ingredients that the prosecution had to prove were the existence of a conspiracy to traffic in the drugs and that the trafficking was actually carried out. That the second limb had been fulfilled was not disputed. The essential question in this appeal was, therefore, whether it could be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was a party to that conspiracy. The essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private in such circumstances that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. In fact there is no requirement in law that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other`s company throughout or at all as stated by Whitton J in 
 R v Chew Chong Jin 
 at p 186: 
 
Again it is clear that there need not be communication between each conspirator and every other, provided that there be a common design common to each of them all: 
 R v
 
 Meyrick & Ribuffi
 21 Cr App R 94.
 
 
 
One method of proving a conspiracy would be to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
As stated by Huggins J in 
 R v Chau Sau-Tai 
 at p 221, the question that a trial court must ask itself at the end of the trial is whether in respect of each alleged conspirator the court is satisfied on the evidence as a whole that he must have conspired with one or more of the others.
We first considered Mr Reddy`s ground of appeal relating to the confession of a co-accused. Mr Reddy contended that the trial judge did not consider this aspect of the prosecution`s evidence at all. We were referred to the cautioned statement of Lai which Mr Reddy submitted was a confession and implicated the respondent in the process, thereby pressing into action s 30 of the Evidence Act which allows a court to take into consideration against the respondent the parts in Lai`s confession implicating him. The relevant lines in the cautioned statement were as follows: 
 
Ah Wah [Tee], myself and Ah Ti [Yeo] and his elder brother [the respondent] had our lunch at Lorong 22, Geylang. Ah Ti`s elder brother told me to open his car boot later on at Aljunied to allow a Singaporean to collect something from the boot and then return to Lorong 22, Geylang. Ah Ti`s elder brother would pay $1,500 for doing this.
 
 
 
Mr Reddy also drew our attention to an oral confession made by Lai to one Insp Rajab bin Mohammed who has since passed away and whose statement was admitted at the trial under the provisions of s 33 of the Evidence Act. The relevant portion of his statement was as follows: 
 
At about 2.35 pm in room #02-35 CNB-HQ I interviewed Lai. I spoke to accused [Lai] in Malay and asked him about the five pounds of heroin. He said that he had collected the heroin from a car JBU 365 and passed them to a male Chinese driving a red car. He said that he is not the owner of the drugs and the actual owner is one `Ah Seow` [the respondent]. He further said that the car key which contained the drug was given to him by `Ah Seow` at a coffeeshop at Geylang and he was supposed to meet Ah Seow again at the same coffee shop with the money for the five pounds of heroin which he was supposed to collect from the male Chinese who had taken the drugs.
 
 
 
While we accept that Lai`s cautioned statement and the statement to Insp Rajab fulfilled the requirements of s 30, what was critical was that when Lai gave evidence in court, he exonerated the respondent by retracting the parts in his cautioned statement that implicated the respondent and said that it was Yeo instead who was the mastermind. As for Insp Rajab`s statement admitted under s 33, we were mindful of the fact that he, being dead, was unavailable for cross-examination by the respondent`s counsel. As such, we gave little weight to both implicating statements and, in any event, they could only at best be used to lend assurance to the other evidence.
We considered Mr Low`s submission that the evidence against the respondent was slender. We did not agree with him. In our view, the evidence against the respondent was highly incriminating.
As we have stated above, being in physical presence with his co-conspirators was not essential to proving a conspiracy and there could be other evidence in which the common design and object could be inferred. The primary facts raised by the prosecution was that he had come into Singapore with the other conspirators, that they had met at Woodlands Checkpoint, that at Block 109 Aljunied the drugs were transferred into his car boot and that he gave his car key to Lai to facilitate the later collection of the drugs.
The drugs having been found in the car boot, the trial judge recognized that the rebuttable presumptions created by the Act weighed against him. As he stated in his grounds: 
 
Section 21 of the Act provides that when a drug is found in a vehicle, it is presumed to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle, and s 18(2) provides that a person proved or presumed to have a drug in his possession is also presumed to know the nature of the drug.
 
 
 
Fortified with the presumed knowledge, the evidence against the [respondent] was that he allowed his car to be used as a depository for drugs and that subsequently he delivered the car key to [Lai] to enable him to collect the drugs.
It was our view that at the close of the prosecution case, the prosecution evidence against the respondent was actually the strongest as compared to that against the other conspirators as quite apart from the other evidence adduced against him, the respondent had to rebut the presumption of knowledge of the drugs in his car boot on a balance of probabilities while the other three only had to raise a reasonable doubt.
 Rebuttal of presumptions
The trial judge himself recognized that the respondent was not a good witness but only gave one example of this. Mr Reddy drew our attention to the verbatim notes of other instances of his evidence which were equally if not more unsatisfactory. In particular we were referred to the following inconsistencies.
 
 
(1) Although the respondent readily agreed to give Yeo a lift to Singapore, he never bothered to ask what it was that Yeo was going to do or where he was to drop him off in Singapore. Upon being pressed further, he then admitted that Yeo had informed him that Yeo wanted `to collect something from somebody` but it never occurred to him to enquire further. In fact Yeo had his own cars and could have driven to Singapore himself. 
 
(2) When they met up with the other two cars at the Causeway and Yeo told the respondent to follow them, the respondent never bothered to ask why or ask when Yeo would finish his errand so that he could bring him back as instructed by his mother. The respondent then admitted that Yeo had informed him that Yeo was assisting his friends in something but when asked to confirm that, the respondent took a long time to respond until he was finally prompted to do so by the trial judge. 
 
(3) The respondent stated that he did not know Lai, Tee or Ah Hai but later qualified this by stating that he had met Lai several times before but only knew him through Yeo and did not know him personally. 
 
(4) The respondent sought to retract any reference to the blue Honda Accord in his long statement to the police. When asked to explain the inconsistencies, he said that when the interpreter read back his statement to him it was as his version in court (ie without the blue Honda) but the interpreter must have told the recorder something else. The interpreter flatly denied this under cross-examination. 
 
(5) The respondent said in his long statement that it was Lai who opened his car boot to place the drugs inside it but in his evidence in court he said that it was Yeo who did so. 
 
(6) The respondent claimed that when they were at the coffeeshop in Geylang and Yeo and Lai were talking at a spot in between the coffeeshops it did not occur to him that they were discussing something. 
 
(7) After being arrested, the respondent told Insp Rajab that two male Chinese armed with knives robbed the car from him but he did not know where it happened as he was not familiar with Singapore roads. NO Rusdi bin Abdul also corroborated this. In his evidence in court, the respondent denied saying such things and asserted that it was Insp Rajab who had `bluffed him` and told him that his car had been used to commit a robbery. 
 
(8) When Yeo and Ah Hai came to fetch him after Lai and Tee had been arrested, the respondent`s evidence was that Yeo informed him that Lai had been arrested at Aljunied and his car had been taken away, but he later changed his evidence to state that Yeo informed him that the car was still at the car park. 
 
(9) It was put to NO Rusdi by the respondent`s counsel that when his car was being searched, the respondent had protested his innocence and maintained that there were no drugs in the car. Later when giving evidence, the respondent denied saying such things to NO Rusdi and said that he did not know why they were searching his car.
  
 
 
Upon a detailed review of the notes of the cross-examination of the respondent as well as the other evidence against him, the primary facts as adduced by the prosecution indicated to us that the entire transaction, from the moment the conspirators met up in Woodlands to the eventual delivery of the drugs to Sgt James, was coordinated beforehand, with the respondent being a participant in the common design to traffic. In fact, the respondent was elemental in the transaction in that the drugs were stored in his car and that he passed the car key to Lai to facilitate the delivery of the drugs to Sgt James.
We were of the view that since the drugs were indisputably stored in his car, the respondent knew that he had to rebut the presumption of knowledge on the standard of a balance of probabilities, and in doing so he tried to tailor his evidence in such a way as to distance himself as far as possible from the other conspirators by asserting that he never bothered to ask any questions as to what they were up to. However, this endeavour became a little over enthusiastic and exaggerated to the extent that they were clearly shown to be lies.
In particular this was well illustrated by items (7) and (9) above where the respondent told NO Rusdi and Insp Rajab that he was robbed of his car in an unfamiliar part of Singapore, and yet later denied in court saying anything to Rusdi.
The English Court of Appeal in 
 R v Lucas 
 
 (Ruth) 
 has held that the mere fact that an accused tells lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, but that lies can in certain circumstances amount to corroboration because it indicates a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at p 724 that there were four criteria to satisfy before a lie could amount to corroboration: 
 
The lie ... must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realization of guilt and a fear of the truth. ... Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by [independent] evidence...
 
 
 
We were of the view that the lies of the respondent were a deliberate attempt on the respondent`s part to dissociate himself from his conspirators as well as to maintain ignorance of the drugs in his car. We found incredible for instance his insistence that Yeo did not once mention to him what it was exactly that he was assisting his `friends` in and that the respondent unquestioningly followed the instructions of his younger brother to the letter. Another example of an attempt to dissociate himself from the conspirators was his subsequent retraction of the mention of Ah Hai`s blue Honda Accord which he talked about in his long statement. His explanation as to how the interpreter deceived him by adding this later seemed incredible to us.
Mr Low has submitted that although the presumption of knowledge weighed against him, nevertheless the trial judge had heard the respondent`s evidence and had found as a question of fact that he had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge, and we should not therefore lightly interfere with that finding.
In this respect we think it necessary to refer to the relevant provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) which define this court`s jurisdiction and powers.
Section 44(3) and (4) read:
 
 
(3) An appeal by the Public Prosecutor shall be either against the acquittal of an accused person or against the sentence imposed upon an accused person by the High Court. 
 
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law.
  
 
 
Section 54(1) sets out the procedure and power of this court on appeal: 
 
At the hearing of an appeal, the Court of Appeal shall hear the appellant or his advocate and solicitor, if he appears, and, if it thinks fit, the respondent or his advocate and solicitor, if he appears, and may hear the appellant or his advocate and solicitor in reply, 
 and the Court of Appeal may thereupon confirm, reverse or vary the decision of the trial court
, or may order a retrial or may remit the matter with the opinion of the Court of Appeal thereon to the trial court,
 or may make such other order in the matter as it may think just, and may by such order exercise any power which the trial court might have exercised
:
 
 
 
Provided that the Court of Appeal may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. [Emphasis added.]
A reading of the above section shows that the powers that this court can exercise on an appeal from an acquittal are not subject to any express limitation. As the appeal in the present case is primarily an appeal on fact, we turn to the Privy Council decision of 
 Sheo Swarup & 
 O
 rs v King-Emperor 
 where the Board succinctly set out the principles that a High Court should consider when dealing with acquittals on a matter of fact from the sessions court. There, the relevant provision in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code under consideration was s 423 which is similar to our s 54 in that there was no limitation or restriction on the High Court in the exercise of its power as an appellate tribunal. We therefore consider the observations of the Board highly instructive.
It was argued by the appellants before the Board that on an appeal from an order of acquittal on a matter of fact it was not open to the appellate court to interfere with findings of fact unless it could be said that those findings reached by the trial judge could not have been reached by him had it not been for some perversity or incompetence on his part.
Lord Russell, in delivering the judgment of the Board, rejected that argument and said that there was no limitation on the power of the appellate court unless it was expressly set out in the Code (which it was not) and laid down four guidelines for an appellate court to consider before reaching its conclusions upon fact. They were:
 
 
(1) the views of the trial judge as to the credibility of the witnesses; 
 
(2) the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused, a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he had been acquitted at his trial; 
 
(3) the right of the accused to the benefit of the doubt; 
 
(4) the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact by the trial judge who had the advantage of seeing the witness.
  
 
 
We endorse these four guidelines but also emphasize that they must be viewed in the light of the facts of each case. In the present case, guidelines (1) to (3) operated against the respondent in that the trial judge found that he was not a good witness, and the presumption of innocence was displaced by the respondent`s undisputed possession of the drugs in his car, giving rise to the presumption of knowledge of the drugs which he had to rebut on a balance of probabilities.
As the primary facts adduced by the prosecution of the conspirators` 
 modus operandi 
suggested to us the clear participation of the respondent in this common design to traffic, the essence of this appeal was whether the trial judge correctly came to the decision that the respondent was a credible witness and therefore successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge.
In this regard, despite recognizing the fact that he was not a good witness, the trial judge nevertheless proceeded to find that he had successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge. Unfortunately, we were of the view that the reasons he gave for this conclusion were focused more on the fact that the respondent was not in the presence of the other conspirators at all times and was kept out of their discussions. Since we have held earlier that presence throughout is not critical to a conspiracy, the trial judge should have directed his mind to the other evidence against the respondent, and decided whether despite all the contradictions and lies, the respondent could still be believed.
As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 Tara Singh & 
 O
 rs v PP 
 at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence. Thus in the present case, we were not satisfied from the reasons given in his findings that the trial judge had in the present case sufficiently considered all the evidence against the respondent, especially the contradictions and lies told by the respondent, when he came to a conclusion as to his veracity. In fact, as we have already observed, the respondent`s evidence at some points was quite incredible. We were firmly convinced that he was not a credible witness and had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge, and the trial judge ought to have rejected his innocent bailee defence.
Having found the respondent`s acquittal to be against the weight of the evidence, we accordingly allowed the appeal, convicted the respondent and sentenced him to death.

Woo Bih Li J:
1          The accused person, Ng Kwang Lim (“the Accused”), faced two charges. Under the amended first charge, the Accused was charged with the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Lee Kwok Hong by slashing him in the neck with a paper cutter which act was done with the intention of causing death, an offence punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed).
2          Under the second amended charge, the Accused was charged with the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to one Deborah June Chew Ai Sim by using a paper cutter to slash her on her face, causing permanent disfigurement, an offence punishable under s 326 of the Penal Code. 
3          The Prosecution proceeded with the amended first charge to which the Accused pleaded guilty. I accepted his plea of guilt and convicted him on it. The Accused agreed to the amended second charge being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
4          The punishment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code is life imprisonment or imprisonment of up to ten years. The Accused was also liable to fine or caning.
5          In mitigation, the Defence submitted that the Accused was suffering from a mental illness that impaired his mental responsibility, an illness that was undetected, undiagnosed and untreated for many years. The Defence also submitted that the Accused accepted responsibility for his role and was sincerely apologetic to the family of the deceased. The Defence informed me that although the Accused was estranged from his parents for almost ten years, his relationship with them had improved. The Accused was confident that they will play an instrumental part in his recovery. The Defence urged that no caning be imposed.
6          The Prosecution pressed for life imprisonment on the basis that the Accused was a threat to society and could not be relied upon to take his medication. The Prosecution relied on reports from two psychiatrists which I shall elaborate on later, the case of 
R v Hodgson
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 113, and sentencing precedents. The Prosecution did not make a submission for caning.
The court’s decision
7          As can be seen, the main question before me was whether life imprisonment was an appropriate sentence for the Accused. The statement of facts, which the Accused agreed to, stated:
4          Investigations revealed that on 13 August 2003 at about 9.30 a.m., the Informant, 11 other senior staff and colleagues and the Deceased were having a Faculty Management Committee meeting at the Conference Room located at unit #07-26 of the Faculty of Engineering, NUS.
5          At the time, the Accused was in the vicinity as he was tasked with setting up the audio-visual equipment in the Conference Room and ensuring that it worked properly. …
6          Shortly after the meeting began, the Accused opened the Conference Room door with a loud bang and went in. He had a paper cutter in his right hand. He walked briskly towards the Deceased, who at that juncture was sitting near to the entrance of the Conference Room and facing away from the Accused. The Accused went behind the Deceased and grabbed the latter’s head with his left hand. He then slashed the Deceased’ throat with the paper cutter in his right hand. The Deceased collapsed to the ground with blood gushing out from his neck.
7          Some of the Deceased’s colleagues in the Conference Room tried to restrain the Accused who struggled and attempted to throw a kick at the Deceased. The others went to the Deceased’s aid. The Accused managed to free himself and ran out of the Conference Room. He dropped the paper cutter he had been holding and ran off in the direction of the storeroom. There, he took a new paper cutter from the stationary supplies in the storeroom. In the meantime, those who were inside the Conference Room attended to the Deceased and locked the Conference Room door from the inside in order to prevent the Accused from re-entering the room.
8          The Accused returned moments later with the new paper cutter and struggled to open the locked door of the Conference Room from the outside. He was agitated and shouting that someone in the Dean’s Office was playing “black magic” on him.
9          The [Accused] paced to and fro near the Conference Room. At one point, he tried unsuccessfully to unlock the side door to the Dean’s private office. He then used a paper cutter to cut the wires running along the edge of the side door to the Dean’s office, thus disabling the power supply to the staff card entry system. This prevented the side door from being opened from the outside. He also locked the main entrance to the Dean’s office.
10         Thereafter, the Accused went on a rampage around the office wielding the second paper cutter. He subsequently went back to the storeroom to get a third paper cutter. Later on, he took a chair and sat in front of the door to the Conference Room, preventing the occupants from escaping. He held a paper cutter in his hand all the while.
11         The Police then arrived and unlocked the main entrance to the Dean’s office. They then disarmed and arrested the Accused without a struggle.
8          Dr Stephen Phang, a consultant forensic psychiatrist and Deputy Chief of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry of the Institute of Mental Health and Woodbridge Hospital, provided two reports.
9          In his first report dated 1 October 2003, Dr Phang said that the Accused’s parents and younger sister described a change in his behaviour following his paternal grandmother’s demise in 1993 characterised by abnormal suspicions on his part. He had been close to the grandmother and after her demise, he accused his mother of not loving the grandmother and of putting black magic on him as well as placing centipedes in his home. The acrimonious relationship came to a head when he insisted that his mother publish a notice in a daily Chinese newspaper that she disown him.
10        The Accused told Dr Phang that he had been the victim of black magic for over ten years. For the preceding two years before the offence, the black magic was accompanied with a hallucinatory voice. The Accused said his previous attempts to resist the black magic resulted in further forms of maltreatment such as sensations of needles poking his eyes and other parts of his body. He said that he had once dreamt of the deceased laughing at him. This was at a time several months before the offence.
11        In the morning of the offence, the Accused had experienced a sensation of needles poking him followed rapidly by a hallucinatory voice laughing at him and a force assuming control over him. The Accused claimed that the black magic had taken complete control of his being that day but Dr Phang disagreed. Dr Phang noted that the Accused had admitted that he had on his own accord appropriated new paper cutters to continue slashing although the rage to slash was principally delusion-driven. The Accused did not feel responsible or remorseful for the killing.
12        Dr Phang was of the view that at the time of the offence, the Accused was not of unsound mind. However, he was suffering from an abnormality of mind, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts in causing the death of the deceased.
13        Dr Phang was also of the view that the long-standing nature and severity of the Accused’s illness, coupled with the symptomatology elicited, meant that there was a significant risk of dangerous behaviour by the Accused to others notwithstanding his favourable response to treatment which would have to continue in the long term, and possibly on a permanent basis.
14        In Dr Phang’s follow-up report dated 18 March 2004, Dr Phang said, 
inter alia
:
Unfortunately, he remained unconvinced that his acts were the result of active mental illness. He elected instead to attribute his behaviour to the influence of 
“black magic”
. This would have significant and serious implications for his future potential to engage in similarly dangerous behaviour, as such individuals with no insight often do not recognize the need for long term treatment, and are therefore likely to default, resulting in relapse of active symptoms after a variable period of time. Under such circumstances, he would indubitably pose a significant risk to others, as well as himself. He would require supervised treatment, probably on a permanent basis.
15        There was also a report dated 20 December 2003 from Dr Lim Yun Chin, a psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital, who was attending to the Accused at Queenstown Remand Prison. That report stated, 
inter alia
:
In my opinion, he would need the medication for an indefinite period to contain his psychotic symptoms. His mental illness is such that he would be prone to relapse if he is not on regular medication. He would also be vulnerable to the risk of relapse even if he’s on medication although the risk is less than if he’s not on medication.
He would pose a danger to others given his current condition. He couldn’t be relied to take his own medication. He would require supervision for an indefinite period. It would be appropriate to place him in incarceration to ensure that he received treatment.
16        In 
R v Hodgson
, the court listed three conditions for life imprisonment. The Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Neo Man Lee v PP
 
[1991] SLR 146
 was in broad agreement with these three conditions. The conditions were again cited with approval by MPH Rubin J in 
PP v Lim Hock Hin
 
[2002] 4 SLR 895
. The conditions mentioned in 
Hodgson
 at 114 were:
[A] sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant’s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence.
17        In my view, the three conditions are a guide only. In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that the three conditions had been met in the present case.
18        First, the offence under the amended first charge was grave enough to justify a sentence of life imprisonment although life imprisonment is not always imposed for such an offence.
19        Second, although the Accused had no criminal antecedent and no history of violent conduct, the circumstances and manner in which the offence under the amended first charge was committed demonstrated that the Accused was clearly of an unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future. He had attacked someone he hardly knew and who had no dispute with him previously or on the date of the offence itself, unlike some other cases where life imprisonment had been imposed.
20        Although the Defence submitted that the Accused accepted responsibility for his role and was sincerely apologetic to the family of the deceased, a report of Dr Phang mentioned his lack of insight that his act was the result of his mental illness.
21        Furthermore, the two psychiatrists I have mentioned have reported that the Accused required drug treatment for his mental illness for an indefinite period and that he was likely to default in taking medication if not supervised. Even if the relationship between the Accused and his parents, from whom he had been estranged for almost ten years, had improved, there was really nothing to suggest that that would assist him significantly in coping with his mental illness.
22        Thirdly, if future offences were to be committed by the Accused, the consequences would be likely to be very serious as could be seen from the amended first charge where a life was taken. Also, the Accused’s wanton conduct did not stop after he had slashed the deceased. He went to get other paper cutters and continued slashing around as a result of which he disfigured another person’s face permanently. This was the subject of the amended second charge.
23        After considering the facts before me and the submissions on sentencing, I was of the view that it was in the interest of society and the Accused himself that he be incarcerated for life. Accordingly, I sentenced the Accused to a term of imprisonment for life from the date of remand, 
ie
 15 August 2003, with a direction that the Accused be given treatment on a regular basis for his illness whilst serving his sentence.
24        I have mentioned that the life imprisonment is from the date of remand as that may assist the prison authorities in determining when the Accused is eligible for consideration of remission of sentence under the Prisons Regulations (Cap 247, Rg 2, 2002 Rev Ed).

Yong Pung How CJ:
1
         
 These were four related applications arising from the same facts. In Criminal Revisions Nos 11 and 12 of 2004, Lee Cheong Ngan alias Lee Cheong Yuen (“Lee”) and Chiong Yen Bao (“Chiong”) sought to have their respective convictions set aside. In support of their applications for criminal revision, Lee and Chiong also requested for leave to introduce additional evidence, in Criminal Motions Nos 7 and 8 respectively. I allowed the criminal motions, but rejected the applications for criminal revision. I now give my reasons.
Background
2
         
 Lee and Chiong are husband and wife, and joint owners of the premises at No 69 Toh Tuck Road (“the premises”). The property adjoining the rear of the premises is No 37 Toh Tuck Place. A brick retaining wall with an attached chain-link meshed fence lies near the boundary between the premises and No 37 Toh Tuck Place.
3
         
 Between January and March 2001, officers from the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) visited the premises to inspect the retaining wall and fence. As they found the fence in a state of disrepair, the BCA wrote to Lee and Chiong on 24 March 2001, directing them to repair the fence by 14 April 2001.
4
         
 On 6 July 2001, Phua Chee Sim (“Phua”), an officer attached to the Building Management Section of the BCA, carried out another inspection of the retaining wall and fence. As he was refused entry onto the premises, Phua had to examine the retaining wall and fence from No 37 Toh Tuck Place. He found a portion of the fence collapsed, with the remaining section in a state of dilapidation.
5
         
 Phua then obtained a survey plan from the Singapore Land Registry, which confirmed that the retaining wall and fence were within the boundaries of the premises. The BCA accordingly issued a notice to Lee and Chiong on 20 July 2001 (“the notice”), under s 4(1) of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act (Cap 30, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Section 4(1) provides that:
Where in the opinion of the Commissioner [of Buildings] any building or common property has not been kept or maintained in a state of good and serviceable repair or in a proper and clean condition, the Commissioner may, by notice in writing, require the owner within such period as may be specified in the notice to take such steps or carry out such repairs and maintenance as the Commissioner thinks fit.
6
         
 The notice was served by registered post as prescribed under s 20(1)(b) of the Act, and directed both Lee and Chiong to repair the damaged fence at the back of the premises by 19 August 2001. The notice also stated that a failure to comply would constitute an offence under s 4(3) pf the Act, which is punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000 and a further fine not exceeding $25 for every day that the offence is continued after conviction.
7
         
 Lee Min Kwang (“Min Kwang”), a son of Lee and Chiong, subsequently wrote to the BCA on 15 August 2001, asking for more time to repair the fence. He explained that their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuck Place had built a bird cage next to the fence, rendering it impossible to carry out the necessary rectification works. Crucially, he also acknowledged that a survey plan from the Singapore Land Registry showed that the retaining wall and fence were within the boundaries of the premises.
8
         
 On 29 December 2001, Phua conducted another inspection of the retaining wall and fence, again from No 37 Toh Tuck Place. He discovered that Lee and Chiong had still not carried out any rectification work. As a result, two summonses were issued against Lee and Chiong respectively on 27 February 2002. Both charges in them read as follows:
You … are charged that you did fail to comply with the Notice … issued by the Commissioner of Buildings on 20 July 2001 under section 4(1) of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act, Chapter 30, requiring you to repair the damaged chain link fence at the rear of the premises at No. 69 Toh Tuck Road, Singapore by 19 August 2001 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 4(3) of the said Act.
The proceedings below
9
         
 Lee and Chiong appeared before the magistrate on 8 October 2002, but the hearing was adjourned for the parties to produce an agreed statement of facts (“Agreed SOF”). On 9 October 2002, the magistrate was informed that Lee and Chiong intended to plead guilty. The magistrate then stood down the hearing to allow their counsel, Mr Tan Cheng Yew (“Tan”), to explain the Agreed SOF and charges to them.
10
       
 When the hearing resumed, the charge was read in Mandarin to Chiong, and in English to Lee. The interpreter informed the court that both were pleading guilty, and understood the nature and consequences of their pleas. The Agreed SOF was then read, and the interpreter notified the court that Lee and Chiong admitted to the facts contained therein. The magistrate accordingly convicted Lee and Chiong on the respective charges.
11
       
 In mitigation, Lee and Chiong submitted, through Mr Tan, that the damage to the fence was caused by their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuck Place. Also, they were both in their seventies, and had been confused when they first received the BCA’s notice, as they did not know if the retaining wall and fence fell within their premises.
12
       
 After hearing the facts and taking into account every relevant mitigating factor, the magistrate sentenced Lee and Chiong to pay a fine of $900 each (in default nine days’ imprisonment). The fines were duly paid, yet Lee and Chiong still failed to carry out the required repairs. They were then charged on 17 October 2003 with a continuing offence under s 4(3) of the Act. On 15 March 2004, they filed these four applications to challenge their convictions on the earlier February 2002 charges. The later charges in October 2003 were not in issue before me.
The applications
13
       
 Lee and Chiong both filed petitions for criminal revision, asking the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) to set aside their convictions. They submitted that they had never intended to admit without qualification to the offences alleged against them, and had suffered serious injustice at the hearing before the magistrate.
14
       
 To substantiate their cases for revision, Lee and Chiong also applied for leave to introduce new evidence. In Criminal Motion No 7 of 2004, Lee sought to admit his own affidavit, as well as that of his other son, Lee Wei Kwang (“Wei Kwang”). In Criminal Motion No 8 of 2004, Chiong sought to admit her own affidavit to assist her case.
The criminal motions
15
       
 The revisionary powers of the High Court are governed by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) and s 268(1) of the CPC. According to s 268(1) of the CPC, the High Court, in the exercise of its revisionary powers, may also take additional evidence in accordance with s 257(1) of the CPC, which provides that:
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is 
necessary
, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate’s Court. [emphasis added]
16
       
 In deciding if the evidence sought to be adduced is “necessary”, the three conditions set out in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
 must be fulfilled:
(a)
       
 non-availability – it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at trial;
(b)
       
 relevance – the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case; and
(c)
       
 reliability – it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
17
       
 I adopted this framework in 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
, and have repeatedly affirmed its authority in cases such as 
Chan Chun Yee v PP
 
[1998] 3 SLR 638
, 
Tan Sai Tiang v PP
 
[2000] 1 SLR 439
 and most recently, in 
Annis bin Abdullah v PP
 
[2004] 2 SLR 93
.
18
       
 In this case, the affidavits that the petitioners sought to adduce described their version of what transpired in the court below on 8 and 9 October 2002. It was apparent that, by the very nature of the evidence, the first condition was fulfilled, since this evidence obviously could not have been obtained at the proceedings below. The second condition was also clearly satisfied, as the evidence was highly relevant. Lee and Chiong based their cases for criminal revision on the main ground that their pleas of guilt below were invalid. In order to ascertain the legality of their pleas of guilt, and consequently, the soundness of their convictions, I had to consider evidence of the circumstances in which the pleas were taken.
19
       
 The only real issue here was the apparent credibility of the additional evidence. Although untested assertions of events would generally not be admitted at this stage, I noted that the affidavits of Lee, Chiong and Wei Kwang were broadly consistent in the most material particulars. Bearing in mind that the evidence must only be apparently credible, and need not be incontrovertible, I found that the final condition was satisfied, but only by the barest of margins.
20
       
 The deciding factor in this case was the high degree of relevance that this additional evidence had on Lee’s and Chiong’s petitions for criminal revision. They had to be allowed to put forward their version of events for me to ascertain the soundness of their convictions in the court below. Given the circumstances, the Deputy Public Prosecutor had no objection to the admission of the affidavits.
   
21
       
 Of course, the fact that I agreed to admit the affidavits did not mean that I accepted their entire contents as the truth. The veracity of the allegations still had to be tested against the rest of the evidence. As all three affidavits came from interested parties, I was especially chary of accepting their evidence at face value. With this in mind, I turned to consider the petitions for criminal revision.
The criminal revisions
22
       
 I laid down the principles governing the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
 at 330, [17]:
[V]arious phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
23
       
 Bearing in mind the potential for abuse by accused persons who have pleaded guilty, the court will exercise its revisionary power sparingly, to ensure that it does not degenerate into a convenient form of “backdoor appeal”: 
Teo Hee Heng v PP
 
[2000] 3 SLR 168
 at [7]. Not only must there have been some error, illegality, impropriety or irregularity, it must also have resulted in grave and serious injustice: 
Ma Teresa Bebango Bedico v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 192
 at [8], followed in 
Lee Eng Hock v PP
 
[2002] 1 SLR 364
.
The petitioners’ case
24
       
 Lee and Chiong raised several issues to substantiate their case for criminal revision. First, various complaints were made against Mr Tan’s conduct of their case. They further alleged that the interpreter did not adequately translate the charges or the Agreed SOF, and failed to convey their reservations to the court. The magistrate’s notes of evidence (“NOE”) were also ambiguous, and did not clearly record that they had both entered an unequivocal plea of guilt. It was submitted that all the circumstances, taken together, established that they had suffered serious injustice, and their convictions ought to be set aside.
The pleas of guilt
25
       
 The greater part of the petitioners’ arguments disputed the validity of their pleas of guilt below. The circumstances under which the High Court would exercise its revisionary powers in such cases are firmly settled. Section 180(b) of the CPC states that if the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him, he may plead guilty to the charge and the court may convict him on it. In 
Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 560
, I adopted the three common law safeguards for a valid plea of guilt as laid down in 
Lee Weng Tuck v PP
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 143
:
(a)
       
 an accused should plead guilty by his own mouth and not through his counsel;
(b)
       
 the onus lies on the judge to ascertain whether the accused understands the true nature and consequences of his plea; and
(c)
       
 the court must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him.
26
       
 I turned to consider each of the petitioners’ contentions in light of these principles.
Allegations against defence counsel
27
       
 Lee and Chiong made many serious allegations against Mr Tan. According to them, he consented to the Agreed SOF without their authority, acted against their instructions, did nothing to express their views to the court, and also omitted to advise them of the availability of the defence of reasonable care.
28
       
 In many petitions for criminal revision, the accused often challenges defence counsel’s conduct of the case. Yet many of these allegations are often unfounded, and are raised by the accused only in a desperate attempt to escape the rigours of the law. In 
Lee Eng Hock
, ([23] 
supra
), the petitioner pleaded guilty, but later sought criminal revision on the ground that he had misunderstood his counsel’s advice. While he was convinced of his own innocence throughout, he thought that his counsel had advised him that a plea of guilt would not occasion a custodial sentence. In dismissing the petition, I made the following observations at [10] of my judgment:
If the conduct of defence counsel could be so easily challenged, the chilling effect on the criminal Bar would be immense. While there may in some cases be a thin line between dispensing credible legal advice and pressurising one’s client to plead guilty, it is undesirable to allow defence counsel to be made convenient scapegoats, on the backs of whom “backdoor appeals” are carried through.
29
       
 These sentiments applied with equal force here. Given that Mr Tan has unfortunately disappeared from the country, I was forced to evaluate the reliability of the petitioners’ account of events without his assistance. After carefully considering the evidence, I found that the petitioners’ claims simply could not be accepted.
30
       
 If Mr Tan was in fact guilty of the petitioners’ allegations, they had every opportunity to voice their objections in court. They may have been slightly overwhelmed by the proceedings, as they were advanced in years and it was their first time in court. Nonetheless, their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang had been keenly involved in the case from the beginning. They were present in court, and fully capable of protesting on their parents’ behalf.
31
       
 Lee, Chiong and Wei Kwang alleged in their affidavits that they had openly disagreed with Mr Tan at the hearing, and the magistrate had stood down the proceedings twice for the parties to resolve their differences. Yet there is no record of any of this in the magistrate’s NOE, which only reflect that the magistrate had stood down for the charges and the Agreed SOF to be explained to Lee and Chiong. The magistrate must have been aware of his duty to ensure that both Lee and Chiong did intend to plead guilty to the charges against them. If there was indeed such an obvious dispute between the petitioners and Tan, I had no doubt that the magistrate would not have accepted their pleas of guilt.
Allegations against interpreter
32
       
 Lee and Chiong also claimed that the interpreter did not translate the charges of the Agreed SOF in full, but instead said, in Mandarin, words to the effect of “you know what you are here for” and “trust your lawyer”. Again, I found their assertions to be completely groundless.
33
       
 The role that interpreters play in cases involving pleas of guilt is especially vital, since they assist the court in ensuring that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea, and intends to admit without qualification to the offence alleged against him. Given the importance of their work to the validity of guilty pleas, it is perhaps inevitable that in such cases for criminal revision, allegations against interpreters are almost commonplace.
34
       
 However, it would be detrimental to the administration of justice if the conduct of interpreters could be so easily impeached. Accused persons should take note that such arguments will be summarily rejected, unless they can establish a sufficient basis for their allegations, and it is demonstrated that the interpreter’s conduct undermined any of the three procedural safeguards outlined above.
 
35
       
 In this case, Lee and Chiong could not offer any reasons to explain why the interpreter, an officer of the court, would neglect to translate such material evidence, and demonstrate such a flagrant disregard for his duties. Their contentions were clearly unwarranted, and their case was further undermined by the considerable lapse of time between the hearing and their petitions. For some 17 months, Lee and Chiong made no complaints against the interpreter, and took no active steps to dispute their convictions. It would be unreasonable to expect the interpreter to be able to recall details of the proceedings now, so as to rebut their allegations.
36
       
 In any case, I had no doubt that both Lee and Chiong were aware of the particulars of the charge, and understood the nature and consequences of their pleas. The notice of 20 July 2001 clearly informed them that a failure to comply would amount to an offence under s 4(3) of the Act. They had received the summons on 27 February 2002, and engaged counsel shortly thereafter. They were represented in the court below, and their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang were also actively concerned with the case throughout. The nature and consequences of the charges must have been impressed upon them.
The Agreed SOF
37
       
 Lee and Chiong also argued that the Agreed SOF contained errors on the face of it, which raised serious issues as to its accuracy. It is trite law that the court has a legal duty to record a statement of facts following an accused’s plea of guilt, and to scrutinise the statement to ensure that all the elements of the charge are made out. The accused need not admit to every fact alleged in the statement of facts, so long as what he does admit contains all the essential ingredients of the offence he is charged with: 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
.
38
       
 Here, Lee and Chiong claimed that the Agreed SOF contained evidence of a material element of the offence that was contradictory. Paragraph 3 of the Agreed SOF states that:
Based on a detailed survey plan issued by the Chief Surveyor of the Singapore Land Registry, the chain link meshed fencing and brick retaining wall between No 69 Toh Tuck Road and No 37 Toh Tuck Place was shown entirely within the accused persons’ property, 
ie
 No 69 Toh Tuck Road.
39
       
 However, Lee and Chiong maintained that a private survey conducted by Ho Huai Hoon Surveyors found that the fence was not within their premises. As s 4(1) of the Act confers a power on the Commissioner of Buildings to issue notices only to owners of the relevant property, if the fence was not within the premises, the BCA’s notice under s 4(1), and Lee’s and Chiong’s convictions under s 4(3), must be set aside.
40
       
 Their arguments on this point were flawed for many reasons. In so far as they disputed the definitive statement in the Agreed SOF that the fence was within the premises, they had to prove that Mr Tan consented to the particulars in the Agreed SOF without their authority. As they had not proved their allegations against Mr Tan to my satisfaction, I found that this particular fact must be taken to have been properly admitted.
41
       
 In any case, the petitioners’ son Min Kwang had confirmed their ownership of the retaining wall and fence in his letter to the BCA on 15 August 2001. Their other son Wei Kwang had also admitted in his affidavit that the ownership issue had been “conclusively settled” by the Singapore Land Authority in February 2003. Having effectively conceded this point, Lee and Chiong could not hope to resurrect the issue now.
42
       
 Even if I was prepared to reopen the question, Lee and Chiong had failed to adduce any evidence of the alleged private survey showing that the fence was not within their premises. A report from the surveyors they commissioned would have provided a strong measure of support for their claims. Tellingly, no such report was ever produced. It was impossible for me to accept their contentions, especially when the BCA had produced two survey plans from the Singapore Land Registry that directly contradicted their contention.
The notes of evidence
43
       
 Lee and Chiong also objected to the contents of the magistrate’s NOE, which they claimed were bare and ambiguous, and failed to reflect the “nuances” of what actually happened.
44
       
 Given the many exigencies that judges face, it is to be expected that the NOE will generally record only the most pertinent aspects of the evidence, often in point form. Here, the NOE did in substance record the most relevant events of the hearing. It was clear, from a perusal of its contents, that both Lee and Chiong had pleaded guilty, indicated that they understood the nature and consequences of their plea, and admitted to the Agreed SOF.
45
       
 Lee and Chiong made much of several minor omissions in the NOE. For instance, they pointed out that the magistrate did not make any distinction between Lee and Chiong. However, since Lee’s and Chiong’s cases were being heard together and they were obviously conducting their cases on the same footing, the magistrate had understandably found it unnecessary to refer to them individually. A broad, objective view must be taken of the entire NOE. It would be sufficient so long as the most relevant elements of the hearing are recorded. To insist on the level of detail that Lee and Chiong argued for would simply open the door to greater delays in court proceedings.
Delay
46
       
 Even if I accepted Lee’s and Chiong’s contentions, any injustice they may have suffered was seriously attenuated by their delay in presenting the petitions. While delay would generally be immaterial in a case of injustice, it may indicate, in some circumstances that there was in fact no injustice caused: 
Ang Poh Chuan
, ([22] 
supra
), followed in 
Lim Hean Nerng v Lim Ee Choo
 
[1998] 2 SLR 585
. In this case, Lee and Chiong could not offer any credible explanation for the lateness of their applications. Although it was unfortunate that Lee had suffered from poor health since his conviction, this did not adequately explain the delay of more than 17 months. Chiong was still in a position to present their case, and their sons Min Kwang and Wei Kwang could also have instructed counsel to file the petitions.
47
       
 In fact, I found it reasonable to infer from the circumstances that these petitions were filed only as a response to the subsequent 17 October 2003 charges against Lee and Chiong, for a continuing offence under s 4(3) of the Act. They probably began to consider petitioning for criminal revision only after they received the second summons, and were faced with the prospect of a much heftier fine. All of this further undermined their case that they suffered substantial injustice in the court below. Their behaviour was certainly not consistent with that of anyone carrying the burden of injustice on their backs.
Strict liability and the defence of reasonable care
48
       
 Section 4(3) of the Act provides that “any person who fails to comply with the requirements of any notice issued by the Commissioner under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence”. The material elements of the offence are: (a) a valid notice issued by the Commissioner to the owner; and (b) failure to comply.
49
       
 As there is no express 
mens rea
 requirement, Lee and Chiong conceded that the provision created a strict liability offence. However, they argued that the defence of due diligence or reasonable care should have been available to them, following the principles in 
M V
 
Balakrishnan v PP
 
[1998] SGHC 416
; 
[1998] 1 CLAS 357
 and 
Tan Cheng Kwee v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 390
. As Mr Tan failed to inform them of this, they allegedly suffered a serious injustice that must be set right.
Strict liability
50
       
 In 
Comfort Management Pte Ltd v PP
 
[2003] 2 SLR 67
, I adopted the approach established in 
Sweet v Parsley
 
[1970] AC 132
 and 
Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd v Attorney-General of Hong Kong
 
[1985] AC 1
, to decide if the relevant offence was one of strict liability. The following opinion expressed by Lord Scarman in 
Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd
 (at 14) provides a concise set of guidelines:
(1) there is a presumption of law that 
mens rea
 is required before a person can be held guilty of a criminal offence; (2) the presumption is particularly strong where the offence is “truly criminal” in character; (3) the presumption applies to statutory offences, and can be displaced only if this is clearly or by necessary implication the effect of the statute; (4) the only situation in which the presumption can be displaced is where the statute is concerned with an issue of social concern, and public safety is such an issue; (5) even when a statute is concerned with such an issue, the presumption of 
mens rea
 stands unless it can be shown that the creation of strict liability will be effective to promote the objects of the statute …
51
       
 However, it was not necessary for me to decide if s 4(3) of the Act did indeed create a strict liability offence, as Lee and Chiong clearly possessed the requisite 
mens rea
 in any case. As I noted earlier, the only material elements of the offence were: (a) a valid notice issued by the Commissioner to the owner; and (b) failure to comply. It was not disputed that Lee and Chiong had received a valid notice, and as owners of the retaining wall and fence, were obliged to comply. Once they received the notice, they knew what was required of them, yet they deliberately chose not to carry out the necessary repairs. They were both clearly guilty of an offence under s 4(3).
Defence of reasonable care
52
       
 Even if I accepted that the defence of reasonable care was available to Lee and Chiong, their conduct fell far short of what was required. After receiving the BCA’s notice, they took no steps to carry out the rectification works. They claimed that the fence was not within their property, yet they did not submit any evidence of the alleged private survey they commissioned to support their contention. Moreover, their son Min Kwang had already acknowledged that the fence fell within the premises as early as 15 August 2001.
53
       
 Lee and Chiong also asserted that their neighbours at No 37 Toh Tuck Place were responsible for the damage to the fence. However, as they failed to produce any credible evidence to substantiate their allegations, I had no choice but to reject their claims.
Conclusion
54
       
 For the reasons above, I allowed the criminal motions to adduce new evidence, but dismissed the petitions for criminal revision.

 Background and charges
Three Malaysians, Abdul Rashid bin Mohamedd (`the first accused`), Abdullah bin A Rahman (`the second accused`) and Abdul Rahman bin Awang (`the third accused`) - all colleagues at the relevant time and in the employ of the Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johore Bahru, Malaysia - were arrested sometime on the morning of 21 March 1990 near the Woodlands Checkpoint around the area close to Blks 2A and 4A Woodlands Centre Road, Singapore. A packet of drugs hidden underneath the dashboard of a Malaysian registered motor vehicle Toyota, bearing registration No NL 4807, driven by the first accused into Singapore was seized. Scientific analysis of the seized drugs (a subject matter of great contention in this case) revealed that the drugs contained not less than 76.3g of diamorphine. In the event, all the three named persons were charged and jointly tried before me on the following charges under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`MDA`).
 First accused
 
That you, Ab Rashid bin Mohamed, on or about 21 March 1990, in Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Sch to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by transporting a packet of drugs containing not less than 76.3g of diamorphine from Woodlands Checkpoint to the car park at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road in motor car NL 4807 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
 
 Second accused
 
 
That you, Abdullah bin A Rahman, between 20 and 21 March 1990, together with one Abdul Rahman bin Awang in Singapore and elsewhere in West Malaysia, did abet one Ab Rashid bin Mohamed in the commission of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Sch to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), when he transported a packet of drugs containing not less than 76.3g of diamorphine from Woodlands Checkpoint to the car park at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road in motor car NL 4807 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
 
 Third accused
 
 
That you, Abdul Rahman bin Awang, between 20 and 21 March 1990, together with one Abdullah bin A Rahman in Singapore and elsewhere in West Malaysia, did abet one Ab Rashid bin Mohamed in the commission of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Sch to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), when he transported a packet of drugs containing not less than 76.3g of diamorphine from Woodlands Checkpoint to the car park at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road in motor car NL 4807 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
At the close of the prosecution case, the third accused was acquitted of the charge but the first and second accused were, however, called upon to enter their defence. The first and second accused who elected to give evidence on affirmation were in the result convicted. My grounds follow.
 Prosecution case
At about 8.15am on 21 March 1990, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), acting on information received, arrived at Woodlands Checkpoint to keep a lookout for two male Malays who were expected to carry drugs into Singapore either in a Malaysian Proton Saga bearing registration No JBP 3885 or in an old model Toyota motor car.
At about 9.30am on 21 March 1990, a Malaysian motor vehicle JBP 3885 (Proton Saga) arrived at the customs vehicle checking bay. There were two male Malays in the car. It was later ascertained that the second accused was the passenger whilst the third accused the driver of the vehicle. The vehicle was not checked by any customs official and consequently passed through the customs bay. Narcotics Officers Ng Say Liang (`NO Ng`) (PW14), Goh Seow Thian (`NO Goh`) (PW20), Chong Kim Siak (`NO Chong`) (PW19) and Sukumar Balan (`NO Sukumar`) (PW16) trailed the said motor car whilst Senior Narcotics Officer Chew Woon Hock (`SNO Chew`) (PW21), Narcotics Officers Tan Chee Hwee (`NO Tan`) (PW18) and Mohd Raziff bin Mohd Yusoff (`NO Raziff`) (PW17) remained at the checkpoint.
The pursuers, however, lost sight of their quarry near the junction of Woodlands Centre Road and Admiralty Road. During the ensuing search around the vicinity, the vehicle was seen parked behind Blk 2A Woodlands Centre Road. There was no one inside the parked motor car. At about 10.15am, SNO Chew, Narcotics Officer Amme Ithnain (`NO Amme`) (PW15), NO Tan and NO Raziff joined the team that located the motor vehicle. At about 11.00am, the third accused returned to the vehicle and attempted to drive it away when SNO Chew blocked its passage with a CNB vehicle. The third accused was arrested presently. Nothing incriminating was found in the vehicle.
Upon his arrest, the third accused was questioned by NO Amme in Malay particularly as to the whereabouts of his companion. The third accused replied that he was going to fetch his friend who was having a drink with another friend at the coffee stall near the staircase of the nearby Woodlands Food Centre (p 148 of the verbatim notes).
NO Amme duly communicated to the rest of the CNB officers the information given to him by the third accused. They then proceeded with the third accused to the Woodlands Food Centre which was situated at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road. At the said food centre, at a coffee stall situated close to a staircase, the second accused was seen having a drink with the first accused. The first and second accused were seated beside each other. Both of them were arrested.
Upon the instructions of SNO Chew, all three accused persons were then taken to the Woodlands Checkpoint in three separate vehicles. On the way to the Woodlands Checkpoint, NO Raziff searched the first accused and recovered from his trouser pocket, amongst other things, a bunch of seven keys. Two of them were branded `Toyota Motor`. Upon being questioned, the first accused told NO Raziff that he drove into Singapore in motor vehicle NL 4807 and that it was parked at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road. The CNB team then proceeded to the car park where the first accused led them to his vehicle NL 4807. The second accused was also present at the scene. When the first accused was brought to the vehicle NL 4807, he was asked by SNO Chew in Malay: `Ada barang?` meaning `Any stuff?`. The first accused remained silent. Presently SNO Chew told NO Raziff to inform the first accused that his car would be given a 100% search. SNO Chew at that point of time asked him where the `barang` was. The first accused then used his head to indicate to SNO Chew the front compartment of his car. With one of the keys marked `Toyota Motor`, SNO Chew opened the front left door of the vehicle. A search of the glove compartment did not reveal anything incriminating. SNO Chew then looked under the dashboard and discovered a packet taped underneath it. He then removed the packet, placed it on the front passenger seat and instructed NO Raziff to question the first accused as to what it was. The first accused remained silent and looked at the second accused. SNO Chew unwrapped the packet which was wrapped in a Chinese newspaper and in it was a packet of `granular substance`.
When he saw the packet of granular substance, SNO Chew instructed NO Raziff to ask the first accused what the substance was. The first accused then whispered in Malay to NO Raziff: `dadah` meaning `drugs`. SNO Chew then said: `Speak louder.` At that point of time, the first accused in a louder voice said: `dadah`. SNO Chew seized the packet and the team of CNB officers then left for Woodlands Checkpoint together with the first and second accused. The vehicle NL 4807 was also driven to the checkpoint. At the checkpoint, the CNB team met up with NO Amme and NO Sukumar who were then guarding the third accused. Subsequently, all the CNB officers left the checkpoint with the three accused persons and arrived at CNB headquarters at about 11.50am.
The scene of crime unit arrived at 2.45pm and took eight photographs (P-12 to P-19). Photographs P-18 and P-19 show the seized substance.
At about 3.01pm at the CNB office, SNO Chew weighed the packet of granular substance in the presence of the three accused persons. The weight recorded by SNO Chew was 425.5g. SNO Chew testified that he used a weighing machine which had a needle running round the scale. After weighing, he sealed and marked the drugs as `Toyota`. At about 4.20pm he handed it over to the CNB storekeeper, Inspector Ho Siew Hong (`Inspector Ho`) (PW23) for safe custody. On 23 March 1990 at 3.25pm, SNO Chew collected the said exhibit from Inspector Ho. At about 4.10pm the same day, SNO Chew handed over the substance to Dr Lee Tong Kooi (`Dr Lee`) (PW13) at the Department of Scientific Services (`DSS`) for analysis. After the analysis, the exhibit was returned by Dr Lee to SNO Chew on 23 June 1990 and the same was returned to the CNB store by SNO Chew the same day.
SNO Chew was vigorously cross-examined by defence counsel on the substance seized from motor vehicle NL 4807. He was asked whether the photographs taken of the drugs seized on the day in question showed them as granular or lumpy. SNO Chew agreed that the photographs showed them to be in lumps. He was also asked about the colour of the substance seized. He replied that the said substance was `more to greyish or light-brownish` in colour. He however agreed that it was more greyish than brownish. When he was asked why in the first charge preferred against the accused persons, he described the seized drugs as brownish substance, SNO Chew replied that the word `brownish` was in his computer disk and he therefore used it uncorrected. When it was put to SNO Chew that the packet he handed over to Dr Lee for analysis on 23 March 1990 (marked `Toyota`) was not the substance he had seized from NL 4807 on 21 March 1990, SNO Chew disagreed.
The storekeeper of CNB, Inspector Ho, testified that at about 4.20pm on 21 March 1990, he received a packet marked `Toyota` from SNO Chew which he kept in the CNB storeroom. At about 3.25pm on 23 March 1990, SNO Chew retrieved the same packet from him. Subsequently at about 11.20am on 23 June 1990, SNO Chew returned the exhibit marked `Toyota` to the store. Inspector Ho said that the exhibit was sealed and he could see from the outside that it was a packet of brownish substance.
Dr Lee, a scientific officer attached to the DSS, by his deposition (PS-1) and by his oral testimony, told the court that at about 4.10pm on 23 March 1990, SNO Chew delivered to him `a packet of powdery substance` marked `Toyota` bearing the CNB seal. The colour of the substance was light greyish. He weighed the substance on 8 May 1990 and concluded all his tests on 25 May 1990. On the same day, he signed a certificate pursuant to s 16 of the MDA in relation to the substance he analyzed. The said certificate (Lab No 90019623) was handed to SNO Chew on 23 June 1990 together with the substance he analyzed duly sealed and marked `Toyota`. The said certificate stated that the exhibit he received for analysis contained 449.1g net of `granular substance` and its diamorphine content was 76.3g. It should be noted that there was a variance between Dr Lee`s deposition where it was stated that the exhibit he received for analysis was a packet of powdery substance whereas in his certificate it was described as `granular substance`.
Dr Lee was recalled to testify on the exhibit he analyzed. He said that the words `powdery substance` appearing in para 3 of his depositional evidence (PS-1) should read as `granular substance` - to be in line with his certificate where it was stated (in para 2) that the exhibit contained `granular substance`.
In reply to a question from counsel for the first accused, Dr Lee referred to his notes (see exh C) and said that his notes confirmed that at 1610 hrs on 23 March 1990 he received one `exhibit sealed CNB 148375 marked ""Toyota"" containing one packet of granular substance`. As regards Dr Lee`s earlier testimony that he analyzed a packet of powdery substance and his later evidence that the substance was granular, his credit and credibility were attacked by counsel for the first accused. Counsel for the first accused applied to the court to impeach Dr Lee`s credit. I shall deal with the impeachment proceedings later in these grounds.
Inspector Ho was also recalled. He was cross-examined in relation to the exhibit received by his store on 23 June 1990, as reflected in a computer printout (exh D-13) which suggested that it was a packet of heroin weighing approximately 600g (p 542 of the verbatim notes). Inspector Ho explained that the computer entry was made by his assistant based on the case report. The case report itself was made by NO Ng who testified that in his case report, he gave the approximate weight as 600g without instructions from anyone but by using his own estimate (pp 581, 582 and 584 of the verbatim notes).
Abdul Hamid bin Ismail (`Abdul Hamid`) (PW9), a hospital attendant (senior grade), attached to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johore Bahru, testified that in March 1990 he was the departmental supervisor of the first and second accused at the hospital. According to his depositional evidence, both the first and the second accused were supposed to have been performing their normal duties from 8am to 4pm on 21 March 1990. Both of them reported to work at 8am. The day before, the first accused had applied to him for half a day`s leave for the afternoon of 21 March 1990. He approved the application. On 21 March 1990 at about 8am, the second accused, too, came to see him and requested half a day`s leave for the afternoon of the same day to attend to some personal matters. He was also granted leave. The afternoon duties were to commence at 12.45pm. However on that day, Abdul Hamid could not find either the first or the second accused at the work place after tea break at 10am.
The prosecution sought to admit and admitted in evidence three long statements of the first accused. The said statements (exhs P-39A, P-39B and P-39C) were admitted in evidence as being made voluntarily without any objection by the defence.
In the statement (exh P-39A) given by the first accused on 24 March 1990, the first accused described how he met the second accused at a beach in Johore Bahru where he was handed a packet by the second accused to be taped to the bottom of the dashboard of his car. In that statement, the first accused denied knowledge of the contents of the packet. All the three statements are crucial to the proceedings and are reproduced hereunder in full: 
 Exhibit P-39A 
 
I work as a hospital attendant at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital in Johore Bahru. I am paid a monthly salary of RM475. I have been working in this hospital for the last ten years. My working hours are from 8am to 4pm.
 
 
 
Sometime last week I wanted to borrow RM500 from Dollah as I was indebted and I wanted to pay the rental for my house and my car NL 4807. The monthly instalment for my car is RM167. I purchased this car from Rahman. It is a Toyota Corolla and is yellow in colour. I purchased this car in June 1989 from Rahman. I have paid him RM3000 and the balance, I was to settle with the finance company by myself. The price of the car is RM7000. I did not effect the transfer of the ownership of my car because Rahman told me that once I had settled the full payment with the finance company he would effect the transfer of ownership.
I am now shown a Malaysian passport No 3465672. I identified the photograph on the passport as that of Dollah. I am now shown another passport and I identified the photograph as that of Rahman. (Recorder`s note: I showed him the passports of Abdullah bin A Rahman, passport No 3465672 and Abdul Rahman bin Awang, passport No D 968816. He identified the photographs on the passport as that of Dollah and Rahman respectively whom he had mentioned in this statement.) Dollah and Rahman are my working colleagues. I have known each of them for almost ten years. They are also working as hospital attendants. Dollah is on shift duty whereas Rahman`s working hours seem to be very flexible to me.
As stated by me, sometime last week I wanted to borrow RM500 from Dollah. 
 Dollah refused to lend me the money and suggested to me that I do a job for him. I then questioned him as to what sort of job, and Dollah told me to smuggle something into Singapore via the Causeway. I further questioned him whether it was dangerous and Dollah assured me that it was not dangerous. He promised to pay me RM1000 for my service and in this way I need not borrow money. I agreed to his suggestion. Dollah then told me that I have to perform the job in a few days time. He told me that he would let me know the date later 
.
On Tuesday, 20 March 1990, at around noon, I met Dollah at the hospital. Dollah told me that very likely the job would be on Wednesday. He then told me to drive my car NL 4807 and meet him at the beach at about 7am. The beach is facing Singapore and is better known as `Pantai Lido`. I agreed.
On Wednesday, 21 March 1990, at around 7am, I arrived at the beach in my car NL 4807. 
 Later Dollah arrived in motor car JBP 3885, a Proton Saga 
. This car belonged to Rahman. He was alone and he was carrying a plastic packet when he alighted from the car. I also alighted from my car. 
 He then handed the packet to me. He told me to hide 
 
 the packet 
. 
 He told me to tie it firmly under the dashboard 
. I then went to the boot of my car to look for strings to tie the packet. I could not find any. I managed to find a roll of tape and I used it to tape the packet under the dashboard on the left side of the car. Dollah was standing next to me watching me conceal the packet. I did not open the packet to inspect the contents, however I noticed that the packet was wrapped with newsprint. I did try to inspect the contents but Dollah insisted that it is not necessary to inspect it. 
 After having concealed the packet under the dashboard near the glove compartment, I reported for work. Before I left, Dollah told me to drive my car into Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. He promised to pay me RM1000 for my service. I was to meet him at the carpark in front of Woodlands Food Centre at about 10am to hand over the packet to him 
. During our conversation I told Dollah that I was able to meet him only during my teabreak which was 10am. Dollah is also aware that my teabreak is about 10am and he agreed to meet me at the carpark till my arrival. When I reported for work at the hospital, I parked my car at the hospital carpark. I locked my car.
At about 10.15am, I left the hospital in my car NL 4807 and drove into Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint. At the checkpoint, I obtained a ROV vehicle entry permit, and after immigration and customs clearance, I drove into the car park infront of Woodlands Food Centre. I parked my car in the parking lot. I tore a parking coupon and placed it on the dashboard of my car. 
 I alighted from my car and started looking for Dollah 
. I could not find him at the carpark. I then decided to look for him at the food centre. I met him at the coffee stall on the first floor of the food centre. He was alone at the stall. I then sat next to him and asked him, `how is it?`, and Dollah replied that later Rahman will collect the packet from my car. A few minutes later, I was arrested by a few officers who identified themselves as CNB officers. Dollah was also placed under arrest and both of us were brought to the car park in front of the Woodlands Food Centre. At the carpark, I saw Rahman. He was also placed under arrest.
I was then brought inside the CNB car. In the car, a Malay officer spoke to me in Malay. He searched me and from my rear trouser pocket, he took my Malaysian restricted passport. He also took a bunch of keys from my left front trouser pocket. The officer then questioned me as to how I arrived into Singapore. I told him that I drove my car into Singapore. I then led the officers to my car. On our arrival, all of us alighted from the car and the officer questioned me as to whether I had anything in the car. 
 I then 
 
 pointed out to the officer where I hid the packet which Dollah had given to me earlier 
. The officer then used my keys and unlocked the left front side of my car. The officer then removed the packet from under the dashboard beneath the glove compartment. The officer then questioned me as to the contents of the packet. I replied that I did not know the contents. Then the officer removed the plastic bag and in it was a packet wrapped with newsprint. The officer removed the newsprint and in it was another plastic packet containing brownish substances. The officer then told me that it is `dadah`. I remained silent and looked at Dollah who was standing next to me. Dollah, on seeing me, looked down. [Emphasis added.] 
 
The above statement was read over, explained and interpreted to me in Malay. I affirm it true, correct and voluntarily given.

Soon after my arrest I was brought to a police station and in my presence the officers searched my car. The officers seized the ROV entry permit and the carpark coupon from my car. The officer also seized the tape which I had used to tape the packet of `dadah`. I obtained this tape from the hospital where I worked. I obtained this tape from the hospital many months ago. Later the officers weighed the packet of `dadah` in our presence.
The next day, 22 March 1990, I was charged in court together with Dollah and Rahman. In court, Dollah told me to admit that the packet of `dadah` belonged to me. I refused to admit to this fact. The truth is that he is the person who handed me this packet of `dadah`. However I was not aware of the contents when he handed to me the packet.
Dollah owns a motor car. It is a Proton Saga black in colour. I think the registration number is JBW 9947 or 9974. His car met with an accident and I believe the car is now undergoing repairs. Most of my working colleagues are aware of the fact that Dollah`s car met with an accident.
Rahman is the owner of motorcar JBP 3885. When I arrived at the coffeestall at the Woodlands Food Centre, I met Dollah. Dollah then told me that Rahman will collect the packet from me. Rahman is also the owner of another motor van. It is a passenger van and I think the number is JB 1177 or 7117. I believe it is a Mitsubishi make. This van is being hired out by Rahman.
This is the first time that Dollah has approached me to smuggle something into Singapore. I needed the money badly and as such I performed the task for him. I knew that it was something illegal but I did not know that it was `dadah`.

Though Rahman has been my colleague for the last ten years, I seldom associate with him. Only on occasions I met him at the hospital. As for Dollah he is close to me as we worked in the same unit at the hospital. On occasions he will pay other hospital staff to work for him. He is also my immediate neighbour. He is staying at house No 27 and I stay at house No 29. After Dollah met with the traffic accident, his car was badly damaged. Since then I have on many occasions seen Dollah driving Rahman`s car, the Proton Saga JBP 3885 or his van JB 1177 or 7117. On occasions, before I left my home for work, I also saw the vehicles parked outside Dollah`s house at Ulu Tiram. To my knowledge, Dollah is very close to Rahman. The hospital staff is also aware that Dollah and Rahman are the best of friends.
My wife, Rahemah bte Jaafar, is working as a hospital attendant in the Sultanah Aminah Hospital. We have two daughters aged five and three, and a son aged four.
Yesterday at the court lockup, Dollah and Rahman spoke to me asking me not to implicate them by saying that the drugs belonged to them. Both of them further promised me that if I admit that the drugs belonged to me they will ensure that my family is well taken care of by them. I remained silent and refused to talk to them. This is the first time that Rahman has spoken to me asking me not to implicate him by saying that the drugs belonged to him. I do not know why he is now seeking my help.

 Defence submission of no case to answer
 
First accused
At the close of the prosecution`s case, submissions were made by both counsel that no case had been made out against the accused persons. The issue common to all the three accused persons pertained to the identity of the drugs. In this regard, the submission by counsel for the first accused, (with which counsel for the second and third accused persons fully associated themselves) was that the substance seized from motor vehicle NL 4807 on 21 March 1990 at the car park at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road, was not the substance which was sent to the DSS for analysis. As regards the second and third accused, another substantial submission by their counsel was based on the effect of s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). It was contended by counsel that the three statements (exhs P-39A, P-39B and P-39C) made by the first accused and admitted in evidence, were not evidence against the second and third accused persons. Additionally, counsel (for the second and third accused) contended that Singapore courts had no jurisdiction to try issues relating to abetment if such abetment took place in West Malaysia.
The threshold questions the court had to answer at this stage were: (a) whether the substance seized from motor vehicle NL 4807 was the very same substance that was analyzed by Dr Lee and (b) whether the prosecution had established (even at this stage) the link in the chain of evidence vis a vis the seized substance.
Counsel for the first accused highlighted a number of discrepancies as to the weight, colour and form of the seized exhibit in the evidence of various prosecution witnesses. The salient points of his submission were as follows.
 Weight
Dr Lee found the net weight of the substance delivered to him to be 449.1g (exh P-1) whereas SNO Chew`s evidence was that the substance including the weight of the plastic bag was 425.5g. The weight, ie 449.1g, obtained by Dr Lee (without the plastic covering of the packet) when juxtaposed with SNO Chew`s weight of 425.5g (including the plastic bag) tended to throw a serious doubt on the prosecution case. SNO Chew said that the weighing machine he used was not calibrated. However, the type of weighing machine with a needle allegedly used by SNO Chew would not have indicated a decimal sum of .5g. In this regard, the court`s attention was invited to one such specimen weighing scale with a needle (exh D-9). The evidence of Inspector Ho and the computer printout which he produced showed that the packet (exh P-40) weighed approximately 600g. The varying weights: viz 600g in the computer printout; 425.5g obtained by SNO Chew and the weight of 449.1g obtained by Dr Lee, made the prosecution`s evidence greatly suspect.
 Colour
Even as respects the colour of the seized item, there was a great deal of uncertainty between various crucial prosecution witnesses. The following should be considered: 
 
 
(a) Dr Lee testified that the substance which he had examined was greyish whereas SNO Chew who testified after Dr Lee said initially that the substance was of a `more to greyish or very light brownish` colour. He also said that grey was the more dominant colour. 
 
(b) When cross-examined as to why then, in the initial charge which he had framed and served on the accused persons, the substance was described as brownish, SNO Chew explained that the word `brownish` was already in his computer disk and that he had overlooked amending that word. 
 
(c) However on the label of exh P-40 which SNO Chew had prepared on the day the substance was seized, he had again described the colour of the substance as `brownish`. 
 
(d) Towards the end of his cross-examination, SNO Chew said that on the day of seizure, the substance had appeared brownish. However when asked why in the circumstances he attempted to lay the blame on the computer, SNO Chew was unable to come up with an explanation. 
 
(e) Inspector Ho, the storekeeper, testified in examination-in-chief that the packet contained a brownish substance. 
 
(f) In the statement which SNO Chew had recorded from the first accused, the substance was again described as brownish.
  
 
 
 
 Form
 
As to the form of the substance seized, there was considerable variance in the prosecution`s evidence which rendered it unsatisfactory, and a serious question mark arose as to whether the substance seized was the substance which was in fact analyzed. The following aspects were accentuated: 
 
 
(a) Photographs P-18 and P-19 show the substance to be in lumps. 
 
(b) Dr Lee in his conditioned statement (PS-1) described the substance as powdery. In his examination-in-chief, he described on two occasions the substance as being powdery and also claimed that his notes indicated that the substance was powdery. 
 
(c) However when recalled, Dr Lee claimed that on all these occasions he had erred. He said that the substance was granular and not powdery. He had used the word granular in his certificate (exh P-1).
  
 
 
Counsel for the first accused after underscoring the several inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the weight, colour and form of the exhibit, submitted that the evidence adduced by the prosecution had been so discredited as a result of cross-examination and so manifestly unreliable, that the defence of the first accused should not be called. In this regard, he invited the court to the principles enunciated in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  the observations of this court in 
PP v Wong Wai Hung & Anor
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 927
  and Lord Parker CJ`s Practice Note published in [1962] 1 All ER 448. Counsel also referred the court to a number of Malaysian decisions where the Supreme Court of Malaysia was robust in finding in favour of the accused persons when there was some break in the chain of the evidence.
 Second accused
As respects the second accused, counsel for the second accused after fully associating himself with the submissions made by counsel for the first accused on the issue relating to the identity of drugs, contended that courts in Singapore had no jurisdiction to try a charge of abetment if the abetment took place in West Malaysia.
Counsel for the second accused said that save for the inadmissible statements of the first accused which implicated the second accused, the only evidence which emerged thus far against the second accused was: (a) the second accused was present with the first accused at a coffee stall at the Woodlands Food Centre; and (b) when NO Raziff questioned the first accused about the plastic packet found under the dashboard of motor vehicle NL 4807, the first accused remained silent and looked at the second accused.
It was contended by counsel for the second accused that the statement of the first accused whilst it was evidence against the first accused, was not evidence against the co-accused persons by virtue of several decided cases in Singapore and elsewhere. In this respect, reference was made to s 30 of the Evidence Act and the principles stated in 
PP v Neoh Bean Chye & Anor
 
 
[1975] 1 MLJ 3
  
Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  and 
Bhuboni Sahu v R
 
[1949] AIR 36 PC 257
 Counsel submitted that since the statement of the first accused was not evidence against the second accused, the rest of the peripheral evidence such as: (a) being present at Woodlands at a coffee stall with the first accused; and (b) the first accused looking at the second accused when questioned, was insufficient to warrant the defence of the second accused being called. He urged the court to acquit the second accused since the prosecution had failed to establish all the ingredients of the charge made against him.
 Third accused
As regards the third accused, counsel`s main submission was that except for certain hearsays in the statement of the first accused, there was no evidence whatsoever to link him to the charge preferred against him.
 Prosecution reply
The learned DPP submitted that the prosecution had established each essential element of the respective charges against the accused persons. He added that the duty of the trial court at this stage was to consider whether there was some evidence not inherently incredible which if the court were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element of the alleged offence and the judge as a decider of fact, must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution witnesses. He then referred to the arrest of the three accused persons at Woodlands Centre Road, the seizure of the packet which contained the drugs, the certificate issued by the DSS stating that the packet seized contained not less than 76.3g of diamorphine, the conduct of the first accused when questioned about the contents of the plastic packets seized, his oral admission that the packet contained `dadah`, the first accused turning and looking at the second accused when questioned, the co-incidence of all three accused persons absenting themselves from their place of work and being found at the Woodlands Food Centre and above all the three long statements of the first accused where he implicated the second accused and in some respects, the third accused. He submitted that the cumulative effect of the various pieces of evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that the three accused persons had committed the offences with which they had been charged.
 Ruling
Until the tumultous and excited entry of 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  into the judicial milieu in Singapore in 1981, it was thought, albeit erroneously, that at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case, the prosecution had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The principles enunciated by Lord Diplock in 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  require no repetition. However in this context it may be useful if reference be made to the observations of LP Thean J in 
Sim Ah Cheoh
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  at pp 358-359. He said: 
 
In a criminal trial there are two critical stages at which the court has to make a decision. Under s 189(1) of the CPC, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the court has to decide whether the prosecution has made out a case, which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the accused. In deciding this question or issue, the court ought not to consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. ...
 
 
 
At that stage, what the court has to decide is whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If the court so decides that each essential element in the alleged offence has been established, he must call for the defence. At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence. After the defence has been called and evidence, if any, of the accused and other witnesses has been tendered and counsel for both sides have made their respective closing submissions, the court must, at that stage, proceed to examine the evidence adduced, assess the veracity and accuracy thereof and consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
Bearing those precepts and principles in mind, I considered the various issues raised by counsel for the three accused persons.
Counsel for the first accused (no doubt joined by counsel for the second and third accused) made a spirited attack on the prosecution evidence as to the identity of the drug seized and analyzed. He had highlighted and tabulated the discrepancies on the colour, weight and form of the exhibit. He recited to the court a number of Malaysian decisions: 
Yeong Kia Heng Iwn PR
 
 
[1992] 1 MLJ 327
  
Lee Chee Meng v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 MLJ 322
  
Mohd Osman bin Pawan v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 110
  and 
Pavone v PP (No 2)
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 423
  all of which deal with the aspect of the chain of evidence in drug trafficking cases in Malaysia.
In 
Yeong Kia Heng
 
 
[1992] 1 MLJ 327
  Gunn Chit Tuan SCJ (as he then was), in allowing the appeal and reversing the decision of the trial judge, said that there existed a serious doubt as to the identity of the case exhibits. The discrepancy in that case concerned the substance described as pink-coloured lumps by one of the prosecution witnesses as against the testimony of the chemist who said that he had received red-coloured powdered substance. The court found that to be unsatisfactory and held that the defence of the accused should not have been called.
In 
Lee Chee Meng
 
 
[1992] 1 MLJ 322
  again Gunn Chit Tuan SCJ (as he then was) set aside the conviction of the accused person as there was a contradiction as respects the number of packets; whether it was 76, 61 or 64 packets of the substance seized, and noting some other unsatisfactory features in the prosecution case.
In 
Mohd Osman bin Pawan
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 110
  there was also a discrepancy in relation to the number of packages. The Superintendent of Customs claimed that he received altogether 4,300 rolls of cannabis, whereas the chemist maintained that he received 3,997 rolls of plant material plus another 299 rolls. The Supreme Court, noting the shoddy manner with which the exhibits were kept in the customs strong-room, the fact that they were not labelled until two days later, and the four missing rolls, agreed with the defence submission that possibly different exhibits were sent for analysis and so allowed the appeal.
Relying on the foregoing decisions and a few others, both counsel argued that the discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly in relation to the seized drugs, rendered the whole prosecution case manifestly unreliable. The main thrust of the defence contention was that the prosecution had not satisfactorily established the chain of evidence and that the drug analyzed by the scientific officer might not have been the drug seized by the CNB on 21 March 1990.
Counsel for the first accused laid out before the court an array of inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses with much industry. There were indeed some unsatisfactory features. The criticisms mounted against the CNB, particularly SNO Chew, Dr Lee and NO Ng were to a certain extent not without merit. To support his arguments, counsel for the first accused invited the court`s attention to a number of decisions from the Malaysian Supreme Court. I carefully considered counsel`s arguments. There was however one distinct feature with a consistent hue which did not escape the court`s attention. That was the inscription `Toyota` on a label prepared and pasted on the packet by SNO Chew when he weighed the packet of drugs in the presence of the accused persons. Dr Lee testified that he analyzed the packet which bore the label `Toyota` with a CNB serial number on it.
The cases referred to the court by counsel did not seem to have such a distinctive `label factor` to contend with. In my view, the approach to be adopted is a broad and commonsense one. In 
Namasiyiam & Ors v PP
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 336
  there was a period of three days where the drugs were unaccounted for. Evidence was led to show that the investigating officer of the case had handed the drugs to the deputy superintendent and saw the latter put the drugs into the safe. The deputy superintendent however, died before the trial. The appellants argued that as the deputy superintendent had not been called, there was a break in the chain of possession and this raised a serious doubt in the prosecution`s case.
The appeal court held that a lack of direct evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the drugs were the same ones sent to the chemist. It was sufficient that the police officer who had seized the drugs had marked them and these markings were confirmed by the investigating officer and the chemist as being the same markings. The appeal court was satisfied that notwithstanding the fact that the deputy superintendent could not give evidence, there was sufficient evidence in the movements of the exhibits adduced by the prosecution to show that there was no break in the chain of evidence affecting proof as to the identity of exhibits.
In the circumstances, without attaching any veracity tab to any of the prosecution witnesses, I formed the view, albeit provisionally, that whatever the misdescriptions and errors as to colour, form and weight, these did not render the prosecution evidence as respects exh P-40 inherently incredible. There was, in my view, prima facie evidence that the drugs seized from the vehicle NL 4807 on the morning of 21 November 1991 was the drug which was analyzed and for which Dr Lee had issued the certificate (exh P-1).
Having arrived at a provisional view as to the identity of the drugs, I next considered the prosecution`s other evidence against the first accused, viz his three long statements and his alleged oral admission that the substance found in his car was `dadah`. In the long statements, the first accused admitted to his transporting the prohibited substance into Singapore save that he was not aware that it was heroin. Having considered the relevant prosecution evidence which in my view was not inherently incredible, I was satisfied that the prosecution had made out a case against the first accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. In the result his defence was called and the two courses available were explained to him. He elected to give evidence on affirmation.
As regards the second accused, besides the issue concerning the identity of drugs, which has already been dealt with, the second contention by counsel for the second accused was based on jurisdiction. The crux of his submission was that since the charge included an averment that the abetment took place in Malaysia, courts in Singapore had no jurisdiction to try this matter. In 
R v Brisac and Scott
 
[1803] 4 East 164
[] 102 ER 794
 the court in England had to deal with the question as respects jurisdiction in conspiracy. The court held that although the agreement was made at a place outside the jurisdiction of the common law courts, it was yet triable in the ordinary criminal courts in England if an overt act in execution of it was done in England and that an act done in England by an innocent agent of one of the conspirators was the act of the conspirators for this purpose. (See also 
 The Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements 
 (1980) by RS Wright, at p 73.)
An act of abetment, be it by conspiracy or by aid, could be a continuing one. The presence of the second accused in Singapore where the actual offence was said to have taken place, clearly neutralized counsel`s submission on the issue of jurisdiction. In the context of the charge where the averment expressly included an act of abetment in Singapore and elsewhere in West Malaysia and the prima facie evidence adduced by the prosecution showed the execution of the acts to be in Singapore, I held that the submissions of counsel for the second accused on the issue of jurisdiction were devoid of merit.
Touching upon the remaining issue concerning the long statements of the first accused, counsel for the second accused contended that they were not, in law, evidence against either the second accused (or for that matter against the third accused). Since substantial arguments were advanced by counsel as to the effect of s 30 of the Evidence Act, it would be useful to refer to some learning in this regard. Section 30 of the Evidence Act reads: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
The two celebrated cases on s 30 are 
Bhuboni Sahu
 
[1949] AIR 36 PC 257
 and 
Kashmira Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh
 
[1952] SC 56
 Section 30 was also considered at length by the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Sim Ah Cheoh
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  LP Thean J, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, made the following observations at p 357: 
 
This section is in pari materia with s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, and it has been decided in a series of Indian cases that under that section, a confession of an accused implicating himself and his co-accused may be taken into consideration along with other evidence and a conviction based only on such confession cannot stand. These cases have thus given a narrow construction to the words `may take into consideration` in that section. Counsel referred us to numerous cases, among which were: 
 Bhuboni Sahu
 
 v
 
 R
 and 
 Kashmira Singh
 
 v
 
 State of Madhya Pradesh
. In 
 Bhuboni Sahu
, which was an appeal to the Privy Council, the evidence consisted of mainly the confession of a co-accused which implicated the co-accused and the appellant, and the Privy Council held, among other things, that this confession was not sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellant of murder and the conviction was set aside. Sir John Beaumont in delivering the judgment of the Board said, at p 260:
 
 
 
`Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the defnition of `evidence` contained in s [3], Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, make it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. The Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most of the High Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction, is correct.`
 
 
 
In 
 Kashmira Singh
, the Supreme Court of India held that the evidence for the conviction of the accused of murder, which was based substantially on the evidence of a confession of a co-accused implicating himself and the accused, was insufficient and set aside the conviction of murder. Vivian Bose J said, at pp 529-530:
 
 
 
`In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in 
 Emperor
 
 v
 
 Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty
 [1911] ILR 38 Cal 559 at p 588 where he said that such a confession can only be used to ""lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused"" or, to put it in another way, as Reilly J did in 
 Re Periyaswami Moopan
 [1931] ILR 54 Mad 75 at 77:""the provision goes no further than this - where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in s 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence"".
 
 
 
Translating these observations into concrete terms, they come to this. The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, 
 if it is believed 
, a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, 
 if believed 
, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.`
It must be noted that the narrow construction enunciated in 
Kashmira Singh
 
[1952] SC 56
 had not been followed by other Indian decisions. In 
R v Sadasibo Majhi & Ors
 
[1939] Patna 35
 it was held that the confession of a co-accused is sufficient, if corroborated by evidence from other sources, but it is not necessary that such corroborative evidence should by itself be sufficient to support the evidence. Whether corroboration is sufficient must depend on the nature of each particular case.
Reverting to 
Sim Ah Cheoh
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  the observations of LP Thean J on the interpretation of s 30 were obiterobiter. This was made clear by LP Thean J himself in 
Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
  where he said at pp 22-23: 
 
... In

 this court in obiter said that these cases are undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 and expressed agreement with those decisions. ...
 
 
 
This court has not been invited to consider afresh the question of the proper construction of s 30 of the Evidence Act and for the purpose of this appeal would accept the construction of this provision as decided by the authorities as correct, as such construction operates in favour of the defence.
For the sake of completeness, it must be mentioned that the foregoing observations were not available to me at the time when the issues in this case were decided.
Having regard to the state of law since 
Haw Tua Tau
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  the question the court had to ask itself at the halfway house was whether the court could rely on the confession of a co-accused to call the defence of the second accused - particularly in a charge of abetment by conspiracy - bearing in mind that conspiracy in almost all cases would have to be deduced from circumstances. There is not much case law on this issue. However the authors of 
 Cross 
 
 on Evidence 
 (3rd Australian Ed, para 17:113) express the view that the admissions of one conspirator are receivable against the other if they relate to an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy, but not otherwise.
In the Malaysian case of 
Indran & Anor v PP
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 408
  Peh Swee Chin J had to deal with the question as to the nature and quantum of evidence which will enable an inquiring magistrate in a preliminary inquiry to find that there were sufficient grounds for committing an accused for trial to the court of a judge, when the only evidence against the accused was from the cautioned statements of other accused persons.
In that case, the applicants had been committed for trial on a charge of murder. The only evidence implicating the applicants came from the respective cautioned statements of two other persons accused in the same case. It was argued that the cautioned statements were exculpating to the makers and did not amount to confessions and that s 30 of the Evidence Act was therefore not applicable. Even if they were confessions and s 30 of the Evidence Act applied, it was argued that on the authority of 
PP v Nordin bin Johan
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  there was no primafacie case for the applicants to be committed for trial. The prosecution submitted that the cautioned statements would form part of the prosecution case and the weight of such evidence would be for the jury and not for the committing magistrate to consider. An appeal by the applicants was dismissed on the ground that the said order of committal was not appealable. The applicants applied for revision.
Peh Swee Chin J held on revision that the test which the magistrate had to apply was whether there were sufficient grounds for committing the accused person for trial. The learned judge held that this meant that the prosecution did not have to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. All the prosecution had to adduce was credible evidence, not inherently improbable, which may result in a conviction. He accordingly held that the cautioned statements of the two co-accused were credible evidence.
I had to consider next a definition point advanced by counsel for the second accused. Counsel argued that in any event the statements of the first accused were not confessions and they being primarily exculpatory statements, could not in law be considered evidence against any co-accused.
It should be remembered that unlike in India, our Evidence Act contains a definition of `confession` under s 17(2) of the Act. It reads: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
The Privy Council in 
Anandagoda v R
 
 [1962] MLJ 289 
 had to deal with the construction of an identical section from the Ceylon Evidence Act. Lord Guest, in delivering the decision of the Board, said at p 291: 
 
... The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts.
 
 
 
... It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial. But equally it is irrelevant to consider whether the accused intended to make a confession. If the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence then it is nonetheless a confession even although the accused at the same time protests his innocence. ... If any admission by an accused of a relevant fact or fact in issue is to be inadmissible then it is difficult to understand why the legislature qualified `confession` in s 17(2) as being a statement of the commission of an offence or a statement suggesting the inference of the commission of an offence. It would have been a simple matter to make all admissions by accused persons inadmissible in evidence. The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt? A useful definition of a `confession` is to be found in 
 Wigmore`s 
 
 Law of Evidence 
 (America) I s 821, p 930, quoting from a judgment of Wolverton J in 
 State 
 
 v Porter 
: 
 
`We take it that the admission of a fact, or of a bundle of facts, from which guilt is directly deducible, or which within and of themselves import guilt, may be denominated a confession, but not so with the admission of a particular act or acts or circumstances which may or may not involve guilt, and which is dependent for such result upon other facts or circumstances to be established. It is not necessary that there be a declaration of an intent to admit guilt; it is sufficient that the facts admitted involve a crime, and these import guilt, or, as put by Mr Wharton, "" `I am guilty of this`; and this imports the admission of all the acts constituting guilt."" It is necessary, however, that the accused should speak with an 
 animus confitendi
, or an intention to speak the truth touching the specific charge of guilt; and when he, with such intention, narrates facts constituting a crime, the guilt becomes matter of inference, a resultant feature of the narration without an explicit declaration to that effect. So that we conclude that whenever the statements or declarations of the accused, voluntarily made, are of such facts as involve necessarily the commission of a crime, or in themselves constitute a crime, then the facts admitted import guilt, and such admissions may properly be denominated confessions.`
 
 
 
In the case at hand, the first accused admitted in his statements (para 4 of exh P-39A and para 13 of exh P-39B) that he did smuggle a packet into Singapore from Johore Bahru, hidden under the dashboard of his car. He said he knew that he was smuggling something illegal though he did not know that the thing was `dadah`.
What does the word `confession` denote? 
 Wigmore 
`s definition of confession was approved in 
 Anandagoda 
:17 
 
... whenever the statements or declarations of the accused, voluntarily made, are of such facts as involve necessarily the commission of a crime, or in themselves constitute a crime, then the facts admitted import guilt and such admissions may be properly denominated confessions.
 
 
 
In my view, what s 17(2) purports to import and what 
Anandagoda
 
 [1962] MLJ 289 
 purports to signify is that a confession need not be an unqualified expression of guilt. Under our law, it is no more than a person`s statement admitting to his involvement in the offence charged in any manner or form. Be it minor or major, direct or indirect, explicit or inferential and whether in exculpation or in earnest, irrespective of its object, so long as the statement connects the accused in some way with the offence charged, it would be deemed a confession under s 17(2).
Leaving aside all extrinsic factors, the admissions by the first accused in his long statements were by themselves indicative of his involvement in the offence for which he had been charged. The statements of the first accused in the context of the charge suggested an inference that he committed the offence - though in the same breath he protested his innocence. As stated in 
Anandagoda
 
 [1962] MLJ 289 
 if the facts in the statement added together suggest the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence, then it is nonetheless a confession even though the accused at the same time protests his innocence. I will revert to the issues concerning the second accused after I have dealt with the evidence and my ruling relating to the third accused.
Now moving on to the third accused, except for the fact he was arrested, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to the offence for which he was charged. All the long statements put together did not in any way directly implicate the third accused. The first accused had not linked the third accused with conspiracy or abetment of any sort. Parts of his statement which seemed to give the impression that the third accused could be involved in this matter were hearsay. In para 7 of exh P-39A, the first accused said: ` 
 I then sat next to him 
 [second accused] 
 and asked him,"" how is it?"", and Dollah 
 [second accused] 
 replied that later Rahman 
 [third accused] 
 will collect the packet from my car 
.` [Emphasis is mine.] The foregoing statement as could be seen, was irrefutably hearsay and not within the knowledge of the first accused. At best, it meant that the first accused was told by the second accused that the packet would be collected by the third accused. There was however no suggestion in that statement that the third accused was party to the transaction or that he knew of the packet.
Later in para 16 of exh P-39C, the first accused said that on 29 March 1990 when he was at the court lock-up, the second and third accused spoke to him and asked him not to implicate them and that both persons further promised him that if the first accused were to admit that the drugs belonged to him, they would ensure the welfare of his family. Again in my view this did not in any way link the third accused to the averments in the charge preferred against him, ie acts of abetment on 20 and 21 March 1990. The prosecution`s case against the third accused was further nullified by the very last two sentences in para 16 of exh P-39C by the first accused where he had said: ` 
 This is the first time that Rahman had spoken to me asking me not to implicate that the drug belonged to him. I do not know why he is now seeking my help 
.` [Emphasis added.] This was yet another clear indication that there was nothing between the first and the third accused prior to 29 March 1990 - the date on which the statement (exh P-39C) was recorded.
In the circumstances, I formed the view at the close of the prosecution case, that the prosecution had failed to establish each essential element of the alleged offence against the third accused. It appeared to me that the case against the third accused was built on conjectures and unsatisfactory hearsay. In the event, the third accused was acquitted of the charge and the said order of acquittal had not been appealed against by the public prosecutor.
Reverting now to the second accused, it should be borne in mind that conspiracy is almost difficult to prove by direct evidence. In so far as proof goes, as Grose J said at p 171 in 
Brisac
 
[1803] 4 East 164
[] 102 ER 794
 it is generally `... a matter of inference, deduced from certain criminal acts of the parties accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them, ...`.
The prima facie evidence adduced by the prosecution was to the effect that the first accused was caught with possession of the drugs transported by him in his vehicle NL 4807 from Johore Bahru to Singapore. The second accused who was supposed to be at work at the material time was found with the first accused at a coffee stall near where the vehicle with the offending substance was seized. The evidence of Abdul Hamid was that insofar as the second accused was concerned, he disappeared after tea break though he was given leave only for the afternoon of 21 March 1990. Bearing in mind that the prosecution`s case against the second accused was one of abetment by conspiracy (where direct evidence would be rare and uncommon), and having considered the 
 net of circumstantial evidence first 
 and juxtaposing it with the statements of the first accused which incriminated him and the second accused, I was satisfied that the prosecution had established all the ingredients of the charge against the second accused (except for a need to omit references in the said charge to the third accused who had been acquitted).
I therefore held that a case had been made out against the second accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. Since the third accused had been acquitted, the original charge against the second accused was amended to omit references to the third accused.
The amended charge against the second accused reads as follows: 
 
You, Abdullah bin A Rahman on or about 21 March 1990, in Singapore and elsewhere in West Malaysia, did abet one Ab Rashid bin Mohamed in the commission of an offence of trafficking in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Sch to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), when he transported a packet of drugs containing not less than 76.3g of diamorphine from Woodlands Checkpoint to the car park at Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road in motor car NL 4807 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
The amended charge was read and explained to the second accused and he was extended the opportunity to recall any of the prosecution witnesses and make submissions thereon. In the event he was called upon to enter his defence. The two courses available were explained to him and the second accused too elected to give evidence on affirmation.
 Defence of the first accused
The evidence of the first accused was as follows. He was, prior to his arrest, employed as a hospital attendant at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johore Bahru. The second accused was his colleague at the hospital. They were neighbours.
A week prior to 21 March 1990, ie the date of his arrest, he approached the second accused for a loan of $500 for the purposes of meeting his instalment payment for his car and house rent. The second accused told him that he had no money and suggested that the first accused do some work for the second accused, ie to bring something into Singapore by avoiding customs duty. The second accused was not very specific about the details except that he told the first accused that the first accused would receive the loan of $500 and a further sum of $1,000 for the job the first accused was going to perform.
On 20 March 1990, a day before his arrest when the first accused met the second accused, he was told to meet the second accused at about 7am the following day at the jogging track at Pantai Lido, Johore Bahru.
Accordingly, sometime past 7am on 21 March 1990, the first accused drove his car NL 4807 and arrived at Pantai Lido for the appointment. Shortly thereafter, the second accused who was alone, arrived in motor vehicle JBP 3885. He had a package with him which he handed to the first accused and instructed him to hide and tie the said package under the dashboard of motor vehicle NL 4807. As the second accused could not find any strings, he used the roll of tape which he found at the boot of his car to fasten the package beneath the dashboard of his car. Before the fastening of the package, the first accused tried to open the package and whilst he was at it, he saw that there was another packet inside the package. The second accused intervened at that juncture and told him to hurry up as it was getting late for work. The first accused was supposed to report for duty at the hospital at 8am.
After the package was thus hidden under the dashboard of the car, the second accused told the first accused to drive the car to Singapore at 10am during the first accused`s tea break at the hospital. The first accused was advised that the second accused would wait for him at the Woodlands Food Centre near the car park where there was a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet from where he would collect the packet.
The first accused then reported for work and when it was time for his tea break, he set off in his car to Singapore between 10am and 10.15am.
When the first accused arrived at the car park as specified by the second accused, he could not locate the second accused. He therefore parked his car at the car park, placed a parking coupon, locked his car and went to look for the second accused. Eventually the first accused found the second accused at the food centre seated at a table near a staircase. The first accused joined the second accused at the table where he was told by the second accused that the third accused had gone to vehicle NL 4807 to take the package from underneath the dashboard. Just about that time, a team of police officers came to the table where the two were seated and arrested them. Before they were arrested, the first accused did not see the third accused at the car park near Woodlands Food Centre or in its vicinity.
Subsequent to their arrest, whilst the two accused persons were brought to the car park near the food centre, the first accused saw the third accused also in handcuffs. He was then taken away in a police car accompanied by the arresting team. Whilst in the car, NO Raziff translated certain questions put to the first accused by SNO Chew. The first accused intimated to NO Raziff that he came to Singapore in his motor vehicle. He was eventually searched and a bunch of keys were recovered from his trouser pocket.
The first accused told the officers that he had parked his car NL 4807 at the car park near where he was arrested. He was consequently brought to his vehicle. SNO Chew then led him to the left side of the vehicle and asked him: `Ada barang?`. The first accused responded by moving his head in the direction of the front part of the car. In the event, the thing hidden under the dashboard of the car was removed and SNO Chew asked the first accused what it was. The first accused said that he did not know what it was. SNO Chew then unwrapped the package and asked him again in Malay: `Apa ini?` meaning `What is this?` and the first accused replied that he did not know.
The first accused said that it was at this stage that NO Raziff told him that the thing was `dadah`. Upon hearing that, the first accused turned to the left in the direction of the second accused who was then looking downwards and not at him. He claimed that he did not utter the word `dadah` nor whisper the word to anyone. He testified further that when the packet was opened, it was in pellet form and brownish in colour.
Subsequently, the first accused was taken to the CNB headquarters where the substance seized was weighed in his presence by SNO Chew. At the time of the weighing, SNO Chew, the three accused persons and a woman constable were present. The weighing machine showed `425 point something` but he could not see the decimal point. The machine used for the weighing was a digital one without needles, such as the type used by goldsmiths.
The first accused was extensively cross-examined by counsel for the second accused.
The first accused confirmed that he was the neighbour of the second accused. Referring to the third accused, he said that though he had met the third accused on occasions, he did not see him at all on the morning of 20 March 1991 prior to his arrest. He clarified that when he heard the second accused telling him that the third accused had gone to the car, he understood it to mean that the first accused should return to his car and hand over the keys and the packet to the third accused. He maintained that the second accused did give the package to him to hide. When the second accused told him that it was not dangerous to transport the package, the first accused trusted him. He claimed that he had full faith in the second accused. According to him, the second accused explained to him that if the customs officials were to discover the package, they would only confiscate the package. The second accused assured the first accused that he would not lose his job in the event of his being caught. Since he had full faith in the second accused, he did not examine the packet.
When asked whether he was admitting to the charge, he said that he did not admit to the offence and when questioned why he had dragged in the second accused and was blaming him for the offence, he replied (p 956 of the verbatim notes): ` 
 I am bringing Dollah 
 [second accused] 
 into the picture because he is connected to this event. As I said, he was the one who told me to carry his package. On the other hand, I am pushing the blame on him because I did not know the contents of the package handed to me by him. 
` When questioned if he was blaming the third accused in connection with this offence, he said: ` 
 No, I am not blaming Rahman 
 [third accused] 
 because earlier he had no connection at all. 
` (p 956 of the verbatim notes).
Counsel also took the first accused through his long statements in order to highlight to the court the discrepancies between his oral evidence and his statements. Finally, it was put to the first accused that the second accused had nothing to do with the first accused bringing drugs into Singapore. The first accused maintained (p 1014 of the verbatim notes): `As far as the drugs are concerned, I don`t know. But what I am telling the court is that Dollah [second accused] told me to bring the thing into Singapore.` By and large, he stood by his original story that the second accused was the one who made him carry the drugs into Singapore and that he did not know of its contents. He asserted that he had no dealings with the third accused and the transaction was all along between the second accused and himself.
When cross-examined by the DPP, the first accused mentioned that he had been a hospital attendant at Sultanah Aminah Hospital for about ten years prior to 21 March 1990. The second accused was at that time already working at the hospital. He became his neighbour a few months after 1986 and their families were close to each other. The first and second accused were quite close and had attended religous classes together. There was mutual trust between them.
A substantial part of the cross-examination centred on the learned DPP putting the case to him and in particular, his purported admission to the CNB officers that it was `dadah` that was in the packet. The first accused denied that he made such an admission.
 Defence of the second accused
The second accused`s evidence could be summarized as follows. He had been working as a hospital attendant at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital, Johore Bahru, for about 15 years prior to his arrest. Though he is married with three children, he went to Batam quite often as he had a second wife there and a son through her. He usually visited Batam on Wednesdays at 8am and would return by the last boat which left Batam at 5pm on Fridays. The usual weekend holidays for workers at the hospital were half a day on Thursdays and a full day on Fridays.
On 21 March 1990, he woke up at 6.15am and after his normal routine, he sent his children to school. He left home at 6.45am. On that day, he had the use of the car of the third accused JBP 3885 since his own car had been involved in an accident. Later, at about 7.15am, he arrived at the hospital canteen where he awaited the arrival of the third accused. He had made a prior arrangement with the third accused to send him to Finger Pier, Singapore, on that day. The third accused arrived at about 8am. The second accused was supposed to be working that day. However he had made some arrangements whereby one Man bin Said would stand in for him. Such a practice known as `ganti`, though not encouraged in the hospital, had been commonplace.
When the third accused arrived, and after he had some food at the canteen, both of them left for Johore Bahru. The vehicle was driven by the third accused. They first went to a workshop at Jalan Lumba Kuda where the car of the second accused was undergoing repairs.
He did not meet the first accused at all on the day in question at the hospital or at Pantai Lido as claimed by the first accused. Prior to 21 March 1990, he had met the first accused only on 13 March 1990 and had not met him since then. He denied asking the first accused at any time to perform any job of any nature on 21 March 1990. He added that the first accused had been his immediate neighbour for four years and they shared a common wall.
After visiting the workshop, both the second and third accused left for Singapore. Sometime past 9am they arrived in Singapore and the car was parked at Blk 2A Woodlands Centre Road. The second accused then decided to go shopping for some ladies` materials. The second and the third accused had arranged between themselves that after they had done their respective shopping separately, they would return to the car. The second accused, therefore, did the shopping himself and bought the materials he wanted. During shopping, he met the third accused again. Thereafter they walked together to a coffee stall. Whilst at the coffee stall, the third accused reminded the second accused about his mentioning buying a T-shirt. Since the second accused was tired, he asked the third accused to drive the car to the front of the shop that sold T-shirts. The third accused presently left. After the third accused had left, the first accused arrived and asked the second accused: `Are you not working?` and sat down at the table where the second accused was. Immediately thereafter, six persons identifying themselves as police officers appeared.
One of the police officers pointed to a bag the second accused had with him and asked whose bag it was. After being told that it belonged to the second accused, the officers searched the bag. The second accused was surprised and asked the officer: `What happened?` to which the officer replied: `Don`t talk much. Just follow.` Both the first and second accused were handcuffed by the officers. Thereafter the second accused was taken in a car and driven in the direction of Woodlands Checkpoint. But midway he was driven back to the car park opposite Blk 4A Woodlands Centre Road. At the said car park, the second accused saw the first accused but did not see the third accused. There he saw one police officer holding the first accused by his shirt collar. At the car park, the second accused was made to turn away from the first accused. He was told by the CNB officers: `Don`t see.` After that he did not know what actually happened at the car park. Subsequently he was taken to Woodlands Checkpoint and thence to the Central Police Station.
After his arrival at the Central Police Station, he was taken to the car park there and made to wait. There he saw the other two accused persons. Later they were all brought to an office where the second accused saw the item in the plastic packet being weighed. SNO Chew weighed `the thing` using a digital weighing machine similar to the ones used in petrol kiosks. The reading showed `425.`. Shortly after that, he gave a statement to Francis Xavier Jeyaraje (PW22) on 21 March 1990. The statement given by him was admitted as exh D-11 and it reads as follows: 
 
I was from Johore Bahru at 9.30am with Abdul Rahman bin Awang who was driving car number JBP 3885. My idea was to ask him to drive me to Finger Pier because I wanted to go to Batam. We stopped at Woodlands for a short while because I wanted to do some shopping. We did our shopping separately. I then went to the hawker centre to get a drink. When I was alone, Abdul Rashid bin Mohamed appeared and sat beside me. I asked him, `how are you?`. Then all of a sudden five or six persons surrounded us and handcuffed us. That is all I have to say.
 
 
 
The substance of the rest of his evidence was that the first accused was not telling the truth and the purpose of the second accused in Singapore that day was to go to Batam to visit his second wife.
When cross-examined by counsel for the first accused, the second accused denied asking the first accused to smuggle anything for him into Singapore. He further denied meeting the first accused at Pantai Lido, Johore Bahru, on the morning of 21 March 1990. He denied offering to pay the first accused up to RM1,000 for the job. He further denied that he informed the first accused that the third accused would collect the package from his car.
When cross-examined by the DPP, he said that on 21 March 1990, he did not request half a day`s leave from Abdul Hamid since he had already arranged with one Misman to stand in for him on a `ganti` basis. He further claimed that prior to 21 March 1990, he saw the first accused only on 13 March 1990 and that he did not know what happened to the first accused between the period 14 and 20 March 1990. He further denied that he saw the recovery of the package from the dashboard of motor vehicle NL 4807 at Woodlands car park. He was extensively cross-examined about the weighing machine on which SNO Chew weighed the substance seized. Apart from seeing the number `425.` displayed in green, he could not remember other details of the machine. He was unable to describe the height, width, length, colour and make of the weighing machine. However, in re-examination he indicated the size of the weighing machine as being 26cm in length and 21cm in width.
 Evidence of Abdul Rahman bin Awang (formerly the third accused)
The third accused (who had been acquitted at the close of the prosecution case) testified on behalf of the second accused. The summary of his evidence is as follows.
He was at the material time an autoclave operator at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital. He had known the second accused for about ten years. Both were working in the same department but at different units. He described the second accused as his good friend. He had also known the first accused for about ten years.
On 21 March 1990, he met the second accused at 8am at the hospital canteen. Prior to that day, the second accused had told him that the second accused would be going to Batam. On 21 March 1990 when they were at the canteen, the second accused asked him to send him to Finger Pier. From about a week prior to 21 March 1990, the second accused had been using the car JBP 3885 belonging to the third accused as the motor car of the second accused had been at the workshop undergoing repairs, having previously met with an accident.
Sometime past 8am that day, they both left the canteen with a view to proceeding to Finger Pier in Singapore. On the way they stopped by the workshop at Jalan Ah Siang, Johore Bahru, to ascertain the status of the vehicle of the second accused. After visiting the workshop, they proceeded straight to Singapore. The third accused was the driver of the vehicle. At 9.30am that morning, they arrived at Singapore immigration.
After clearing immigration and customs, they passed the Woodlands Checkpoint and parked the car at Blk 2A Woodlands Centre Road where they did their shopping separately. When the third accused met the second accused during their shopping, he asked the second accused whether the second accused had any more purchases to make. The second accused replied that he wanted to buy some T-shirts. Eventually whilst both of them were on their way to a drinks stall, the second accused told the third accused that he was tired and wanted the third accused to bring the car near where the drink stalls were situated.
The third accused obliged and left the place to bring the car which was parked behind Blk 2A. However, whilst he was trying to drive his car out, a vehicle came and blocked his path and he was handcuffed by someone. He was eventually brought to the Central Police Station in Singapore where a plastic packet was weighed in his presence by SNO Chew. The weighing was done on an electronic weighing machine which was about 30cm in length, 16cm in height and 21cm in width. He saw numbers appearing on the display and the machine showed the figure `425.`. He had seen similar machines at shopping centres and pawnshops. Subsequently on 21 March 1990 he gave a statement to Francis Xavier Jeyaraje and the statement, at the instance of the defence, was admitted as exh D-12. It reads thus: 
 
On 21 March 1990 at about 10am my friend Abdullah bin A Rahman and I left Johore Bahru with the intention of sending him to Finger Pier before he left for Batam in motor car number JBP 3885. When we reached Woodlands we stopped for a short while to do some shopping separately. Some how or other we met again at the shopping complex at Woodlands. My friend then asked me to bring the car to park it at the car park which is below the complex. He said he could not be bothered to walk to the car. When I reached my car and opened the front door, I started the engine. The car had moved for about five yards or so, then I was arrested. That is all I have to say.
 
 
 
When cross-examined by counsel for the first accused, he claimed that he had never seen the plastic packet before. The packet was photographed at the Central Police Station. He said that the weighing machine SNO Chew used did not have any needles.
At one stage when questioned by the DPP as to what happened after the second accused told him at the hospital canteen that he wanted to go to Batam, he replied: ` 
 Yes, I sent him there to Batam. No, your Honour, I sent him to Finger Pier in Singapore. No, I like to clarify. I did not reach Finger Pier because we were arrested at Woodlands 
.` (p 1191 of the verbatim notes). By and large, his evidence was that he did not know anything about the drugs.

At the close of the case for the defence, counsel for the first accused renewed his earlier submission that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance seized from motor car NL 4807 was the very same substance that was analyzed by Dr Lee.
In this regard, once again he referred to the discrepancies as regards the weight, colour and form of the substance. His submission in this respect could be summarized as follows:
Weight. Dr Lee found the net weight of the substance to be 449.1g whereas SNO Chew found the weight (including the weight of the plastic bag) to be 425.5g. However, Inspector Ho`s record which was based on the case report (exh P-60) indicated that the packet weighed approximately 600g.
Colour. Dr Lee testified that the substance he examined was greyish. To be more precise, his evidence was `more to greyish or very light brownish` colour - grey being the more dominant colour. However the initial charge framed by the CNB showed that the substance was brownish.
Form. Photographs P-18 and P-19 showed the substance to be in lumps whereas Dr Lee in his depositional evidence (PS-1) described the substance as being powdery. However when recalled, he said that the substance was in fact granular and not powdery.
Counsel contended that, additionally, the prosecution by its failure to call the CNB store assistant, had not established a continuous chain of evidence. He submitted that the exh P-40 as tendered in court was in powder form whereas photographs of the substance seized (P-18 and P-19) showed it to be in lumps. He contended that since no evidence was led to explain this patent difference, it could not be said that the substance seized from motor vehicle NL 4807 was in fact the substance produced in court. Counsel urged the court not to take judicial notice of the change the substance might have undergone when being analyzed by the DSS, which might have turned the lumps into a powdery substance. His other submission was that the evidence of Dr Lee stood impeached. He submitted that the first accused should be acquitted of the charge since there was a break in the chain of evidence as respects the substance seized and on account of the various discrepancies adverted to in his submissions.
 Second accused
Counsel for the second accused fully associated himself with counsel for the first accused in regard to the issue concerning the identity of the drugs and the break in the chain of evidence. In addition, he said that there was no direct evidence at the end of the prosecution case against the second accused except for the fact he was seen seated with the first accused at the food stall on the morning of the day of the commission of the offence. He submitted that mere physical presence of the second accused with the first accused should not be held against him. He urged the court to ignore the evidence of NO Raziff who testified that when the first accused was asked by him about the contents of the plastic bag, the first accused remained silent and looked at the second accused who was standing behind him. He also urged the court to disregard both the confession as well as the oral testimony of the first accused implicating the second accused. He invited the court to accept the evidence of the second accused that he was in Singapore for the purpose of visiting his second wife in Batam and that his brief stopover at Woodlands was to enable him to do some shopping and nothing more. He submitted that the account of the first accused connecting the second accused with the parcel was a total fabrication. Counsel submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove abetment by conspiracy on the part of the second accused.
 DPP`s final speech
The DPP in his final speech dealt at length with the issue as to the identity of the drugs and the alleged break in the chain of evidence. The following is an extract from his submissions: 
 
 
(a) The substance was recovered from beneath the dashboard of motor vehicle NL 4807. This exhibit was subsequently seized by SNO Chew and was brought back to the CNB headquarters. 
 
(b) At the CNB headquarters, the exh P-40 was weighed in the presence of all the accused persons. The weight recorded by SNO Chew was 425.5g. SNO Chew testified that he used a machine which had a needle running round a scale. He sealed and marked the exh P-40 as `Toyota` and handed it over to Inspector Ho for safe custody. On 23 March 1990 at about 3.25pm, SNO Chew collected exh P-40 from Inspector Ho. Inspector Ho testified that on 21 March 1990 at about 4.20pm, SNO Chew handed exh P-40 which was marked `Toyota` to him for safe custody. Inspector Ho further testified that on 23 March 1990 at about 3.25pm, he handed over to SNO Chew exh P-40. Inspector Ho produced exh D-13 which was a record of the movement of exh P-40. At about 4.10pm on 23 March 1990, SNO Chew handed over exh P-40 to Dr Lee at the DSS for analysis. 
 
(c) Dr Lee analyzed exh P-40 and found it to weigh 449.1g (net) and that it had a diamorphine content of not less than 76.3g. The analysis was not challenged by counsel. After the analysis, exh P-40 was returned by Dr Lee to SNO Chew on 23 June 1990. 
 
(d) Inspector Ho gave evidence that exh P-40 was then returned to the CNB storeroom by SNO Chew on 23 June 1990. He testified that the record of this particular movement of exh P-40 was made by his assistant. This can be seen from exh D-13. Exhibit D-13 also recorded the movements of exh P-40 in and out of the storeroom until it was produced in this court. Dr Lee identified exh P-40 as the drug which he had analyzed and returned to SNO Chew on 23 June 1990. He confirmed this by referring to the marking and seal put up by SNO Chew and comparing it with his laboratory notes. The exhibit that was given by Dr Lee to SNO Chew on 23 June 1990 was the very same exhibit that was produced before this court. 
 
(e) SNO Chew described the colour of exh P-40 as either greyish or light brown. In his [working sheets] (exh P-59), Dr Lee described it as greyish. SNO Chew testified that exh P-40 was marked as `Toyota` and sealed with a Central Narcotics Bureau Seal No A148375. Dr Lee testified that he received an exhibit which was marked `Toyota` and sealed with a Central Narcotics Bureau seal number A148375. Exhibit P-40 itself shows a broken seal with the letter `A` and the numbers `75`. 
 
(f) Dr Lee explained that his evidence on 11 January 1993 pertaining to the description of the drugs as being powdery was based on what was led by the prosecution. On 15 January 1993 when he was recalled, he explained that his statement (PS-1) was not prepared by him but by the investigating officer. At the time when he signed it, he did not have any reference to his notes or laboratory worksheets. He had to rely on what the investigating officer had prepared. Furthermore his notes and the laboratory notes also described the exhibit as being granular in appearance. Dr Lee also informed the court that he did not refer to any dictionary when he described the exhibit as granular. He told the court that he described the exhibit based on his own perception of the drugs and his own usage of the word `granular`. Lastly the laboratory No 90019623 also appeared on exh P-40 and this was the laboratory number of the certificate put up by Dr Lee (exh P-1). 
 
(g) NO Chong testified that the drugs discovered by SNO Chew beneath the glove compartment of motor vehicle NL 4807 appeared lumpy and granular. His statement was admitted in evidence as exh D-5/PS-27. In it, he stated: `SNO Chew then opened the plastic bag and in it was a plastic packet wrapped with Chinese newspaper containing a granular substance believed to be heroin.` 
 
(h) The use of the word `granular` by SNO Chew, NO Chong and Dr Lee might not be an appropriate description of exh P-40 if one were to follow strictly the meaning ascribed to it by the Chambers` dictionary. However, this was the description used by the witnesses who had seen it as shown in photographs P-18 and P-19. 
 
(i) SNO Chew weighed exh P-40 at the CNB headquarters and found it to weigh 425.5g. He testified that he did not calibrate the weighing machine when he used it. Neither did he check whether the machine was properly maintained before he placed exh P-40 on it for weighing. SNO Chew testified that he did not do so because he was aware that the exhibit would subsequently be sent to the DSS for analysis where there were more accurate machines. He said the purpose of his weighing was to obtain an approximate weight for preparing the charges used in the recording of cautioned statements from the three accused persons. SNO Chew is not a scientific officer nor is the CNB an accredited scientific research body. 
 
(j) The description of the colour of exh P-40 was a matter of perception by different individuals. Dr Lee testified that he found the substance to be greyish whereas SNO Chew found it to be light brownish or greyish. Most of the other CNB officers described it as brownish. Different individuals might have different perceptions as to colour, which is highly subjective. It is important to note that in such a serious case as this, the court had to be objective in arriving at a conclusion that the package recovered from motor vehicle NL 4807 was in fact exh P-40 that was produced in court. The best way of arriving at that finding was for the court to ask itself whether the defence had succeeded in raising any reasonable doubt on the chain of evidence pertaining to exh P-40. The defence had however not succeeded in this respect. This was because the exhibit initially marked `Toyota` was given a CNB serial number A148375 and it was subsequently sent to the DSS for analysis. Dr Lee, who gave evidence in court from his laboratory worksheets, confirmed that this was the CNB seal number A148375 which was on the package marked `Toyota` which he received from SNO Chew on 23 March 1990 at 4.10pm at the DSS. Dr Lee found the exhibit marked `Toyota` to have a net weight of 449.1g of granular substance. After analysis, he found the exhibit `Toyota` to contain 76.3g of diamorphine. Dr Lee identified exh P-40 in court and confirmed that it was the exhibit he had analyzed. 
 
(k) The accused persons testified that they saw the use of a digital weighing machine at CNB. There was no reason for SNO Chew to lie to this court since the initial weighing by him was meant for the sole purpose of preparing charges to be used later that evening in connection with the recording of cautioned statements from each of the accused persons pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC. There was absolutely no doubt that the said exhibit marked `Toyota` bearing the CNB seal was the same exhibit that was sent to the DSS for analysis and found to contain 76.3g of diamorphine. 
 
(l) NO Ng testified that when he put up the case report, he approximated the weight of exh P-40 to be 600g. He did not weigh the said exhibit. No weight should be attached to NO Ng`s evidence pertaining to the weight of exh P-40 because he never weighed the same. The chain of evidence adduced by the prosecution established that exh P-40 was the very exhibit that was seized from motor vehicle NL 4807 on 21 March 1990 by SNO Chew; the same was personally delivered by SNO Chew to the DSS on 23 March 1990; and it was the very same exhibit that was analyzed by Dr Lee and eventually produced before this court.
  
 
 
The essence of the learned DPP`s submission was that the various discrepancies underscored by counsel for the defence as respects colour, form and weight did not diminish the overwhelming effect of the mark `Toyota` given by SNO Chew to exh P-40.
Now touching upon the defence of the first accused, the learned DPP submitted that the evidence adduced had established that the first accused drove into Singapore with the offending package with the drug hidden beneath the dashboard of the vehicle and that he uttered the word `dadah` audibly to the CNB officers. The learned DPP also invited the court to s 18(2) of the MDA which provided that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. The learned DPP also relied on the provisions of s 17 of the MDA and submitted that the first accused had not rebutted the presumptions therein. He contended that the first accused had failed to show that he was only in innocent custody of the package and further invited the court to consider his mixed statements to determine where the truth lay.
As against the second accused, the main thrust of his submission was that the presence of the second accused in Singapore was not a co-incidence and that he was involved in the conspiracy in relation to the subject matter of the offence. He urged the court to take into account the testimony of the first accused that he transported the package into Singapore and that his subsequent meeting with the second accused at Woodlands Food Centre was by prior arrangement. The prosecution also urged the court to draw an inference of conspiracy from the circumstances of the first and second accused absenting themselves from the hospital from 10am and their meeting in Singapore at Woodlands Food Centre.
 Conclusions
The first issue to be decided at the conclusion of the case was whether the drugs seized from motor vehicle NL 4807 were indeed the drugs analyzed by Dr Lee. Counsel for both accused persons highlighted several discrepancies as to the colour, form and weight of the exhibit. There was an array of discrepancies which on the face of it appeared to undermine the prosecution evidence and raise doubts both as to the quality of the investigation and the presentation of evidence. The court was also concerned in particular whether the standard of proof required in criminal proceedings had been adequately discharged by the prosecution.
I had the benefit of hearing SNO Chew, Dr Lee and NO Ng during the prosecution`s case. I hasten to say that NO Ng had been extremely shoddy in venturing a weight which he passed on to the CNB store without bothering to check the facts and without verifying the same with SNO Chew. SNO Chew too was somewhat inadequate and indecisive in his explanation as to the reasons why he marked the substance as brownish. Equally, Dr Lee`s explanations on `granular substance` and `powdery substance` were disconcerting. However the overwhelming feature of the exhibit which shone like the polestar was the marking `Toyota` which it bore throughout.
A host of authorities was cited to me from the Supreme Court of Malaysia and in the cases cited, the Malaysian Supreme Court saw fit to disagree with the trial courts` decisions when there were a few unsatisfactory features on the description or marking of the exhibits. I need not advert to the reasonings in those cases for I am in full agreement with the principles of law stated therein. However the fact situation in the cases referred to did not comprise a feature such as the one in the case at hand, ie the distinct and contemporaneous marking of the exhibit as `Toyota` by SNO Chew and its continued presence throughout - from the time it was marked, kept in the store, released to SNO Chew, delivered to Dr Lee, analyzed by the DSS and subsequently returned to CNB.
There was much argument concerning the type of weighing machine used. In my view there was no palpable reason as to why the investigating officer should lie to the court that he used a machine with a needle movement if in fact he used a digital machine. The difference in the weight obtained by SNO Chew and Dr Lee were, to my mind, not really significant as I accepted the evidence of SNO Chew that the weighing scale he used was not calibrated. I also accepted SNO Chew`s evidence that after he had sealed and marked the exhibit as `Toyota`, he handed it to Inspector Ho for safe custody and two days later, ie on 23 March 1990, he retrieved the same exhibit from the store at about 3.25pm and handed it to Dr Lee at about 4.10pm. The sealing, marking and delivery were all carried out promptly and in the circumstances, there was no substance to the complaint that there was a mix-up as respects the particular exhibit. Dr Lee was positive that he analyzed the exhibit marked `Toyota` and arrived at the result he did, as stated in the certificate issued by him under s 16 of the MDA.
The criticism that the store assistant (who received the exhibit after it was returned from the DSS) was not produced to give evidence, lacked substance particularly when the prosecution had produced his superior, Inspector Ho who had knowledge, from his records, to testify to the transactions at the store.
The other contention that the seized substance (exh P-40) was lumpy in appearance whereas the exhibit produced in court was powdery, lacked both depth and conviction. I found the argument to be totally unmeritorious for it is elementary that any analysis by the DSS must necessarily involve the homogenization of the drug under reference. In the result, having had the advantage of observing all the witnesses and having reviewed all the evidence and arguments advanced, I concluded that there was in fact no mix-up in the exhibits and that the exhibit analyzed by Dr Lee was the very exhibit which was seized from the vehicle Toyota NL 4807 on 21 March 1990.
It is perhaps appropriate at this stage to comment upon the application by counsel for the first accused to impeach the credit of Dr Lee. The application was made when Dr Lee tried to clarify his earlier evidence when recalled. Dr Lee had adequately explained his reasons why he had originally testified that the substance was powdery. In my view, his credit was not impeached and his explanations were adequate and satisfactory.
Turning now to the substantive aspects of the defence of the first accused, it was a straightforward disclaimer of the knowledge of the contents of the package found under the dashboard of the vehicle NL 4807. The first accused endeavoured to explain that he was asked to do a job for profit. He wanted to know whether the job was dangerous but was assured that the package would, at worst, be confiscated. He claimed that he did not think that he would lose his job even if he was caught with the package. Therefore he secured the package under the dashboard and set off for Singapore where he was scheduled to meet the second accused at the Woodlands car park. He said that the man who made him do the job was the second accused and that he was innocent.
The evidence had established that he was caught with the keys to the vehicle in which the drug was found. He admitted driving the vehicle into Singapore with the offending substance. The only issue therefore revolved around his knowledge of the package. Did he have knowledge of the contents of the offending package?
Knowledge generally implies consciousness of facts. In the Malaysian case of 
PP v Badrulsham Bin Baharom
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 585
  at p 588, Lim Beng Choon J observed: 
 
... I believe it is well settled at least by our courts that to establish possession by an accused person of any dangerous drugs or to 
 impute to him possession
 of the said drugs, it must first be shown that he had knowledge of the drugs which were found to be in his possession. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Later, at p 589 he said: 
 
... Knowledge being an element of the state of mind of a person, the obvious question is: how is one to prove the element of knowledge in order to establish possession. However that may be, certain modes of proof are acceptable as sufficient to distinguish between a genuine and a feigned defence. Those modes of proof are acceptable because unless a defendant confesses that he has the necessary knowledge which is an element of his state of mind 
 such element must be judged from his outward acts or omissions
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
Saad Ibrahim v PP
 
 
[1968] 1 MLJ 158
  Yong J was quite emphatic as to the requirement of the element of knowledge on the part of the possessor before he could be criminally incriminated with possession of a prohibited article. He observed at p 159: 
 
... In my opinion mere possession is one thing and possession with 
 mens rea
 is another. Possession which incriminates must have certain characteristics. The possessor must be aware of his possession, must know the nature of the thing possessed and must have the power of disposal over it. Without these characteristics possession raises no presumption of 
 mens rea
. Without 
 mens rea
 possession cannot be criminal except in certain cases created by statute, which is not applicable in this case.
 
 
 
In 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
 Lord Pearce observed at p 305 (E-F): 
 
... If one goes to the extreme length of requiring the prosecution to prove that `possession` implies a full knowledge of the name and nature of the drug concerned, the efficacy of the Act is seriously impaired, since many drug pedlars may in truth be unaware of this. I think that the term `possession` is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its qualities, and that ignorance or mistake as to its qualities is not an excuse. This would comply with the general understanding of the word `possess` ...
 
 
 
Lord Pearce added at pp 305(H)-306(A-B): 
 
... If a man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was mistaken as to its contents? As in the case of goods that have been `planted` in his pocket without his knowledge, so I do not think that he is in possession of contents which are quite different in kind from what he believed. Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it 
 and
 no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.
 
 
 
Lord Pearce`s construction of the word `possession` was adopted here (with a qualification) by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP
 
 
[1980] 1 MLJ 49
  at p 53: 
 
... Under our Act, where a person is in possession of a bag or package which contains in fact a controlled drug, it is presumed that he is in possession of and knows the nature of the controlled drug unlike in the United Kingdom where there is only a 
 prima facie
 strong inference that he is in possession of its contents.
 
 
 
Touching upon the statutory presumption relied on by the prosecution, s 18(2) of the MDA makes it abundantly clear that once a person is proved to have had a controlled drug in his possession he shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
In the circumstances of the case, even if the court were to accept the testimony of the first accused that he did not utter the word `dadah` and the said word was in fact suggested to him by a CNB officer, it was still manifest that the first accused knew that he was transporting into Singapore something which was illicit or illegal. In those circumstances, even if he did not care to inspect what the substance he indeed carried was, the presumption under s 18(2) operated against him. Having reviewed all the evidence and his explanations, I formed the view that the first accused was not the sort of gullible person he wanted the court to believe him to be. In my view, he knew that he was transporting drugs into Singapore. I found in the circumstances that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt its case against the first accused who had not, on a balance of probabilities, negatived the prosecution case.
 The second accused
I have already dealt with the issue relating to the identity of the drugs and the link in the chain of evidence. I then went on to consider the arguments advanced on behalf of the second accused that he was not party to the criminal enterprise and did not know anything about the subject matter of the offence.
The main evidence against the second accused was from the first accused. The testimony of the first accused was that it was the second accused who gave the substance and made the first accused transport it into Singapore. The first accused further testified that the second accused would arrange to collect the substance at Woodlands Food Centre. In addition to that piece of evidence, the second accused was apprehended at Woodlands car park together with the first accused. The car in which the drugs were discovered was parked nearby. The second accused explained that his purpose of coming to Singapore that day was to visit his second wife in Batam and he had left his place of work after arranging with one Misman (Man Bin Said) to stand in for him during his absence.
As to his absence from work, his evidence that he had not seen his superior that day was contested by his supervisor. Abdul Hamid testified that on 21 March 1990, the second accused came to see him to apply for half a day`s leave to attend to some personal matters. However both the first and second accused were not seen after the usual morning tea break. Abdul Hamid was an independent witness whose testimony directly controverted the evidence of the second accused who claimed that he did not report for work except for a visit to the canteen that day. Misman (Man Bin Said) was not called to give evidence and above all, the first accused directly implicated him in the offence. It was submitted that the evidence of the first accused should, in this connection, be totally disregarded.
After the defence of the accused persons had been called, if the first accused did not testify against the second accused, then the court would have to consider whether the confession of the first accused (which was not made in the presence of the second accused and not subjected to any cross-examination) should be taken into consideration against the second accused. In the case at hand, we had crossed the threshold and were at a point where the parties were face to face with the oral testimony of one co-accused implicating the other. The first accused had been subjected to some extensive cross-examination and his testimony was placed under direct scrutiny. Given the scenario, in my view the reservations expressed in a number of cases in regard to confessions of co-accused persons who had not given evidence were not well suited to the issues at hand. What then is the law?
In 
Tan Cheng Seng & Anor v R
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
 the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal followed the principles enunciated in the English authority of 
R v Barnes and Richards
 
[] 27 Cr App R 154
 and held that: 
 
Where prisoners are tried jointly, and one of them gives evidence on his own behalf incriminating a co-prisoner, the prisoner who has given the incriminating evidence is not placed in the position of an accomplice, nor does the rule of practice with regard to the corroboration of an accomplice apply to such a case. The rule applies only to witnesses called for the prosecution.
 
 
 
The Court of Criminal Appeal of the Federation of Malaya approved the foregoing principles in 
Daud Bin Awang Ngah & Ors v PP
 
 
[1958] MLJ 168
  Thomson CJ at p 169 commented: 
 
At the trial the first appellant gave evidence which implicated the second and third appellants. He admitted striking the fatal axe blow but said that his intention was not to cause death but merely to injure the deceased (which the jury apparently, and not surprisingly, disbelieved). He went on to give evidence as to the part played in the affair by the second and third appellants and the evidence, to put it at the lowest, was not inconsistent with the prosecution evidence against these appellants. No great point was made of this by counsel for the second appellant either at the trial or before us but both at the trial and before us it was strongly urged for the third appellant that in dealing with this evidence by the first appellant in his charge to the jury the trial judge should have warned the jury that he (the first appellant) was an accomplice and that he should have gone on to administer the warning that is ordinarily given regarding an accomplice`s evidence.
 
 
 
Further, at p 170 he said: 
 
... we agree with and adopt that statement by the Singapore court and we find support for that course in the case of 
 Davies v Director of Public Prosecutions
 where Lord Simonds LC, referred to the rule that where a person who is an accomplice gives evidence on behalf of the prosecution it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that although they may convict upon his evidence it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated and observed that this rule `applies only to witnesses for the prosecution`.
 
 
 
The truth, of course, is that there is no rule of law which demands that in every case where an accused person gives evidence which tends to incriminate a co-accused the jury should be warned that it is dangerous to convict upon such evidence unless it is corroborated.
Whether or not such a warning should be given to the jury is not a matter of law. It is a matter to be decided in the light of the circumstances of each individual case. In some cases such a warning might not be necessary; in others as a matter of ordinary prudence such a warning would be imperative.
The above principles were reaffirmed by the Malaysian Federal Court in 
PP v Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
 
Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, I considered carefully the significance of the evidence of the first accused who unequivocally implicated the second accused whilst confessing that he transported the substance into Singapore. I scrutinized the evidence of the first accused with much care. I took into account all the discrepancies between his oral evidence and his long statements accentuated by counsel. Moreover, I reminded myself of the pitfalls in relying exclusively on the evidence of the first accused without some additional features. However, having first weighed in my mind the circumstantial aspects of this case and having had the advantage of observing and hearing both accused persons in their defence, I was satisfied that the account narrated by the first accused connecting the second accused to the offence was a true version. Could part of the testimony of the first accused be accepted and the remainder rejected? Decided cases support the view that the court is perfectly entitled to do so after a careful scrutiny of the witness`s testimony as Raja Azlan Shah FJ held in 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Hj Idris (No 2)
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
  at p 19: 
 
There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed entirely or not at all. A court is fully competent, for good and cogent reasons, to accept one part of the testimony of a witness and to reject the other. It is therefore necessary to scrutinize each evidence very carefully as this involves the question of weight to be given to certain evidence in particular circumstances.
 
 
 
The first accused was emphatic in his assertion in implicating the second accused who was his neighbour. No motive had been attributed to the first accused as to why he should in fact implicate the second accused. Another telling feature in the evidence of the first accused was that he totally absolved the third accused from any involvement in the offence.
It must be remembered that conspiracies are proved generally from inference of conduct as it is often difficult to have direct evidence of such conspiracy. Having regard to the totality of the evidence adduced in this trial against the second accused, viz the evidence of the first accused and the cohesive circumstantial factors (such as the presence of the second accused at Woodlands Food Centre where he was apprehended together with the first accused and his disappearance from his place of work just after tea break), I was impelled to conclude that he was indeed party to the conspiracy and that he abetted the offence as averred in the charge against him. I considered very carefully the exculpatory aspects in the statement of the second accused and his explanations in court, but his story that he was present at Woodlands Food Centre only by co-incidence was rejected by me. In my view the prosecution had indeed proved its case against the second accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
Lest it is suggested that I overlooked it, it must be mentioned that I also considered the evidence of the third accused who testified in favour of the second accused. Though he was acquitted for want of evidence at the close of the prosecution case, his evidence as to what indeed happened in Johore Bahru on 21 March 1990 was negatived by the evidence of Abdul Hamid. Furthermore the third accused was found by me to be prevaricating about an all important aspect of the Batam trip - when he unwittingly blurted out: `Yes, I sent him there to Batam. No, ... I sent him to Finger Pier in Singapore. No, I like to clarify. I did not reach the Finger Pier because we were arrested at Woodlands.` (p 1191 of the verbatim notes). In the circumstances, I did not accept his evidence in support as being credible.
Having reviewed all the evidence, I was satisfied at the conclusion of the whole case that the prosecution had discharged the ultimate burden placed on it in respect of both accused persons. In the result, I found both accused persons guilty, convicted them of the charges and sentenced them accordingly.

The respondent was tried in the district court on the following charge: 
 
You, Chin Moi Moi, f, 36 years, NRIC No S1180502-G, are charged that you, on 6 March 1993, at about 6.30pm, at Blk 13 Marsiling Lane, #13-17, Singapore, a place used for human dwelling, committed theft of a gold bangle valued at about $436, in the possession of one Ng Lay Lay, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the trial, the district judge acquitted the respondent. The public prosecutor being dissatisfied brought this appeal against the order of acquittal. The grounds of appeal raised by the public prosecutor involved a question of law with respect to s 27 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). After hearing the respective submissions of counsel, I allowed the appeal and pursuant to the powers conferred on the High Court under s 256(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), remitted the case to the district court for a retrial. My reasons are now set out below.
 The evidence
It was undisputed that on 6 March 1993, at about 6pm, the respondent, a saleswoman who did door to door sales of gas safety valves, visited the flat of one Madam Loo Ah Moy (PW1), at Blk 13, Marsiling Lane, #13-17, Singapore. PW1 allowed the respondent into the flat. The respondent proceeded to the kitchen where she explained to PW1 the product she was selling. At that time, two other persons were in the flat; PW1`s husband and her daughter, Ng Lay Lay (PW2). However, only PW1 was in the kitchen with the respondent. During the respondent`s demonstration of the safety valve, the telephone rang. As PW1 left the kitchen to answer the phone, the respondent asked her whether she could wash her hands and was left alone in the kitchen. PW1 was on the telephone for a short while and, during this time, she could see the respondent in the kitchen.
It was the evidence of PW2 that she saw the respondent washing her hands at the kitchen sink when PW2 walked through the kitchen to the bathroom for a shower. Shortly after, PW1 returned and the respondent continued her demonstration. PW1 told the respondent that she did not wish to purchase the safety valve and the respondent left the flat. According to PW1, the respondent `appeared to be excited` when she left and `looked different from the time she came in.` In all, the respondent was in the flat for some 20 to 25 minutes.
After the respondent left, PW1 did not notice anything unusual. Later that evening, at about 9 pm, PW2 asked her whether she had seen her gold bangle as she could not find it. According to PW2, she would normally keep her jewellery on top of a cabinet in her bedroom. On the morning of 6 March 1993, she had worn the bangle when she visited the market. On returning to the flat, she had removed it and placed it by the wash basin in the kitchen. PW1 remembered seeing it there earlier at about 5.30pm and told PW2 to look for it there. However, the bangle could not be found. As there were no other visitors to the flat that day, they suspected that the respondent might have taken it.
In her defence, the respondent denied taking the gold bangle. Her version of the events was this. She admitted that the telephone had rung and that she had been left alone in the kitchen. However, she claimed that this was only for a brief period and that PW1 was always looking in her direction when she was on the telephone. She did not wash her hands at the kitchen sink and did not see a gold bangle there either. The respondent recalled that after she had completed her demonstration of the safety valve, PW1 had asked her how much it cost. When the respondent replied, PW1 called for PW2 and asked for her opinion. PW2 told the respondent that they would consider it and she then asked for her name card but the respondent did not have any with her. She realized that they were not keen to buy and she decided to leave the flat. After visiting PW1`s flat, she went over to the next block which was Blk 12. When she called at a flat there, she found out that someone else had been there earlier selling the same product. She then left for home.
PW2 only managed to trace and contact the respondent about two days later, on 8 March 1993 when she spoke to the respondent over the telephone. According to PW2, she offered the respondent a chance to return the bangle but the respondent denied taking it. PW2 then lodged a report at Marsiling Neighbourhood Police Post in the afternoon.
The case was referred to the duty officer, Sergeant Lim Tian Lye (PW4). PW4 left a message at the respondent`s office and at 7.10pm that evening, the respondent turned up at the police station. After a short interview, the respondent was arrested.
From about 12.25 am, the respondent was questioned by a team of three police officers, Sergeant Kiang Ah Bah (PW5), Woman Corporal Ang Lay Kim (PW6) and Corporal Manjit Singh (PW7). This interrogation lasted until about 6.10am. During this period, no statement was recorded from the respondent. At 10am, the same morning the respondent was taken out from the lock-up by PW4, who, in the presence of Woman Corporal Toh Lee Loh, recorded a statement from her. The recording of the statement ended at 11.15am.
Subsequent to the recording of the statement, PW4 phoned PW2 and told her that he was coming over to the flat to search for the bangle, and asked her to wait at the ground floor. PW4 arrived at Blk 13, Marsiling Lane, at about noon and together with PW2 searched the open area at the foot of the block, just below the kitchen window of the flat. The bangle was spotted by PW2 and PW4 at the same time, lying on a grass verge which separated the cement flooring at the foot of the block and the car park next to it. PW4 said that it `was very obvious` and agreed with defence counsel that anyone passing by would have noticed the bangle on the grass verge. There were several paths along the grass verge and PW4 said that these were used by the residents to get to Blk 13 from the car park. The bangle was seized by PW4. The respondent was later released on bail on the same day.
There was also the evidence of PW1 and PW2 that, soon after midnight on 10 March 1993, the respondent and her employer, Susan Chiang Yah May (DW2), called at their flat and attempted to settle the matter. According to PW2, the respondent asked her how much the bangle was worth and told her that she was prepared to pay compensation for it. PW2 told the respondent that she had already lodged a police report and could not listen to her proposal. PW2 had actually called the Neighbourhood Police Post first before she opened the door. Two police officers proceeded to the flat. One of them, Corporal Tan Loong Kit (PW3), gave evidence at the trial. PW3 testified that when he arrived there, PW2 saw the respondent and DW2 at the entrance to the flat. PW2 told him that they were harassing her to settle a case and she wanted them to leave. The respondent and DW2 were asked by PW2 to leave. Some ten minutes later, the respondent and DW2 returned to the flat. The respondent repeated her offer of compensation. PW2 again refused to accept. After about 20 minutes, they left.
The respondent did not dispute the fact that she visited the flat with DW2. However, she denied offering to settle the matter with PW2. The respondent claimed that she hardly spoke and that DW2 spoke to PW2 throughout. The respondent only asked PW2 whether the bangle was found and told PW2 not to frame her. When the police officers asked them to leave, they complied and denied returning to the flat a second time. DW2`s evidence was that she went over with the respondent to the flat as she wanted to find what the whole matter was about. She said that it was her suggestion to go there. When she was told by PW2 that the bangle was found, she asked PW2 to withdraw her police report. She denied offering PW2 any compensation at all.
In the court below, the deputy public prosecutor sought to admit the statement of the respondent recorded by PW4. The defence counsel objected to its admissibility on the ground that it was involuntary. As a result, a voir dire was conducted by the district judge.
The respondent claimed that when she was first interviewed by PW4 on arrival at the police station, PW4 threatened to lock her up if she did not admit to the charge and, when she did not do so, had then placed her under arrest. Later that night, she claimed that she was taken to a cold dark room for interrogation and was continuously harassed, abused and assaulted by PW5 and PW7. This was in fact the subject of a complaint which the respondent made to a magistrate on 23 November 1993, under s 133(1) of the CPC. She also claimed that she was not given any food or drink after her arrest. When she was taken out to see PW4 in the morning, she claimed that she was forced to sign a prepared statement. She alleged that PW4 threatened to put her in a lock-up for three months if she did not sign. The respondent also claimed that PW4 swung out his hand as if to hit her. She did not know the contents of the statement.
PW5, PW6 and PW7 denied harassing or assaulting the respondent. They claimed that the questioning took a long time only because they felt that the respondent was not cooperative in the sense that she did not admit to the theft. PW4`s evidence was that the respondent had voluntarily given her statement to him in Mandarin, which he recorded in English, and he had read it back to the respondent in Mandarin. He denied shouting and threatening the respondent at all. At the conclusion of the voir dire, the district judge found that the statement was made involuntarily and rejected it.
 Decision of the district court
At the conclusion of the trial, the district judge concluded that the prosecution had not made out its case against the respondent and he acquitted her. He explained in his grounds of decision: 
 
The submission by the defence that the whole case was premised upon conjectures and misplaced suspicions was properly made. It was not for the court to make conjectures as to who had removed the gold bangle and how it got on the grass verge where it was recovered by Sgt Lim on 9 March 1993. The onus is on the prosecution to prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Not by any stretch of imagination can it be said that it has done so in this case.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
On appeal, the DPP submitted that the statement need not be proved to have been made voluntarily, as only a part of the statement was sought to be admitted under s 27 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). Section 27 reads as follows: 
 
When any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether such information amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved.
 
 
 
The DPP submitted that s 27 was an exception to its preceding sections, 24 to 26, in that it was not subject to the conditions of admissibility there, ie the confession must not be made without any inducement, threat or promise, and must be made to a police officer not below the rank of sergeant. He also referred to s 122(3) of the CPC: 
 
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement made in the course of an identification parade or falling within section 27 or 32(a) of the Evidence Act.
 
 
 
The admissibility section for statements to the police is, of course, s 122(5) of the CPC, which prohibits the admission of statements which appear to the court to have been made involuntarily.
The DPP contended that when an application was made by the prosecution under s 27, the only question open to the court was whether the statement fell within the purview of that section. If the trial judge was satisfied that the statement relating to the discovery of the subsequent fact fulfilled the conditions under s 27, it would have to be admitted. This was because s 27 was an exception to ss 24 to 26 of the Evidence Act and s 122(5) of the CPC, and there was therefore no requirement for a voir dire. In this case, he contended that s 27 was applicable and that the district judge ought to have admitted part of the statement.
The DPP laid emphasis on the evidence of PW4 that it was only consequent to the respondent`s statement that he proceeded to the foot of Blk 13 whereupon he found the bangle at the grass verge below the kitchen window of the flat. He contended that the discovery of the bangle there showed that the respondent had knowledge of its location. As a result, he argued that the prosecution case could not have been a case of `conjectures and misplaced suspicions`. The facts gave rise to an irresistible inference that the respondent must have taken the gold bangle and had thrown it out of the flat, with the intention of stealing it.
 Evidence Act s 27
Section 27 of the Evidence Act represents loosely what is known as the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent facts. This doctrine holds that where in consequence of a confession, otherwise inadmissible, a search is made and facts are discovered which confirm the confession in material points, the possible influence which through caution had been attributed to the improper inducement is seen to have been nil and the confession may be accepted without hesitation (Wigmore
 , Evidence in Trials at Common Law Vol III 
, s 856, p 550). The rationale for the admissibility of that part of the statement which is subsequently confirmed by the discovery of a material fact is that it must be reliable.
Before embarking on an examination of the law with respect to s 27, it has to be noted that the law in England is different. Under English common law, facts which are discovered in consequence of a confession are admissible although the confession itself is inadmissible (see , reaffirmed in ). This is commonly referred to as the `fruits of the poisoned tree` and is now statutorily enacted in s 76(4) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. However, s 76(5) provides that evidence that a fact was discovered as a result of a statement by an accused person shall not be admissible unless evidence of how it was discovered is given by him or on his behalf. Section 76(4) was also based on the recommendations of the 11th Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee. The majority of the Committee held the view that it was reasonable to allow evidence to be given that the discovery of the fact in question was made `as a result` of a statement made by the accused, although this statement was inadmissible. However, the minority view there was followed and formed the basis for s 76(5).
Section 27 of the Evidence Act is of course derived from the Indian Evidence Act and is similarly worded, save for the words `Provided that`, found at the commencement of the Indian s 27. In India, the preceding words gave rise to some difficulty on the construction of the section. It was at one time uncertain whether s 27 was merely an exception to s 26 alone, or to s 25 and s 26 (since ss 25 to 27 was apparently taken out almost word for word, from the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure (Act XXV of 1861) into the Indian Evidence Act) or to ss 24 to 27. However, it now seems to have been settled that s 27 qualifies ss 24 to 26 (see 
 Sarkar on Evidence 
(14th Ed), p 466, for the cases which decided this point). In the Malaysian case of , Azlan Shah J (as he then was), applied s 27 to admit information which had been earlier ruled involuntary and inadmissible. He held at p 158: 
 
Section 27 is a concession to the prosecution. It is the express intention of the legislative that, even though such a statement is otherwise hit by the three preceding sections, viz ss 24-26 of the Evidence Ordinance, any portion thereof is nevertheless admissible in evidence if it leads to the discovery of a relevant fact.
 
 
 
This view has been accepted by the Malaysian Supreme Court in , and would also represent the position in Singapore.
The locus classicus on s 27 is the advice of the Privy Council, delivered by Sir John Beaumont, in . The propositions there have since been followed by courts in Malaysia and Singapore. In , Sir John Beaumont explained the operation of s 27, at p 70: 
 
Section 27, which is not artistically worded, provides an exception to the prohibition imposed by the preceding section, and enables certain statements made by a person in police custody to be proved. The condition necessary to bring the section into operation is that discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a police officer must be deposed to, and thereupon so much of the information as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved. The section seems to be based on the view that if a fact is actually discovered in consequence of information given, some guarantee is afforded thereby that the information was true, and accordingly, can be safely allowed to be given in evidence; but clearly the extent of the information admissible must depend on the exact nature of the fact discovered to which such information is required to relate. Normally the section is brought into operation when a person in police custody produces from some place of concealment some object, such as a dead body, a weapon, or ornaments, said to be connected with the crime of which the informant is accused.
 
 
 
It was argued by the Crown in that case that `the fact discovered` is the physical object produced, and that any information which relates distinctly to that object is admissible. This proposition was rejected: 
 
In their Lordship`s view, it is fallacious to treat the `fact discovered` within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this, and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact. Information as to past user, or the past history, of the object produced is not related to its discovery in the setting in which it is discovered. Information supplied by a person in custody that `I will produce a knife concealed in the roof of my house` does not lead to the discovery of a knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of the offence, the fact discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement the words be added `with which I stabbed A` these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to the discovery of the knife in the house of the informant.
 
 
 
Section 27 is clearly not a backdoor avenue for the admission of statements made by an accused person to the police, bypassing s 24 and s 122(5) of the CPC. In , Brown Ag CJ had warned that the section was not to let in confessions generally and no more than that which showed how the fact which was discovered was connected with the accused was admissible. In , Gunn SCJ emphasized that s 27 should be strictly construed and applied.
During the course of submission by counsel for the respondent, I was referred to , a case decided in 1966 but reported at 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 188
 . In that case, Choor Singh J held that s 27 of the Evidence Act must be read subject to s 121(5) of the CPC (now s 122(5)) and rejected a cautioned statement on the ground that the prescribed `caution` was not properly stated to the accused. With the greatest of respect, I disagree with the reasoning of the learned judge. Section 122(3) of the CPC is clear and unambiguous. It clearly provides that the requirements under s 122 are exempted when s 27 of the Evidence Act is applicable. To hold otherwise would render s 27 otiose.
It is material to note that `information` under s 27 does not only apply to statements. The words `whether such information amounts to a confession or not` clearly indicate that `information` is not only limited to a statement by the accused but also encompasses acts or conduct of the accused which relate distinctly to the fact discovered. This would of course consist of acts like pointing out the place where an article is hidden or where the accused leads the police to the article. As was held by Gunn SCJ in , `information` included knowledge derived by the person informed by the accused as well as the means taken to impart that knowledge.
Before s 27 can be invoked, it is essential to prove that a fact was discovered in consequence of the information received from the accused. The information must be such as has caused discovery of a fact, ie the fact must be the consequence and the information the cause of its discovery (per Gunn SCJ, ). If there is no link between the information and the fact discovered, such information would not be admissible under s 27.
Turning to the facts of this case, the DPP submitted that the district judge should not have conducted a voir dire and, instead, should have admitted the statement directly under s 27. No authority was referred to me to support the contention that whenever an application is made to adduce part of a statement under s 27, the trial judge need only consider whether the statement falls within the purview of that section, and if he decides that the statement is indeed within s 27, he must admit it.
It is a matter of principle that a trial judge must always be mindful of the authenticity and weight of the information which allegedly led to the discovery of a fact. There is always the danger that an information is falsely attributed to the accused. It is however a rare instance where the prosecution would only seek to admit part of an inculpatory statement by an accused under s 27. The prosecution would always inevitably seek to admit the entire statement of an accused and, as a matter of course, the defence would object to such statements and a voir dire would accordingly be conducted. Where the whole of a statement is sought to be admitted, s 27 could never apply as only that part of the information which relate distinctly to the fact discovered is admissible. It can therefore be seen that this issue would hardly arise in practice.
After having perused the notes of evidence, I did not find any specific attempt by the DPP there to adduce only that part of the statement which is now contended to be relevant evidence within s 27. This was what transpired at the trial: 
 
PW4: I only went to the scene behind Blk 13 after I had recorded the statement from her under s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
DPP: I am seeking to introduce the statement under s 27 of Evidence Act. 
Krishnan: I am challenging the admissibility of statement on ground it was given involuntarily. 
Court: Statement to be proved.
 
 
 
From the above, it was clear that the DPP sought to admit the whole and not just the material part of the statement. As stated earlier, in such circumstances, the defence counsel was entitled to object to the admissibility of the whole statement and the district judge, as a matter of course, had to conduct a voir dire. There was therefore no error in law by the district judge in doing so. In my opinion, the material issue in this appeal would really be whether the district judge ought to have admitted the relevant part under s 27 notwithstanding the fact that he had ruled the entire statement inadmissible. Before I proceed, it would be appropriate to offer some guidance as to how such evidence can be given should an occasion arise, albeit occasionally, where the prosecution decides to invoke s 27 to admit just one part of a statement of the accused.
It must always be proven first that the discovery of the fact only resulted from the information received from the accused. In this respect, s 138(2) of the Evidence Act is relevant: 
 
If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last-mentioned fact must be proved before either evidence is given of the fact first-mentioned, unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact and the court is satisfied with such undertaking.
 
 
 
This subsection was cited by Brown Ag CJ in . At p 182 of his judgment, it was held: 
 
While we do not wish to lay any hard and fast rule, we think that as a general rule it would be safer first to give evidence of the discovery of the fact before giving evidence of the information which the accused supplied. And in this connection, s 137 sub-s 2 [now, s 138(2)] is material. Thus the examination-in-chief would proceed on these lines:
 
 
 
Q: Did the accused speak to you ?
A: Yes. 
Q: As a result of what he said, what did you do ? 
A: I took the accused to his house. 
Q: What did you find ? 
A: I found this knife which was concealed in the roof.
 
 
 
Up to this point there has been no danger of admitting an inadmissible statement. The fact of the discovery of the knife has been established, and that it was discovered as a result of something which the accused said. But if section 27 is to be used, the next question must be directed to eliciting so much of the information supplied by the accused as distinctly relates to the discovery of the knife.
 
 
 
It is essential that the fact discovered must first be brought out in evidence. In my view, the trial judge must be satisfied that it was as a consequence of the statement that the fact was discovered. In doing so, he should look at all the circumstances of the case, the offence with which the accused is charged, the other evidence adduced so far and the relevance of the fact which is discovered as a consequence, so that no more than what was necessary is let in.
Reverting back to the issue at hand, the material part of the statement which is now contended as relevant evidence under s 27 and which was alleged to have led to the discovery of the gold bangle by PW4 was this: 
 
Without much hesitation, I throw down [sic] the gold bangle out of kitchen window ...
 
 
 
Having reviewed the evidence adduced at the trial, I am satisfied that the prosecution had clearly made out the factual assertion that it was only in consequence of the respondent`s statement that PW4 proceeded to the area outside the flat to search for the bangle. In my opinion, the district judge erred when he failed to consider this fact.
Where a finding of fact is not dependent upon an assessment of the credibility of a witness but on inferences drawn from the evidence, an appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to assess the evidence. I am of the view that the evidence did not altogether support the conclusions of the district judge. I disagree with the district judge`s finding that as `the fact that the bangle was found in full view of everyone would only suggest that it could not have been at the spot for such a long period of time but that it was placed there just before the arrival of PW4`. It cannot be that the prosecution case was based on `conjectures` and `misplaced suspicions`. I am satisfied that the part of the statement above was admissible under s 27 of the Evidence Act and ought to have been so admitted in evidence. That part of the statement was clearly distinctly related to the fact discovered.
Counsel for the respondent contended that s 27 did not apply as the part of the statement sought to be admitted was not relevant to the issue of theft. He referred to this part from the judgment of Sir John Beaumont in at p 71: 
 
The difficulty, however great, of proving that a fact discovered on information supplied by the accused is a relevant fact can afford no justification for reading into s 27 something which is not there, and admitting in evidence a confession barred by s 26. Except in cases in which the possession, or concealment, of an object constitutes the gist of the offence charged, it can seldom happen that information relating to the discovery of a fact forms the foundation of the prosecution case. It is only one link in the chain of proof, and the other links must be forged in the manner allowed by law.
 
 
 
It was submitted that even if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision as the prosecution had not proven the ingredients of theft.
This submission was misplaced. In my opinion, an irresistible inference arose from the fact of discovery of the gold bangle in consequence of information contained in a statement of the respondent, that the respondent had thrown it out of the window for the purpose of moving that property in order to take it out of the possession of the owner without consent. The movement of the gold bangle in itself constituted theft (s 378 Penal Code (Cap 224), illustration (h)).
One material fact also stood out and I would mention it without disturbing the finding of the district judge that the statement was involuntary. The respondent alleged that the statement was prepared by the police and that she was forced by PW4 to sign it. However, the evidence adduced in the voir dire was with respect to the allegations of harassment and assault during the first period of interrogation, in which PW4 was not involved. I observed that there was no other allegation against PW4 of any inducement, threat or promise held out by him to the respondent, save for the allegation that she would be jailed for several months if she did not sign the statement. At the same time, it was not disputed that the second period of questioning in which the statement was recorded, was from 10am to 11am that day. In my view, the evidence seems to indicate that it would have been highly improbable that the statement was fabricated in the manner in which PW4 was alleged to have so done as the evidence showed that it was only subsequent to his recording of the statement that he proceeded to Blk 13 whereupon the bangle was discovered at the grass verge.
There was also the evidence of the respondent that during the period of questioning by PW4, PW4 received a telephone call which suggested that the gold bangle was already found and that the caller was asked to keep it. This was denied by PW4. Although no finding was made by the district judge, in my view, the probative value of this piece of evidence was, at best, minimal.
The DPP had, in the course of his submissions, contended that it would have been more appropriate in the interests of justice to have a retrial. His reasoning was that this would provide the respondent with a fair opportunity to properly test the evidence of PW2 and PW4, especially the circumstances of the discovery of the gold bangle.
After considering the provisions of s 169 of the Evidence Act: 
 
The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case if it appears to the court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
 
 
 
and taking into account the evidence led by the prosecution, I was satisfied that the order of acquittal could not stand, if the material part of the statement was admitted as evidence under s 27 of the Evidence Act. I accepted the prosecution`s case and accordingly ordered a retrial. I have already given my reasons why the rejected evidence of the part of the statement was admissible. The district judge was directed to admit the material part of the respondent`s statement under s 27 of the Evidence Act.

You, Sim Gek Yong, male, 36 years, NRIC No S1311412/I, are charged that you, on or about 17 November 1994, between 9.30pm and 9.35pm, from Xilin Ave to the junction of Simei Road and Simei St 3, Singapore, in motor car SBH 5230 D, did obstruct officers of customs, Hoo Sen Kwi and Liew Chia Min in customs vehicle No SBB 4915 A, in the execution of their duties, to wit, by driving and using the said motor car to block and prevent the said customs vehicle from intercepting motor van No GH 6192 P which was conveying uncustomed goods, to wit, 1,970 cartons of assorted brands of duty-unpaid cigarettes, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 137(a) of the Customs Act (Cap 70) and punishable under s 137 of the same Act.
 
 
 
The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced by a district judge to nine months` imprisonment as well as a $5,000 fine (in default six months` imprisonment), this being the maximum punishment prescribed under s 137(a) of the Customs Act. The present appeal was brought against the sentence imposed. Having heard the submissions of counsel for the appellant and of the deputy public prosecutor, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
The facts of the case are set out in the statement of facts to which the appellant admitted unreservedly in pleading guilty to the charge against him. Essentially, the appellant had agreed to assist a friend, one Toh Hai Cheow (Toh), in Toh`s plan to smuggle into Singapore cigarettes on which customs duty had not been paid (the duty-unpaid cigarettes). The smuggling activity was to be carried out on 17 November 1994. At about 7.30pm on that day, therefore, the appellant proceeded to Changi Coast Road in motor car SBH 52130 D. His task, as agreed with Toh, was to drive close to the van driven by Toh (in which the cigarettes were being conveyed) and to keep a lookout for customs vehicles.
While driving along Changi Coast Road, the appellant noticed Toh`s van being trailed by a car which he suspected to be a customs vehicle. As it turned out, his suspicions were well founded: the car was a customs vehicle carrying officers from the Customs Investigations Branch. The appellant accelerated his vehicle and overtook the customs vehicle along Xilin Ave, after which he intentionally slowed down. From Xilin Ave to Upper Changi Road East, he then manoeuvred his car by repeatedly swerving from one side of the road to the other, in such a way as to block the customs vehicle`s path. Eventually, however, Toh`s van was forced to stop at a red light, at which point one of the customs officers alighted from the customs vehicle and attempted to remove Toh`s ignition key through the window of the van. The officer failed to do so and Toh`s van sped off. The customs officer, then still clinging to the van window, was dragged for a short distance before falling off. The appellant too fled from the scene in his car, although he surrendered himself to the police four days after the incident.
 The present appeal
On appeal, counsel for the appellant contended that the maximum sentence imposed by the district judge below was erroneous and manifestly excessive for the following reasons: first, because the district judge failed, in meting out sentence, to give any discount for the appellant`s act of voluntary surrender and his plea of guilt; secondly, because he failed also to take account of the fact that the appellant had no similar antecedents; thirdly, because the appellant`s role throughout the entire episode was that of a mere lookout, which role was not a sufficiently significant one to merit the imposition of the maximum sentence; and, finally, because the district judge erred in drawing a comparison between the appellant`s case and the case of an offence under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), which offence involves an assault or the use of criminal force on a police officer and which carries a maximum custodial sentence of two years.
 Plea of guilt and absence of similar antecedents
The mitigating force of the appellant`s act of voluntary surrender and his guilty plea was in fact canvassed in the court below. The district judge pointed out that such factors had no mitigating effect where an accused had been caught `red-handed` and where a plea of guilt was practically speaking inevitable. On appeal before me counsel for the appellant made much of the fact that the appellant had not been caught by the customs officers at the scene of the crime. Indeed, so counsel claimed, had the appellant been minded to do so, he could even have denied his presence at the scene. This seemed to me a most unrealistic contention, since - as the deputy public prosecutor pointed out - the appellant`s accomplice, Toh, had already been arrested some three days prior to the appellant`s act of voluntary surrender: in other words, the appellant must have known it was only a matter of time before the police descended upon him.
Even assuming that it could be argued that by his plea of guilt, the appellant saved the authorities time and expense which might otherwise have been spent investigating his whereabouts and subsequently proving his movements on 17 November 1994, such a plea of guilt still did not automatically merit a discount; for, as the English Court of Appeal held in and in , the element of public interest must be considered by the sentencing court in deciding whether a discount ought to be given for a guilty plea. In certain cases, the circumstances may be such that any mitigating effect afforded by a guilty plea is heavily or even completely outweighed by the need for a deterrent sentence. Thus in it was said by Macpherson J: 
 
[I]n nearly all cases the court must look at all the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and any mitigating features ... which include the question of giving credit for the plea [of guilt] and the other matters which are raised. In addition the court must look at the interests of society and strike a balance when considering what sentence is proper. In some cases the protection of society is an overwhelming consideration and in our judgment this is just such a case. We see no ground for giving any discount in the circumstances of this particular case.
 
 
 
In the present case the appellant acted with full knowledge of the fact that he was, by his conduct, assisting Toh in the perpetration of a crime. To compound matters, he drove in such a manner as to endanger not merely his own life and the lives of the customs officers involved, but also the safety of the public in general. Indeed, as the district judge pointed out, in the course of the chase down Xilin Ave, the customs officers were forced to take evasive action to avoid colliding with the appellant`s car. Having displayed such flagrant disregard for the safety of all concerned, it hardly lay in the appellant`s mouth to congratulate himself on the fact that, most fortuitously, no-one had been injured. I agreed with the district judge`s view, therefore, that the appellant`s conduct throughout the entire incident exemplified the very sort of recklessness and lawlessness the public must be protected from; and that, in all the circumstances of the case, the demands of public interest far outweighed any mitigating effect which might have been attached to the appellant`s guilty plea.
The above reasoning applied with equal force to counsel`s argument that a discount should have been given in respect of the appellant`s absence of similar antecedents. Like any other personal factor put forward on an accused`s behalf in mitigation, the absence of similar antecedents is something to be taken into account by the sentencing court and weighed in the balance against other, possibly opposing, factors. The first and foremost consideration in this balancing process, however, must be the public interest. Any sentence imposed must be such that it enables our criminal law not merely to punish crime effectively but also to prevent it. I have pointed out above the features in this particular case which offended against the public interest and which outweighed any ameliorating effect attaching to the appellant`s plea of guilt. In the same way, those circumstances also outweighed any mitigating effect which might have been said to attach to the appellant`s absence of similar antecedents; and the district judge was, in my opinion, fully justified in refusing to give any discount for this factor.
 Imposition of maximum sentence
The above did not of course lead to the ineluctable conclusion that the maximum sentence was warranted in the appellant`s case; and this, no doubt, was the point of counsel`s contention that the appellant`s role in the entire episode amounted to that of a mere lookout; in other words, that the present case fell outside the `worst case` scenario for which the maximum sentence was designed. The proposition appeared to be based on the remark made by Channell J in that `[t]he maximum sentence must ... be reserved for the worst cases.` In the present case, however, I would point out (albeit with respect) that counsel`s reliance on the above proposition begged the question of what actually constituted a `worst case` scenario.
In it was held by the Court of Appeal in England that: 
 
... it is to be borne in mind that when judges are asking themselves whether they should pass the maximum sentence, they should not use their imagination to conjure up unlikely worst possible kinds of cases. What they should consider is the worst type of offence which comes before the court and ask themselves whether the particular case they are dealing with comes within the broad band of that type.
 
 
 
The above approach was adopted by the Federal Court of Australia in . In its judgment, the court referred to and approved the decision of Burt CJ in , in which it was stated: 
 
A maximum sentence prescribed by statute is not reserved for the worst offence of the kind dealt with it that can be imagined. If such were the case it would never be imposed as the addition of non-existing but aggravating circumstances would never be beyond the reach of imagination. The true rule as I understand it is that the maximum sentence should be reserved for the worst type of cases falling within the prohibition or ... `for the worst cases of the sort.` That expression should be understood to be marking out a range and an offence may be within it notwithstanding the fact that it could have been worse than it was.
 
 
 
It was clear from the district judge`s grounds of decision that he took the above approach in sentencing the appellant; and in this I was fully in accord with him. The principles espoused above in and represent, in my view, the approach which should be adopted by a court towards the issue of maximum sentences. To restrict the maximum sentence to the `worst case imaginable` would only invite an endless permutation of hypotheses. In the appellant`s case, for instance, would the `worst case imaginable` be one in which the customs officers had been injured? Or would it be one in which one of the officers had been killed? Or would it be one in which a innocent bystander had been fatally hit by the appellant`s car? The possibilities are limitless and the uncertainty intolerable. All that a court can realistically do - and all that it should do - when deciding whether or not to impose a maximum sentence is to identify a range of conduct which characterizes the most serious instances of the offence in question. This would, as the court in pointed out, involve consideration both of the nature of the crime and of the circumstances of the criminal. Thus, taking the case of a conspiracy to defraud as an example, the fraud involved could be said to come within a band of fraud of the worst kind if it concerned a breach of trust; was in the multi-million dollar range; involved a person in a senior and responsible position; and had an element of public impact: see .
In the present case the offence in question was that of obstructing customs officers in the execution of their duties contrary to s 137(a) of the Customs Act. In committing this offence, the appellant acted deliberately and with full knowledge of the fact that he was facilitating the commission of a crime. The quantity of duty-unpaid cigarettes being smuggled by Toh was, furthermore, not insubstantial. In addition, by driving his car as he did, the appellant not only achieved the obstruction of the customs officers but further posed a danger to their safety and the safety of other road-users; and, indeed, the blatant recklessness shown by the appellant in this respect was a crucial factor in bringing his case within the band reserved for the worst possible type of case under s 137(a).
 The comparative punishment under s 353 Penal Code
In the final resort, counsel argued that the sentence imposed on the appellant was bad because the district judge, in passing sentence, compared the appellant`s case with the offence of assaulting or using criminal force on a police officer under s 353 of the Penal Code, which offence is punishable with a maximum custodial sentence of two years. In counsel`s submission, the comparison indicated that the district judge was influenced by the consideration that the appellant might have been charged with a more serious offence or at least one carrying a greater maximum sentence. I agreed with counsel that had this really been the case, it might have formed a valid ground for challenging the maximum sentence imposed on the appellant under s 137(a) of the Customs Act. The onus lies on the prosecution in the first place to assess the seriousness of an accused`s conduct and to frame an appropriate charge in the light of the evidence available. Once an accused has pleaded guilty to (or been convicted of) a particular charge, it cannot be open to the court, in sentencing him, to consider the possibility that an alternative - and graver - charge might have been brought and to treat him as though he had been found guilty of the graver charge.
In this case, however, the district judge`s brief reference to s 353 of the Penal Code would appear to have been in the nature of an afterthought rather than a substantive reason for his decision to impose the maximum sentence under s 137(a) of the Customs Act. Certainly, in the several pages of his judgment preceding the reference to s 353, the district judge considered most carefully the line of authorities represented by and came to the conclusion that the criminality of the appellant`s conduct was sufficiently serious to warrant the maximum sentence. I could not agree with counsel, therefore, that the district judge had in any real sense been influenced by the comparative punishment under s 353.
Having regard to all the foregoing reasons, I found no merit in the appeal and accordingly dismissed it.

s 354 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The appellant was charged in the district court with an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), namely, with having used criminal force to a 19 year-old female (`the complainant`), intending or knowing it to be likely to outrage her modesty. Upon pleading guilty, he was sentenced by the district judge to nine months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. He appealed against the said sentence. On 19 January 1995 I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
The facts of the case are contained in the statement of facts to which the appellant admitted unreservedly in pleading guilty. Essentially, they were as follows.
On 2 July 1994 at about 7.55pm, the appellant and the complainant, who had been passengers aboard the same bus, both alighted at a bus stop along Commonwealth Avenue. It was raining and the complainant, who had an umbrella, was walking along Commonwealth Avenue towards a pedestrian crossing when the appellant approached her and asked if he could share her umbrella. The complainant agreed, whereupon the appellant took the umbrella from her, placed his right hand on her right shoulder and pulled her towards him. The complainant became agitated at this and removing his hand from her shoulder, told him she did not wish to be held by him.
Unfortunately this did not deter the appellant, for, as they were crossing the road, he put his right hand on her right shoulder once more. The complainant shook it off and warned him angrily to keep his hands to himself. The warning went unheeded by the appellant, for, as they came to the pedestrian crossing, he placed his right hand on her right shoulder a third time. Holding her tightly, he leaned over her and asked her if she were afraid of being raped. Simultaneously he used his left knuckles to press onto her breast. The complainant, no doubt terrified at the implication of such a question coupled with the physical advances being made, was unable to extricate herself from the firm grip he had on her shoulder. To add to her horror, she noticed his right hand moving towards her right breast as they were crossing the road. At this point she managed to free herself from the grip he was exerting on her shoulder and began walking at a faster pace ahead of him.
The appellant caught up, however, and placed his right hand over her right shoulder a fourth time whilst moving it towards her right breast. The complainant turned around and snatched her umbrella from him. Happily for her, a male passer-by intervened and subsequently brought the appellant to a nearby Neighbourhood Police Post where the appellant was placed under arrest.
 The present appeal
On appeal counsel contended that the appellant stood in a far less serious position than the accused in , a case cited by the district judge in the oral judgment he delivered when passing sentence. This was a case in which the accused, similarly charged under s 354 of the Penal Code, had touched the vaginal area of a woman passenger whilst also flying as a passenger aboard a Singapore Airlines flight. He pleaded guilty to the charge and subsequently appealed against the sentence of three months` imprisonment. I dismissed that appeal and enhanced the sentence to one of six months` imprisonment with three strokes of the cane. In so doing I stated also that in respect of offences under s 354 of the Penal Code, the standard sentence in cases where the victim`s private parts or sexual organs had been intruded should be nine months` imprisonment with caning. Rather startlingly, counsel for the appellant endeavoured to persuade me that in the present case the appellant had not in any way intruded upon the complainant`s private parts. In fact, however, as I pointed out to counsel, the appellant had made use of his knuckles to press onto the complainant`s right breast; and I could see no reason therefore to regard such behaviour as a light infraction falling outside the category of cases held in to be deserving of custodial sentences with caning.
Counsel further urged upon me the arguments presented below in relation to the appellant`s personal background. In particular it was emphasised that the appellant (who was some 22 years of age at the time of the offence) had an excellent academic and extra-curricular record. Having previously completed his term of national service with some distinction, he had also just finished his first year of study at the National University of Singapore (NUS); and, at least until the commission of the offence in July last year, had appeared all set for a promising future. I could not agree, however, that these were considerations which weighed so heavily in the appellant`s favour as to justify a non-custodial sentence. There is, in my view, no good reason why accused persons who chance to possess some learning and intelligence should receive more lenient sentences than those meted out to their untutored brethren. Indeed one may just as easily argue that persons of some intellectual merit (such as the appellant in the present case) should be capable of a commensurate level of self-restraint.
Counsel also urged that consideration be given to the mental anguish the appellant`s parents had undergone since his conviction. Again, however, I could not see that this formed a relevant factor. It gives the courts no joy to witness the unhappiness suffered by an offender`s family, but this in itself has no mitigating value; and we should be inviting a travesty of justice if the courts were to start excusing offenders on the ground that sentences of imprisonment and/or caning upset their families.
Finally counsel tendered to this court a psychiatric report on the appellant dated 5 January 1995. Having perused the report with care, I could accord it no great weight. The main thrust of the report appeared to be that the appellant, being sexually inexperienced and naive, was too easily aroused when in close proximity to a woman. This factor in itself, however, carried no mitigating force. It is often said in mitigation that an accused could not help himself, that he gave in to certain impulses because of some sad defect in his personality or upbringing. Such arguments, to my mind, are wholly unmeritorious in most cases; for as I stated in 305: 
 
The whole purpose of the law is to maintain order and discipline; and that is most necessary precisely when the citizen might be inclined to act to the prejudice of good order.
 
 
 
Indeed I should add that, on the facts of the case, I could not accept that the appellant suffered from any psychiatric disorder. At the most it seemed to me that he was sexually immature and lacking in self-control. In the circumstances, therefore, I could find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by the district judge. The appeal was dismissed accordingly.

The appellant was convicted by the magistrate on seven counts of using criminal force with intent to outrage the modesty of the complainant (PW1) contrary to s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). After hearing both learned counsel and the deputy public prosecutor, I dismissed his appeal against conviction, but I reduced the sentence in respect of five of the charges. I now give my reasons.
 The charges 
Four of the charges against the appellant alleged that he caressed PW1`s thigh. These incidents happened on 29 March, 31 March, 7 April and 12 April. A fifth charge alleged that the appellant caressed PW1`s thigh and squeezed her on the back on 5 April 1995. The sixth charge alleged that the appellant caressed PW1`s thigh and touched her left breast on 19 April 1995. The last charge alleged that he caressed her thigh, touched her breasts and kissed her on the cheeks and lips on 21 April 1995. All the incidents took place between 8.30am and 10.30am.
 Background facts 
PW1 was 13 years old at the time of the alleged offences. She is an Indonesian student studying in Singapore. PW1 came to Singapore in August 1989. The appellant`s wife (Mrs Teo) was the principal of PW1`s primary school. Since September 1993, PW1 boarded with the appellant`s sister (Madam Teo). The appellant became PW1`s guarantor. In March 1995, he gave her tuition. Until the incidents, PW1`s family and the Teo family were on good terms.
PW1 and PW6 were friends. PW6 is a Taiwanese student who came to Singapore in 1993. This was upon the recommendation of PW1`s father, PW3. PW3 was a friend of PW6`s mother. PW1 and PW6 went to the same primary school and were roommates at Madam Teo`s flat. The appellant also gave PW6 tuition.
The first tuition lesson the appellant gave PW1 was on 22 March 1995. The lessons lasted from 8.30am till 10.30am, on Wednesdays and Fridays. They were held in the dining room of the appellant`s flat, which was a Housing and Development Board maisonette. During the lessons, the appellant always sat facing the stairs, which led upstairs. PW1 sat with her back to the stairs. The appellant had a dog, a Pomeranian, which was always in the room.
 The prosecution`s evidence 
PW1
PW1 testified that the first incident took place during the third lesson, on 29 March 1995. The appellant placed his right hand on her thigh. He moved it up and down for about one minute. PW1 did not say anything even though she felt uneasy. She did not know that the appellant intended to outrage her modesty. After the incident, they continued with the lesson.
On 31 March, the appellant did the same thing. On 5 April, the appellant caressed PW1`s thigh. He also asked her whether she was tired. She replied that she was not. He pressed his hands against her back and rubbed her shoulders. On 7 and 12 April, the appellant stroked PW1`s thigh again. PW1 did not protest on any of the occasions.
On 19 April, PW1 went to the appellant`s home for tuition wearing a tee-shirt with a logo over her left breast. The appellant caressed her thigh on that occasion again. On the pretext of examining the logo, he pressed his hands against her left breast. PW1 was shocked and frightened. However, she did not raise any objection as there was nobody within sight. According to her, this was the first time she realised that the appellant had the intention to outrage her modesty. On that day, she did not tell anyone about the incident as she thought that the appellant would not repeat what he did. Nevertheless, PW1 told Madam Teo that she did not wish to go for tuition. Mdm Teo insisted that she had to go.
On 21 April, the appellant caressed PW1`s thigh and squeezed her left breast. He then kissed her on the left cheek and tried to make her turn her face to the other side so that he could kiss her on the right cheek. PW1 resisted. The appellant turned PW1`s head towards him and kissed her on the lips. After that, he squeezed her right breast.
The appellant told PW1, `Don`t tell anybody. Don`t tell Daddy and don`t tell Aunty (Mdm Teo).` He said that otherwise, they would be angry with him. PW1 kept still because she was afraid of the Pomeranian underneath the appellant`s chair. When the appellant squeezed her right breast, she shook off his hands. She told him that she had to go to the bank to get some money. The appellant offered to send her there. She refused and rushed out of the flat.
PW1 left the appellant`s flat crying. She went to the Post Office Savings Bank at the Tampines Bus Interchange and withdrew $100. She bought a $50 phone card. She then went to the flat of her friend, Chew, which was nearby. At the void deck, she telephoned Chew from the public phone to let him know that she was going up to his flat.
After this, she called home to Indonesia. PW3 picked up the phone. She asked to speak to her mother (PW7). PW1 told PW7 what happened. PW7 started crying. PW3 took over the call. He told PW1 that he would take a flight to Singapore that very night. After calling home, PW1 went up to Chew`s flat. She cried and told him that she had been molested by her tuition teacher.
After confiding in Chew, she returned to Madam Teo`s house. The appellant`s shoes were not outside and she thought that he was not inside. She called PW3 to let him know that she had arrived home safely. Madam Teo approached her and asked her to give the appellant a chance. Madam Teo said that the accused wanted to speak to her. PW1 locked herself in her room upon hearing this. The appellant stood outside the room, asking for forgiveness. She only came out after Madam Teo said that the appellant had left. On that day, her friends, Chew, Eunice and Rickson accompanied her to school.
PW6 came looking for her at about 5pm. PW6 had a letter written by the appellant. PW6 said that the appellant had begged her to see PW1. PW6 asked her what happened. PW1 did not say. PW1 obtained permission to leave school early. The two of them went for a meal. After the meal, they returned to PW1`s school. PW1 was concerned that PW3 would look for her there. They waited till 7pm. PW6 went back to Madam Teo`s flat and collected a change of clothes. Both of them went to People`s Park Centre to rent a room. PW1 asked PW6 to call Madam Teo to let PW3 know that they were at People`s Park. PW3 came at 9.30pm.
Following this, there were two meetings with the appellant`s family at People`s Park. PW1 was confused about the date. By this time, PW6`s mother had arrived from Taiwan. The appellant did not turn up at the first meeting, which was in the afternoon. The second meeting in the evening was therefore arranged.
During the second meeting, PW3 asked the appellant to say what he had done to molest PW1 and to admit the truth. The appellant denied the allegations. Subsequently, the appellant and Mrs Teo left in a hurry.
PW3 took PW1 to the police station to lodge a report. PW1 only mentioned about the incident on 21 April in her first information report. This was because this incident was the most recent. It remained freshest in her mind. When she was questioned by the police, she told them about the other incidents.
PW3
PW3 said that PW1 called home on 21 April 1995. PW1 was crying. He asked what had happened, but PW1 wanted to speak to her mother. PW3 asked his wife to take the call. After hearing PW1, PW7 started crying as well. From what PW7 asked PW1, PW3 surmised that PW1 had been molested. PW7 handed the phone to him. He told PW1 to take a taxi home and that he would fly to Singapore that day.
PW3 called Madam Teo. He asked her why the appellant had molested PW1 during tuition. PW3 told Madam Teo that the appellant had kissed PW1, embraced her, caressed her thigh and touched her breasts. He told her that she had to be responsible and asked her to look for PW1. He made several more calls to Madam Teo to find out if PW1 had arrived home safely.
PW3 received a call from the appellant. The appellant said that there was no need for PW1 to go to Singapore as nothing serious happened. The appellant apologised. PW3 hung up the phone. Later, PW1 called to say that she had reached home. He assured her that he would go to Singapore. After this, he made two calls to Taiwan to PW6`s mother. However, he could not reach her.
PW3 arrived in Singapore at about 7pm. He went to PW1`s school but did not find her. He went to Madam Teo`s flat and was told that PW1 was waiting for him at People`s Park Centre. He reached there around 9pm. PW3 took PW1 for a medical examination the next day to determine if she had been raped. PW6`s mother arrived in Singapore that day.
The following day, which was 23 April 1995, PW3 made an appointment to see the appellant at People`s Park Centre at 3pm. Only Mrs Teo and Madam Teo turned up. PW3 insisted that he wanted to see the appellant. He arranged another meeting for the evening.
That evening, PW3, together with PW1, PW6 and PW6`s mother met the appellant. The appellant went with his wife and four other family members. PW3 asked the appellant what he had done to PW1. The appellant replied that he had only caressed PW1`s thigh and kissed her on the cheeks. The appellant apologised. PW3 asked the appellant whether he had done other things. He specifically asked whether PW3 had squeezed PW1`s breasts. The appellant remained silent.
PW3 asked PW1 whether the appellant had squeezed her breast. PW1 said, `Yes, with great force.` PW3 confronted the appellant, who apologised. The appellant insisted that he had only caressed PW1`s thigh and kissed her. PW6`s mother then confronted the appellant. Mrs Teo and the appellant`s daughter stood up and said, `If that`s the case, we will see you in court.` PW3 left when he heard that. The meeting ended and PW3 took PW1 to make a police report.
A tape recording of a telephone conversion between PW3 and Madam Teo was admitted with the consent of the defence. In it, Madam Teo said that the appellant had sometimes admitted and sometimes denied that he touched PW1`s breasts.
PW6
PW6 gave evidence that on 21 April 1995, Madam Teo told her that PW1 said that she was molested by the appellant. Madam Teo asked whether PW6 had also been molested. PW6 remained silent. Madam Teo asked PW6 to speak to the appellant. The appellant asked PW6 to help him. He requested that PW6 go to his flat.
When PW6 reached there, the appellant knelt down and begged her to ask PW1 to tell her father not to come to Singapore. The appellant wrote a letter to enable PW6 to see PW1 in school.
PW6 reached PW1`s school at about 4pm. When she met PW1, PW1 cried. PW6 asked PW1 whether she had been molested by the appellant. PW1 said she had. PW6 told PW1 that she too had been molested. It was the first time she told anyone about this.
PW6 waited for PW1`s lessons to be over. PW1 obtained permission to leave school. Both of them went for a meal. They got wet in the rain. PW6 wanted to change her clothes but PW1 did not want to go back to Madam Teo`s flat. PW6 went home to get a change of clothing. They then went to People`s Park. PW6 called Madam Teo to let her know where they were.
 Other prosecution witnesses 
Chew was PW1`s friend and schoolmate. He testified that on 21 April 1995, PW1 called him on the telephone. She sounded like she was crying. Shortly afterwards, PW1 went to his flat. She was crying. She told him that her tutor molested her. Chew advised her to tell her father or to lodge a police report. She did not tell him where the appellant touched her. Later in the morning, PW1 telephoned again and asked him to accompany her to school as her tutor was downstairs. Chew called Rickson. PW1 came with another girl. They went to school together.
PW7 gave evidence that PW1 telephoned her on the morning of 21 April 1995. PW3 answered the call. PW1 was crying. She asked for her mother. When PW7 took over the call, PW1 told her that her tuition teacher had kissed her, touched her thigh and squeezed her breasts. PW1 said that she had run away. PW7 wept when she heard this. PW3 took over the call.
That morning, the appellant called too. He admitted touching PW1`s thigh and kissing PW1, as well as pressing his hand against her chest. PW7 was very upset. She gave the handset to her husband. PW3 went to Singapore that very day.
Two police officers gave evidence that they recorded statements from the appellant. The statements were not challenged by the appellant and were admitted. In them, the appellant denied the first six incidents. He admitted caressing PW1`s thigh and kissing her. The appellant said that he offered to be PW1`s god-father. When she agreed, he kissed her on the left cheek. He `rubbed` PW1`s thigh during one of the lessons. On that occasion, he advised her to join the `Trim and Fit Club in school to reduce her weight`. He denied squeezing PW1`s breast and kissing her on the lips.
 The defence`s evidence 
The appellant
The appellant testified that he started giving PW1 tuition on 22 March 1995. He gave PW6 tuition from September 1993 to April 1995. Until 21 April 1995, he had never received any complaint.
PW1 arrived for tuition on 21 April 1995 at 8.30am. She told him that she needed to leave early at 9.45am to go to the bank. He agreed. At 9.30am, he sent Mrs Teo to school. On the way, they spoke about adopting a god-daughter. They had been talking about their god-son. Mrs Teo agreed. The appellant went home after dropping Mrs Teo off at the school.
The appellant asked PW1 if she would like to be his god-daughter. She happily agreed. The appellant was pleased and gave her a fatherly peck on the cheek as a sign of acceptance. PW1 said that she was fat. He said, `Fat all over is not good.` The appellant advised her to join the school Trim and Fit Club. He gave her a tap on the thigh for emphasis. PW1 went off happily.
The appellant went to the market. When he returned home, his son told him that Madam Teo had called him. He telephoned Madam Teo and was told that PW3 had called her to complain that the appellant kissed PW1 on the face. The appellant was shocked. He explained to her that PW1 had agreed to be his god-daughter. That was why he gave her a fatherly peck. He called PW3 to explain.
The appellant decided to explain to PW1, so he went to Madam Teo`s house. When PW1 came back, she locked herself in the room and refused to see him. Madam Teo asked him to go home, which he did.
He waited until it was time for PW6 to reach home from school. He telephoned PW6 and explained what happened to her. He asked PW6 to explain what happened to PW1. PW6 reassured him that PW1 would listen to her. She asked the appellant to write her a letter so that she could see PW1 in school. The appellant wrote the note and PW6 took it to PW1`s school. After that, he went to work. In the evening, he told Mrs Teo that the `god-daughter business` had gone off badly and there was a misunderstanding.
On Sunday, he was told that PW3 wanted to see them. Mrs Teo and Madam Teo suggested that they meet PW3 first to see what he wanted. They came back, saying that PW3 said that if the appellant did not show up at 7pm, PW3 would report the matter to the police. The appellant went to the meeting with his family.
PW3 asked the appellant why he had kissed PW1. The appellant said that PW1 ageed to be his god-daughter. PW3 looked at PW1 in surprise. PW1 retorted that she did not give the appellant permission to kiss her. PW3 started to abuse him. When the appellant heard this, he walked away. PW3 did not ask him about anything else apart from the kiss. There was no mention of any incident before 21 April 1995.
The appellant denied that anything happened on the other occasions. He had never seen the tee-shirt which PW1 claimed she wore on 19 April 1995. PW1 normally wore a tee-shirt with a hood.
Mrs Teo
Mrs Teo gave evidence that Fridays were her `late days`. This meant that she would be at home till 9.30am. On Wednesdays, she left home for work at 6.45am. When she was at home, she did housework. According to her, she was a `visible presence`. However, she did not observe the tuition lessons.
On 21 April 1995, Mrs Teo left home at about 9.30am. As usual, the appellant interrupted the lesson to fetch her to work. On the way to the school, they discussed adopting a god-daughter. The appellant suggested PW1.
At about 6.45pm that day, the appellant told her that he had asked PW1 to be their god-daughter. PW1 had agreed. However, things turned out badly after the appellant gave PW1 a peck on the cheek as a fatherly gesture.
On Sunday, Mrs Teo and Madam Teo went to meet PW3 in the afternoon because they were concerned that PW3 would bring thugs to assault or intimidate the appellant. PW3 insisted that unless the appellant met with him, he would report the matter to the police. In the evening, they and their children accompanied the appellant to the meeting, so that the appellant would have help if he was intimidated.
During the meeting, PW3 asked why the appellant had kissed PW1. The appellant looked at PW1 and said, `I asked you to be my god-daughter and you agreed.` PW1 said that she did not give the appellant permission to kiss her. PW3 gave PW1 a quizzical look. PW1 said something inaudible, after which PW3 started to abuse the appellant. The appellant walked off and they followed suit. She denied saying that she would see PW3 in court.
 Madam Teo 
Madam Teo testified that on 21 April 1995, PW1 went for tuition as usual. At about 10am, she received a telephone call from PW3. PW3 asked her why the appellant had touched PW1`s thigh and kissed her on the cheek. Madam Teo said that the appellant was not that kind of person and said that she would clarify from the appellant. The appellant was not at home the first time she called. PW3 telephoned again. He asked whether PW1 was back and threatened to sue.
When the appellant returned Madam Teo`s call, she told him about PW3`s complaint. The appellant said that it could not be. PW1 had left the flat smiling. Madam Teo asked whether the appellant kissed PW1 on the cheek. The appellant said that it was because PW1 had agreed to be his god-daughter. The appellant asked for PW3`s telephone number and said that he would call him. Later, PW1 phoned and said that she was at her friend`s house. She confirmed that she had complained to her father. Madam Teo asked her to go home.
The appellant went to Madam Teo`s home at about 12pm. He wanted to see PW1, but she was not back yet. The appellant waited. PW1 came home. She locked herself in her room when Madam Teo told her that the appellant was there.
In the afternoon, PW6 came home from school. Madam Teo asked her whether the appellant had touched her during tuition. PW6 replied that the appellant had touched her shoulder. Madam Teo told PW6 that PW1 had complained that the appellant had kissed her on the cheek and touched her thigh. PW6 said that PW1 was too conservative as she came from a conservative family. PW6 offered to explain the matter to PW1. PW6 called her mother. Shortly afterwards, the appellant telephoned PW6. PW6 told Madam Teo that she was going to the appellant`s flat. She came back with a letter from the appellant, which she took to PW1`s school.
At about 7pm, PW6 came home. She said that it was not easy to convince PW1. She collected her clothes and left. PW3 called to say that he was at the airport. She told him that PW1 was waiting for him at school. PW6 then called to say that they had rented a room at People`s Park. Later in the evening, PW3 came to Madam Teo`s flat. She told him that PW1 was at People`s Park.
On 23 April 1995, PW3 called to say that he wanted to see the appellant. Madam Teo and Mrs Teo went to meet PW3. PW3 insisted on seeing the appellant. PW3 threatened to call the police if the appellant did not show up. Madam Teo and Mrs Teo went home. She did not go to the meeting in the evening.
Asked about the recorded telephone conversation with PW3, she said that she made up portions of it. PW3 refused to believe that the appellant had not touched PW1`s breast. In order to appease PW3, she told him that the appellant sometimes made admissions.
Madam Teo`s daughter
Madam Teo`s daughter gave evidence that the appellant never touched her during her tuition lesson with him. However, when she got good results, he would tap her on the shoulders to congratulate her. She had seen him kissing his children on special occasions. Under cross-examination, she could only remember one such incident.
On 21 April, she heard Madam Teo speaking to PW6 when she came home from school. PW6 said that she was going to the appellant`s flat to clear up some misunderstanding.
 The finding below 
The magistrate approached the case from the position that in relation to the first six charges, the defence was a bare denial. In relation to the last charge, the appellant admitted that he tapped PW1`s thigh and kissed her on the cheek. The defence was that it was not done with any intention to outrage PW1`s modesty. Therefore the relevant issues were, firstly, in relation to the first six charges, whether the alleged incidents took place at all. In relation to the last charge, whether the appellant touched PW1`s breast and kissed her on the lips as well, with the intention to outrage PW1`s modesty; or whether he merely touched her on the thigh and kissed her on the cheek without any such intention. In the end, it was essentially a question of who to believe, as nobody else was around.
The magistrate was of the view that PW1`s evidence was unusually convincing. There were some minor inconsistencies, but this could be explained by her age. That she did not complain about the first five incidents could be explained by the fact that she did not realise the appellant was molesting her. As for the incident on 19 April, she called her mother but she was not in. It was not unnatural for her to be reluctant to confide in her father. PW1`s explanation in relation to the first incident report that the events on 21 April remained freshest in her mind was accepted. She revealed the other incidents when the police questioned her that night. No adverse inference was drawn against her for failing to shout or scream as there was nobody within sight. The inconsistencies were not significant. PW1`s reaction was consistent with something having happened to her which frightened her.
On the taped conversation, the magistrate held that it was unsafe to convict on it because the admission was not that of the appellant`s. Neither did it show that the appellant had told PW3 about his defence from the start. The conversation only took place in the later half of May 1995. It was not possible to draw any conclusion from the length of the other telephone calls between Indonesia and Singapore on 21 April 1995.
As for Chew, he was an independent witness who gave evidence of PW1`s distressed state. PW6`s evidence ought to be treated with great care as she was a complainant in another set of proceedings. Nevertheless, it did not make sense for her to volunteer to mediate to resolve the misunderstanding and then turn around to accuse the appellant of molest as well. The appellant has said himself in his police statement that he had begged PW6 to help him.
So far as the defence evidence was concerned, the magistrate held that the possibility that the appellant wanted to adopt a god-daughter could not be discounted. However, it did not explain why the appellant had to come into physical contact with PW1. In her view, it was a convenient excuse used to exonerate himself. The appellant knew that he had to be careful with his actions when giving lessons to a student of the opposite sex. PW1 was a new student and he had not yet built a trusting relationship with her.
The explanation given by the appellant for touching PW1`s thigh was unbelievable. There was no reason for PW1 to raise the topic of her physique, especially when they were talking about something totally unrelated to this.
Even if Mrs Teo and the appellant`s son came downstairs frequently, this was of little weight. The appellant could see them when they go downstairs. The appellant had been consistently maintaining his defence. However, this `did not lead inevitably to the conclusion` that the appellant was innocent. Furthermore, the appellant in his statement had said that he had `rubbed` PW1`s thigh, instead of a mere tap.
As for the other defence witnesses, the magistrate held that they were not reliable. She formed the impression that Mrs Teo was tailoring evidence to back up the appellant`s defence. The evidence of Madam Teo`s daughter did not throw much light on the case. Madam Teo`s evidence could not be given much weight. The magistrate was of the view that Madam Teo did not appear to be objective when giving evidence.
In the end, much of evidence revolved around surrounding events rather than the alleged incidents. However, viewing the evidence in totality, the magistrate was convinced that the prosecution`s evidence represented the truth. The defence`s version was disbelieved. The appellant was convicted on all seven charges.
 The appeal 
Counsel for the appellant raised several grounds of appeal. First, I shall deal with the submission that the magistrate erred in failing to consider whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. The magistrate merely said that she was convinced that the prosecution`s version represented the truth. Counsel submitted that the test is whether the defence case casts a doubt on a balance of probabilities (presumably what counsel intended to say was whether there was a reasonable doubt), even if the magistrate was of the view that the prosecution`s case represented the truth.
In my view, there was nothing in the grounds of judgment to indicate that the magistrate did not apply the correct burden or standard of proof. No doubt, the magistrate did not use the words `beyond reasonable doubt`, however, it was clear from the manner she approached the issues that she was looking for proof beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, she addressed herself to the question whether PW1`s evidence was `unusually convincing`. It is pertinent to note that she made a finding that it was, before proceeding to examine the defence evidence. This showed that the magistrate was aware that even if the defence`s evidence was disbelieved, the onus was first and foremost on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The magistrate said that she was convinced that the prosecution`s evidence represented the truth. This was simply another way of saying that she had no reasonable doubt.
It bears repeating that the burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. That standard is impossible to achieve in the vast majority of cases. In almost all cases, there will remain that minutiae of doubt. Witnesses, apparently independent, could have conspired to `frame` an accused. Alternatively, an accused could be the victim of some strange, but unfortunate, set of coincidences. The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal.
Counsel relied on the consistency with which the appellant maintained his defence. However, this was already taken into account by the magistrate. There was therefore no error in this respect, as it does not mean that a consistent defence must always raise a reasonable doubt. In this respect, how PW3 came to know about this contention, as revealed in the taped teleconversation, was not material.
Likewise, the magistrate was entitled to disbelieve the appellant`s allegation that he kissed PW1 on the cheeks because she agreed to be his god-daughter, notwithstanding that the magistrate accepted that it was possible that he wanted to adopt a god-daughter. I agreed with the magistrate that accepting the latter proposition does not in any way mean that the former must also be accepted or that it must necessarily raise a reasonable doubt. The circumstances in which the incident happened and the way it happened are all relevant considerations, which the magistrate rightly took into account.
It was also argued that the evidence of PW3 and PW7 could not corroborate PW1`s evidence as they were her parents. In my view, there is no basis for the proposition that a parent cannot corroborate a child`s evidence. There is no rule of law that a parent is not an independent witness merely because he is a parent of the witness. 
 Teo Thin Chan & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 184
  was relied on by the appellant. However, that case merely revealed that the mother of the child complainant there was `very much of an interested party.` There was no mention of what sort of interest the mother had in the case. I did not find that case persuasive.
In any event, it was quite clear that the magistrate did not treat PW3 and PW7`s evidence as corroboration by independent evidence. Likewise, even though she regarded Chew as an independent witness, she did not treat his evidence as corroboration. The same was true of Chew`s evidence that PW1 appeared distressed. The magistrate`s attention was specifically directed to 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 . If she had regarded any of these witnesses` evidence as corroboration, she would have said so, instead of looking to see if PW1`s evidence was unusually convincing. The words `unusually convincing` are used in situations where the trial judge considered that there was no corroboration.
I would add that there is nothing magical about the words `unusually convincing.` They are but another way of saying that the witness`s testimony was so convincing that the prosecution`s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of that evidence.
I come next to the argument that the prosecution`s evidence contained many inconsistencies, which the learned magistrate ought to have held were material. I agreed with the magistrate that these were indeed minor inconsistencies. They related mainly to what one witness said to another. It is not controversial that in such circumstances, minor inconsistencies are only natural. On the contrary, if there were no such inconsistency at all, it could be argued that this suggested that the evidence was fabricated.
Then, it was argued that the fact that the charges were amended during trial showed that PW1 was not consistent in her description of what happened. I could not agree with this submission. The orginal charges stated that the offences occurred at around 9am. The amendment merely changed this to `between 8.30 to 10.30am`, which was the duration of the tuition lessons. The amendments were minor and quite inconsequential. In any event, whether or not to amend the charge was within the discretion of the prosecuting officer. It cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the charges were amended that the witness had made a previous inconsistent statement.
As for the taped teleconversation between PW3 and Madam Teo, the magistrate held that it was unsafe to convict solely on the basis of this evidence. It would have been more accurate to say that this evidence cannot be relied on at all. It was an out of court statement by Madam Teo in which she said that the appellant `sometimes` admitted to her that he did the alleged acts and sometimes did not. It is hearsay.
Even though the taped conversation could be admitted to impeach Madam Teo`s credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act, it could not be used as evidence of the facts stated therein. In any event, there was no attempt to impeach her credit. Nevertheless, nothing much turned on this. The learned magistrate was aware that there was no admission by the appellant in the taped conversion. She had also accepted Madam Teo`s explanation as plausible. It was merely a slip of the pen.
Turning to the absence of a prior complaint in relation to the earlier alleged incidents, in my view, this issue was addressed by the learned magistrate. In relation to the first five incidents, the answer was simply that PW1 did not know until 19 April 1995 that the appellant intended to molest her. In relation to the incident on 19 April 1995, the magistrate found as a fact that PW1 attempted to call home on 19 April 1995.
A related aspect of this question was the reason given as to why she did not resist or shout when the appellant molested her. The magistrate was of the view that this was because she did not see anyone around at the time. This finding did not quite agree with the undisputed evidence that Mrs Teo was often in the same flat during tuition. Nevertheless, the magistrate was prepared to accept that Mrs Teo was in the flat.
Similarly, there was the issue of why PW1 had continued to go for tuition after the alleged incident on 19 April 1995. PW1`s explanation was that she did not think that the appellant would do the same thing again. She also said that Madam Teo insisted that she must go for tuition. As was mentioned above, PW1 said that she called her mother on 19 April, but she was not in. The magistrate was of the view that it was not unnatural for her to be reluctant to confide in her father.
These are some of the weaknesses in PW1`s evidence. However, I was of the view that the magistrate was nevertheless entitled to reach the conclusion that the case had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. This is because the premise behind the appellant`s version, of a misunderstanding blown out of proportion, was so unlikely that the learned magistrate was entitled to reject it for the reasons stated by her. The magistrate had certainly taken these matters into consideration when assessing the evidence.
This left only the possibility that the alleged god-daughter incident did happen in the way the appellant said it did, and that PW1 understood the nature of the alleged fatherly peck and innocent tap on the thigh but nevertheless chose maliciously to blow the matter up. Alternatively, the god-daughter story was concocted by the appellant out of fear that the court would not believe his bare denial, though he did not do what PW1 alleged he did.
In this respect, a `bare denial` does not carry the connotation that it cannot be true. On this point, I could not accept the learned deputy public prosecutor`s submission that a prima facie case cannot be answered by a bare denial. This is because if it was really the case that nothing at all happened, there would be nothing but a bare denial. It is in the very nature of such offences that they are often committed when no one else is around. Just as it is difficult for the prosecution to produce corroborative evidence in the case of a guilty accused, it is equally difficult for an innocent accused to produce in court anything more than a bare denial. It would be very dangerous to discount the accused`s evidence merely because it is a `bare denial`.
Both possibilities would imply that all the allegations were concocted by PW1. They envisage that PW1 made the accusations maliciously against the appellant for hidden reasons. However, it was inconceivable that such a possibility did not cross the magistrate`s mind when assessing PW1`s credibility, even though they were not expressly referred to in the grounds of judgment. This was especially so in the light of 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
 , which was specifically brought to her attention. It is therefore unnecessary for me to dwell at length on this.
It is trite law that an appellate court will defer to the trial judge`s finding of fact. The trial judge enjoys the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses as they give evidence. An appellate court will not lightly disturb the finding unless it can be shown to be plainly wrong or, in the case of a criminal appeal, that there remains a lurking doubt.
There could hardly have been a more vivid example of why this is so in the present case. Counsel informed me that PW1 demonstrated to the magistrate what the appellant did to her. Counsel argued that what PW1 had demonstrated could not amount to a molest. This was not an argument that was open to counsel. The demonstration was not done before me. Unlike the magistrate, I did not see anything. I could not overturn the magistrate`s clear finding of fact on the basis of what counsel said from the bar.
In the circumstances, there was insufficient basis for me to disturb the convictions. The magistrate had meticulously identified all the relevant issues and had directed her mind towards them. I therefore dismissed the appeal against conviction.
 Sentence 
Counsel made no submission on the sentence even though the notice of appeal was against both conviction and sentence. Nevertheless, I was obliged to interfere as I was of the view that some of the sentences were manifestly excessive.
The appellant was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment for each of the first five charges. He was sentenced to three and four months` imprisonment for the charges relating to the incidents on 19 and 21 April 1995 respectively. The sentences for the first three charges were ordered to run concurrently and those for the last four were to run consecutively, making a total of nine months` imprisonment.
In 
 Nordin bin Ismail v PP 
[1996] 1
 CLAS News 
 250, the appellant was a police corporal who molested a woman police constable at the police station. Two of the charges were that he placed his hand on her shoulder and on her waist respectively. Like the present case, the appellant there had no previous conviction. He was originally sentenced to three and four months` imprisonment for each of these two offences. On appeal, I reduced the sentence to $500 fine, in default one week`s imprisonment, for each of the two offences.
No grounds of judgment was delivered for that case, and it is unfortunate that it is not better known. I take this opportunity to reiterate that in respect of relatively minor acts of molest under s 354, a fine is generally more appropriate. So far as the seriousness of the first five charges in the present case are concerned, they were, in essence, much the same as that in 
 Nordin bin Ismail v PP 
 . Accordingly, I reduced the sentence on each of the first five offences to a $500 fine, in default one week`s imprisonment. Hence, the appellant`s total sentence was seven months` imprisonment and fines of $2,500, in default, a further five weeks` imprisonment.

Disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence
  – 
Discretion to limit disqualification to specific classes of vehicles -s 3 Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189)
 
The appellant appealed against the sentence of disqualificationimposedby the district judge upon his conviction of an offence under the MotorVehicles (Third-Party Risks and Comp ensation) Act (Cap 189) (the Act). Idismissed that appeal and now give my reasons.
The relevant charge against the appellant read: 
 
You, Ashley James Stewart are charged that on the 27th of May 1995 atabout 1.45 am along Cairnhill Road, Singapore, did permit one Anthony JohnRedman to use motor cycle no AX 9800 K when there was not in force in relationto the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of thethird party risk as complies with the requirements of this Act, and you havethereby committed an offence under s 3(1) and punishable under section 3(2) ofthe same Act.
 
 
 
The trial judge imposed a $600 fine, with 1 week`simprisonment indefault, and 1 year`s disqualification from driving all classes ofvehicles. The appellant was also fined on another charge of allowing a personwithout a licence to use his motorcycle. There was no appeal against thatsentence.
The appellant admitted to the prosecution`s statement ofthefacts. This disclosed that on 27 May 1995 the appellant allowed one AnthonyJohn Redman, a friend of his, to ride his motorcycle. The insurance policy forthe motorcycle only covered the appellant.
 The appeal 
The appellant contended that he should not have been disqualifiedfromholding a licence in respect of all classes of vehicles. He argued that thiswas unfair as it was more severe than Redman`s sentence - hisfriend was only disqualified from holding a class 2 driving licence. It wassaid that both the appellant and Redman were equally culpable in the offencescommitted. In fairness to the appellant, it had to be noted that he refrainedfrom riding his motorcycle at the time of the incident as he did not wish tobreak the law, having consumed alcohol.
Counsel for the appellant made reference to a number of decisions inwhich general disqualification was imposed. These cases were distinguished asinvolving serious driving offences, reflecting poor attitude. It was said thatgeneral disqualification is justified only where the offender displays ablatant disregard for the law. In contrast, here the appellant had only failedto appreciate that his insurance policy did not cover Redman, and that was amistake committed after the consumption of alcohol. The appellant had alsoshown sufficient remorse for his act.
 The respondent`scase 
The prosecution argued that disqualification under s 3(2) ismandatory,citing 
 PP v 
 MohdIsa 
[1963] MLJ 135
, and noted that the only exception to that iswherespecial reasons pertaining to the commission of the offence exist. It wasfurther argued that a general disqualification was not manifestly excessivefor, unlike s 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act which also empowersdisqualification, there is no express proviso to s 3(2) allowing the court torestrict such disqualification to a particular class. In this context then, itwas submitted that general disqualification should be imposed as a norm inorder that it deters vehicle owners from using their vehicles in circumstancesendangering the user and other persons on the roads, and leaving them withoutany compensation should the user not be able to satisfy judgment. Thisconsideration was so important that it justified a deterrent sentence eventhough the appellant had pleaded guilty (
 Sim Gek Yong vPP 
[1995] 1 SLR 537
 cited).
That the appellant had valid licences in respect of other classesofvehicles meant that a limited restriction would not serve the objective of themandatory disqualification. There was also an aggravating factor for theappellant had put not only Redman but also at least three other drivers atrisk in disregarding his insurance policy. That Redman`s sentence waslenient was not a basis for a reduction in the appellant`s sentence forthe latter was appropriate on the facts (
 Yong Siew Soonv PP 
[1992] 2 SLR 933
 cited). The prosecution referred to a number of othercases where a general disqualification was imposed.
 The issue 
The sole question that arises is whether a discretion isconferred uponthe court to restrict disqualification ordered under s 3(2) of the Act to aspecific class of vehicles. Section 3(1) and (2) read:
 
(1)Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any personto use or to cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle unlessthere is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that personor that other person, as the case may be, such a policy of insurance or such asecurity in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements ofthis Act.
(2) )If a person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of anoffence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or toimprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both and a personconvicted of an offence under this section shall (unless the court for specialreasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power ofthe court to order a longer period of disqualification) be disqualified forholding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act for a periodof 12 months from the date of the conviction ...
 
 
 
The effect of sub-s (2) is that upon conviction disqualificationwillnormally be ordered, unless special reasons are shown. The appellant did nottake issue with that. His argument centred on whether such disqualificationshould normally extend to all classes of vehicles.
The plain wo rds of the section speak of a disqualificationagainst theholding of a driving licence. There is no limitation that the driving licenceis one for a specific class. The use of the generic term then leads to theconclusion that a general disqualification follows.
In contrast, a discretion to limit disqualification to specificclassesis provided for by s 42 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) which reads in itsmaterial portion: 
 
(1)A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection withthe driving of a motor-vehicle may, in any case except where otherwiseexpressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, orderhim to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life orfor such period as the court may think fit except that if the court thinksfit, any disqualification imposed under this section may be limited to thedriving of a motor vehicle of the same class or description as the motorvehicle in relation to which the offence was committed.
 
 
 
That such a discretion is specified in s 42 reinforces theconclusionthat a s 3(2) disqualification is general. However, the court is mindful ofthe caution required in using a provision from a separate statute ininterpreting s 3(2).
Nonetheless, the conclusion is supported to some extent bylegislativehistory. The predecessor provisions to s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act,referred to as the insurance disqualification provisions, can be traced backfor present purposes to the Road Traffic (Third-Party Insurance) Ordinance (No8 of 1938). Section 3(2) of that Ordinance is in material terms similar to thepresent s 3(2). In 1941, though, that Ordinance was consolidated with variousother enactments in the Road Traffic Ordinance (No 17). The equivalent of s3(2) was s 48(2), and was contained in Part II of the enactment. In 1960, theinsurance and other related provisions contained in the 1941 enactment andre printed in Cap 227 of 1955 were repealed and re-enacted as Ordinance 1 ofthat year.
The predecessor provisions of s 42 of the Road Traffic Act,referred toas the traffic disqualification provisions, can be traced back to the RoadTraffic Ordinance of 1941. The relevant preceding statute, the TractionEngines and Motor Cars Ordinance (Cap 214 of 1936), did not contain anequivalent traffic disqualification section. It was only in the 1941 Ordinancethat there was such an equivalent.
Although an insurance disqualification provision existed before1941,there was no traffic disqualification provision before that time. That the1941 Ordinance had the two types of disqualification, and that they weredifferently worded raises a clear inference that the legislature intended adifference in the scope of the discretion of the court in defining the ambitof disqualification. Though the provisions have now been re-enacted inseparate statutes, the distinction between the two still remains, which lendsweight to the conclusion that while there may be a discretion in terms ofdisqualification under s 42 of the Road Traffic Act, none exists under the s3(2) of the Act.
No assistance can be derived from contemporary legislativedebates, particularly since the origins of the provisions lie in pre-war days. However,considerations of policy would lead to the same result. Section 3(2) isprimarily concerned with ensuring that persons using the roads take adequatesteps to ensure that compensation would be available to persons involved inaccidents with them. A contravention of s 3(1) is a serious offence. Ofcourse, incidents involving such contravention would not necessarily be fatal,nor need there be any injuries at all. Nonetheless it is clear that a strictprophylactic approach is necessary to ensure that there is adequate provisionfor compensation. Taking this into account, the absence of a discretion isjustified and necessary.
Counsel was unable to point out any case in which adisqualificationunder s 3(2) was limited only to a specific class. There was one appeal heardby this court in which the disqualification ordered under s 3(2) wasrestricted (
 Samnasivams/o 
 Sharma v PP 
[1992] 2 SLR 580
). However, the question of a general disqualificationunder s 3(2) was not in issue since the appeal was concerned primarily withthe imposition by the magistrate of a general disqualification forcontravention of s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act in driving while under adisqualification. That case cannot stand as authority for the proposition thata discretion exists under s 3(2).
In the course of his submissions, counsel referred to the factthatRedman was only given a disqualification from holding a class 2 licence inrespect of a similar charge under s 3(2). However, it seemed clear uponperusing the court file that his disqualification extended to allclasses.
 Conclusion 
The appeal was therefore dismissed.

This was an appeal from the decision of the district judge convicting the appellant on a joint charge of trafficking in cannabis. The co-accused, one Abdul Aziz Bin Ahtam (Aziz) was also convicted, but was not involved in this appeal. I allowed the appeal, and now give my reasons.
The charge against them read:
 
You, Abdul Aziz Bin Ahtam, male, 21 years, IC No 7222796D, and Goh Kim Hong, male, 25 years, IC No 6926145J, are charged that you on or about 18 June 1994 at about 1.58am, in motor car bearing registration number SZ 8607K along Dunearn Road near Hillcrest Road, Singapore, together with Teo Tian Hoe IC No A 0455522 (Malaysia), in furtherance of the common intention of three of you, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class OA` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking in not less than 330g and not more than 550g of cannabis in motor car bearing registration number, SZ 8607K along Dunearn Road, Singapore, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and by virtue of s 17 and s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
An alternative charge specified that they had in furtherance of their common intention trafficked in the cannabis by transporting it in the car, and had therefore committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (MDA) read with s 34, Penal Code (Cap 224), and punishable under s 33, MDA. The appellant was sentenced to 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. He was also charged and convicted of the consumption of a cannabinol derivative, but he has not appealed against that conviction.
 Brief facts 
On 18 June 1994, at about 1.40am, a car, bearing licence plate number SZ 8607K, was stopped at a police road block along Dunearn Road. One of the officers manning the road block noticed that the car had switched from the centre lane to the left lane and stopped for a while, before moving forward to the road block.
The driver was Aziz. The appellant was seated in front, while a third person, one Teo Tiang Hoe, Michael, (Teo) sat in the rear. The officers inspected the car. Teo opened the boot, where the officers found a green sports bag, bearing the brand OSanlino`, in which there was a polythene bag. Inside that polythene bag was a block of vegetable matter. An officer, PC Lee Tuan Loy, asked Teo whether the block belonged to him. Teo said that some of the things were his, and some were not. Aziz and Goh denied owning the vegetable block. Their suspicions aroused, the police officers arrested the three persons, and brought them back to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters.
Various items were recovered from the vehicle. In the boot of the car there was the vegetable block, which was actually wrapped in a newspaper. In the side pocket of the green sports bag, there was another packet of vegetable matter. From the rear seat of the car the police recovered an attach&8e; case, containing amongst other things, two packets and two paper wrappings of vegetable matter. From the back pocket of the front seat, a plastic bottle was taken. In front, vegetable matter was present inside a Tupperware container. More of it was found in an envelope on a shelf below the glove compartment.
Upon testing by the Department of Scientific Services, 3.53 grams were found in the envelope, 1.84 grams in the Tupperware container, 18.30 grams of cannabis from one packet and two paper wrappings, 25.85 and 13.86 grams in packets, and 477.7 grams in the block. Stains of tetrahydrocannibinol and cannabinol were also detected in the bottle.
Although raids were conducted on the homes of Aziz and the appellant, no drugs were found. A black Sanlino bag was found at the room rented by Teo, but no there was no evidence adduced in this trial that there were drugs there. Money was found on both Aziz and the appellant. Aziz had $1,058 with him, and 10 Saudi Riyals, while Goh had only $12 and 100 South Korean Wons.
Aziz gave a statement under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to the CNB. This was adduced in evidence. The material portions read: 
 
On 17 June 1994 at about 7.30pm as I was crossing the road from Tanjong Pagar to Amara Hotel, Michael Teo honked at me. He was the driver of the car, SZ 8607K and was with Alan Goh [the appellant]. I then went into the back seat of the car. It was a chance meeting. When I entered the car, I saw that the bottle was already at the back pocket of the front passenger seat and the yellow container on top of the handbrake. The attach&8e; case was also at the back seat on the right side and it belongs to Michael Teo. Michael drove the car to Peninsula Plaza where he alighted leaving Alan and I in the car. Michael told us that he was going to meet a friend. Before alighting, Michael told me to pass the attach&8e; case to him. I saw him opening the attach&8e; case and taking out two to three long type window envelopes bearing the name OSumida`. I also noticed that the envelopes contained cannabis. Michael then placed the envelopes in the pocket of his trouser before handing back the attach&8e; case to me. He then left the car. He came back less than 5 minutes later. Michael Teo then drove the car off to Ginza Plaza at West Coast Road. Upon arriving there, he alighted from the car and told us that he was meeting a friend leaving Alan and I inside the car. Michael Teo returned to the car about 5 minutes later. He then drove to the hawker centre on the opposite side of the road. I then saw him walking to the hawker centre. When he came back, Michael Teo drove to the MacDonald`s Drive Thru Restaurant at East Coast Parkway. After collecting our food, we continued with our journey to Tampines where there was a police road block. That time was between 9.45pm and 10pm. However, we were checked and we were allowed to pass through.
 
 
 
We then travelled through various places and it was actually a joyride. Michael Teo was the driver throughout the journey. When I first entered the car at about 7.30pm along Tanjong Pagar Road, Michael Teo has already started to smoke cannabis in the car. The bottle with a pipe attached was used to smoke the drug which were taken out from the yellow container. The bottle was passed between Michael Teo and I throughout the car journey. Along the Pan Island Expressway, I told Michael Teo that I wanted to go home as I needed to go to work the following day. I also told him I wanted to borrow the car as I intended to go out with my fiancee the next day. Along Eng Neo Avenue, Michael Teo told me to take over the wheel as he was feeling tired. At the same time, he told me that the Othing` was under the driver`s seat and was for me. The Othing` Michael Teo referred to was cannabis and it was for my own consumption. From Eng Neo Avenue, I drove along Dunearn Road as I intended to sent Michael Teo back to his rented room at No 60 Watten Estate. I remember that throughout the journey, Alan Goh was seated in the front seat and I noticed that he was rather quiet and seldom talked. I also remember that when I took over the driving, he told me that he wanted to bring the sport bag back. This sport bag was the one found in the boot when we were arrested. However, along Dunearn Road, we were stopped by the road block and arrested.
 
 
 
I also remember that after we left the McDonald`s Drive Thru Restaurant, Michael Teo asked me to take something from the boot of the car. I then lowered down the back rest of the back seat and I saw the sport bag there in the boot. I then asked Michael Teo why the sport bag was still inside there and he replied that he forgot to bring it out. I knew the sport bag contained a block of cannabis. I suspected that the block of cannabis was still inside the bag. The first time I saw the sport bag containing the block of cannabis was sometime on 14 June 94 in the evening when he came in the car, SZ 8607K, to pick me up after my work. We then picked Alan Goh at his block and we proceeded to one of the car parks in Marina South to smoke cannabis. Upon arriving there, Michael Teo opened up the boot of the car and showed Alan Goh and I the sport bag. He opened up the sport bag and we saw the block of cannabis wrapped with newspaper and in a plastic bag. Michael Teo told us that one Mike passed the drug to him. The sport bag is green in colour. After showing the bag to us, he left it in the boot.
 
 
 
The statement further disclosed that Aziz first met the appellant sometime in 1989, and that in 1990 he was introduced by the appellant to Teo. Aziz also said that he had contributed to the rental of the car, but hardly used it.
Also adduced was the note found in the organiser of the appellant which read:
 
I`ve always treated you as a friend and I`m very disappointed that you [unintelligible word but probably would] did (this) [sic].
 
 
 
 
 
Did I ever reject you?
 
 
 
 
 
If I wanna Ocheat`/hurt you, I wud [sic] have find a supplier and under cut (Eng Tiong) you.
 
 
 
 
 
I`ll earn a lot then. But why?
 
 
 
 
 
You know I have ah longs and you know you didn`t wanna help me. Some more you asked me to foot for the bill on 6/6 at (Rex) restaurant.
 
 
 
 
 
Can I ask you whether u treat me as a friend or your men.
 
 
 
 
 
Inspirations: car 6/6/94.
 
 
 
 
 
 Determination of a case to answer 
 
 
 
The trial judge found that prima facie cases had been made out against both Aziz and the appellant. His Honour noted that Aziz and the appellant were in the car driven by Teo for six hours, and were consuming cannabis during that journey. It was also thought significant that the appellant`s memo pad and organiser were found in Teo`s attach&8e; case. The trial judge found further that the note written by the appellant gave rise to the suspicion that he was involved in trafficking. Also noted was the fact that the three of them had known each other for some time.
From Aziz`s statement, which was considered a confession available for use against the appellant under s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) the trial noted that Teo was seen making deliveries of envelopes containing cannabis at various points during the journey, that Aziz knew of the block of cannabis in the boot, and that three days before the arrest, Teo had shown Aziz and the appellant that block in the boot.
It was held then Aziz`s confession suggested that he committed the offence, and implicated the appellant.
 The decision 
Both Aziz and Goh gave evidence on their own behalf. No other witnesses were called. At the end of the trial, the trial judge was of the view that the appellant had lied and that Aziz was trying to protect him by modifying his testimony. He thus rejected the defence evidence and accepted that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge imposed the minimum mandatory punishment of 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
 The appeal 
The appellant`s case
The appellant argued primarily that there was no case for him to answer at the close of the prosecution`s case. It was said that the essential elements of the charge, namely the commission of the offence by the appellant, that they were in possession, and that there was a common intention to commit the offence, were not proven.
The respondent`s case
The prosecution maintained that the evidence adduced justified the calling of the defence. It was said that the appellant had the drugs in his possession and that there was common intention to traffic; alternatively, the drugs were deemed by the operation of s 18(4) of the MDA to be in the possession of the appellant since it was in the possession of Teo with the appellant`s knowledge and consent.
 The issues 
The appeal then turned really on whether it was shown at the end of the prosecution`s case that a prima facie case had been made out. And of the elements of the charge, the ones that were in issue were possession and common intention.
Possession
There were two possible lines of argument to show that the appellant was in possession of the drugs. The first relied on the fact that he knew that there was cannabis in the boot. The second involved the presumption under s 18(4) of the MDA.
Knowledge of cannabis in the boot
It was insufficient for the prosecution to rely simply on the appellant`s knowledge of the drugs in the boot to show that these were in his possession. Mere knowledge is insufficient to establish possession ~ there has to be an indication that there was some control over the drugs (
 Foong Seow Ngui v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 785
 at 802F). Indeed, that knowledge is by itself insufficient normally to establish possession is clearly indicated by the need for s 18(4) which provides for the deeming of possession where there is only knowledge and consent. On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, including Aziz`s statement, there was nothing which showed that the appellant had possessed those drugs.
Presumption of joint possession
There is no need to show control when reliance is placed on s 18(4) which states
 
Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
 
 
 
That deeming would be sufficient to fix the appellant with possession, but it will have to be shown that such possession was for the purpose of trafficking, and no reliance may be placed upon the presumption in s 17 MDA (
 Foong Seow Ngui 
 at 804D). Such possession for trafficking by the appellant could not on the prosecution`s facts be shown ~ that evidence indicated nothing more than that he was in the car, and that he knew of the activities of Teo and Aziz, and of the drugs contained in the boot.
The overt acts of trafficking were committed by persons other than the appellant. The only way the prosecution could have made out its case was on the basis that there was a common intention amongst them to traffic in the drugs. The appeal thus turned primarily on the question of common intention.
For common intention to exist, there has to be a pre-arranged plan, see 
 Mahbub Shah v Emperor 
 AIR 1945 PC 118 where the Privy Council said:
 
It is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case [at p 120].
 
 
 
In 
 PP v Ho So Mui 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 59
, the Court of Appeal approved of the effect of the above. The charge here did not specify what the common intention was, but it was clear that it had to be a common intention to traffic (
 Hartej Sidhu v PP 
 [1992] 2 SLR 598).
In the decided cases, common intention has generally only been found where there is some evidence of involvement by the accused person. In 
 Jasbir Singh v PP 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 18
, one of the co-accused was told by the other to carry a plastic bag containing drugs for him. That co-accused agreed. The trial court there found this to be sufficient to show common intention, and the Court of Appeal found no reason to disturb that finding. The Court of Appeal also agreed with the decision of the trial judge in 
 Hartej Sidhu v PP 
 [1992] 2 SLR 598, that the fact that a co-accused had negotiated for the sale of drugs in the possession of the accused was sufficient to disclose common intention. In 
 Lee Yuan Kwang v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 349
, one of the accused, Quek, had driven the vehicle in which a drug transaction had taken place, and in which drugs were found. Quek in his defence claimed that he had no knowledge of the drugs, and that he thought that he was delivering contraband cigarettes. The trial judge, with whom the Court of Appeal agreed, rejected his evidence and found that he knew what it was he was delivering. Common intention to traffic in drugs was found to have been made out. As can be seen, all of these cases involved some form of participation by the person charged with having common intention.
The present appeal lacked any indication of involvement by the appellant. All that the prosecution`s evidence showed was that he was a mere hanger-on; that is someone merely along for the ride. This will be seen from an analysis of the evidence before the trial judge which he found to have indicated that common intention.
The trial judge in his decision chose not to separate common intention from the acts in furtherance of it. It would seem that the same set of facts led him to find both common intention and the furtherance of it. These were as adduced by the prosecution:
 
 
(i) ) the note; 
 
(ii) ) the appellant being in the car, paying for its use, and having personal items in the care of Teo; and 
 
(iii) ) the appellant knowing the activities of Teo and Aziz
  
 
 
None of these disclosed any common intention to traffic in cannabis. Even if each of them were accepted, the appellant would have only been guilty of apathy as to the trafficking of drugs by Teo.
The note
The effect of the note was ambiguous. The link between that note and trafficking is wholly tenuous and incredible. There is no reference anywhere in that note to drug trafficking or cannabis. All it speaks of is undercutting, and better treatment. As it stood at the end of the prosecution case, the note in no way implicated the appellant. None of the circumstances surrounding it would have coloured it as part of a sinister transaction. The trial judge was not justified in finding that the use of the terms Osupplier`, Oundercutting` and Oearning a lot` by themselves indicated that the appellant was involved in trafficking.
The presence of the appellant in the car
The trial judge found the presence of the appellant in the car significant because it indicated his knowledge of the activities of Teo and Aziz. In particular, it was found that the appellant must have known about the block of cannabis in the boot because, first, he was shown it by Teo on 14 July and, secondly, he would have heard Teo mentioning it on the day of the arrest. A related point thought significant by the trial judge was that the three of them had, by the time of the arrest, been travelling for six hours.
Even if it was accepted that the appellant would have known about the large block of cannabis in the boot, this did not in any way implicate the appellant in a prearranged plan involving him in the trafficking of cannabis. Mere knowledge of the presence of drugs is not an offence, nor is it any indication of involvement in trafficking. Similarly, his knowledge of the activities of Teo, and possibly Aziz, would not be relevant in establishing common intention unless it was shown that these activities were part of a prearranged plan involving him.
The judge thought it incongruous that the appellant would have remained in the car if he was not involved in trafficking. He could not accept that the three of them would have been in the car for a long joy ride. However, it was in evidence by the prosecution itself that Aziz and the appellant consumed cannabis at different points in the journey. And for much of the trip before dinner, the presence of the appellant at least was incidental to the journey taken. The prosecution evidence did not disclose that the appellant was either concerned with or consulted about the destinations. He was a mere passenger in every sense of the word. Thus his being in the car could not be any indication of his complicity.
Common intention to traffic was deduced as well by the trial judge from the presence of the appellant`s personal effects, namely his organiser and memo pad, in the attach&8e; case belonging to Teo. Even if the appellant had put these items in the attach&8e; case, it is difficult to see how this would have implicated him in a plan to traffic.
Knowledge of the activities of Teo and Aziz
Teo leaving the car with envelopes of cannabis was considered to implicate the appellant. Again, mere knowledge of the activities of Teo would not lead to any conclusion that there was common intention to traffic. No evidence adduced by the prosecution showed the appellant`s involvement in any way, beyond his mere acquiescence in and silence on the activities of his friends. And even if the appellant, Aziz and Teo were on their way back to Teo`s home, and Teo intended to take the drugs out once they reached there, this did not indicate the appellant`s participation in the transporting of the drugs.
Cumulative effect
At times though the individual strands of evidence are insufficient on their own to lead to a particular conclusion, the cumulative effect when taken together may be enough to warrant a finding against an accused (
 Ang Sunny v PP 
 
[1966] 2 MLJ 195
; [1965D1968] SLR 67.) This is not the case here. Even if the facts adduced by the prosecution were taken together, they would not disclose any prearranged plan.
 Conclusion 
What the prosecution has to establish at the end of its case is specified by s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code: 
 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal, or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter his defence.
 
 
 
The court then has to be satisfied that the elements of the charge have been made out on the basis that the primary facts adduced are true, and that reasonable inferences can be drawn from them (
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
; [1980D1981] SLR 73; 
 Ng Theng Shuang v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
). But here, as examined above, the prosecution`s primary facts and reasonable inferences from those facts did not support the charge at all. In these circumstances, the defence of the appellant should not have been called. The conviction was wrong and the appeal was therefore allowed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court, was convicted in the district court on the following charge:
 
You, Narinder Singh s/o Malagar Singh, M/45 years, NRIC No S2000696Z, are charged that you in conjunction with one Hartej Singh Sidhu, a condemned prisoner, on 18 May 1995, at or about 5pm, at Changi Prison, Jalan Awan, Singapore, did corruptly solicit for the family of the said Hartej Singh Sidhu, a gratification, to wit, a sum of $100,000 from one Baldev Singh, the son of another condemned prisoner, Sarjit Singh s/o Anokh Singh, on account of Hartej Singh Sidhu exonerating the said Sarjit Singh s/o Anokh Singh by his signed statement, to wit,
 
 
 
 
 
OI, Hartej Singh Sidhu c/o Changi Prison Cond No 476/93 hereby state that Sarjit Singh c/o Changi Prison Cond No 477/93 is innocent and was not involved in the drug trafficking transaction. The transaction was done by me solely.`
 
 
 
 
 
of any complicity in the drug trafficking transaction concerned in Criminal Case No 52 of 1991 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241).
 
 
 
Upon his conviction, the appellant was sentenced to five months` imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence.
 The undisputed facts 
The undisputed facts of the case were as follows. Hartej Singh Sidhu (Hartej) and Sarjit Singh s/o Anokh Singh (Sarjit) were both convicted on 21 January 1993 by the High Court on two charges of trafficking in 600.8g of diamorphine and 9,371g of opium. They were then represented by assigned counsel John Abraham (Abraham) and Subhas Anandan (Subhas) respectively. Both appealed against their convictions and the death sentences imposed. On appeal the counsel assigned to act for Hartej was the appellant, whilst the counsel assigned to Sarjit was NK Rajah (Rajah). Both appeals were dismissed on 16 May 1994.
Subsequently the appellant and Rajah were further assigned to act for Hartej and Sarjit respectively in the preparation of their petitions for clemency to the President. Both petitions were rejected by the President and the two men were told that they would be executed on 19 May 1995. The prosecution`s and the appellant`s accounts of what then transpired differed in crucial aspects; and since one of the appellant`s main grounds of appeal relied on the contention that the district judge should have accepted his versions of events, I shall set out both versions in some detail.
 The prosecution`s version of events 
The prosecution`s version of the events leading up to the offence on 18 May 1995 was drawn mainly from the evidence of Sarjit`s son Baldev Singh (Baldev) and Sarjit`s lawyer, Rajah.
Baldev`s evidence
Baldev gave evidence that on 18 May 1996, he went to Changi Prison to visit his father at about 1.30pm. He was accosted by his mother, who informed him that Sarjit wished to speak to him urgently and that Othe other accused Hartej had written on a small slip of paper in Punjabi that the [sic] takes the blame`. Baldev immediately telephoned Rajah to tell him about this. According to Baldev, Rajah told him Oit would not work Ã‰ the execution would not be stopped`. In response to Baldev`s query, Rajah also said that he was not in touch with the appellant. Baldev subsequently telephoned the appellant`s office and left him a message to the effect that he should come to Changi Prison as soon as possible.
The piece of paper on which Hartej had allegedly written down his intention to Otake the blame` was exhibited in court as D1. The translation exhibited as D1T shows, in fact, no such intention. All that Hartej said was:
 
In my opinion it should be this way: that both our counsels should discuss with one another about our case and assess as to which one of us can be saved.
 
 
 
Rajah and the appellant arrived at Changi Prison together in the afternoon of 18 May 1995. They proceeded to the visiting area to see their respective clients. According to Baldev, Sarjit was then seated in Othe extreme left cubicle` whilst Hartej was in Othe extreme right cubicle` (there being five cubicles altogether in the visiting area). Rajah and the appellant went to their respective client`s cubicles. Sarjit showed Oa slip of paper` to Rajah and told him that Hartej was prepared to take the blame. Rajah replied that nothing was going to work and that Sarjit should Ojust prepare for tomorrow`. Some discussion followed between Sarjit and Rajah, following which Rajah stepped outside the cubicle. Baldev presumed at this stage that he had gone to talk to the appellant, although he did not actually see this. When Rajah returned, he said that the appellant Owould take (Sarjit`s) statement` whilst he (Rajah) would take Hartej`s statement. Although this account is somewhat garbled, what Baldev appeared to be saying was that Rajah had stated that both Sarjit and Hartej were to make statements each exonerating the other of blame in the drug trafficking offence. This was not done.
Baldev then left the visiting area with his family. He waited for Rajah at the waiting area outside the main gate of Changi Prison. When Rajah came out, he was with the appellant who proceeded to call Baldev aside. At this point Rajah and another lawyer Thangavelu were also present. According to Baldev:
 
[the appellant] said that Hartej Singh had written a letter demanding for $100,000 and that he had taken the blame for $100,000. I think it was in Singapore currency. My reply was that it was too much money and I asked whether there was any guarantee that my father`s life would be saved. NS Kang said there is no guarantee for anything Ã‰ NK Rajah said that this is all nonsense and just to prepare for tomorrow. NK Rajah did not ask me to pay the money. NK Rajah just said it was all nonsense and just to prepare for tomorrow Ã‰
 
 
 
 
 
On my way home NK Rajah paged for me. I returned his call. He told me ODon`t be worried and just prepare for tomorrow`. I asked him whether there was any way he could stop the execution. He told me nothing could be done and just to prepare for tomorrow.
 
 
 
On the evening of the same day, Baldev telephoned the appellant and asked if there was any way he could help. He was told to go to the appellant`s office, where he again asked the appellant whether the appellant could Ohelp to stop the execution`. In response the appellant asked him if he agreed with Hartej`s demand for money. Baldev stated that they could Otalk about the money later but try to stop the execution`. He asked the appellant whether Oif the 100,000 is given would (Sarjit`s) life be spared` and was again met with the reply that there could be no such guarantee. Both the appellant and Baldev then made unsuccessful attempts to contact Rajah, after which Baldev left the appellant`s office.
In addition to the above evidence, Baldev also testified that sometime in August 1994 he had visited the appellant`s office in the company of one Kaka Singh. He made this visit because, on that same day, he had seen his father at Changi Prison and his father had told him that Hartej Owanted to take the blame` in return for 100,000 rupees. Baldev relayed this to the appellant and indicated his willingness to pay the 100,000 rupees if his father`s life could be saved. Baldev stated that the appellant said he Owould think about it`. Under cross-examination he added that the appellant had also counter-offered 200,000 rupees on Hartej`s behalf, in return for a statement from Sarjit exonerating Hartej. Thereafter, it appears that Baldev visited the appellant one more time and reminded him to go and see Hartej. The appellant obtained from Baldev $500 as a fee for doing so, but later told Baldev that he did not have time to see Hartej and refunded the $500.
Under cross-examination, Baldev stated that he had discussed with Rajah on two or three occasions the possibility of getting a statement from Hartej which would exonerate his father of involvement in the drug trafficking offence. He could not recall whether, in the course of these discussions, he had told Rajah about the 100,000 rupees demanded by Hartej. He stated that Rajah had told him to see the appellant as he (Rajah) did not want to get involved. He could not remember whether he told Rajah about the outcome of his visit to the appellant`s office in August 1994. He claimed, however, that prior to 18 May 1995 he had already told Rajah about the $500 fee he paid the appellant.
Rajah`s evidence
According to Rajah, he received three telephone calls from Baldev on 18 May 1995. The first telephone call was at about 11.30am. During this call, Baldev told Rajah that Hartej had now confessed Oto taking the blame` for the drug trafficking offence and that Sarjit Ohad a document written in Punjabi`. Rajah replied that a confession from Hartej would not work because of Othe nature of the evidence` in the case. Five minutes later, however, Baldev called again with the message that Sarjit insisted on Rajah coming to see him. Rajah replied that he would fax the record office of Changi Prison for a copy of the Punjabi document. He did in fact send such a fax (exh P3A). He also asked his colleague Thangavelu to bring the original of the faxed letter to the prison record office, since Thangavelu was going to visit his own client at the prison.
At about 2 to 2.15pm, according to Rajah, Baldev called him again and asked him to come to the prison. Baldev also told him to Ocall [the appellant] to find out what was happening`. Rajah managed to contact the appellant, who said that he would be visiting his client and who asked him to Ocome along so that [they] can resolve this matter`. On finding out that Rajah did not have any transport of his own, the appellant offered him a lift. The appellant also asked Rajah to bring along his firm`s letterhead, adding that he too would bring his Oin case there would be any statement or confession`.
The appellant picked Rajah up at about 2.45pm and it was Rajah`s testimony that they had the following conversation in the appellant`s car: 
 
[H]e asked me ODo you know your client`s son BS came to see me earlier?` I told him ONo`. He told me that BS approached him in his office and asked him whether his client Hartej Singh was prepared to confess, taking the blame solely and that he was prepared to pay 100,000 rupees to Hartej Singh`s family if he does that. ([The appellant] then told me that he told BS that he was prepared to see Hartej Singh in prison about this and to charge a fee of $500. He then said that after receiving the fees he went to see Hartej Singh in prison and Hartej Singh counter offered the sum of 200,000 rupees to SS` family if SS was prepared to take the blame. He said nothing developed on the matter.
 
 
 
As to the incidents inside the visiting area at Changi Prison, Rajah testified that Sarjit told him Hartej wanted to Oconfess and take the entire blame`. When told by Rajah that such a confession was not going to save him because the court had relied on other independent evidence in convicting him, Sarjit insisted that he did not want to die and asked Rajah to get the confession for him. Rajah then walked out of the cubicle and asked the appellant what the position was. The appellant replied that his client had not indicated a wish to confess. Instead, the appellant suggested that both Hartej and Sarjit should make statements each exonerating the other of blame in the drug trafficking offence. Rajah felt that this was a Oridiculous` suggestion but he relayed it nevertheless to Sarjit who said ONo`. In fact, Sarjit apparently became so agitated that he got up and shouted into the passageway running behind the cubicles in the visiting area. Rajah told him to sit down and again advised him to forget about getting a confession.
At this point the prison officers informed Sarjit`s family they would have to leave soon. Rajah left the cubicle so that Baldev and his family could bid farewell to Sarjit. On stepping out of the cubicle Rajah was approached by the appellant. He told the appellant that Sarjit was not prepared to confess. According to Rajah:
 
[the appellant] then said that his client would confess and he said I can write out the confession and I asked him if his client confessed that my client was not involved in the drug transaction. He said yes. He gave me his letterhead and I wrote out a simple confession that SS was not involved in the drug transaction, that he was innocent and that the drug transaction was done by Hartej Singh something to that effect Ã‰ When I was writing out [the appellant] was sitting next to me on a chair. I then gave it back to him for him to get his client to sign a confession.
 
 
 
 
 
[The appellant] took the confession written on the paper and showed it to the Prison Superintendent Mr Loh Chan Pew who was there. Mr Loh took a quick look at it and he said OK. I believe he gave the confession to one female warden for it to be brought into Hartej Singh`s cubicle. I saw [the appellant] going into the cubicle speaking to Hartej Singh in Punjabi and the confession was signed by Hartej Singh.
 
 
 
Asked whether he thought it strange that the statement should be written by him on the appellant`s letterhead, Rajah replied that he had only thought that it saved time which he and the appellant might otherwise have spent arguing about the way the statement should be drafted. Under cross-examination he admitted that, privately, he felt the statement was Oincredible` and unlikely to save his client. He also maintained, however, that so far as he was concerned he was in no position to verify the contents of the statement. He did not think he had done anything wrong in writing it out: it was up to Othe authorities` to assess its credibility. In any event, he did not wish to deny his client Oa glimmer of hope`.
A copy of the signed statement was made by the prison officers and the original was returned to the appellant. Rajah asserted that up to this juncture, the appellant had said nothing about monetary consideration for Hartej`s statement. However, as they were walking towards the main office to retrieve their identity cards, the appellant told Rajah that his instructions were Onot to hand over the confession unless a sum of $100,000 was paid for his client`s family`. Rajah thought at first that the appellant was joking. He did not respond to the appellant`s statement as they had reached the main office by then. When they had collected their ICs and walked out to the waiting area, the appellant approached Baldev. In Rajah`s own words:
 
[The appellant] went towards the direction of BS who was seated there and asked him to come aside and he looked at me and said ONK you come over too`. BS came. Next to him was his wife. When I went there Thangavelu also was with me. [The appellant] then told BS his instructions from his client were that the confession would be handed over only if the sum of $100,000 was paid to his client`s family.
 
 
 
 
 
BS`s immediate response was OSo much? Is there any guarantee?` [The appellant] replied that OThere is no guarantee Ã‰ BS turned towards me and asked ORajah, how?`
 
 
 
 
 
I told him as I told him before the confession was not going to work and that it was worthless and no money at all should be paid. I told him to take his family to go back home and to prepare his family for his father`s funeral the next day.
 
 
 
After leaving the prison, Rajah worried that Baldev might pay the $100,000 out of sheer desperation. He therefore paged Baldev and reminded him Onot to pay the $100,000 for the confession and Ã‰ to prepare for his father`s funeral`.
Following some consultation with his senior partner, Rajah decided to write to the Law Society about the incident. He did not do so, however, until nearly three weeks later (on 7 June 1995) because he was busy preparing in the interim for a criminal case.
As to Baldev`s meeting with the appellant in August 1994, Rajah stated under cross-examination that he had no prior knowledge of such a meeting. He said that it was only a week after Sarjit`s execution that Baldev told him about the previous payment of a $500 fee to the appellant. Other than this, Baldev had at no time mentioned meeting with the appellant.
Thangavelu`s evidence
Rajah`s colleague, Thangavelu, also gave evidence in the trial below. He testified that on 18 May 1995, he had to visit his client at Changi Prison. Later, as he was leaving Changi Prison, Thangavelu met Rajah and the appellant coming to see their respective clients. He told Rajah he had transport waiting and was asked to wait for Rajah. He did so at the waiting area. When Rajah and the appellant emerged again, Rajah came up to Thangavelu. Subsequently, as Thangavelu recounted:
 
[The appellant] called out to NKR [Rajah] to see him. Before [the appellant] called out to NKR I can`t recall anything. NKR went up to (the appellant) and I followed NKR. He also had BS [Baldev] with him at that time and BS`s wife. When I went up with NKR to [the appellant], BS and his wife, at that stage [the appellant] said that he had the confession of his client and he had the instructions of his client to ask for $100,000 for the confession. He asked the money from Mr BS. He said that this money is for the family of his client. Mr BS asked him what guarantee is there that the execution won`t take place tomorrow and [the appellant] replied that there is no guarantee whatsoever. Thereafter [the appellant] called me aside and went to the back of the building or on the side of the building where (the appellant) asked me for a cigarette Ã‰ I came back to where NKR was and I told him that we can go back Ã‰
 
 
 
 
 
After I told NKR we can go back, NKR told BS words to the effect that ODon`t waste your time, don`t give the money, go back and make arrangement for the funeral.`
 
 
 
Other prosecution evidence
In addition to the above three persons, the prosecution also relied on the testimony and statements of several other witnesses. In particular, Asnah bte Mahmud, the prison wardress in charge of supervising the visiting area on 18 May 1995, said in her statement that she saw Rajah and the appellant having Osome discussion`. She saw one of them writing a note. She could not remember who wrote the note but she stated that it was the appellant who passed her the note and asked her to pass it to Hartej for his signature.
Bikar Singh, the Sikh priest who accompanied the appellant to Changi Prison on 18 May 1995, was called to give evidence. In the course of the trial, his credit was held to have been impeached in respect of certain areas; and the district judge stated categorically in his written grounds that he Odid not find it necessary to consider any of [Bikar Singh`s] evidence in arriving at` his decision. For that reason, I do not propose to say any more about Bikar Singh`s evidence. I turn, instead, to the evidence presented by the appellant.
 The defence`s version of events 
The appellant`s evidence
The appellant testified that he made two visits to see Hartej at Changi Prison on 18 May 1995. The first visit at 11am came about because he had received news that Hartej was to be executed on 19 May 1995 and wished to see him. During this visit the appellant learnt that Hartej had converted from the Sikh religion to Christianity and wished to have his body buried according to Christian rituals after execution. The appellant became angry as he had, prior to this, taken it on himself to make arrangements for a Sikh cremation for Hartej. He scolded Hartej and left. As he was passing through the prison compound, he met Bant Singh Bassi (Bassi), the head priest from the Sikh temple Khalsa Dharmak Sabha, and Surjit Singh Rode (Rode), the secretary of the temple. On being told that they were there to see Sarjit and hopefully Hartej as well, the appellant informed them of Hartej`s conversion.
At about 1pm that day, the appellant received a telephone call from Rode who told him that Bassi and he (Rode) had spoken to Hartej and that Hartej had changed his mind about having a Christian burial. Instead, Hartej now wished to be cremated according to Sikh rituals. Rode then asked the appellant to visit Hartej again and to bring along his firm`s letterhead so as to get Hartej to reconfirm his funeral arrangements. Rode was Oconcerned that there should not be any incident the next morning, that the Sikhs as well as the Christians would want to claim (Hartej`s) body`.
The appellant subsequently spoke to Rajah on the telephone. According to the appellant, Rajah said that Baldev had called him Oand that both SS and HS had agreed to allow the lawyers to decide who on the merits of the case could say [sic]`. The appellant offered Rajah a lift to the prison, which Rajah accepted. According to the appellant, it was Rajah who broached the subject of Baldev`s telephone call again during the car journey. The two of them then Owent into the merits of the case`. The discussion apparently ended with Rajah agreeing that Oif anyone of the two could save the other it was SS who could save HS`. Rajah also agreed to speak to Sarjit.
As to the incidents in the visiting area at Changi Prison, the appellant claimed that he only spoke to Hartej about the funeral arrangements. It was Hartej who told the appellant that both he and Sarjit had resolved to Oleave it to the lawyers to decide`. The appellant replied that Rajah was Oasking SS if SS would take the blame`. On leaving the cubicle, however, the appellant was told by Rajah that Sarjit had adamantly refused to take the blame. This was relayed to Hartej who asked Sarjit loudly in Punjabi, OO Paternal Uncle why are you denying it?` Sarjit repled in Punjabi, OOh no Friend I am myself in a fix`. What happened next, according to the appellant, was this:
 
At this stage HS looks at me and said to me O
 Vakil sahib vekhai mein esde ma kestra mar dah
`. Literally translated, this phrase means OSee how I am going to kill his mother`.
 
 
 
 
 
This is the kind of Punjabi expressed when one wants to cause extreme hurt to another and an expression always used with a mischievous intent. Having said this to me, he raised his voice to me again: O
 Changa chacha mere kar than ru ek lakh dalla dede tan mein sein kar denda han
` which translated means OOK, Younger Paternal Uncle give to my family $100,000 and I would sign`.
 
 
 
 
 
When HS shouted this, at that point of time NKR (Rajah) was standing just next to me and he asked me what HS said or words to that effect. I spontaneously, sort of interpreted to him what he had said as I interpreted earlier. In my mind, at that point of time, this last shout was a taunt thrown down by HS to SS to torment him especially before this he had said to me OSee how I would kill his mother`. The torment was, he knew SS had gone back on his words, SS wanted him to take the blame. He didn`t want to because he was not the guilty party and he knew SS or SS`s family could not raise the $100,000, so he said it to make them suffer. Surprisingly, as soon as I said that to Mr NKR he said to me OAsk him to sign`. I looked at him surprised and puzzled and asked him OSign what?` He was looking at me and I was looking at him and I was surprised at what he wanted me to sign. He flicked through his file. I thought he was looking for material to write on. I took out my letterhead and said OHere, what is it you wanted him to sign?` He quickly took my letter head. He scribbled something on my letterhead and handed it to the prison warden to be signed by HS. The document found its way in. I was sitting in front of HS and I looked at him and asked why was he signing. His reply was he was going to sign but it was not to be released to NKR, BS or to anyone else. He said I was to show it to them but I was not to release it. In due course he signed it and immediately thereafter he was taken out of the interview room to his cell, as was SS Ã‰
 
 
 
 
 
After HS had signed and the note found its way back to where I was, I informed NKR that although it was signed the note was not to be released. I told him those were my instructions. He may have said something that OIf these were your instructions these were your instruction [sic]`. After that we went to the record office where a photocopy of document was made and kept in the records, the original was given to me and I kept it in my file.
 
 
 
The appellant`s version of the events which then transpired at the waiting area outside the prison main gate also differed drastically from the version told by Rajah, Baldev and Thangavelu. The appellant claimed that when he came out to the waiting area, all he did was to ask Thangavelu for a cigarette. Both he and Thangavelu smoked at the back of the prison building because the appellant did not wish to let Bikar Singh, the Sikh priest, see him smoking. After having smoked his cigarette, the appellant returned to the waiting area and asked Bikar Singh to follow him back to the car. He denied that he had spoken to Baldev at all about Hartej`s statement, or that he had asked Baldev to pay $100,000 for this statement.
On returning to his office, the appellant was contacted by Baldev who asked if anything could be done to stay the execution. The appellant asked Baldev to come to his office. When Baldev arrived, he again asked the appellant to help him but was told by the appellant that he should contact Rajah instead. Attempts to locate Rajah on the telephone proved futile, whereupon Baldev then mentioned Hartej`s signed statement again. Baldev claimed that Rajah had told him the statement could not be released unless $100,000 was paid to Hartej`s family in India. The appellant assured Baldev that there was no such thing. He even stated that Othere was no connection between the money and the note and that (Baldev) could take the note now if his lawyer was not around`. He said that he did so because by then, he felt that Oit was wrong for HS to hold back that document and that if NKR wanted to use it (he) would release it`. There followed more unsuccessful attempts to contact Rajah, after which Baldev and his wife left the appellant`s office without taking Hartej`s statement.
Under cross-examination the appellant stated that he had since then destroyed the original of Hartej`s document. He could not recall when he had done so or why.
As to the visit paid by Baldev and Kaka Singh in 1994, the appellant testified that this had taken place in OJune or July 1994`. He claimed that Baldev and Kaka Singh asked him if he could ask Hartej to take the blame for the drug offences. The appellant asserted that it was only out of deference to the elderly Kaka Singh that he agreed to Othink about it`. He could not remember whether it was on this occasion that Oeither BS or Kaka Singh had said that if HS were to take the blame, they would take care of HS`s family`. When he asked the pair what they meant by Otaking care` of Hartej`s family, he was told that O100,000` would be given to Hartej`s family. He could not recall the currency in which this sum was expressed. In any event, Baldev ~ so the appellant claimed ~ pestered him continually after the first meeting by telephoning him frequently and even coming to his office unannounced. The appellant tried to put off Baldev by asking him to pay the fees and disbursements incurred in making a visit to the prison. Baldev ended up making a payment of $500. The appellant still did not go to the prison and the fee paid by Baldev was finally refunded.
The appellant`s other witnesses
The appellant called two witnesses, Bant Singh Bassi (Bassi) and Surjit Singh Rode (Rode), the head priest and secretary respectively of the Sikh temple Khalsa Dhamak Sabha. Both testified that on 18 May 1995, after they had confirmed Hartej`s change of mind regarding funeral arrangements, Rode telephoned the appellant and asked him to see Hartej again to Oget down some proper papers so that it would be a proper authorisation`. Rode stated that he asked the appellant to bring his own papers to the prison so that he could Owrite to the authorities to release (Hartej`s) body` to the Sikh temple.
 The district judge`s decision 
Having heard the above evidence, the district judge accepted the testimony of the three main prosecution witnesses, Baldev, Rajah and Thangavelu, over that of the appellant: that is, he held that it was the appellant who had asked Baldev to pay $100,000 for Hartej`s family in return for Hartej`s signed confession.
The district judge also rejected submissions made by the appellant`s counsel to the effect that the appellant had not acted Oin conjunction with` with Hartej, within the meaning of that phrase as used in s 5 of the Act; that the appellant had not acted Oin respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever`, as required by s 5(a)(i); and that the appellant had not acted corruptly. His reasons appear from the records. I shall not repeat them here since the appellant relied, during the appeal, on virtually the same arguments canvassed before the district judge.
 The appeal against conviction 
The factual issues
I deal first with the challenge which the appellant`s counsel mounted in respect of the district judge`s findings of fact, since ~ as counsel pointed out ~ acceptance of the appellant`s testimony as to what transpired in the prison waiting area on 18 May 1995 effectively eliminates the need to consider any other issue.
From an examination of the charge against the appellant, it is plain that there is really only one central issue of fact in the present case: did the appellant solicit from Baldev Singh a sum of $100,000 for Hartej`s family in return for Hartej`s signed confession? From the facts I have recounted, it is obvious that the prosecution witnesses said one thing whilst the appellant said another. Counsel for the appellant endeavoured to persuade me that the district judge`s acceptance of the prosecution witnesses` testimony was fatally flawed, because of the ulterior motives each of the trio (Baldev, Rajah and Thangavelu) had for lying.
The allegations of ulterior motives against Baldev and Thangavelu can be disposed of quite swiftly. I have considered these allegations most carefully, bearing in mind their seriousness, and I can find no merit at all in them. Baldev is said to have harboured a grudge against Hartej, on his father`s account. Quite how this may have translated itself into a grudge against the appellant was never adequately explained; and indeed it is not disputed that, under cross-examination, Baldev admitted candidly his anger with Hartej but also said in the same breath that he did not think he blamed the appellant. To my mind, the evidence of any malevolent desire on Baldev`s part to Oframe` the appellant is non-existent. I say the same about the allegations of ulterior motive on Thangavelu`s part. He is said to have lied because he wanted to help corroborate a story fabricated by his colleague (Rajah). This is an accusation so absurd that I have no hesitation in rejecting it at once.
I turn then to Rajah`s evidence. It is said of Rajah that he had numerous opportunities to protest the propriety of the appellant`s conduct on 18 May 1995, which opportunities he failed to utilise. It is also said that he lied in denying he had prior knowledge of Baldev`s meeting with the appellant in August 1994: a denial which, as counsel was at pains to emphasise, contradicted Baldev`s evidence. These two points, so counsel argued, showed that Rajah was trying to distance himself from the events of 18 May 1995; and no wonder, since, in counsel`s submission, Rajah had acted improperly in conniving at the concoction of a confession he himself felt to be Oincredible`.
I do not propose to set out the details of counsel`s submissions. They were most admirably organised and presented, but I cannot agree with them. I do not doubt that there were some discrepancies between Rajah`s evidence and that of Baldev. These were not specifically dealt with in the district judge`s grounds of decision, but that is really neither here nor there. It was not necessary for the district judge to deal explicitly with each and every inconsistency in the prosecution`s evidence: see in this respect the judgment of Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) in 
 Krishna Jayaram v PP 
 [1989] 3 MLJ 272 at pp 272 to 275); 
[1989] SLR 696
 at p 702. The crucial issue is whether sufficient evidence exists in this case to justify his findings, or whether such findings are against the weight of the evidence. I can see no basis for coming to the latter conclusion. The allegations of impropriety on Rajah`s part depend on sheer conjecture: the court is asked to infer from various incidents that Rajah lied, and that he lied most cunningly to extricate himself from a situation largely of his own creation. On the basis of the available evidence, I am unable to draw such an inference as to Rajah`s credibility. His testimony as to what transpired in the prison waiting area was corroborated by not one but two other witnesses. As to his professed ignorance of the August 1994 meeting, he had no reason to lie: it was never the appellant`s case that he (Rajah) had encouraged Baldev to secure a false confession from Hartej at this meeting or to offer money for such a confession. I do not believe (as the district judge clearly did not believe) that the version of events on which the prosecution`s case proceeded was really an elaborate falsehood which Rajah had created as a Opre-emptive strike` to preclude accusations of wrongdoing against himself. Rajah`s letter to the Law Society clearly admitted that he was the one who had written down a confession for Hartej to sign on 18 May 19 95. If he had truly wished to distance himself from the events of 18 May 1995, he would hardly have been the first to bring these events to light.
Counsel conceded early on in the appeal that this was a case of the appellant`s word against that of at least three prosecution witnesses. His effort to persuade me to the appellant`s rendering of the facts was a most eloquent one. I am satisfied, however, that the district judge`s findings were entirely supported by the evidence; and I can see no reason to disagree with his preference for the prosecution`s version of events.
 The legal issues 
On counsel`s submission, however, even accepting the prosecution`s version of events, there remained three issues of law to be considered. First, even assuming the appellant had appeared to commit the physical act of soliciting a gratification, did he actually intend to solicit such a gratification? Secondly, could his act be said to be a corrupt one? And finally, could he be said to have acted Oin conjunction with` Hartej?
OIn conjunction with`
The third issue can conveniently be dealt with first, since the arguments from both sides with regard to this issue were fairly short. The appellant`s counsel contended that the phrase Oin conjunction with` in s 5 of the Act must mean Otogether with`. Counsel further argued that the opening words of the section (OAny person who shall by himself or by or in conjunction with any other person`) required that the offending act be committed by an accused acting by himself, or by another person, or 
 together with another person 
 . An accused who merely acts as an agent for a principal is not caught within the scope of the section: it is argued that, had Parliament intended to include the acts of an agent within the scope of the section, it would have inserted into the provision such words as Oon behalf of`. In the present case, therefore, the appellant could not be said to have acted Oin conjunction with` Hartej because in repeating the request for $100,000, he merely acted as Hartej`s agent.
In response, the deputy public prosecutor contended that s 5 made no distinction between the acts of principals and those of agents; that the section was designed to catch out anyone who had played a role of some sort in a corrupt matter or transaction. This is an argument I find myself in agreement with. In my view, the phrase Oin conjunction with` in s 5 should be read, not in isolation, but in the context of the entire Act, with the purposes of the Act in mind.
The preamble states that it is an Act Oto provide for the more effectual prevention of corruption`. It does not state that it intends to cover the acts of public officers only, or of persons acting as principals only. Counsel argued that the acts of agents were already covered under s 6. A look at s 6 shows that it only covers (very broadly speaking) situations where an agent has corruptly taken a gratification in return for doing something in relation to his principal`s affairs, 
 without the principal`s knowledge or consent 
 : see s 6(a) and in particular s 6(c). Section 6 does not cover situations where an agent proceeds 
 on the instructions of his principal 
 to commit a corrupt act (for example, to offer a bribe to someone else). Yet, if the stated purpose of the Act is simply Othe more effectual prevention of corruption`, why should it exclude from its scope the latter category of acts? An agent who assists his principal in offering a bribe to a third party is not, to my mind, any less culpable than an agent who accepts a bribe from a third party to show that party favour in relation to his principal`s business. Suppose, for example, that A (a building sub-contractor) wants to ensure he is successful in his tender for a job being offered by B (a building contractor). A tells his agent C to offer some Ounder-the-counter` money to B. C sets up a meeting with B, negotiates terms with him and eventually pays over a certain sum to B as Ounder-the-counter-money` in return for B awarding the job to A. In this scenario, according to the arguments presented for the appellant, A and B are both guilty of offences of corruption under s 5; but C, who has been an active and knowing participant in the corrupt transaction, is not guilty of any offence at all. Plainly, such a situation would sabotage the effective operation of the Act.
In the light of the above reasons, I conclude that the phrase Oin conjunction with` in s 5 should be construed so as to include the acts of agents who act on the instructions of their principals in carrying out corrupt acts; and that the appellant can, accordingly, be said to have acted Oin conjunction` with Hartej in asking Baldev for $100,000 on 18 May 1995.
 Whether the appellant intended to solicit a gratification 
Counsel`s other argument was that the appellant never actually intended to solicit a gratification of $100,000, even if his actions at the prison waiting area on 18 May 1995 could be said to give the appearance of a solicitation. In this respect, counsel did not disagree with the district judge`s reliance on the judgment in 
 PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2) 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
, in which it was said that the word Osolicit` as used in the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act meant no more than Oto ask` or Oto make request`. Counsel contended, however, that even accepting that the appellant did mention the payment of $100,000 at all, he was merely repeating Hartej`s instructions and not making an actual request.
I am unable to agree with such reasoning. We are told by three different prosecution witnesses that the appellant asked Baldev for $100,000 for Hartej`s family in return for Hartej`s confession. It is not suggested that the appellant`s act was anything other than voluntary and deliberate. What he is really saying now amounts to this: O
 I said that my client said 
$100,000 must be paid. 
 I did not say myself 
 that $100,000 must be paid.` With respect, such protestations appear to me to be nothing more than a specious exercise in semantics.
 OCorruptly` 
I come, then, to the arguments advanced on the appellant`s behalf in respect of the element of corruption in his act. Both counsel and the deputy public prosecutor were content to rely on the formulation propounded in
 PP v Khoo Yong Hak 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 283
, namely, that the offending act (in this case, the act of solicitation) must have been committed with a corrupt intent; and that there must be a corrupt element in the transaction itself.
Counsel did not dispute that a corrupt element existed in any transaction involving the exchange of money for a confession, since such a transaction constituted in substance a transaction in the nature of a bribe. Counsel resisted most strenuously, however, any charge of corrupt intent on the appellant`s part.
First, counsel pointed out that the appellant`s act of solicitation had been committed in full view of several witnesses. It lacked, therefore, that element of secrecy or furtiveness which counsel submitted formed the hallmark of an offence of corruption. With respect, this is not a submission borne out by the authorities. It is true that in many cases of corruption the accused has acted in a secretive or furtive manner in trying to conceal the corrupt nature of his transaction. It does not follow, however, that secrecy must be an essential element in an offence of corruption. In 
 PP v You Kong Lai 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 298
, for example, the accused was convicted of corruptly receiving a gratification intended as an inducement to a public officer. He had been quite open about the fact that the gratification he was receiving was to be used as a bribe: indeed it appears that he told several people so! I do not think, therefore, that the absence of secretiveness on the appellant`s part is any bar to a finding that he acted corruptly.
It was then argued that the appellant had believed the confession to be false and worthless; and that he had not thought Baldev capable of raising $100,000 in the time remaining before Sarjit`s execution. That may have been so, but again I cannot see that it necessarily precludes a conclusion that the appellant acted corruptly. As counsel himself conceded, the exchange of money for a confession ~ indeed, for any sort of evidence affecting the question of criminal liability ~ must of itself be a corrupt transaction. There is a very grave danger that evidence given in exchange for money will be tailored or even fabricated to suit the interests of the paying party. The existence of this danger perverts the very basis of our system of justice: it signifies that the question of guilt no longer depends on the impartial workings of an established system of criminal justice but on the comparative amounts of money being offered by the parties involved. The danger exists the moment money is even offered or solicited. Whether or not the evidence given eventually proves to be true or useful is immaterial. I do not see that it is less blameworthy to pay for (or ask payment for) a false confession than it is to pay for (or ask payment for) a true confession. If anything, the former seems to me to be an even greater perversion of justice. Similarly, whether or not the intended paying party can actually lay his hands on all the necessary funds is immaterial. The accused who asks for 
 x 
 dollars in exchange for a confession may well intend it as an opening gambit. This is beside the point. What is crucial is that he has, in so asking, deliberately put a price to the confession: he has treated justice as his to hawk.
For these reasons, I hold that the appellant acted with corrupt intent when he solicited $100,000 from Baldev in return for Hartej`s confession.
 OAny matter or transaction whatsoever` 
There is one other point of law I should deal with. This concerns the construction of the phrase Oany matter or transaction whatsoever` which appears in s 5(a)(i). Before the district judge, it was argued that this phrase referred only to Ocircumstances in which a contractual, professional or administrative duty can be shown to exist` and that it did not cover the situation in the present case, where Ono commercial or professional connections` existed between Hartej and Sarjit. The argument was rejected by the district judge. It was touched on very briefly by counsel in the course of the appeal. All that was said was that the phrase Oany matter or transaction whatsoever` was drafted in wide terms; and that it was for the prosecution to define the parameters of the offence thus created and to show that the appellant`s case fell within these parameters.
Having examined the terms of s 5, however, I must agree with the deputy public prosecutor that there are no grounds for giving the phrase the restrictive construction argued for by the appellant. The words Oany matter or transaction whatsoever` are very clear in not including any restrictions. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the restrictive construction argued for by the appellant is supported by existing case law. As the district judge pointed out, in 
 Kannan s/o Kunjiraman v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 757
 for example, it could hardly be said that a Ocommercial or professional` relationship of some sort existed between the bookmaker Rajendran (the offeror of an $80,000 bribe) and the goalkeeper David Lee (the intended recipient of the bribe).
For the reasons given above, the appellant`s appeal against conviction is dismissed.
 The appeal against sentence 
In respect of the appeal against the sentence of five months` imprisonment, it was said that the district judge failed to consider the fact that the appellant had not personally benefitted from the offence. I do not think this is strictly accurate. The district judge referred in his written grounds to 
 PP v Abbas Saad 
 (DAC 6962/95) (unreported), a case where the accused had not personally derived any money from the offence of corruption committed and was fined $50,000 on conviction. It can be surmised from this reference that the district judge was aware of the lack of personal benefit in the appellant`s case. In any event, there is no inflexible rule that an accused who derives no personal benefit from a corrupt transaction should automatically be entitled to some sort of discount on his sentence. In 
 PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris 
 , the accused solicited money not for himself but for the political party to which he belonged; yet, so far as we can tell from the learned judge`s grounds of decision, this does not appear to have weighed much in the accused`s favour.
It was further argued that any attempt to influence the President by using Hartej`s confession would probably have failed anyway. I have said earlier that I do not think this is relevant. The harm to our justice system was done as soon as the appellant asked Baldev to pay for the confession. It is of no mitigating value to say that he did not really expect anyone to take the confession seriously.
Finally, it was said that the appellant had already suffered grave, possibly irreparable, damage to his career; and accordingly, whilst the court might wish to send a message to other lawyers minded to act as the appellant had done, a heavy fine would suffice to give these lawyers the necessary warning. I have considered the facts of this case very carefully; and, in my view, a fine would be manifestly inadequate. As a senior member of the Bar and a former police officer, the appellant should have been all the more keenly aware of the need to guard against any abuse of our justice system. I find his conduct shocking and reprehensible. Indeed, having regard to all relevant circumstances, the sentence of five months` imprisonment was manifestly inadequate. I note that in 
 PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris 
, for example, the accused, who was a senior political leader convicted of three charges of corruption, received an aggregate custodial sentence of two years. I am of the view that this is a case where the court should exercise its powers under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to enhance the sentence. The appeal against sentence is accordingly dismissed; and the period of imprisonment imposed on the appellant is hereby enhanced to 12 months.

This is the Public Prosecutor`s appeal against a decision of the High Court, acquitting the respondent on a charge of having 3,488.91g of cannabis mixture in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This order was made at the close of the prosecution case.
The `cannabis mixture` was recovered from the rubbish chute at the foot of Block 79 Indus Road on 16 April 1996. The prosecution had been informed by one Amir bin Abdullah that he would be purchasing ganja (cannabis) from the respondent in the vicinity of Block 79 Indus Road. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) subsequently managed to trace the respondent`s residential address to Block 79 Indus Road #02-479 (the flat). The CNB then organised a raid on the flat.
The evidence of one Sgt Leong Wai Wah, a member of the CNB raiding party, was that he saw the respondent and one Ramalingam Rajasegar throw something into the rubbish chute of the flat when the CNB officers were outside the flat waiting to gain entry. Narcotics Officer Kharudin bin Sukaimi, who was stationed at the ground floor, somewhere behind the kitchen window of the flat, also testified that he saw the respondent throwing a black object into the rubbish chute. He immediately checked the rubbish container and noticed a black bag lying on top of other matter. He also noticed that there were several other bags under the black bag.
Following that, the respondent was arrested. The rubbish container was immediately checked and a total of six bags, including the black bag, was retrieved by the CNB. Three of these six bags contained substances believed to be cannabis. In particular, from the black bag, 2,825g of highly fragmented greenish vegetable matter was recovered. The total weight of the substances believed to be cannabis which were recovered was 3,488.91g.
During the trial, the prosecution called Dr Jyothi Mary Ipe (Dr Ipe) of the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) to testify on the scientific analysis of the seized substances. From her analysis, she had determined that they were `fragmented vegetable matter which was ... found to contain tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol`. She concluded that `[t]he vegetable matter was therefore cannabis mixture as defined in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)(MDA)`.
This appeal is primarily concerned with one question: what constitutes `cannabis mixture`? The trial judge held that he was bound by the recent ruling of the Court of Appeal in 
 Abdul Raman bin Yusof v PP 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 15
 on this question. Consequently, the judge accepted the defence submission that the prosecution had failed to establish an essential element of the charge, in that the vegetable matter in question was not `cannabis mixture` according to the definition as construed in 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case.
 Abdul Raman 
`s
 case 
In 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case, the appellant was charged with trafficking in 852.35g of cannabis and 119.38g of cannabis mixture. Dr Lee Tong Kooi (Dr Lee) of the DSS provided the scientific evidence for the prosecution. Dr Lee said that he had to analyse a block of compressed greenish vegetable matter which had been seized from the possession of the accused. He had to `prise open` the compressed matter into `several thin slabs of compressed vegetable matter`. He managed to separate the vegetable matter into two groups. One comprised `intact branches` including stems and leaves, and the other comprised `dry and brittle` broken pieces which he classified as `fragmented vegetable matter`. There was a very small quantity of `extraneous matter` which he could not classify as either `intact branches` or `fragmented vegetable matter`.
Dr Lee certified that the intact branches weighed 852.35g, which he classified as `cannabis`, while the fragmented portion weighed 119.38g of `cannabis mixture`. He explained that the fragmented portion did not conclusively satisfy him from macroscopic and microscopic examinations that they exhibited the characteristic features of cannabis, although he detected the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol on chemical analysis. He testified that all three tests - macroscopic and microscopic examination and chemical analysis - had to be satisfied before the DSS would certify the plant material to be cannabis. As the fragmented portion satisfied only the chemical test, he certified it to be cannabis mixture.
At the close of the prosecution case, defence counsel submitted that it was not permissible in law to separate the two groups of vegetable matter to make two offences out of what was in effect one block of vegetable matter. It was argued that the quantities of `cannabis` and `cannabis mixture` should be amalgamated into one, and considered as a whole as 982.38g of `cannabis mixture`. On account of this weight falling below 1000g, a charge of trafficking in cannabis mixture would not attract the death penalty upon conviction. The trial judge rejected this submission. Instead, the judge amended the charge of trafficking in cannabis to specify that only 590.23g were involved, as it was only this quantity that satisfied all the requisite three tests to enable classification as `cannabis`. At the conclusion of the trial, both accused persons were convicted on this charge and sentenced with the mandatory death penalty.
Counsel for the defence repeated the submission as to amalgamation of `cannabis mixture` before the Court of Appeal. In the opinion of the court, the primary question in the appeal was whether the compressed block of greenish vegetable matter ought to have been classified as cannabis mixture having regard to Dr Lee`s certification in which case the proper charge against both appellants would have been trafficking in 982.38g of cannabis mixture. This was a mixed question of law and fact. The court went on to examine Parliament`s rationale for introducing trafficking in cannabis mixture as an offence under the MDA. Reference was made to the following statements of the Minister for Law at the second reading of the bill which introduced these amendments: 
 
Next, cannabis mixture. The Central Narcotics Bureau has detected some cases in which cannabis was trafficked in mixed form, ie the plant is broken up and mixed with other vegetable matter such as tobacco. Currently, this does not attract the death penalty.
 
 
 
To deter traffickers from trafficking in large amounts of cannabis in this form, a new capital offence will be created for this type of drug. As the amount of cannabis in such a mixture does not usually fall below 50%, it is proposed that for the purpose of capital offences, trafficking in a cannabis mixture should be in amounts of more than 1,000g (as compared to more than 500g in the case of cannabis alone) ...
The court observed that, from the evidence, the question of a `mixture` did not arise. It is necessary to refer to the court`s reasoning in its entirety (at pp 25-26): 
 
It is clear to us that what Parliament was seeking to deter was the camouflaging of cannabis by mixing the cannabis in broken form with another vegetable matter such as tobacco. This is the example the minister gave. `Mixing` as used by the minister in his speech in Parliament and by dictionary meaning involves two separate substances; in the instant case two separate vegetable matter. Indeed the dictionary meaning of `mixture` referred to us by Mr Ismail Hamid was `the mechanical mixing of two substances involving no change in their character.` Hence, the crucial words in the definition of cannabis mixture are: `any mixture of vegetable matter` and this can only mean two or more separate vegetable matters. This then leads us to the evidence, to assess the factual aspect of the mixed question of law and fact.
 
 
 
The evidence of Dr Lee does not show that the compressed greenish vegetable matter he analysed to be a mixture of two separate vegetable matter. It does not even suggest it. His evidence properly understood was that since the greenish vegetable matter he received for analysis was in a compressed form, he had first to `prise open` the compressed matter into several thin slabs of compressed vegetable matter. He did this by using a screw driver. Having done this he then separated the `thin slabs of compressed vegetable matter` into individual branches with his fingers. Some separated into whole branches with stems and leaves. These he classified as `intact branches` but some, because the vegetable matter was `dry and brittle`, broke into `small pieces`. These he classified as `fragmented vegetable matter`. It is clear from this evidence that the block of compressed greenish vegetable matter was composed of one and only one vegetable matter and no more. As a matter of fact the question of `mixture` or `mixing` does not arise.
It will be remembered that Dr Lee said in his evidence that plant material satisfying the macroscopic and microscopic features of cannabis cannot unequivocally be considered to be cannabis, unless the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol were detected in them by chemical analysis, notwithstanding that the definition of `cannabis` in the Act makes no reference to the presence of these alkaloids, whereas for cannabis mixture, the Act requires the presence of these two alkaloids. In this connection what the Minister said in Parliament in moving the amendment bill referred to is instructive. He said: 
 
`Next cannabis. Cannabis is currently defined under the Act to mean ""any part of any plant of the genus Cannabis from which the resin has not been extracted, by whatever name it may be designated"".
 
 
 
In practice, the DSS relies on three types of tests to prove that the substance seized is cannabis as defined. First, there is a visual examination to establish the physical appearance and characteristic odour of cannabis. Next, a microscopic examination is carried out to detect the presence of resin, cystolithic trichomes and non-cystolithic trichomes which are unique to cannabis. Lastly, chemical tests are carried out to detect the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. These are the two main alkaloids, I am told, which distinguish cannabis from other hallucinogenic drugs. We have been informed by DSS that they are also the psycho-active ingredients in the plant which causes hallucination. These alkaloids can be found in other parts of the plant (except the roots) which do not contain resin. In view of this and on the advice of the DSS, my ministry proposes to amend the definition of cannabis to remove the misconception that cannabis is a controlled drug only if resin is present in that part of the plant. Clause 2(a) of the Bill seeks to amend the definition of `cannabis` as follows: 
 
""`Cannabis` means any plant of the genus Cannabis, or any part of such plant, by whatever name it is called.""
 
 
 
It is not necessary to provide for tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol to be included in the definition because, according to DSS, the plant material cannot be considered as being of the `genus cannabis` without their presence.`
 
 
 
The `fragmented vegetable matter` being small broken pieces from the whole branches (intact branches), as Dr Lee explained in his evidence, did not conclusively satisfy him from the macroscopic and microscopic examinations that they exhibited the characteristic features of cannabis, but on chemical analysis, he detected the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. All three tests must prove satisfactory to qualify the plant material as cannabis. As the `fragmented vegetable matter` had satisfied only the chemical test, Dr Lee certified it to be cannabis mixture, although strictly speaking the `fragmented vegetable matter` was not a `mixture of vegetable matter`, as we have already explained the scientific evidence clearly showed. It was composed of the same vegetable matter as the `intact branches` but failed to satisfy the macroscopic and microscopic examinations for cannabis. In all correctness Dr Lee should not have certified the `fragmented vegetable matter` as `cannabis mixture` and in our view should have certified that the `fragmented vegetable matter` did not satisfy all three tests he carried out for cannabis, although he found the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in the `fragmented vegetable matter`. However this does not and could not detract from his evidence that 590.23g of the `intact branches` satisfied all three tests for cannabis.
 
 
 
For the sake of completeness, we should mention that our understanding of Dr Lee`s evidence was that faced with a compressed block of vegetable matter, he was endeavouring to break down the compressed vegetable matter into individual branches to enable him to carry out the macroscopic and microscopic examinations, both of which are visual. It was in doing this, as we have already said, some of the branches broke into small pieces. He was not engaged in separating one vegetable matter from another vegetable matter. To speak of a `mixture` and `separating` in the sense spoken of by counsel and in the context of the scientific evidence is to misunderstand the scientific evidence.
In the event, the court found it clear that Parliament had introduced the term `cannabis mixture` into the MDA in order to deter the camouflaging of cannabis by mixing it in broken form with some other vegetable matter such as tobacco. Hence, when s 2 of the MDA refers to `any mixture of vegetable matter`, `this can only mean two or more separate vegetable matters`.
From Dr Lee`s evidence, it was clear that 590.23g of the `intact vegetable matter` had satisfied all three tests for cannabis. On that premise, the trial judge`s decision was upheld.
 The scientific evidence in the present case
The key points to note from Dr Ipe`s evidence were summarised by the trial judge as follows. Dr Ipe testified that macroscopically she was unable to say conclusively that the vegetable matter in the exhibits examined by her was herbal cannabis. Nevertheless, her microscopic examination led her to believe that the vegetable matter originated from the cannabis plant. Her chemical analyses confirmed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. She did not find any other vegetable matter in the exhibits. However, she did not certify the substance as cannabis. It was not the practice of DSS to do so unless all three tests - macroscopic, microscopic and chemical - were satisfied. This was in line with the UN Testing Manual (
 Recommended Methods for Testing Cannabis 
 - 
 Manual for Use by National Narcotics Laboratories 
 (UN 1987)) (the UN Manual).
Dr Ipe said that she could not conclusively confirm that every single fragment in the exhibits was of cannabis origin. She `preferred` to certify the substance as being cannabis mixture. In her opinion, this certification was in accordance with the definition of `cannabis mixture` provided under s 2 of the MDA.
 The submission of no case to answer
At the close of the prosecution case, counsel for the respondent rested his submission of no case to answer solely on the argument that the respondent was not in possession of `cannabis mixture` as alleged. Counsel contended that the Court of Appeal had unambiguously stated in 
 Abdul Raman 
 that cannabis mixture meant a `mixture of two or more separate vegetable matters`. Thus, inasmuch as Dr Ipe did not and could not find any other vegetable matter in the exhibits she analysed, the seized exhibits could not be correctly termed `cannabis mixture`, as they appeared to contain only one uniform type of vegetable matter.
The deputy public prosecutor`s primary focus was on characterising the ruling on `cannabis mixture` in 
 Abdul Raman 
 as being obiter dicta. The deputy public prosecutor sought to distinguish 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case on the premise that it concerned `fragmented vegetable matter`, being small broken pieces from the whole (intact) branches of the cannabis plant. As there was no suggestion that the exhibits in the present case contained fragments from intact branches, `it would not be inaccurate to call the fragmented vegetable matter a mixture of vegetable matter`.
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that the meaning given to `mixture` in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was `unduly restrictive and should not be adopted as it would lead to an unintended result whereby it is merely the absence of some (potentially not even a controlled drug) vegetable matter different from cannabis that allows the accused person to escape conviction`. The deputy public prosecutor therefore contended that the term `mixture of vegetable matter` was wide enough to include `an inseparable mass of vegetable matter, most or all of which cannot be clearly identified to ascertain whether the mass is uniform or is composed of different vegetable matter`. It would also include `an inseparable mixture of different plant parts (ie leaves/seeds/stems etc)`.
Initially, there was also an alternative submission by the deputy public prosecutor that the vegetable matter in the exhibits was in fact cannabis. He argued that although due to DSS protocol Dr Ipe would not testify that the exhibits were `cannabis`, it was nevertheless open to the court to find, based on the evidence adduced, that the exhibits did fall within the MDA definition of cannabis. However, the deputy public prosecutor eventually abandoned this alternative submission.
 The decision below
The trial judge opined that it would not be open to him to depart from the ruling of the Court of Appeal in 
 Abdul Raman 
. He noted that the Court of Appeal was laying down the ratio decidendi of the case in its expressed views on what constituted `cannabis mixture`. It was immaterial that the facts in 
 Abdul Raman 
 involved the question of separability of cannabis from fragmented vegetable matter. The judge considered that he was bound to hold that the prosecution had not established a vital legal element of the charge in regard to the respondent`s alleged possession of `cannabis mixture`.
 The appeal
Before us, the deputy public prosecutor advanced various arguments. His first and primary submission was that the interpretation placed on `cannabis mixture` by this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was erroneous, and should be overruled. Alternatively, he submitted that, even if the reasoning in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was correct, the prosecution had proved that the drugs seized were cannabis mixture in the present case. Finally, he contended that, in any event, the defence should have been called on alternative charges of trafficking in cannabis and trafficking in cannabis mixture.
In his written submissions, the deputy public prosecutor also suggested that the relevant portions of 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case cited above were obiter and therefore not binding on the trial judge. In our view, this court`s pronouncements in 
 Abdul Raman 
 on the meaning of `cannabis mixture` clearly formed part of the ratio decidendi. In 
 Abdul Raman 
, the question as to what `cannabis mixture` meant was raised squarely by the defence submission that the single block of compressed vegetable matter could only be properly classified as `cannabis mixture` and that it would be wrong to divide it into component parts of `cannabis` and `cannabis mixture`. The defence proceeded on the premise that `cannabis mixture` encompassed a mixture of two `components` of `cannabis` and `cannabis mixture`. The trial judge rejected this argument. On appeal, this court held that `this very question is the principal argument in this appeal`.
We are of the opinion that the trial judge had no recourse but to hold that he was bound by the decision in 
 Abdul Raman 
. Nevertheless, we do not see why we should desist from reconsideration of the question, in view of the serious and far-reaching implications of the issues raised in this appeal.
 The submissions
It is apparent that in 
 Abdul Raman 
 the court proceeded on the premise that the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase `mixture of vegetable matter` contemplates a mixture of two or more different types of vegetable matter. More specifically, it would have to comprise two or more types of vegetable matter of both cannabis and non-cannabis origin. Before us, the deputy public prosecutor took issue with this construction. In his submission, he argued that there is nothing in the phrase which stipulates that the mixture must refer to a mixture of vegetable matter from different species. The definition merely requires a mixture of any vegetable matter. It is far broader than a reference to `vegetable species`. Thus, the phrase `mixture of vegetable matter` can accurately describe a block composed of various parts of the same plant.
The deputy public prosecutor postulated two alternate and mutually exclusive paths of analysis for this argument. First, he submitted that separate plant parts constitute separate ingredients or components, which, when put together, could still be properly called a `mixture of vegetable matter`. Secondly, he submitted that since the separate ingredients comprising the `mixture` in the present case were not identifiable individually, the mass of vegetable matter was a blend. As such, it would fall within the meaning of `mixture`. In any event, the deputy public prosecutor emphasised that the definition of `cannabis mixture` should not be qualified by reading in a mandatory requirement that the vegetable matter should originate from `different species`. To interpose these qualifying words would not accord with accepted principles of statutory interpretation.
Accordingly, the deputy public prosecutor submitted that the phrase `mixture of vegetable matter` is not limited to a mixture of two vegetable species in its natural and ordinary meaning. If the resin, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, seeds, fruits etc from the cannabis plant species have been ground into small pieces and then mixed together, this `mixture` would clearly fall within the natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase. As these parts of the plant bear distinctly different physical characteristics and chemical compositions, they must be regarded as different kinds of vegetable substances which are capable of being mixed together to constitute a `mixture of vegetable matter`.
In the deputy public prosecutor`s submission, the term `cannabis mixture` would inherently indicate that it is a mixture of pure cannabis vegetable matter. This would be the primary or core meaning of the term. However, the definition adopted in the MDA has widened it to include any mixture of cannabis and non-cannabis vegetable matter. By stipulating the key requirement that tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol should be present in the `cannabis mixture, the definition would even include instances where entirely non-cannabis vegetable matter has been `spiked` eg. by the addition of synthesised tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. These would come within the extended meaning of `cannabis mixture`. In the present exercise, both the primary and extended meanings of the term had to be considered. The extended meaning should not be allowed to displace the primary meaning.
The deputy public prosecutor also argued that the minister`s speech in Parliament confirmed that an extended meaning of `cannabis mixture` was also intended, taking into account its context in the MDA and the purpose or object underlying the Act, as provided under s 9A(2)(a) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1). After all, the minister could not have intended to oust the primary meaning of what a `cannabis mixture` was comprised of, by mere omission. Parliament`s espoused intention was to enlarge the scope of the MDA in controlling the trafficking of cannabis and not to curtail its scope or application.
In the circumstances, the deputy public prosecutor invited this court to overrule the decision in 
 Abdul Raman 
 on the construction of `cannabis mixture`. He urged this court to adopt a construction that would give effect to both the primary and the extended meanings of the term, being consistent with the policy and purpose of the MDA.
In reply, counsel for the respondent quite properly supported the trial judge`s decision that he was bound by the ruling in 
 Abdul Raman 
. He submitted that the construction of `cannabis mixture` placed by the court in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was the only proper definition of the term. The intention of Parliament in introducing `cannabis mixture` could be gleaned entirely from the minister`s speech during the second reading of the Amendment Bill. In amending the MDA in 1993, Parliament was seeking to discourage the trafficking of cannabis which had been camouflaged by mixing with another vegetable substance. What the deputy public prosecutor had referred to as the `primary` meaning, ie a mixture of vegetable matter purely of cannabis origin, would clearly contravene the ordinary dictionary meaning of the word `mixture`.
Counsel emphasised the fact that there was no evidence that the vegetable matter in the present case was in fact a mixture of cannabis and some other vegetable matter, or, alternatively, that the vegetable matter was `pure` cannabis. After all, Dr Ipe had clearly refused to classify the vegetable matter as cannabis. The onus remained on the prosecution to establish that the vegetable matter was `cannabis mixture`. But the prosecution had clearly failed to establish that there were two different vegetable matters in the alleged `mixture`.
It was also argued that, if Parliament had intended to rely solely on the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol as determinative of what was `cannabis mixture`, the definition in s 2 MDA would have been couched differently. For example, Parliament could simply have defined cannabis mixture as `any vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol`. The use of the phrase `mixture of vegetable matter` clearly implied that Parliament had intended for there to be more than one type of vegetable matter co-existing with the vegetable matter of cannabis origin.
Counsel agreed that the Court of Appeal could overrule and depart from its own previous decisions. Nonetheless, he submitted that the construction of `cannabis mixture` adopted by this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was correct and consonant with Parliament`s intention, and thus it should not be departed from. He further submitted that, if this court should be disposed to a contrary view, the matter was one for the Legislature to rectify.
 The decision of the court
The cardinal rule in statutory construction is to construe the statutory provision in question according to the intention expressed in the provision itself. If the words of the statute are themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their ordinary and natural sense.
We are conscious that the use of interpretation clauses frequently met with judicial disapproval in the previous century. It was said that such devices suffered from failure to observe the valuable rule never to enact under the guise of definition. For instance, in 
 R v Commissioners under the Boiler Explosions Act 1882 
 
[1891] 1 QB 703
, and 
 Bradley v Baylis 
 
(1881) 8 QBD 195
, Lord Esher MR was unreservedly critical of legislative drafting which attempted to enact that a word should mean something which in fact it did not. This criticism does not arise in the present case. The interpretation clause in question states that `cannabis mixture means any mixture of vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in any quantity`. This definition is explanatory and prima facie restrictive. The only difficulty, which we note with some irony, is that the construction of the interpretation clause itself now arises for reconsideration.
In 
 Abdul Raman 
, this court took what the deputy public prosecutor has now characterised as the `extended` meaning of `cannabis mixture` to be an exhaustive definition. No arguments on the point were canvassed before the court in 
 Abdul Raman 
, although it must be said that the court was cognisant of the problem which fell to be addressed. Having now had the benefit of hearing extensive and cogent arguments from both the deputy public prosecutor and counsel, we are of the unanimous opinion that this is a proper case for us to exercise our powers to depart from the decision in 
 Abdul Raman 
. In our opinion, this course is open to us on account of the Practice Statement on Judicial Precedent issued on 11 July 1994 (
[1994] 2 SLR 689
). We recognise the importance of ensuring certainty and coherence in the law. Against this, the potential injustice which may be caused by continued adherence to a mistaken decision has to be weighed. We turn now to elaborate on our reasons for allowing the appeal.
On being invited to re-examine the construction of `cannabis mixture` and exercise our powers under the Practice Statement, it would be appropriate for us to keep out of mind what was initially expressed in 
 Abdul Raman 
. We propose to approach the issue in the first place as an exercise in statutory construction, as if the matter were res integra. This was the approach adopted by Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
 R v Shivpuri 
 
[1987] 1 AC 1
 at p 18, from whose judgment we would respectfully draw guidance.
At the outset, it is useful to recall the scientific evidence adduced by the prosecution in the present case. The entire tenor of Dr Ipe`s evidence was that the exhibits were comprised wholly of `fragmented vegetable matter`. As the exhibits were in crushed form, all the exhibits failed the macroscopic test, ie when visually examined, the characteristics of the cannabis plant could not be discerned. Nonetheless, she was able to detect quantities of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in the exhibits. Coupled with the microscopic examinations, she was thus able to infer the presence of vegetable matter of cannabis origin. Accordingly, since s 2 of the MDA defines `cannabis mixture` simply as meaning `any mixture of vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in any quantity`, she certified the exhibits as `cannabis mixture`.
Dr Ipe was only prepared to say that there was a `possibility` that some other vegetable matter was present in the exhibits. She opined that it was improbable that there was vegetable matter other than cannabis in the exhibits. She explained that the DSS`s main concern was to look for cannabis in the vegetable matter received. She did not specifically look for any other type of vegetable matter and did not notice any other type of vegetable matter therein. All the available evidence therefore pointed to there being no other type of vegetable matter in the alleged `mixture`, other than homogeneous vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. Applying the reasoning from 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case, the prosecution would have failed to establish a prima facie case that the exhibits could be properly classified as being `cannabis mixture`.
We also note that at various points in her evidence, Dr Ipe testified that her tests indicated the `presence of cannabis`. Inasmuch as this suggests that she had found cannabis to be present in the exhibits, this stands in complete contradiction with her stand that the exhibits could not be classified as `cannabis`, on account of the requirements stipulated in the UN Manual not having been met. With respect, the only conclusive inference that could be made in the circumstances was that Dr Ipe had affirmatively detected the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. It is incontrovertible that the exhibits were not properly classifiable as `cannabis`. Strictly speaking, they should not have been described as `cannabis` at all. The term `cannabis` may well have been used only as a matter of convenience, but we must emphasise that it is lacking in precision and, indeed, misleading. For this reason, therefore, we see no merit in the deputy public prosecutor`s submission that alternative charges of trafficking in cannabis and trafficking in cannabis mixture could have been brought against the respondent.
The statutory definition of `cannabis mixture` lays down the specific scientific test which the DSS has to satisfy. The following extracts from the minister`s speech during the second reading of the Amendment Bill must be considered: 
 
... tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol are the two main alkaloids distinguishing cannabis from other hallucinogenic drugs. Detection of these two substances by the DSS chemist is sufficient scientific proof that the substance is cannabis mixture.
 
 
 
This lends justification to the DSS practice of treating anything under analysis which fails to qualify strictly as `cannabis` as being `cannabis mixture`, provided the mixture of vegetable matter under analysis contains tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in any quantity. There is nothing in s 2 MDA which suggests that scientific proof in any other respect is needed before a substance can be called `cannabis mixture`. Nor is there any requirement for a mixture of vegetable matter from different species. As the deputy public prosecutor quite rightly emphasised, the definition simply requires a mixture of any vegetable matter.
A restrictive construction of the phrase `mixture of vegetable matter` would operate to preclude a block composed of various parts of the same cannabis plant from being characterised as `cannabis mixture`. In our opinion, such a construction could not have been intended by Parliament. It would clearly omit to give effect to the ordinary or primary meaning of the term `cannabis mixture`. In its literal sense, the term clearly contemplates an unadulterated mixture of vegetable matter of entirely cannabis origin. This mixture may or may not be capable of being classified by the DSS as `cannabis`. By way of illustration, the `mixture` could well be a mixture of different grades or purity levels of cannabis, or a mixture of various parts from different cannabis plants. Alternatively, it could be a mixture of what has been loosely termed `crushed cannabis`, which is not susceptible to visual examination to detect the characteristics of the cannabis plant. Having regard to the primary meaning of the term, all the above `mixtures` would still be `mixture[s] of vegetable matter containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol in any quantity`.
We acknowledge that to take this view of the primary meaning of `cannabis mixture` involves recognising a degree of overlap between the definitions of `cannabis` and `cannabis mixture`. However, this does not give rise to any real cause for concern. Overlapping definitions, and indeed overlapping offences, are not anathema to enacted legislation.
Moreover, we are persuaded by the deputy public prosecutor`s submission that the primary meaning of `cannabis mixture` should not be displaced by its `extended` meaning. It was primarily on this count that this court`s construction in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was erroneous, in giving sole and exclusionary effect to the extended meaning of the term `cannabis mixture`. By the `extended` meaning, `any mixture of vegetable matter` contemplates the co-existence of vegetable matter of cannabis origin as well as non-cannabis vegetable matter. The term `cannabis mixture` would clearly embrace a mixture of two or more separate vegetable matters. Seen from this perspective, there is no real ambiguity in the definition of `cannabis mixture`. Both the primary and extended meanings have to be recognised. This appears to us to be entirely consistent with Parliament`s intention in introducing the offence of trafficking in `cannabis mixture` into the MDA in 1993.
The minister`s speech in Parliament confirms that an extended meaning of `cannabis mixture` was intended, taking into account its context in the MDA and the purpose or object underlying the MDA. No doubt, the minister made no express reference to both the primary and extended meanings which we have attached to the term `cannabis mixture`. He was obviously directing his explanatory speech solely to the extended meaning of the term. This would be an instance where the criticism might potentially have been levelled that the term `cannabis mixture` was being made to mean something it did not ordinarily suggest, namely, a mixture of cannabis with some other non-cannabis vegetable matter. It is evident that it was in seeking to address this potential criticism that the minister considered it necessary and appropriate to explain the extended meaning of `cannabis mixture`. As the minister emphasised, the term was intended to capture the cases of `camouflaging` cannabis by mixture with some other vegetable matter, eg tobacco.
From our perusal of the minister`s speech, we note that the minister did not suggest that once non-cannabis vegetable matter did not co-exist with vegetable matter of cannabis origin, the resultant substance would cease to be a `mixture of vegetable matter` within the meaning of the MDA. In explaining the reason for the extended meaning of `cannabis mixture`, the minister could not have intended to oust its primary meaning. If there had been any such intention, we do not see how it should have been achieved by what was apparently a casual omission of explicit reference in the Parliamentary debates. There is no reason why the maxim of construction expressio unius must apply to the minister`s speech.
It may also be noted that in s 17 MDA there was already a provision dating from Act 38/89 referring to cannabis or cannabis resin `whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture`. As a consequence of the 1993 amendment introducing `cannabis mixture`, the provision now contains a dual reference to `mixture`: 
 
Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than -
 
 
 
... 
(da) 
 30 grammes of cannabis mixture 
; 
...
 
 
 
whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation 
 or mixture
 shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
At first blush, the above provision may appear tautologous, insofar as it mentions `30 grammes of cannabis mixture ... whether or not contained in any ... mixture`. However, on closer scrutiny, it may be said that this supports the deputy public prosecutor`s construction of what constitutes `cannabis mixture`. The term can bear the primary meaning of `any mixture of cannabis vegetable matter`, as well as the secondary meaning of `any mixture of cannabis and non-cannabis vegetable matter`. The latter scenario is clearly contemplated by the concept of a `mixture within a mixture`.
The court`s primary function in construing statutes is to give effect to the legislative intent. Mason J (as he then was) rightly pointed out that, if the court is convinced that a previous decision does not truly reflect the legislative intent of an enactment, it should correct the mistake and not perpetuate the error (
 Babaniaris v Lutony Fashion Pty Ltd 
 (1987) 71 ALR 225 at p 232). A fortiori, the error should be rectified as soon as practicable where the previous decision has distorted the law as intended by Parliament (per Lord Bridge and Lord Hailsham LC in 
 R v Shivpuri 
 at pp 23, 11). We were persuaded that the reasoning in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was clearly erroneous and should therefore be overruled. Accordingly, we so order.
 Prospective or retrospective overruling
 
 
 
 Background
 
The trial judge noted that, if this court were to hold that the exhibits were indeed `cannabis mixture`, then `based on circumstantial evidence it would have been in order to call for the defence of the accused for the whole amount stated in the charge`. However, it must be noted that, at the time when the respondent allegedly committed the offence ie 16 April 1996, there was no definitive judicial interpretation of the meaning of `cannabis mixture`. At first instance in 
 Abdul Raman 
 (
 PP v Abdul Raman bin Yusoff & Ors 
 (CC 4/96) (unreported)), the trial judge had left the question open. The judge had referred to the minister`s speech in Parliament during the second reading of the amendment bill. Having done so, the judge stated (at para 115): 
 
 
115 It is clear from the foregoing speech that the intention in introducing the new definition of cannabis mixture was to further refine the law with a view to deterring drug traffickers peddling drugs in mixed form, that is, by breaking up the plant and mixing it with other vegetable matter such as tobacco. In the case at hand, the seized substance did not contain any tobacco or any other vegetable matter. At any rate, Dr Lee was easily able to separate and identify the intact branches from the others and was able to confirm by macroscopic and microscopic examination that they possessed the features of cannabis. The chemical analysis carried out by him on 590.23g of the intact branches also revealed that they contained sufficient quantities of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol, so as to confirm his finding that the analysed portion was indeed cannabis. 
 
(116) The contention by defence counsel, that so long as the cannabis was found to be mixed with or intermingled with any other foreign matter, the whole matter should be regarded as cannabis mixture, is not in accord with the intention of the legislature in enacting the new provision adverted to. 
 In my opinion, so long as the cannabis whose stalks are not broken up could be separated from foreign matter and such matter can be identified by visual, microscopic and chemical analysis as cannabis, the fact that it was in a bundle with other substance does not render it to be classified as cannabis mixture. In the circumstances, the contention by counsel that the whole slab should be correctly classified as cannabis mixture was rejected. 
 [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
The above passages demonstrate that the trial judge did not quite traverse the same territory charted by this court when judgment was delivered on appeal in 
 Abdul Raman 
 on 29 July 1996. The question before us now is whether the law as stated by this court on 29 July 1996 should apply to the respondent. Essentially, this requires us to consider whether 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case should be made subject to prospective or retrospective overruling.
 The deputy public prosecutor`s submissions
It is apparent from the deputy public prosecutor`s submissions that a decision from this court having retrospective effect is sought. Unfortunately, we were unable to glean much assistance in this respect from the submissions put forward by counsel for the respondent. We set out the deputy public prosecutor`s written arguments on this point verbatim: 
 
It is submitted that if the finding of this court is that the definition in 
 Abdul Raman v PP
 of `any vegetable matter` was not correct, this opportunity should be taken to review the definition [of cannabis mixture] for the following reasons:
 
 
 
... 
(b) ... there would be no adverse effect on accused persons in that no ambiguity would be created by deviating from the definition in 
 Abdul Raman v PP 
. There can be no doubt that the Singaporean public is well aware of the severe punishment that is attached to trafficking in drugs. The suggestion that drug traffickers might be misled into believing that trafficking in crushed cannabis is no crime (flowing from the decision in 
 Abdul Raman v PP 
) is easily countered by the fact that the trafficker, 
 being aware that he was trafficking in pure cannabis 
, would not need to concern himself with the definition of cannabis mixture. 
 His actions would constitute the crime of trafficking in cannabis. 
 The only misconception that the trafficker might be under is that he would be able to evade prosecution because of the difficulties that the prosecution would have in proving the content of the vegetable matter. I submit that 
 this uncertainty as to whether the crime can be proved or not, where the accused is himself sure that he is committing a crime, is not one that the Court should concern itself with. 
 
(c) It follows from (b) above that `... it would seem impossible that anyone could have acted to his detriment in reliance on the law as stated in the decision` (per Lord Hailsham in 
 R v Shivpuri 
 
[1987] 1 AC 1
 House of Lords at p 11, which was the first case in UK where the House of Lords reversed its own previous decision). In the same case Lord Bridge in the leading judgment of a unanimous House of Lords said, in giving his reasons for departing from the previous House of Lords decision in 
 Anderton v Ryan 
 said (at p 23), `... I cannot see how, in the very nature of the case, anyone could have acted in reliance on the law as propounded in 
 Anderton v Ryan 
 in the belief that he was acting innocently and now find that, after all, he is held to have committed a criminal offence`. The statement applies with equal force to the present appeal. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The deputy public prosecutor`s submissions rest on the hypothesis that an agglomeration of vegetable matter which has been loosely labelled `crushed cannabis` is in fact `pure cannabis`. He reasoned that a person in a position similar to that of the respondent could therefore be charged for trafficking in cannabis. Such a person would be conscious that he was in fact committing a crime.
With respect, as we have stated earlier, we do not agree with the Deputy Public Prosecution`s reasoning. The `crushed cannabis` cannot be properly classified as `cannabis` by the DSS unless all three tests laid down by the UN Manual are satisfied. It is apparent that once the cannabis is crushed or pulverised, the visual or macroscopic examination for parts of the cannabis plant invariably fails. There can therefore be no crime of trafficking in `cannabis`. This has always been the state of the law. The DSS methods of testing for `cannabis` have been alluded to even before 1996: see the decision of this court in 
 Teo Tiang Hoe v PP 
 (Crim App 25/95) (unreported).
As for the deputy public prosecutor`s reference to 
 R v Shivpuri 
, it will be useful to examine the decision of the House of Lords in further detail. This was a case where their Lordships overruled their previous decision in 
 Anderton v Ryan 
 [1985] AC 567, in which it was held that by s 1, UK Criminal Attempts Act 1981, attempts to commit offences which were, on their true facts, impossible, were not criminal offences as they were `objectively innocent`. The power to overrule previous decisions was derived from the 1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) 
[1966] 1 WLR 1234
. By their decision in 
 Shivpuri 
, the House of Lords affirmatively established that an attempt to commit an impossible offence could still be a criminal offence. On the facts in 
 Shivpuri 
 itself, the accused was therefore held to have been correctly convicted of attempting to traffic in controlled drugs, despite the fact that what he had had in his possession was, in reality, either snuff or some harmless vegetable matter.
The leading judgment of the House of Lords was delivered by Lord Bridge, who stated at p 23: 
 
I am thus led to the conclusion that there is no valid ground on which 
 Anderton v Ryan
 can be distinguished. I have made clear my own conviction, which as a party to the decision (and craving the indulgence of my noble and learned friends who agreed in it) I am the readier to express, that the decision was wrong. What then is to be done? If the case is indistinguishable, the application of the strict doctrine of precedent would require that the present appeal be allowed. Is it permissible to depart from precedent under the Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) 
[1966] 1 WLR 1234
, notwithstanding the especial need for certainty in the criminal law? The following considerations lead me to answer that question affirmatively. First, I am undeterred by the consideration that the decision in 
 Anderton v Ryan
 was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretension to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better. Secondly, 
 I cannot see how, in the very nature of the case, anyone could have acted in reliance on the law as propounded in Anderton v Ryan in the belief that he was acting innocently and now find that, after all, he is to be held to have committed a criminal offence
. Thirdly, to hold the House bound to follow 
 Anderton v Ryan
 because it cannot be distinguished and to allow the appeal in this case would, it seems to me, be tantamount to a declaration that the Act of 1981 left the law of criminal attempts unchanged following the decision in 
 R v Smith
 
[1975] AC 476
. Finally, if, contrary to my present view, there is a valid ground on which it would be proper to distinguish cases similar to that considered in 
 Anderton v Ryan
, my present opinion on that point would not foreclose the option of making such a distinction in some future case. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Evidently, their Lordships` key reason for overruling 
 Anderton v Ryan 
 was that it was not possible for any person who had attempted to commit an impossible offence to be retrospectively disadvantaged by the decision in 
 Shivpuri 
. The change in the law which criminalises an attempt to commit an impossible crime would have no bearing on his belief that he was acting innocently or otherwise. There was no element of reliance on the law of criminal attempts when the offender was committing an impossible crime. His own misguided beliefs rendered the state of the law irrelevant.
Hence, 
 Shivpuri 
 stands on a separate footing, because of the unique nature of the offence of impossible attempts in criminal law. We do not agree with the deputy public prosecutor that the views of Lord Bridge which he has cited would apply `with equal force to the present appeal`. His Lordship`s statements must be read in the proper context of that case.
 III Article 11 and the principle of nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege
Article 11 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore states: 
 
 
(1) No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed. 
 
(2) A person who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence shall not be tried again for the same offence except where the conviction or acquittal has been quashed and a retrial ordered by a court superior to that by which he was convicted or acquitted.
  
 
 
Article 11(1) embodies the basic principle of criminal jurisprudence of nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege: `conduct cannot be punished as criminal unless some rule of law has already declared conduct of that kind to be criminal and punishable as such`. The nullum principle denies the validity of retrospective declaration of the criminality of any kind of conduct, and also the justifiability of a court or judge declaring to be criminal anything not previously declared criminal (
 The Oxford Companion to Law 
 (1980) Oxford, at p 895).
In 
 Reference re ss 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
 (1990) 56 CCC (3d) 65, Lamer J (as he then was), who delivered the leading judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated at p 86: 
 
... the ancient Latin maxim 
 nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege
 [establishes] that there can be no crime or punishment unless it is in accordance with law that is certain, unambiguous and not retroactive. The rationale underlying this principle is clear. It is essential in a free and democratic society that citizens are able, as far as possible, to foresee the consequences of their conduct in order that persons be given fair notice of what to avoid, and that the discretion of those entrusted with law enforcement is limited by clear and explicit legislative standards: see Professor L. Tribe, 
 American Constitutional Law
 (2nd Ed) (1988), p1033. This is especially important in the criminal law, where citizens are potentially liable to a deprivation of liberty if their conduct is in conflict with the law.
 
 
 
Article 2 of our Constitution defines the word `law` as follows: 
 
`law` includes written law and any legislation of the United Kingdom or other enactment or instrument whatsoever which is in operation in Singapore and the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore and any custom or usage having the force of law in Singapore.
 
 
 
Article 2 provides an `inclusive` definition. Constitutional provisions should be liberally construed to advance their intent and to prevent their circumvention. This is a well-settled principle of construction. In 
 Ong Ah Chuan v PP 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
; [1980-1981] SLR 48 a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from Singapore, Lord Diplock observed at p 70: 
 
... the way to interpret a constitution on the Westminster model is to treat it not as if it were an Act of Parliament but as sui generis, calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its character ... without necessary acceptance of all the presumptions that are relevant to legislation of private law.
 
 
 
Even if the definition of `law` in art 2 had to be construed according to the ordinary canons of statutory construction, the use of the word `includes` indicates that the definition is extensive. Although various `inclusive` meanings of `law` are contained in art 2, they do not derogate from the ordinary meaning of the word `law`. As Lord Selborne said in 
 Robinson v Barton-Eccles Local Board 
 
(1883) 8 App Cas 798
 (at p 801), in discussing the meaning of the term `street` as used in s 157 of the Public Health Act 1875, as interpreted in an `inclusive` fashion in s 4 of the same Act: 
 
An interpretation clause of this kind is not meant to prevent the word receiving its ordinary, popular, and natural sense whenever that would be properly applicable, but to enable the word as used in the Act, when there is nothing in the context or the subject-matter to the contrary, to be applied to some thing to which it would not ordinarily be applicable.
 
 
 
We are of the view that the word `law` contained in art 2 and art 11(1) must be read in its `ordinary, popular and natural sense` to include judicial pronouncements, or judicial interpretation of statutory provisions which create criminal liability. In expounding the declaratory theory of law, Sir William Blackstone (
 Commentaries on the Laws of England 
, Book I (1765, 1992 reprint, New York) opined, in effect, that judges did not `make law` by way of judicial pronouncements. Rather, according to Blackstonian doctrine (at pp 69-70): 
 
... the law in that case being solemnly declared and determined, what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private sentiments ... [The judge is] not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.
 
 
 
Blackstone further observed that where judges overrule their previous decisions: 
 
... even in such cases the subsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate the old one from misrepresentation. For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or unjust, 
 it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law;
 that is, that it is not the established custom of the realm, as has been erroneously determined. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The logical implication of Blackstone`s declaratory theory is that a judicial pronouncement can always be overruled retrospectively simply on the basis that `it was not law`. In our opinion, the better view is to acknowledge the fiction of the declaratory theory. Indeed, in modern times, Blackstonian theory has had to make way for the concession that judges do in fact make law (see eg Lord Reid, 
 The Judge as Law Maker 
 (1972-1973) 12 JSPTL 22, 23). As suggested by Daniel Seng (
 Of Retrospective Criminal Laws and Prospective Overruling: Revisiting Public Prosecutor v Tan Meng Khin & 24 Ors 
 
(1996) 8 SAcLJ 1
, at p 13): 
 
... when judges overrule previous decisions, they always have to consider the retroactive effect of these judicial pronouncements. The slate of the past cannot just simply be wiped clean of its chalk marks.
 
 
 
In 
 Chicot County Drainage District v Baxter State Bank et al 
 (1940) 308 US 371, Hughes CJ, delivering the opinion of the US Supreme Court, stated at p 374: 
 
The courts below have proceeded on the theory that the Act of Congress, having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was inoperative, conferring no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording no basis for the challenged decree ... It is quite clear, however, that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications. 
 The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.
 The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects - with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application, demand examination. These questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous decisions that 
 an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The above observations were made by Hughes CJ in response to arguments relating to judicial pronouncements on the constitutionality of certain statutory provisions. Nonetheless, they are equally applicable to the present discussion. As Hughes CJ quite aptly put it, `the past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration` and `a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified`.
The doctrine of prospective overruling evolved in American jurisprudence in order to address the problem of retrospective reversal of past acts and decisions, where a statute (or part thereof) is declared unconstitutional: see 
 Great Northern R Co v Sunburst Oil & Refining Co 
 (1932) 287 US 358. Its applicability beyond the sphere of constitutional law has since been recognised in the leading US Supreme Court decision of 
 Linkletter v Walker 
 (1965) 381 US 618.
In contrast, in 
 Golak Nath v State of Punjab 
 AIR 1967 SC 1643, the Indian Supreme Court chose to restrict its application of the doctrine of prospective overruling to issues arising under the Constitution. Subba Rao CJ explained (at p 1669) that the court `would like to move warily in the beginning` since that was the first time it had been `called upon to apply the doctrine evolved in a different country under different circumstances`.
Like the Indian Supreme Court in 
 Golak Nath 
, this is the first occasion that this court has been called upon to consider applying the doctrine of prospective overruling. It would undoubtedly be advisable to approach the matter with a measure of circumspection. Even so, we do not propose to follow the narrow path marked out in 
 Golak Nath 
. There is no compelling reason why prospective overruling must be confined only to issues arising under the Constitution. In any event, while certain of the issues arising in the present case may be characterised broadly as `constitutional issues`, the primary task before us involves statutory construction.
By judicial overruling of a previous decision, new law may be pronounced for the first time. The rule of law requires adherence to the maxim ignorantia juris neminem excusat: ignorance of the law excuses no one. However, if a person organises his affairs in accordance with an existing judicial pronouncement about the state of the law, his actions should not be impugned retrospectively by a subsequent judicial pronouncement which changes the state of the law, without his having been afforded an opportunity to reorganise his affairs. This seeks to protect his reasonable and legitimate expectations that he did not act in contravention of the law. In addition, as in the case of new enacted legislation which creates criminal liability, proper notification (by way of publication) must be given prior to its commencement. In the words of Lamer J from 
 Reference re ss 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
, the nullum principle requires that citizens must be `able, as far as possible, to foresee the consequences of their conduct in order that persons be given fair notice of what to avoid`. These principles of legitimate expectation and notification are the foundations for art 11(1) and the nullum principle.
In our opinion, where art 11(1) and the nullum principle are brought into operation, the courts are precluded from retrospectively reversing a previous interpretation of a criminal statutory provision where the new interpretation creates criminal liability for the first time, and where it would operate to the prejudice of an accused. The same prohibition against retrospective overruling must apply equally where the new interpretation represents a reversal of the law as previously interpreted and effectively extends criminal liability.
 IV Applying the doctrine of prospective overruling
The effect of our decision to overrule 
 Abdul Raman 
 is to extend the scope of criminal liability in respect of trafficking in cannabis mixture, where 
 Abdul Raman 
 had previously attached a narrow construction to it. It is clear that if any persons had been caught in possession of what we will refer to loosely, if somewhat imprecisely, as `crushed cannabis` in the interval spanning 29 July 1996 and the delivery of this court`s decision in the instant case, it would be wholly unfair and unjust to prosecute them now with the capital offence of trafficking in `cannabis mixture`. The fact that there is a change in the law which extends criminal liability cannot provide justification for such an approach. These persons would have a legitimate expectation that 
 Abdul Raman 
 had authoritatively construed the law as not contemplating any capital offence of trafficking in `crushed cannabis`, where the `crushed cannabis` can neither be classified as `cannabis` nor as `cannabis mixture`. Article 11(1) and the nullum principle must operate to protect them from a retrospective imposition of criminal liability.
If liability is imposed retrospectively, the guilt or innocence of accused persons may well be affected, if not wholly determined, by such factors as the administrative efficiency of the prosecuting agencies or their discretion as to when to commence prosecution. These factors can be arbitrary and can operate to the prejudice of accused persons, including those in a position similar to that of the respondent. The following discussion amply illustrates this argument.
It would not have been difficult to foresee that persons who, like the respondent, were caught in possession of `crushed cannabis` and who have already been prosecuted and tried for trafficking in `cannabis mixture`, would have ended up in a position akin to the respondent at first instance. They would have been acquitted of the capital charge on the strength of this court`s ruling in
 Abdul Raman 
, pending any decision to overrule it. As far as these persons are concerned, their reasonable and legitimate expectations of how the law would have applied to them would have been vindicated.
However, complications may arise as there may still be pending similar cases to be tried or prosecuted, as the deputy public prosecutor has indicated. There can be no legal basis for drawing a distinction between one group of persons who have been acquitted of the charge, and the other whose cases await prosecution or trial, simply because of the relative dispatch with which the prosecution has operated, whether by conscious choice or otherwise. But for this court`s decision to overrule 
 Abdul Raman 
, and in the absence of any grounds for distinguishing that case, the construction of `cannabis mixture` adopted in 
 Abdul Raman 
`s case would have applied to the respondent, and any other persons who are brought before the court.
On 16 April 1996, when the offence was allegedly committed by the respondent, the state of the law as regards the definition of `cannabis mixture` was, to say the least, uncertain. There was no authority prior to 16 April 1996 which interpreted `cannabis mixture` as positively requiring the prosecution to prove the existence of two or more different types of vegetable matter (of cannabis and non-cannabis origin) in the mixture. It may be argued, therefore, that an individual who was caught in the respondent`s position could not be said to have harboured any legitimate expectation that the law would be as decided by this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
.
On the other hand, it cannot be gainsaid that an individual has a legitimate expectation that his actions are legal unless the law has expressly and clearly criminalised those actions. In this connection, it would be pertinent to see how the law has criminalised the respondent`s conduct in the present case. In view of the prevailing law on 16 April 1996, could he have been charged for possession of cannabis or cannabis mixture for the purpose of trafficking? As regards the former, it is clear from the scientific evidence that such a charge could not be sustained. As for the latter, we are of the opinion that, in the absence of an affirmative judicial interpretation which confirms what `cannabis mixture` means and includes, any uncertainty in the state of the law should prima facie be resolved in the respondent`s favour.
A further point must be considered. The primary question before this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
 was one of statutory construction. A ruling on the meaning of `cannabis mixture` was laid down by this court on 29 July 1996. However, there were no arguments raised as to whether the ruling should apply prospectively or retrospectively, nor was there any express direction by this court along either line. It follows, therefore, that the decision in 
 Abdul Raman 
 would have retrospective effect, and would apply to all conduct regardless of whether it takes place before or after 29 July 1996.
After this court`s ruling in 
 Abdul Raman 
 on 29 July 1996, and pending any decision to overrule it, any individual who has been charged with trafficking in cannabis mixture, regardless of when the offence was allegedly committed, would have expected that the law in 
 Abdul Raman 
 would apply to him. He would have expected that there was no capital offence known in law of trafficking in `cannabis mixture` which was comprised of `crushed cannabis`, unless the `crushed cannabis` had contained two or more different types of vegetable matter of both cannabis and non-cannabis origin. This was precisely the scenario in the respondent`s case. He was acquitted by the judge below, who rightly held that 
 Abdul Raman 
 was binding on him.
The decision of this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
 would have affirmed the respondent`s legitimate expectation that he would not have been charged with a capital offence of drug trafficking. The only offence which the respondent could be alleged to have committed was one of unauthorised possession of controlled drugs under s 8(a) MDA. The position in law on 16 April 1996 was that the `crushed cannabis` could not be properly classified as either `cannabis` or `cannabis mixture`. Hence, at the highest, the respondent could only have been charged with being in unauthorised possession of cannabinol and cannabinol derivatives (ie. tetrahydrocannabinol). He must be taken to have known that even if the `crushed cannabis` could no longer be classified as `cannabis`, or as `cannabis mixture`, it would nevertheless still be correctly characterised as a controlled Class A drug falling within the First Schedule of the MDA, since cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol would inevitably have been detected.
Article 11(1) expressly states that `no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed`. It follows that the respondent cannot be made to suffer any punishment in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed in relation to s 8(a) MDA, which is punishable with up to ten years` imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or both, in the case of first offenders.
On our understanding of art 11(1) and the nullum principle, and having regard to the circumstances of the present case, prospective overruling is mandated. In our opinion, all acts done subsequent to the delivery of this judgment will be governed by the law as stated herein. It follows that acts done prior to this date will be governed by the law as stated in 
 Abdul Raman. 
We should make it clear that the application of prospective overruling is only confined to the Court of Appeal, as the Practice Statement is not intended to affect the operation of the doctrine of precedent other than in this court. In this regard, we would adopt the approach of the Indian Supreme Court in 
 Golak Nath 
.
We will order that the respondent`s acquittal of the charge of trafficking in cannabis mixture be upheld, on the premise that the applicable law at the time when he allegedly committed the offence was as stated in the decision of this court in 
 Abdul Raman 
. It would nevertheless be appropriate to frame a charge against the respondent of having been in unauthorised possession of controlled Class A drugs. The prosecution has clearly adduced sufficient prima facie evidence to support such a charge. This court may exercise any power which the trial court might have exercised: s 54(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Section 163(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides: 
 
The trial court may alter any charge or frame a new charge, whether in substitution for or in addition to the existing charge at any time before judgment is given.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, we direct that a new charge against the respondent be framed in substitution for the capital charge of trafficking in cannabis mixture. The new charge avers that the respondent was in unauthorised possession of controlled Class A drugs, namely cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, contrary to s 8(a) of the MDA. Accordingly, we remit the case to the trial judge for the respondent`s defence to be called on this charge.

The appellant was convicted on the following charge: 
 
... that you, on or about 24 February 1994, at about 11.30am, in the lift A of Blk [X] Tampines St 8, Singapore, did use criminal force on [PW5], F/27 yrs, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said person, to wit, by hugging and kissing her cheeks, and in order to facilitate the commission of this offence, you caused instant wrongful restraint to the said person, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 354A(2)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to five years` imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. After hearing counsel for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor, I dismissed the appeal against conviction but reduced his sentence. I now give my reasons.
 The prosecution`s evidence
 
 
 
 PW5 - The victim
 
The victim (PW5) was a 27 year old Indonesian maid. At the time of the offence, she had only been in Singapore for a few days, having arrived on Friday, 18 February 1994. She was employed by PW4 and PW4`s husband. Her work included looking after PW4`s two daughters, who were four and two years old at the time.
One of PW5`s duties was to accompany the elder child down to the void deck of Block X, where the child would be picked up by the school bus. This she did at about 11am. She would take the lift down from the eleventh floor with the child. The lift does not stop at the ninth floor, where PW4`s flat is located. The bus usually arrived at about 11.15 to 11.20am.
The first time PW5 had to send the child off on the school bus was 21 February 1994, which was a Monday. On the first two days, she was accompanied by her employer (during cross-examination, she said that she was accompanied by PW4`s husband). On 23 February, while waiting for the school bus, she saw the appellant at the void deck of Block X. There was a short conversation between the appellant and the child. After this short conversation, she smiled and nodded at the appellant as a friendly gesture. The appellant asked her whether she spoke Malay. She answered that she could and that she was Indonesian.
On 24 February, PW5 was waiting for the school bus with the child when the appellant approached her. At the time, she was seated on one of the stone benches there. The appellant offered to take her out for food and sightseeing. She declined, saying that she came to Singapore to work and that she could not leave her employer`s flat. The appellant told her that she could tell her employer that they were going out together. She replied that she could not. He placed his hands on her body when they were talking. When he moved them towards her chest, she pulled away and told him to stop. The school bus arrived. She got up and sent the child up the bus. She did not see where the appellant went. Nobody else was at the void deck at the time.
She saw the appellant inside the lift when she returned. The appellant told her to go in quickly. The appellant asked which floor she was going to. She replied that she was going to the eleventh. The lift door closed. She stood with her arms crossed over her chest. The appellant came close to her. He touched her hands, body and face, and kissed both her cheeks. She told him to stop and pushed him away. The appellant stopped, but stood close to her. When the lift reached the eleventh floor, she tried to get out but the appellant pushed her, held her by the upper arms and told her to stay in the lift. At the same time, he pressed the `close` button on the lift. She managed to struggle free and escape from the lift. She ran back to the flat.
PW4 had opened the door and was waiting for her when she returned. PW4 was feeding the younger child near the kitchen. PW5 took out the vacuum cleaner. Her mind was on the incident. She approached PW4 and tried to tell her what happened. However, PW4 could not understand her, as she spoke in a mixture of Indonesian and Malay. She was frightened.
PW4 called her friend (PW6) and passed the handset to her. She told PW6 about what happened in the lift. She merely said that the appellant kissed her. She did not mention that he also hugged her. PW6 appeared to understand. After PW6 had spoken to PW4, PW4 told her to go down to the void deck and look for the appellant, saying that she would follow shortly.
She went downstairs. She looked around and saw the appellant seated near a kiosk at the next block. He was alone. A few minutes later, PW4 came down. She pointed at the appellant. PW4 went over and approached the appellant. She then waved for her to go over. PW4 asked if the appellant was the one. She said he was and PW4 called the police.
The police arrived shortly. Only one of the policemen could speak Malay. He asked PW5 what happened. She told him that the appellant touched her and kissed her while she was in the lift.
PW5 was cross-examined on the first incident in the void deck. Her evidence was that it lasted for about five minutes. The child was on her lap at the time. She told the appellant to stop touching her, but she did not move away because she was told by her employer to wait for the school bus. She did not scream because there was nobody around and she was not hurt. Even if the school bus had arrived late, she would have continued sitting there to wait for it, despite what the appellant was doing. She did not complain to the school bus driver because she did not speak English. She got into the lift with the appellant after the first incident as she did not expect the appellant to repeat what he did. When he molested her, she pushed him away.
An attempt was made to impeach her credit by referring to her statement to the police, which was made on 24 February 1994. She had not told the police about the incident at the void deck. The district judge ruled that, although she had not mentioned the first incident at the void deck, there was no material inconsistency. In response to questions from the court, she testified that she did not tell the police about what happened at the void deck because she did not feel embarrassed about that incident. She was not embarrassed when the appellant touched her breast at the void deck. However, she was when he kissed her in the lift. The incident in the lift frightened her.
PW4 testified that she and her husband employed PW5 as their maid on 18 February 1994. PW4 initially had difficulty communicating with her as PW4 did not speak Malay. She would call PW6 to translate for her.
On 24 February, PW5 took PW4`s elder daughter down to the void deck to wait for the school bus, and then returned to the flat between 11.20 and 11.25am. PW4 noticed that PW5 came back and closed the door hurriedly. PW4 was eating in the kitchen when PW5 spoke to her in Malay. PW5 looked frightened when she spoke to PW4. That was why PW4 called PW6 to ask her to translate what PW5 was saying. After PW4 had spoken to PW6, she told PW5 to go down to see whether the appellant was still downstairs. They went downstairs and the maid pointed out the appellant to PW4.
As PW4 confronted the appellant, PW5 stayed behind because she was frightened. PW4 asked a delivery man to accompany her, as she too was afraid. They approached the appellant. PW4 said to the appellant that her maid had told her that he had molested the maid. The appellant said that he might have touched PW5 accidentally when he wanted to touch PW4`s daughter`s face. PW4 replied that he did not have to explain to her. She told him to wait and went to call the police from the public phone. When the police arrived, she told them that PW5 said that the appellant had molested her.
 PW6 - Phylis Phang
PW6 is a Peranakan Chinese and knows basic Malay. She was an ex-colleague of PW4. On 24 February 1994, she was working in her office when she received a call from PW4. PW4 said that her maid might have been molested but she could not understand her fully. PW6 spoke to PW5. PW5 told her that there was a man following her. PW5 spoke very fast and PW6 could not understand everything that she said. PW6 asked PW5 whether the man touched her. PW5 did not answer, but merely kept repeating that she did not like to be followed and that she was `disturbed` by him. PW6 could not remember the phrases which she could not understand. PW5 sounded distressed.
 PW1 and PW2
PW1 and PW2 were Corporal Tan Kow Liang and Corporal Elyadi bin Yusman respectively. They gave evidence that at about 11.47am on 24 February 1994, they received a message to respond to a call that someone had molested the caller`s maid. They arrived at the void deck and saw the appellant, PW4 and PW5. PW1 questioned PW4 and PW2 questioned PW5.
The rest of PW1`s evidence related to what PW4 told him about what she was told by PW5. It was, strictly speaking, hearsay and was not useful. PW2`s evidence was that he interviewed PW5. She told PW2 that she had been molested by the appellant in the lift of the neighbouring block while she was sending PW4`s child to school. She said that the appellant held her waist from behind. She indicated with her gestures that he held her around the waist. He remembered that PW5 said that she was taking PW4`s daughter downstairs to wait for the school bus at the time. PW2 did not ask PW5 how many times the appellant held her because he was inexperienced.
 The defence`s evidence
The appellant was 64 years old. He lived on the eleventh floor of Block 872. He had retired from the Ministry of Community Development and was working as a trolley pusher at the airport. He gave evidence that he was on medical leave in February 1994 because he had injured his thumb.
The first time the appellant saw PW5 was on 21 February. He saw her with the child at the void deck. He did not speak to her on that occasion. According to the appellant, he saw her again the following day. The child greeted him and said `good morning` in Mandarin. PW5 greeted him in Malay. The appellant asked her if she was Malay. He could not remember if she said she was Indonesian or Filipino. He enquired if she cooked Chinese dishes. She said she could cook and asked about his hand. He could not remember if this was on 22 or 23 February.
The third time the appellant saw PW5 was on 24 February. She was sitting at the void deck when he came out of the lift. The child greeted him and there was a conversation between the two of them. PW5 greeted the appellant and asked about his hand. There were some people washing their cars at the nearby carpark at the time. He denied that he touched any part of PW5`s body when he was speaking to her. The school bus came and the child boarded the bus. He went to the lift. The lift came down and he entered it. He pressed the button for the eleventh floor. PW5 came and asked him to wait. The appellant told her to go in quickly. He asked her which floor she was going to. She answered that it was the eleventh.
PW5 asked the appellant whether the flat he was living in was rented or bought. They had a conversation. She was facing him and did not notice that the lift door had opened. The appellant informed her. The door was about to close when she dashed out. He pulled at her hand to prevent her from being hit by the door. As he did so, the lift door struck her left arm. As the door closed, he saw her through the gap. She waved at him and said, `Thank you uncle bye bye.` The appellant went down with the lift as he did not have the chance to get off.
The appellant explained that he had taken the lift up to the eleventh floor because he wanted to go back to his flat to take some money. He had wanted to buy some cigarettes but discovered that he had only $10 in his wallet. He thought it might not be sufficient as he intended to visit friends. When the lift came down again, he decided to go to the next block to buy a packet of cigarettes.
After a while, PW4, PW5 and a young man came. PW4 approached him and asked him why he had pulled at PW5`s hand. The appellant explained to her that the lift door was closing, but she refused to listen. She told him to wait for the police. He did not see PW4 call the police, but they came subsequently. At the police station, the appellant told the police that he did not do what was alleged. His statement, taken under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) was admitted without objection. In it, he merely said that he was innocent.
 The finding below
The district judge disbelieved the appellant. PW5 had only been in Singapore for a few days. After the incident, she had gone back to PW4`s flat hurriedly. Although PW4 could not understand PW5, PW4 could see that she was distressed and enlisted PW6`s help. Thereupon, they went down to the void deck to look for the appellant. He was identified and the police were summoned. There had been an immediate complaint to the authorities. The district judge was of the view that all these supported PW5`s testimony. He was satisfied that PW5 and PW4 were telling the truth.
The district judge held that the appellant`s version was difficult to accept. If, as he claimed, the appellant had wanted to help PW5 and she had waved to him when she left, it was hard to see why PW5 was seen returning to the flat and closing the door in a hurry. Furthermore, the appellant had not related his version of the event in his s 122(6) statement. The district judge drew an adverse inference from this. He had no difficulty finding the appellant guilty.
 The appeal
The appeal was solely on the facts. However, in view of the rather unusual circumstances of this case, it is a good opportunity to clear up some of the difficulties in this area of the law.
I start with the principle stated by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 PP v Mardai 
 
[1950] MLJ 33
 at p 33: 
 
Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated, nevertheless it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be unsafe to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the complainant`s story.
 
 
 
Likewise, Murray-Aynsley CJ in 
 Koh Eng Soon v R 
 
[1950] MLJ 52
 opined: 
 
In this case the complainant was an adult. In cases of this kind corroboration is desirable though not technically essential. Where the case has been heard by a magistrate or a district judge the appellate court must be satisfied that the court below appreciated fully the desirability of having corroboration and was not under a misapprehension that something was corroboration which as a matter of law was not.
 
 
 
It seems clear that the requirement for corroboration in cases of sexual offences also applies where the victim is male. This can be seen from the English case of 
 R v Burgess 
 (1956) 40 Cr App R 144. What is normally considered to be corroboration was stated by Lord Reading CJ in 
 R v Baskerville 
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
 at 667, which is regarded as the locus classicus. Corroboration means independent evidence which implicates the accused in the offence charged in a material particular.
The reason for requiring corroboration in any of these cases, however, is rather ill-explained. In 
 Din v PP 
 
[1964] MLJ 300
, Thomson LP opined in the Federal Court at p 301: 
 
In the case of accomplice evidence the need for corroboration arises from the nature of the witness who is somebody who may have an interest in making out the guilt of another in preference to his own. Again in the case of children`s evidence the need arises from the notorious unreliability of children as witnesses and in particular their known aptitude to confuse fact with fantasy. Neither in the case of accomplices nor children, however, is there any connection with the nature of the offence. The evidence of an accomplice or of a child calls for corroboration just as much in a case of assault or theft as in a case of murder.
 
 
 
But the desirability for corroboration of the evidence of the prosecutrix in a rape case (which in any event has not yet crystallized into something approaching a rule of law and which is still a rule of practice and prudence) springs not from the nature of the witness but from the nature of the offence. Never has it been suggested that the evidence of a woman as such invariably calls for corroboration. If a woman says her handbag has been snatched and if she is believed there can be no question of a conviction on such evidence being open to attack for want of corroboration. If, however, she complains of having been raped then both prudence and practice demand that her evidence should be corroborated.
Why this is so, at least in Thomson LP`s view, can be seen from the paragraph that followed: 
 
Here, however, the necessity for corroboration, generally speaking, is not so imperative with regard to the identity of her assailant as to the fact of the offence itself. It is here that there is danger. The temptations of a woman to exaggerate an act of sexual connection are well known and manifold. But though it might be dangerous to find the 
 factum
 of rape on the uncorroborated evidence of the prosecutrix once that 
 factum
 of rape is established there seems to be nothing left to support the view that her identification of the assailant calls for corroboration any more than it would in relation to any other type of offence.
 
 
 
A similar, though not exactly the same, view can be seen from Roberts CJ`s judgment in a case from Brunei. In 
 PP v Emran bin Nasir 
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 166
, he stated at p 171: 
 
I warn myself that, on a charge of rape, it is dangerous to convict on the evidence of the complainant alone, since experience has shown that female complainants have told false stories for various reasons.
 
 
 
In England, this view is found in 
 R v Henry, R v Manning 
 (1968) 53 Cr App R 160. There, Salmon LJ said at p 153: 
 
What the judge has to do is to use clear and simple language that will without any doubt convey to the jury that in cases of alleged sexual offences it is really dangerous to convict on the evidence of the woman or girl alone. This is dangerous because human experience has shown that in these courts girls and women do sometimes tell an entirely false story which is very easy to fabricate, but extremely difficult to refute. Such stories are fabricated for all sorts of reasons, which I need not now enumerate, and sometimes for no reason at all.
 
 
 
In the Eleventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee (Cmnd 4991), the view was expressed at para 186 that: 
 
In sexual cases it [the danger of convicting without corroboration] is the danger that the complainant may have made a false accusation owing to sexual neurosis, jealousy, fantasy, spite or a girl`s refusal to admit that she consented to an act of which she is now ashamed ... In the case of a sexual offence the danger may be hidden. Moreover the nature of the evidence may make the jury too sympathetic to the complainant and so prejudice them against the accused.
 
 
 
However, it is hard to see why the same considerations do not apply in cases involving other offences. A false accusation concerning other offences can just as easily arise from sexual neurosis, jealousy, fantasy or spite. The danger is no less hidden in such cases. It may be the case that such motives to falsely implicate may have a particular bearing upon sexual cases, but, surely, this should only mean that the evidence must be sifted with care, which should, in any event, be done in all cases. Of course, the problem is especially acute in sexual cases as it is in the nature of such offences that it is often the case that all the court has before it are the words of the victim against the words of the accused.
In 
 R v Pahuja 
 (1988) 49 SASR 191, a case from Southern Australia, King CJ made the following pertinent observation when referring to s 34i(5) of the Southern Australian Evidence Act 1929, which abolished the mandatory requirement to give a corroboration warning, at p 199: 
 
Although I consider that s 34i(5) has had the effect of abolishing the rule of law or practice relating to corroboration warnings in sexual cases, I cannot read into it some of the wider implications attributed to it. It does not confer upon the evidence of an alleged victim in a sexual case any particular legal status, nor inhibit the triers of the facts in a sexual case from weighing that evidence in the usual way, having in mind such aspects of human nature and behaviour as they consider to be material for that purpose. Acts of Parliament do not and do not purport to, change human nature. There are aspects of human nature and behaviour, such as sexual appetite, certain motives for making false complaints and proneness to certain types of fantasies, which have a peculiar bearing upon sexual cases and which may be important in certain factual situations. The ease of making an allegation and difficulty of refutation, often given as reasons for the former rule, are considerations not entirely confined to sexual cases, but are often nevertheless of considerable importance in such cases. The trial judge is not required to ignore such matters in charging the jury and may have a duty in certain cases to remind them of such considerations ...
 
 
 
The passage is salutary. It emphasises that in a trial for sexual offences, what is important is that the evidence is weighed carefully, always bearing in mind the relevant aspects of human nature and behaviour. It would be wrong to be bogged down by technicalities, especially when it has no logical bearing to the problem at hand. King CJ`s observation that Acts of Parliament cannot purport to change human behaviour is particularly insightful.
Much the same position has now been reached in the United Kingdom. The old English common law rule under which it is obligatory to give a corroboration warning in cases involving sexual offences has been abolished by s 32 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. This section came into effect on 3 February 1995.
 R v Makanjuola, R v Easton 
 [1995] 3 All E R 730 could well be the first reported case from the Court of Appeal on this matter since that section came into effect. Invited to give guidance as to the circumstances in which, as a matter of discretion, a judge ought in summing up to a jury to urge caution in regard to a particular witness and the terms in which that should be done, Lord Taylor CJ said at p 732: 
 
The circumstances and evidence in criminal cases are infinitely variable and it is impossible to categorise how a judge should deal with them. But it is clear that to carry on giving `discretionary` warnings generally and in the same terms as were previously obligatory would be contrary to the policy and purpose of the 1994 Act. Whether, as a matter of discretion, a judge should give any warning and if so its strength and terms must depend upon the content and manner of the witness`s evidence, the circumstances of the case and the issues raised. The judge will often consider that no special warning is required at all. Where, however, the witness had been shown to be unreliable, he or she may consider it necessary to urge caution. In a more extreme case, if the witness is shown to have lied, to have made previous false complaints, or to bear the defendant some grudge, a stronger warning may be thought appropriate and the judge may suggest it would be wise to look for some supporting material before acting on the impugned witness`s evidence. We stress that these observations are merely illustrative of some, not all, of the factors which judges may take into account in measuring where a witness stands in the scale of reliability and what response they should make at that level in their directions to the jury ...
 
 
 
At p 733, the following additional observations were made in Lord Taylor CJ`s summary: 
 
In some cases, it may be appropriate for the judge to warn the jury to exercise caution before acting upon the unsupported evidence of a witness. This will not be so simply because the witness is a complainant of a sexual offence ... There will need to be an evidential basis for suggesting that the evidence of the witness may be unreliable. An evidential basis does not include mere suggestions by cross-examing counsel.
 
 
 
...
Where the judge does decide to give some warning in respect of a witness, it will be appropriate to do so as part of the judge`s review of the evidence and his comments as to how the jury should evaluate it rather than as a set-piece legal direction.
Where some warning is required, it will be for the judge to decide the strength and terms of the warning. It does not have to be invested with the whole florid regime of the old corroboration rules.
In Singapore, there is no jury trial. There is no legal requirement that a judge must warn himself expressly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant in a case involving sexual offences. There is, however, authority to the effect that it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless her evidence is unusually compelling. There is therefore no reason for the courts here to be bogged down by legal technicalities as to whether or not there is corroboration and what is or is not, legally speaking, corroboration.
In my view, the right approach is to analyse the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence, and decide whether the complainant`s evidence is so reliable that a conviction based solely on it is not unsafe. If it is not, it is necessary to identify which aspect of it is not so convincing and for which supporting evidence is required or desired. In assessing the supporting evidence, the question then is whether this supporting evidence makes up for the weakness in the complainant`s evidence. All these would, of course, have to be done in the light of all the circumstances of each case and all the evidence, including the defence evidence, as well as accumulated knowledge of human behaviour and common sense.
This way, the proper weight is given to the right evidence, and no undue weight is assigned to some evidence merely because it is called `corroboration` or `supporting evidence`. Likewise, it ensures that insufficient weight will not be given to other evidence merely because there was an absence of `corroboration` or `supporting evidence` in relation to some other issue where such evidence is not even necessary.
Support for this proposition can be found in 
 DPP v Kilbourne 
 
[1973] AC 729
. In that case, Lord Reid observed at p 750: 
 
There is nothing technical in the idea of corroboration. When in the ordinary affairs of life one is doubtful whether or not to believe a particular statement one naturally looks to see whether it fits in with other statements or circumstances relating to the particular matter; the better it fits in, the more one is inclined to believe it. The doubted statement is corroborated to a greater or lesser extent by the other statements or circumstances with which it fits in.
 
 
 
Such, in my view, is the approach in local cases. In 
 Din v PP 
, which was referred to above, Thompson LP observed at p 301: 
 
... The rule relating to corroboration, like most of the other rules of our law of evidence, is not a purely technical rule contravention of which is fatal to a conviction. The rules of evidence are not rules for governing a forensic game of chess; they are rules for the administration of justice and they are based on accumulated human experience and common sense. That particularly applies to the rules relating to corroboration.
 
 
 
In 
 Brabakaran v PP 
 
[1966] 1 MLJ 64
, another case from the Federal Court, Ong ACJ held that: 
 
Corroborative evidence is not necessarily restricted to the oral evidence of an independent witness. Corroboration can equally well be afforded by established facts and the logic of established facts sometimes speaks even more eloquently than words.
 
 
 
In that case, the offence was one of statutory rape. Consent was therefore not a relevant issue. The girl`s evidence was that she had sexual intercourse with the appellant. There does not appear to be any dispute that the girl had sexual intercourse with someone. The Federal Court held that in the circumstances, if during the confinement of the girl`s elder sister she had to go to her sister`s house to look after her sister`s children, when the appellant`s mother had to go to hospital and the girl`s services were again required, it was more than probable that the girl in fact went to assist her sister`s family during the period when the appellant`s mother was in hospital, and that what she said was true. As it was not suggested that the girl had any male friends, and nobody else even remotely connected could have had sexual intercourse with the girl, the court held that the appellant`s conviction was right.
 Augustine Foong Boo Jang v PP 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 225
 is a recent case from Brunei. In that case, the appellant was convicted of raping his maid. The sole issue was consent. The appellant`s defence, supported by his wife, was that he had had a continuing sexual relationship with the maid for two months prior to the alleged rape and that the incident took place with the maid`s consent. There was no evidence of resistance. A medical examination conducted the day after the incident had revealed that there was a recent laceration of the maid`s hymen. The Brunei Court of Appeal had no difficulty in upholding the conviction.
In relation to corroboration, Hunter Commissioner stated at p 226: 
 
A point has been taken on corroboration. It is said that what [the trial judge] said was wrong and that the laceration of the hymen did not amount to corroboration. We disagree. We feel, in the circumstances of this case, that that evidence did support her account of lack of consent, because the consent alleged here had been a continuing consent extending over a period of at least two months to continuous intercourse between the parties over that time. The doctor made it clear that this recent laceration was consistent with recent intercourse. It is very difficult to see that it could be consistent with intercourse extending over that whole period.
 
 
 
The court was even more unimpressed with the argument that there could be a lack of mens rea. At p 227, Hunter Commissioner held: 
 
On the facts here it was quite impossible to draw any distinction between the fact of consent and reasonable belief in consent. Either this girl had consented since July to a sexual relationship or she had not. There was no half-way house.
 
 
 
These cases, although couched in the traditional language of corroboration, show that it is important to identify the issues at hand, and then examine the evidence before the court in the light of these issues. To recite mechanically that it is unsafe to convict without corroboration and to delve into what is or is not, technically speaking, corroboration without relating the evidence to the relevant issues would obfuscate the matter, which is essentially a factual one. It would be a true instance of not seeing the wood from the trees.
One such example is the controversy at one stage in England over whether circumstantial evidence can corroborate. In 
 Thomas v Jones 
 
[1921] 1 KB 22
, Atkin J, following to the letter what was said in 
 R v Baskerville 
, stated at p 48: 
 
... it appears to me impossible, when dealing with the question of corroboration, that the accumulation of pieces of evidence, each of which by itself is not admissible as corroborative evidence, can amount in the whole to corroboration. 
 Ex nihilo nihil fit
.
 
 
 
The views of this great judge always command respect. However, I must respectfully disagree in this case. In 
 R v Hills 
 (1988) 86 Cr App R 26, the contrary view was stated at p 30: 
 
Corroboration is not infrequently provided by a combination of pieces of circumstantial evidence, each innocuous on its own, which together tend to show that the defendant committed the crime. For example, in a rape case, where the defendant denies he ever had sexual intercourse with the complainant, it may be possible to prove (1) by medical evidence that she had had sexual intercourse within an hour or so prior to the medical examination, (2) by other independent evidence that the defendant and no other man had been with her during that time, (3) that her underclothing was torn and that she had injuries to her private parts. None of these items of evidence on their own would be sufficient to provide the necessary corroboration, but the judge would be entitled to direct the jury that if they were satisfied so as to feel sure that each of those three items had been proved, the combined effect of the three items would be capable of corroborating the girl`s evidence.
 
 
 
This is but common sense. The only surprise is that it took so long for it to be recognised. If a conviction for an offence can be secured solely on circumstantial evidence, there is no reason at all why corroboration cannot also be based purely on circumstantial evidence. The contrary position would lead to the absurdity that the prosecution`s case is stronger if the victim is unable to give evidence.
Another example is when it is not disputed that someone had committed a sexual offence on the victim, where the only live issue before the court is one of identification. Again, the surprise is that it was only in 
 R v Chance 
 [1988] 3 All ER 225 that it was authoritatively laid down that, where no one could sensibly say that no sexual offence had occurred, no corroboration warning need be given. A direction following the guidelines in 
 R v Turnbull 
 
[1977] QB 224
 would suffice.
As Roche J observed in 
 R v Chance 
 at p 229, the contrary position would be that it would be better for a burglar to rape the occupant of the house as well: 
 
In those circumstances, if one applies the corroboration rules strictly, the woman`s evidence about the identity of the intruder requires no corroboration if he confines himself to robbing or stealing, but must be the subject of the usual warning if, having stolen or robbed, he then goes on to rape the woman, despite the fact that the rape would almost certainly give her more opportunity and more incentive to observe and memorise his appearance rather than the robbery or theft.
 
 
 
If the law demands that in those or similar circumstances the usual warning should be given by the judge, it puts an unexpected and unwelcome premium on rape. Presumably also in such circumstances, the judge would have the task of explaining to the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the victim in respect of rape but not dangerous so far as the robbery was concerned. Moreover, any judge might be forgiven for hesitating long before adding insult to injury by explaining to a jury the reasons for the usual warning, namely, that the unfortunate householder, allegedly burgled and raped in her own home, might have made a false accusation owing to sexual neurosis, fantasy, spite or refusal to admit consent of which she is now ashamed of or any of the other reasons in 
 R v Henry, R v Manning 
.
It is perhaps noteworthy that in Malaysia the opposite course of development appears to have taken place. In 
 Din v PP 
, Thomson LP held that once the factum of rape had been found, there was no longer any need to look for corroboration regarding identification. The relevant passage at p 301 has already been reproduced above. However, in 
 PP v Mohamed bin Majid 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 121
, it was held by Harun J that in a prosecution for rape it is unsafe to convict unless there is corroboration on both the allegation of rape and the identification of the assailant.
Although the results of both these Malaysian cases appear justifiable on their facts, the approach taken appears to focus more on legal technicalities. In many cases it is dangerous to convict on a sole witness`s unsupported identification evidence. However, this is because identification carries with it its own set of difficulties. Apart from the usual danger of concoction, identification evidence can be unreliable because of a myriad of other reasons. These issues have been identified in 
 R v Turnbull 
. They are no less applicable in cases involving sexual offences, though, as was pointed out in 
 R v Chance 
, there could be rare cases where the sexual nature of the case may have affected the complainant`s identification evidence, and hence, compounded the difficulty.
In the two Malaysian cases cited above, it would have been more fruitful to examine the reliability of the identification in the light of the evidence, rather than on whether or not corroboration is desirable because the case involved a sexual offence. Harun J in 
 Mohamed bin Majid 
 noted that the victim did not describe the assailant to anyone immediately after the incident or even when she made the police report. However, there was no reason why she should. It may well be the case that nobody asked for a description. On the facts of that case, the decision could easily be justified by the reason that the identification parade was conducted in such a flawed manner and was so prejudicial to the accused that any subsequent identification of the accused by the victim was unreliable. In such a case, it was imperative to look for supporting evidence, regardless of whether the offence was a sexual one.
Over-concentration on legal technicalities have also produced some rather difficult cases on the facts. In 
 PP v Nasar bin Ahmad & Ors 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 71
, another case from Brunei, this time at first instance, the complainant said that she was raped in a car by D1, D3 and one Jurol, and that D2 also attempted to rape her. It was her evidence that, immediately after this incident, she was taken to a house by D1 and D2 where they raped her again.
Roberts CJ held that there was corroboration of the victim`s evidence in relation to the first incident in the form of testimonies from witnesses and that the victim`s evidence was credible. D1 and D3 were convicted of rape and D2 of attempted rape. However, in relation to the second incident, he held that there was no corroboration and so D1 and D2 were acquitted.
With respect, the acquittals on the second charge are hard to justify. D2`s evidence was that he spent the night in the room with her and that he did not have any physical contact with her as he rejected her advances. That being so, how can there be any doubt that D2 was obviously lying about what happened in the room? That would have entailed the court believing that after the victim was gang raped by three men and after D2 had attempted to rape her as well, she turned around and made sexual overtures to D2. This was patently ludicrous.
If the victim could be believed in relation to the first incident, and D2 could not, why should she not be believed in relation to the second incident? She did not fabricate her evidence in relation to the first incident and she clearly did not fantasise it. There was no evidential basis at all in the circumstances for suggesting that she could have done so in relation to the second incident. There was thus no basis for doubting her evidence. Likewise, D1`s credibility had been totally demolished in the trial. There was similarly no basis to doubt the victim`s evidence against him. This is especially so when he said that he spent the night in a room with PW7, when it was PW7`s evidence that he remained outside the house and did not know what happened in there.
In 
 Sabli bin Adin & Ors v PP 
 
[1978] 1 MLJ 210
, the appellant was convicted of statutory rape. The Federal Court held that no question of her consent to the alleged act arises. However, the Federal Court then went on to observe that she had made no complaint after the incidents and that her distress could be attributed to some other cause. Furthermore, it was a wonder that after that alleged incident, she was prepared to leave her house with one of the appellants, and was seen by a witness to be walking and talking together. The Federal Court allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction.
Although, on the facts of that case, the decision was probably right, the reasoning seemed a bit incongruous. If consent was not an issue, then what was the point of looking for complaints or distress? It is not clear from the report whether it was alleged that she did not consent to sexual intercourse. However, if her evidence was that she did not consent, then the question of her consent must be a live issue on the facts of that case. If the evidence was inconsistent with the lack of consent, then it showed that she cannot be believed so far as this issue was concerned. If she had reasons to conceal the fact that she consented to intercourse, then it would be fair to infer that she also had reason to falsely implicate someone else. In the circumstances then, even though consent was not a necessary ingredient of the offence, it nevertheless remained a crucial question.
Hence, in a case involving sexual offences, it is essential to identify the relevant issues first. It will then be possible to isolate the areas of a victim`s testimony which the court feels are not so convincing that a conviction can be based solely on it, ie that the victim`s testimony is not so convincing that the court can say that that aspect of the case has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Only when the reason for this is identified will it be possible to examine other evidence that will support the witness`s and the accused`s respective testimonies. Applying an overly technical approach without relating the legal principles to the evidence given will give rise to the danger of insufficient weight being given to relevant evidence and too much weight being assigned to insignificant or irrelevant evidence.
Two particular aspects of corroboration are relevant in the present case. These are the victim`s previous complaints and distress. As for previous complaints, s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) provides: 
 
In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.
 
 
 
Section 159 is not new, but the courts in Singapore have only dealt with it in a handful of reported cases in connection with sexual offences. These cases do not appear to be altogether consistent. In 
 R v Velayuthan 
 
[1935] MLJ 277
, Whitley J sitting in the Court of Criminal Appeal noted: 
 
It is well-established law that upon the trial of an indictment for rape or other kindred offences against women or girls, the fact that a complaint was made by the prosecutrix shortly after the alleged occurrence and the particulars of such complaint may, so far as they relate to the charge against the prisoner, be given in evidence on the part of the prosecution, not as being evidence of the facts complained of, but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box [see 
 R v Lillyman
 
[1896] 2 QB 167
]. But in England, as Lord Hewart CJ pointed out when delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 R v Whitehead
 [1929] 1 KB, at p 102, what the girl said could not amount to corroboration of her story, because it proceeded from the girl herself; it would be merely the girl`s story at second hand. `In order that evidence may amount to corroboration it must be extraneous to the witness who is corroborated. A girl cannot corroborate herself.`
 
 
 
In this Colony, however, the position is different inasmuch as s 157 of the Evidence Ordinance, which has no counterpart in the English law of evidence, provides that: 
 
`In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement by such a witness ... relating to the same fact at or about the same time when the fact took place, ... may be proved.`
 
 
 
The learned Acting Chief Justice was accordingly fully justified in referring to such an immediate complaint, if made, as corroboration, although in England it would not be so regarded. Such a complaint in order to be admissible as corroboration must be made `at or about the time` of the offence and its value and strength as corroboration must depend in every case upon the circumstances under which it is made.
 
 
 
In 
 Koh Eng Soon v R 
, Murray-Aynsley CJ opined, in the light of 
 R v Velayuthan 
: 
 
... In this connection it should be noted that what is described as corroboration in s 157 of the Evidence Ordinance is not corroboration for this purpose. The effect of s 157 is to render generally admissible statements made by complainants which in England are only admissible in cases of rape and kindred offences. Such statements are not corroboration in England and therefore, where as a matter of practice corroboration is required or desirable, they should not be regarded as otherwise here.
 
 
 
The question of the complaint in these cases is different from that of corroboration. It is not in any way at the present time a legal requirement, but where there is no complaint within a time that is, in the circumstances reasonable, naturally no Court would convict, on the evidence of the complainant.
The law as to corroboration is laid down fully in the case of 
 R v Baskerville 
 
[1916] 2 KB 658
 and applied locally in 
 R v Velayuthan 
.
In the present case, I do not consider that there was any corroboration and I am not satisfied that the magistrate, who otherwise gave extremely careful attention to the matter, gave sufficient attention to this aspect of the case.
However, in 
 PP v Teo Eng Chan & Ors 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 156
; 
[1987] SLR 475
 Punch Coomaraswamy J stated [
[1988] 1 MLJ 156
 at p 161; 
[1987] SLR 475
 at p 483]: 
 
Our law is contained in s 159 of the Evidence Act which provides that a witness`s testimony may be corroborated by any former statement made by such witness `... relating to the same fact at or about the time the fact took place or before any legal authority competent to investigate the fact`.
 
 
 
In 
 Liew Kim Yong v PP 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 323
 at p 327; 
[1989] SLR 97
 at p 104 Grimberg JC sitting in the Court of Criminal Appeal said in relation to a victim`s complaints to her sister and mother: 
 
It is clear from a plain reading of s 159 of the Evidence Act that evidence of the complaint to the sister on the telephone, and then the complaint to the mother, sister and Angela was admissible as corroboration of the complainant`s own evidence as to the offence. It is clear that the learned trial judge looked for corroboration and properly regarded that evidence as corroborative, that is to say as evidence which confirmed in material particulars, not only that the complainant had been raped, but also that the appellant raped her - see 
 R v Beck
 [1982] 1 All ER 807.
 
 
 
It can be seen that no guidance was ever given as to what it means to call the complaint `corroboration`, apart from saying that much would depend on the circumstances. This is hardly helpful.
In Malaysia, however, the position since the celebrated Privy Council case of 
 Chiu Nang Hong v PP 
 
[1965] MLJ 40
 appears consistently to have been that corroboration for this purpose must come from an independent source. Thus, in 
 Ah Mee v PP 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 220
, it was held there is a distinction between corroboration in the strict sense and corroboration under s 157 of the Malaysian Evidence Ordinance, which is in pari materia to our s 159.
Punch Coomaraswamy J in 
 PP v Teo Eng Chan 
 had sought to distinguish 
 Chiu Nang Hong v PP 
 on the basis that in the latter case, the Public Prosecutor was precluded from argument on the difference between the position as to what constituted corroboration by virtue of the Evidence Act.
With respect, I very much doubt if the Privy Council would have reached a contrary decision even if they had been referred to the Evidence Act. It appears clear from the judgment that the error there lay in apparently treating as independent evidence something which is not independent. If a piece of evidence is weighty only if it is independent, the mere fact that the legislature decided to attach to it the label `corroboration` without more cannot add any weight to that piece of evidence if it should turn out that that piece of evidence is not independent. If the legislature had intended to lay down a presumption that a witness is more credible merely because he or she had repeated his story before, then it would have done so expressly.
It would be a mere academic exercise to attempt to reconcile what was said in some of the Singapore cases and the Malaysian ones. Deciding whether to call a previous complaint `corroboration` or otherwise does not add anything to the fact finding process. In all cases, it is necessary to identify the reason behind the perceived unreliability of the complainant`s testimony. Only then is it possible to decide whether a previous complaint or the absence of one adds anything at all to the equation.
The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact that making it renders the victim`s testimony more credible. The evidential value of a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim`s evidence 
 less 
 credible. The reason is simply common human experience. It is not usual human behaviour for a victim not to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim`s actions depart from it. It would then be an error not to have regard to the explanation proferred. All these merely illustrate the fallacy of adhering to a fixed formula.
It is against this backdrop that I said in 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 that: 
 
In my view, although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is 
 not
 corroboration by 
 independent
 evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word.
 
 
 
In that case, there was a real danger of concoction, as revealed from the numerous inconsistencies in the complainant`s evidence and the fact that she suddenly revealed the existence of one `auntie` which, until she gave evidence during the trial, even the prosecuting officer had never heard of. It was an unusual twist of event for which no reasonable explanation was proffered. In the circumstances, as her evidence could not be verified, it was dangerous to rely on it. That being the case, if there was a danger that she concocted the alleged incident, there would equally be a danger that she was merely repeating a fictional story when she made the other complaints. In those circumstances, evidence of her previous complaints would add very little, if anything, to the fact finding process.
The error at first instance in that case lay not in finding that the previous complaints were `corroboration`. The error lay in treating evidence which is not independent as though it is evidence which is and, hence, attributing to it undue weight. It is also in this context that I observed in that case that 
 PP v Teo Eng Chan 
 was a case in which it could have been safe to convict without corroboration.
 John Benjamin Cadawanaltharayil v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 805
 is an even more vivid example. In that case, the facts revealed that there was a real risk that the complainant was mistaken as to the nature of the medical examination conducted by the appellant doctor. Likewise, there was no error, in view of s 159 of the Evidence Act, in calling her immediate complaint to her friend `corroboration`. However, it would be an error to treat it as a weighty piece of evidence. As the complaint was not independent of the complainant, it was consistent with her being mistaken. It was therefore of little value.
As a comparison, the English case of 
 R v McInnes 
 (1990) 90 Cr App R 99 is instructive. In that case, the appellant was convicted of abducting a seven year old child and raping her. The child gave unsworn evidence. She was able to describe in vivid detail the contents of the appellant`s car. The appellant was a complete stranger.
The English Court of Appeal held that this was ample corroboration of her identification evidence even though the description came from the child. The reason was simply that she could not have been able to give such a description had she not been in the appellant`s car. The conviction for abduction was upheld. On the other hand, the conviction for rape was substituted for one of indecent assault as the child was not able to tell clearly what the appellant had inserted or attempted to insert in her private parts. The medical evidence was only consistent with something having been inserted. The jury was sufficiently concerned to ask for clarification on what constituted rape but they obtained no guidance from the judge.
Similarly, the complainant`s previous description of the accused may or may not have added weight, depending on what was given by the complainant. Thus, a complainant`s description of a scar on a part of the accused`s body which the complainant could not have known of unless she was speaking the truth is weighty evidence. This was the case in 
 R v Nagy 
 [1990] Crim LR 187. On the other hand, if the description is of something which anybody could have observed, such as a mole on the face, then it has little weight. The mere fact that the complainant identified someone with that feature in an identity parade would not have added much to the complainant`s evidence, as was the case in 
 R v Willoughby 
 (1989) 88 Cr App R 91.
These cases illustrate the importance of giving the correct weight to the correct evidence. The principle is equally applicable to a witness`s previous statements. In many cases, such statements are only valuable as evidence of consistency. Though they may be admitted as evidence of the facts stated therein, the weight to be assigned to them may be questionable. Much would depend on the issues at trial.
The same applies for evidence of distress. In 
 R v Redpath 
 (1962) 46 Cr App R 319, it was held that in certain circumstances, evidence of distress may amount to corroboration. In that case, the appellant was seen by a complete stranger to have approached a child and later driving off in a car. The child was observed to be in a very distressed condition shortly afterwards. The child did not know that she was being observed. Lord Parker CJ held that in those circumstances, the child`s distress could amount to corroboration.
In 
 R v Knight 
 (1966) 50 Cr App R 122 and 
 R v Wilson 
 (1973) 58 Cr App R 304, it was stressed that in order to be weighty as corroboration, there must be no other apparent cause for the distress. Distress may spring from a number of causes. Likewise, where distress is observed as part and parcel of a complaint, the distress could have been simulated.
 R v Chauhan 
 (1981) 73 Cr App R 232 is a case falling between the two extremes, and is thus useful. In that case, the accused was left alone in an office with the complainant. The complainant was seen by a colleague running out of the office into the toilet, crying and in an upset stage. The colleague followed the complainant in, whereupon the complainant made an immediate complaint to her that she had been molested by the accused. The accused gave evidence that nothing happened in the room and that when the complainant left the room, she appeared normal. The prosecution thought that there was no corroboration but the recorder disagreed, and directed the jury that the distressed state of the complainant could amount to corroboration if they thought that the distress was not feigned and that the complainant was not imagining things. The Court of Appeal held that the recorder was right.
Provided that the pitfalls are kept in mind, there is no reason why the complainant`s distress cannot be a weighty piece of evidence in the right circumstances. Of course, apart from the possibility that distress was due to some other reasons, there will always be the danger that the distress could be feigned. However, so could injuries and torn clothing. Whether this is a real possibility in any case must depend on the circumstances of each case and the evidence adduced.
In this respect, it should also be borne in mind that the standard of proof that must be discharged by the prosecution in order to secure a conviction is that the case against the accused must be proven beyond any reasonable doubt. This means that every relevant ingredient of the alleged offence must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Reference may be made to 
 R v White 
 (1865) 4 F & F 383, where it was said that the rule is `well established` and `laid down by every judge from Hale to Gurney.`
However, the prosecution`s burden is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. In 
 R v Pahuja 
, Cox J observed at p 204: 
 
The notion conveyed by the expression `beyond reasonable doubt` is, of course, inexact. It is an acknowledgment of the impracticability, if not impossibility, of requiring that a charge be proved to the point of absolute certainty. All that society, acting through the courts, can do, if the system is to be workable, is to pitch the required degree of probability at a level that will ensure the conviction of a high proportion of the guilty and at the same time keep the risk of convicting the innocent acceptably low. The determinant that is used for this purpose is the state of mind - the belief or conviction - of the jury. There is no way of measuring degrees of conviction in any scientific fashion - one cannot apply to the jurors` minds a sort of Richter scale of belief - so recourse is had to a general formula that is intended to convey to the jury, simply and adequately, the law`s standard of proof.
 
 
 
In Singapore, it is the trial judge`s mind that is relevant. However, as trial judges, unlike juries, have to give reasons for their decision, there is the safeguard that an appellate court may intervene if he attaches undue weight to some piece of evidence.
Nevertheless, it is not every doubt that suffices. Thus, in Australia, a `reasonable doubt` has been compared against `fantastic or completely unreal` possibilities - 
 Green v R 
 (1971) 126 CLR 28. In 
 R v Wilson 
 (1986) 42 SASR 203, King CJ referred to `the capacity of the human mind to conjure up fanciful, nervous or unreasonable misgivings about matters which are not in reality in doubt.` In Canada, in 
 R v Sears 
 (1948) 90 CCC 159, the Ontario Court of Appeal contrasted a reasonable or `real doubt` with one which is `illusory`.
In practically all criminal cases, it is always possible to imagine that the accusation against the accused may be concocted. Likewise, one may imagine that witnesses, apparently independent, may have conspired to `fix` the accused up. There will always be that minutiae of doubt as to whether the accused might perhaps be the victim of a strange set of coincidences. The question in each of these cases must be whether, given the evidence presented, whether that doubt is a real or reasonable doubt or whether it was a merely illusory or fanciful one.
In our system, the task of sifting through the evidence, and determining whether there is a real doubt or a fanciful one, is entrusted to the trial judge. In cases like this, it is an especially onerous duty. It is not possible for the evidence, with all the nuances of the witnesses` expressions and demeanour to be presented to the appellate court again. I have no doubt that our judges take this task most seriously. They are aware of the limitations of relying solely on a witness`s demeanour and the way he or she gives evidence, especially when the burden of proof required of the prosecution is so high. Hence, an appellate court will not lightly disturb a trial judge`s finding of facts in cases such as this.
In the present case, there was no doubt that PW5 was alone with the appellant in the lift at the relevant time. Shortly thereafter, PW5 was seen by PW4 returning to the flat and shutting the door hurriedly. Within a manner of minutes, PW5 attempted to make a complaint to PW4. Even though PW4 could not understand PW5, she could see that PW5 was clearly in distress.
Likewise, even though PW6 could not understand all that PW5 told her over the phone, she could hear that PW5 was distressed. As far as PW6 could remember, PW5 did not say anything about being touched. However, she did say something about being followed by the appellant and that she did not like it. Nevertheless, PW4 formed the impression from the complaint that PW5 was molested. Whether this involved jumping to conclusions on the part of PW4 is not strictly material, apart from the possibility of late concoction. PW5 was the alleged victim, not PW4. PW4 told PW5 to go down and look for the appellant. PW4 confronted the appellant. When the police arrived shortly afterwards, PW5 told the officer that she was molested by the appellant in the lift.
Against this, the appellant`s evidence was that they merely talked in the lift. PW5 did not realise that they had reached the eleventh floor. She tried to run out when the lift door was about to close. The appellant grabbed her to prevent her from being hit. When she left, the appellant saw her wave at him, and say: `Thank you uncle bye bye.` There was, however, not enough time for the appellant to get out of the lift even though that was also his floor.
The present case is remarkably similar to the facts in 
 R v Chauhan 
. The fact that PW5 was seen returning to the flat and closing the door hurriedly can be regarded as corroboration, even though the district judge merely regarded it as supporting evidence. However, this is a matter of semantics and does not advance the fact finding process.
What was material was that the district judge correctly identified the significance of this piece of evidence: that it was inconsistent with the appellant`s version. Leaving aside concoction at this stage, there was no reason for PW5 to do what she did unless what she said was true. The same was true of her almost immediate complaint to PW4. One does not, in the normal course of human behaviour, wave and say `thank you` to a person and in the next breath accuse him of a serious crime.
The defence suggested that PW5 could have been complaining about being hit by the lift door and was misunderstood by PW4. However, if that was the case, there was no reason for PW5 to return to the flat and close the door hurriedly. Furthermore, the complaint made to PW6 was about the appellant and what he was doing, and not the lift. In this respect, of course, PW6 could not understand PW5 fully. At best, from the appellant`s point of view, PW6`s evidence was neutral.
However, this was not all the evidence, for, when the police arrived, what PW5 said to PW2 was that the appellant molested her in the lift. It should be remembered that only about 30 minutes elapsed from the alleged incident in the lift to when PW5 said to PW2 that she was molested by the appellant. For this purpose, I did not rely at all on the statement given by PW5 in the police station.
It was suggested by the defence that PW4 could have miscontrued what PW5 was telling her and that in order not to annoy or embarrass PW4, PW5 later fabricated her evidence about the incident in the lift. In fact, this was the main thrust of counsel`s argument. The question remained whether this was at all likely. Given the very short period of time between the incident and the complaint to PW2, and the fact that PW5 and PW4 could hardly understand each other, this was implausible. A meeting of minds in that brief interval to level a false accusation against the appellant, even in a very general way, was most improbable. It was at best, a fanciful possibility.
It cannot be overstressed that though concoction is easily alleged, it must still have a genesis. If the concoction was unlikely to have germinated in the period of time between the complaint to PW4 and the statement to PW2, when could it conceivably have arisen? Could it have been during the period when PW5 was returning to the flat or perhaps even before the alleged incident? However, there must be some evidential basis for suggesting this. PW5 had only been in Singapore for about a week. The appellant was as good as a stranger to her. Again, the possibility of her concocting the incident was so remote as to be nothing more than fanciful. To counsel`s credit, even he did not deem it proper to suggest this possibility.
It was in this context that the district judge said that there was no earthly reason for PW5 to feign distress. The learned district judge was being scrupulously fair to the defence. He was conscientiously examining all the possibilities and leaving no stone unturned, regardless of whether that possibility was suggested by the defence or otherwise.
After all, it was not for the defence to suggest any reason why PW5 might want to fabricate a false accusation against the appellant. The best the court can do is to look at all the surrounding circumstances, especially the evidence of PW5 and her demeanour when giving evidence, to see if there was a real possibility that PW5 was fabricating evidence against the appellant for hidden reasons.
An appellate court does not have the advantage which a court at first instance enjoys of being able to observe the witnesses give evidence. It is only open to an appellate court to study the records and determine if the inconsistencies in a witness`s testimony are so substantial and so clearly suggest that the witness is not reliable as to warrant interfering with the trial judge`s finding.
No doubt there were inconsistencies in PW5`s evidence, however, in the present case, they did not appear to be anything out of the ordinary. The inconsistencies all appeared trivial. In particular, it was argued that PW5 told PW2 that she was molested while taking the child down to wait for the school bus. However, this was not a material inconsistency. PW5 was, loosely speaking, taking the child down to wait for the school bus at the relevant time. The incident occurred during this trip, albeit on the way back. Nevertheless, that was a reasonable way for a lay person to describe what PW5 was doing at the relevant time.
Then it was argued that PW5 never complained about the first incident in the void deck. PW5`s explanation was remarkably candid. It was simply because she was not alarmed by it. She did not mention it because she was not bothered too much by what happened. This was not an unreasonable explanation. If accepted, as the district judge did, it in fact showed that PW5 was not the type of person who could be easily frightened. It would actually lend credence to her evidence that something particularly nasty must have happened in the lift. Again, for the defence, it was at best a neutral piece of evidence.
Against this was the evidence of the appellant that he was merely helping PW5 in the lift. Yet, this was nowhere mentioned in the appellant`s statement to the police. If he was to be believed, it would mean that he thought the incident important enough to mention to PW4, but not significant enough to be revealed to the police. Both were accusing him of committing a serious offence in the lift. Moreover, this would be leaving aside PW4`s evidence that the appellant never said such a thing to her. In the circumstances, I did not think it was wrong for the district judge to draw an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
In conclusion, the evidence presented did not raise any reasonable doubt. Counsel for the appellant did everything that could be done for the appellant in this appeal. However, the case was much stronger than it might have appeared at first glance. It would not be proper to disturb the conviction, and I upheld it.
 Sentence
The appellant was sentenced to five years` imprisonment. The legislature has taken a serious view of this type of offence and has stipulated that the minimum term of imprisonment is three years. The maximum is ten years. In normal cases, caning is mandatory. It appeared that the district judge sentenced the appellant to five years` imprisonment in view of the fact that the appellant was not liable to suffer caning because of his age. However, in view of the appellant`s age and lack of antecedent, a sentence of three years` imprisonment was more appropriate. Accordingly, I reduced his sentence to the bare three years.
During the hearing, I had asked the deputy public prosecutor whether it is appropriate to backdate the sentence to when the appellant was first arrested or to when he was first convicted. The learned deputy public prosecutor submitted that it was not appropriate, as the appellant had been out on bail, and was not under remand. Whereupon, I remarked that there is nothing in s 223 of the CPC which expressly states this. Nevertheless, I ordered that the sentence should be reduced but that it should commence from the day I reduced the sentence.
Having had an opportunity to look this matter up, I agree with the deputy public prosecutor that as a general rule, the period in which a convicted person has been out on bail should not be taken into account in backdating a sentence. This was implied in the decision of the Malaysian court in 
 Muharam bin Anson v PP 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 222
.
In 
 Cheong Seok Leng v PP 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 481
; 
[1988] SLR 565
 Chan Sek Keong J had to consider whether any allowance ought to be made for a period of detention in a drug rehabilitation centre when considering the commencement of a sentence under s 223. It was held that it should not, because such a centre is not gazetted as a prison. This case also suggests that periods in which a convicted person has been out on bail is, as a general rule, irrelevant for the purpose of s 223.
I should add that a primary consideration is the adequacy or harshness of the sentence. This is demonstrated in 
 PP v Tan Kim Chok 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 211
 and 
 Pang Po & Anor v PP 
 
[1962] MLJ 294
. The discretion given to the court under s 223 does allow the court, to a certain extent, to achieve the effect of giving the convicted person either an enhanced sentence or a discount, or so it appears from the two cases.
Nevertheless, there is a dearth of authority on this point. In the absence of more detailed argument, the question whether under no circumstances should a sentence be backdated unless the convicted person had been remanded in prison is best left open for another day.

s 4 Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A)
 
This was an application made by the Public Prosecutor by way of an originating summons, filed on 28 November 1995, for a confiscation order under s 4 of the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A). This Act was enacted to provide for the confiscation of benefits derived from drug trafficking.
The respondent was arrested on 27 September 1994 by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau and charged for trafficking in heroin. The trial in the High Court commenced on 22 May 1995 and, at the conclusion of the trial on 26 May 1995, the respondent was found guilty and sentenced to death. His appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 24 July 1995.
Mr Ang, counsel for the respondent in the present application submitted that the court had no jurisdiction to make any order because the application was made out of time. It is helpful to set out s 4 of the Act: 
 
 
(1) Subject to section 23, where a defendant is convicted of one or more drug trafficking offences, the court shall, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, make a confiscation order against the defendant in respect of benefits derived by him from drug trafficking if the court is satisfied that such benefits have been so derived. 
 
(2) If the court is satisfied that benefits have been derived by the defendant from drug trafficking, the court shall, before sentencing or otherwise dealing with him in respect of the offence or, as the case may be, any of the offences concerned, determine in accordance with section 7 the amount to be recovered in his case by virtue of this section. 
 
(3) The court shall then, in respect of the offence or offences concerned - 
 
(a) take into account the confiscation order before imposing any fine on him; and 
 
(b) subject to paragraph (a), leave the confiscation order out of account in determining the appropriate sentence or other manner of dealing with the defendant. 
 
(4) Subject to section 24, for the purpose of this Act, a person who holds or has at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) held any property or any interest therein disproportionate to his known sources of income, the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the court, shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have derived benefits from drug trafficking:
  
 
 
Provided that any expenditure by such person (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been met out of his benefits derived from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
The phrase which forms the basis of Mr Ang`s objection lies in s 4(2), which is, `the court shall, before sentencing or otherwise dealing with him`. Mr Ang submitted that these words impart a clear and mandatory procedure that an order for confiscation shall be made before the court passes sentence and not after. He argued that these words clearly do not permit the court to postpone the making of the confiscation order. In the present case the respondent was sentenced before this application for a confiscation order was made.
Mr Wong for the Public Prosecutor submitted that the word `shall` in s 4(2) is merely `directory` and not mandatory in this case. He submitted that `where an accused person has been found guilty of a drug trafficking offence which carries a mandatory death penalty, sub-ss (2) and (3) are entirely inapplicable` and concluded that, consequently, s 4(2) does not preclude the prosecution from initiating the confiscation proceedings after sentence had been passed on the accused.
The authorities which Mr Wong relied on such as 
 Cheong Seok Leng v PP 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 481
; 
[1988] SLR 565
, 
 Toh Teong Seng v PP 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
, all represented cases where the court accepted the principle that the word `shall` may in certain context, be interpreted to read as `may`. In 
 Toh Teong Seng v PP 
the court had to construe s 20(4) of the Environmental and Public Health Act, Cap 95. That provision reads as follows: 
 
A Court convicting any person of an offence under subsection (1) shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.
 
 
 
The issue there was whether the word `shall` meant that the court had no discretion or whether it should be construed as merely directory. In holding that the word `shall` should not be read in the mandatory sense the learned Chief Justice considered the other provisions of the same Act and found, inter alia, that if the word `shall` is used in the mandatory sense then that subsection becomes irreconcilable with sub-s (5) which confers a discretion on the court to make an order for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under sub-s (4).
The purpose of making the confiscation order after conviction and before sentencing is obvious from ss 4(2) and (3). The court has to take into account the confiscation order before imposing any fine on the convicted person. Thus, the only reason that a confiscation order has to be made before sentence is that the order must be taken into consideration when a fine may be imposed. It is clearly not relevant where the only sentence is a mandatory sentence of death. Hence, sub-ss (2) and (3) have no relevance whatsoever in a capital case. I am of the view that the word `shall` in s 4(2) of the Act should not be read in the mandatory sense where no fine is contemplated. Indeed, s 4(3) reinforces this view because where the convicted person is to be dealt with in a manner other than the imposition of a fine the confiscation order shall be left out of account.
The Act does not provide a limitation period within which an application for a confiscation order is to be made. Section 4(2) cannot be read as such. It can, at best, be implied that if the court should make the order before sentencing, the time for the application should be limited in that sense. If Parliament intended that there be a specific period beyond which any such application would be time-barred the provision must be clearly worded to that effect. Such provisions should not be implied.
It should also be noted that in a capital case, the accused ought to be sentenced as soon as he is convicted and that it is undesirable that the sentence be postponed, as it would certainly have been if the court is to proceed to hear the confiscation proceedings on a reading of s 4(2) as suggested by Mr Ang.
For the above reasons I granted an order in terms of the application by the Public Prosecutor.

On 27 March 1991 the appellants were convicted in the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Mohamed Bachu Miah and Md Mahamudzzaman Khan s/o Md Zinder Ali Khan, are charged that you, on or about 22 January 1988 at between 3.15am and 5am at the site office of Messrs Ong Huat Construction Co, situated between Nos 10 and 12, Jalan Kampong Chantek, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, committed murder by causing the death of one Md Shafiqul Islam @ Md Abdul Islam, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
They were accordingly sentenced to the mandatory sentence of death. They have now appealed to this court against both conviction and sentence.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution at the trial is as follows. On 22 January 1988 at about 8am, one Shafiqul Islam also known as Mohamed Abdul Islam (hereafter called `the deceased`), a Bangladeshi construction worker, was found dead with serious injuries on his face and body in a container stationed at a construction site at Nos 10 and 12, Jalan Kampong Chantek, Singapore. The container was used both as an office and as the sleeping quarters of the deceased. The pathologist, Dr Clarence Tan, who arrived at the scene soon after the detection of the crime noted serious injuries to the head and body. In particular he noted that the jeans worn by the deceased were unzipped and pulled down, exposing his genitals. The deceased`s scrotum had been cut and both his testicles had been removed and were found on the floor close to the body of the deceased. The foreskin of the deceased`s penis had also been circumferentially incised into. Dr Tan said a cutting instrument with an edge which was not too sharp could have been used to cause these injuries. However, as there was no bleeding around the genitals, he was of the view that those injuries were caused at or around the time of death.
The pathologist certified that the cause of death was the combined effect of a fractured skull and dislocation of the cervical spine (the neck). He said that these fractures were consistent with repeated blunt injuries to the left side of the face and neck. Severe force must have been used to produce the fracture and dislocation. He agreed with the suggestion that a steel crank could have been used to inflict the fatal injuries. He did not find any injuries on the deceased consistent with strangulation. Dr Tan estimated that the deceased must have died between 3am and 5am that morning of 22 January 1988.
The first appellant/accused was arrested some nine days later at about 6pm on 31 January 1988 at Dunlop Street. From information obtained from him, the police on the same evening went to a location at Mandai Lake Road, Track 11, where they arrested the second appellant and another person called Hallaludin (`Tony`). Both the second appellant/accused and Tony were Bangladeshi workers.
Following their arrest, the officer in charge of the case, Insp Yeoh Bak Seng, recorded three statements from each of the accused persons. The first statement was recorded in the field diary; the second was a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) and the third was a long statement. The first accused gave his statements on 31 January 1988, 1 February 1988 and 4 and 8 February 1988; the second accused on 31 January 1988, 1 February 1988 and 11-12 February 1988.
The admissibility of all the statements from each of the appellants was objected to. A trial-within-a-trial was accordingly held. The first appellant alleged that he was subjected to assaults, threats and inducement before he gave and signed the field diary statement. As regards the s 122(6) statement, he alleged that there were also threats and inducement. Furthermore, the interpreter, who was present, did not do much of an interpretation. Neither was the statement read back to him. As regards the long statement, there were similar threats of assaults and inducement. The interpreter, who came in a little later, hardly did any interpretation. The first appellant said that he signed the statement without knowing what he signed. He claimed that he could not really communicate in English or understand English.
The second appellant also claimed that he could not converse in English. He did not make any of the three statements voluntarily and he did not know what he signed. He alleged that before he gave the field diary statement he was assaulted and was threatened. He signed the statement because he was induced to do so. As regards the recording of the s 122(6) statement, he said that he was again assaulted and beaten. An interpreter who was present did not do anything other than obtain his personal particulars. No caution was administered to him. As regards the long statement, he said that the interpreter did not do any interpretation of any statement. No warning was given to him.
The police officers who were implicated denied that they had assaulted or threatened the appellants or had offered any inducement to the appellants to make those statements. The recording officer, Insp Yeoh, said that while recording the field diary statements from the appellants, he was able to converse with them in English. The Bangladeshi interpreter, Mr Chakravarti, denied that any other person was present in the room while he was acting as interpreter for the s 122(6) statements and the long statements of the two appellants. He said he did the interpretation on the statements. However, he was not able to express adequately in English the warning which he administered to them when recording the long statements from them even though he understood the meaning of the caution.
At the conclusion of the trial-within-a-trial, the learned trial judges ruled that they were satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that all the three statements given by each appellant were given voluntarily without any inducement, threat or promise and admitted the statements. The statements clearly implicated the appellants in the joint deliberate killing of the deceased. The relevant portions of the statements are as follows: 
 
Field diary statement of the first accused
 
 
 
On 18 January 1988, I go to Tampines New Town at the SGE Construction and met King Balbu there. He told me that the police used to go to disturb him and other workers there. He suspected Islam to be the informer. He also know that I am going home and he asked me to kill Islam before I go home. I asked him how much he is going to pay me and he told he will pay me $1,000. I agreed as I needed money because my mother is very sick in Bangladesh. He gave me until Sunday to kill Islam but I killed Islam on Friday morning at about 4am. On 21 January 1988 at about 7.30pm I was at the Coronation Shopping Centre to wait for `Linto` as appointed. At about 8.30pm, `Linto` came to meet me. Both of us later have dinner at a stall at Hillview. After that, we took a taxi to Islam`s place at Jalan Kampong Chantek. We met him at his office. Islam asked me why I came so late. He is a friend of mine and we ever worked together before. Shortly, Islam told us that he wanted to go to Jalan Kayu to meet four Thai workers whom he employed. Linto and I agreed to accompany him to Jalan Kayu. We took a taxi there. At Jalan Kayu, the Thais were drunk and he was unable to collect money from them. We left sometime around 11pm and returned to Islam`s place at Jalan Kampong Chantek. On the way, Islam bought two bottles of beer and two bottles of stout. We stared [sic] drinking at Islam`s office. He switched on his cassette player and a table light and asked us to enjoy. We were talking, drinking and dancing. At about 2.30am on 22 January 1988, Linto told Islam whether he is interested in a Malay girl or not. Islam said he is interested and Linto telephoned the girl and made appointment with her. So, the three of us left in a taxi to Blk 52, 7th floor Macpherson. Islam also talked to her over the telephone. The three of us take turn to have sex with the Malay girl. We paid her $25 only. Islam was the one who paid everything including taxi money. Islam had sex with the girl twice. After that, we went back to Islam`s place by taxi to Islam`s office. We went into the office and sat there. We talked until 4am. Islam then fall asleep but we just lied down. As prearranged, Linto lighted up his cigarette lighter indicating to me to get ready to kill Islam. Linto then went to call Islam softly but Islam did not respond and carry on sleeping. Linto then went to sit on top of Islam and strangled his neck. At the same time, he pointed to me to take the metal starter. I too went to catch hold of his leg but Islam managed to push both of us aside. He just stood up after having bitten Linto`s finger. Linto then tell me to kill him and he caught hold of Islam and asked me to kill him. I then took the metal starter from the table and hit him many times on his head. He fell to the floor. Linto took Islam`s purse from his rear pocket. He then told me to look for blade and said that if ISLAM is not dead, he will report to the police. I went around to look for blade but was unable to get any. I managed to get hold of a pair of plier and Linto went to catch Islam`s balls. He pulled Islam`s balls with hands but was unable to pull it off. I told him to leave it to me and I used the plier to pull out his two balls. With the balls out, Islam did not make any more sound and we knew he was dead. I looked around and took a pair of track shoes which I am wearing now. I also took a photo album which I burnt away subsequently. Linto also took a pair of shoes. We then took a taxi to Orchard Road and on reaching there near Lucky Plaza, we realized it was already 5am. We walked to Far East Plaza and took a taxi to Yishun.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Field diary statement of the second accused
 
 
 
On 21 January 1988, Mohamed Ali @ Bachu and I met at Coronation Plaza sometime past 8pm as appointed. There, Mohamed Ali told me to bring a knife but I refused. We have previously planned to kill Islam. Mohamed Ali @ Bachu was angry with Islam for informing the police which led to the arrest of his brother Shajahan. Both of us then went to have dinner at Hillview Indian Restaurant. Later, we went to a nearby temple to pray. After that, we took a bus to Kampong Chantek. We arrived at Islam`s office and he was dressed up waiting for someone. Islam then asked us to accompany him to Jalan Kayu to meet three Thai workers. We left in a taxi. On arrival at Jalan Kayu, Islam speak to the three Thai persons and later told me that they have no money and were unable to pay him. Islam, Mohd Ali and I came out to the main Road where he bought four bottles of beer and one packet of `kachang`. We then took a taxi back to Islam`s office. We arrived at Islam`s place at about 12.30am on 22 January 1988. The three of us sat down and drink, smoke and talk about girl. Islam asked me whether I have any girl and I telephoned a Malay girl at telephone No 7465702 at Macpherson. Islam also spoke to the girl in Malay. Sometime around 1.30am or 1.45am we went to visit the Malay girl at her Blk 52, 7th floor Room No 821, Circuit Road. Three of us have sex with the Malay girl by turn. Islam had sex with her twice and subsequently gave her $25 only. We then returned to Jalan Kampong Chantek at about 3.40am. On arrival there Islam told us to sleep without taking out our clothes. All of us lied down and five minutes later, Islam was fast asleep. Mohamed Ali slept near to the door while I slept in the centre near to Islam. Shortly, Mohamed Ali got up and took a metal starter and hit Islam on his face and head. Islam shouted in pains several times. Mohamed Ali @ Bachu Miah asked me to help. I went to grab Islam`s mouth to prevent him from shouting. Islam bit my fingers. Bachu Miah continued to hit Islam with the metal starter seven or nine times. Bachu Miah then took a pair of pliers and opened Islam`s pant and pulled his testicles. I told him not to do it but he did not listen to me. He then used the plier to pull out Islam`s testicles. Before leaving Islam`s office, Mohamed Ali took a pair of track shoes and a shirt and his wallet containing $50. He later give me $25 (two ten dollars and one five dollars) at Yishun. I took a pair of shoes because my shoes was stained with blood. I took Islam`s shoe. We then went back. We took a taxi to Orchard and from there, we took another taxi to Yishun.
 
 
 
122(6) statement of the first accused
 
 
 
I admitted that together with my friend MD Zaman Khan, the other accused, we committed the murder. The murder was committed on a Thursday late night. On Sunday evening, together with few other Bangladeshi friends, we went to `King Balbu`s` house. We cooked there and stayed the night there. When we were at his place, `King Balbu` was not there. I subsequently went to the 2nd Chance Building near to Mackenzie Road to look for him but he was not there. At that time `Tony` and Zaman Khan was with me. That is all!
 
 
 
122(6) statement of the second accused
 
 
 
When the murder was committed, I was not directly involved. The murder was committed by Mohamed Bachu Miah. Bachu Miah took an iron starter and hit Shafiqul Islam on his head. At that, Shafiqul Islam was shouting for about seven to nine times. Then Bachu Miah asked me to close Shafiqul Islam`s mouth to prevent him from shouting. Accidentally my two right fingers went into Shafiqul Islam`s mouth and he bit my two fingers. During that time, Bachu continued hitting on his head. Then I told Bachu not to hit him any more as I suspected that he is dead. Bachu then took a pair of plier and used that plier to pull out the testicles of Shafiqul Islam by force. All the time, I was crying and telling him not to do it. After Bachu had pulled out Shafiqul`s testicles, Shafiqul did not make any noise anymore. Presuming that he is already dead, Bachu Miah told me, `let us go now`. Bachu Miah took a piece of cloth and covered Shafiqul`s body. Bachu then asked me to take the wallet from Shafiqul`s pocket. So I took out the wallet and hand it over to Bachu. At that time, I do not know what was inside the wallet. As my shoes was stained with blood, Bachu asked me to wear Shafiqul`s shoes. I then wore Shafiqul`s shoes and left the place. We took a taxi to Orchard Road. From Orchard Road, we took another taxi to Yishun. At Yishun, we took off our shirts which were stained with blood and soaked them in the water. Then Bachu told me that it is already quarter to five in the morning and asked me to rest. So, we rest. Before we left Shafiqul`s house, Bachu took another pair of Shafiqul`s shoes a shirt together with some photographs and letters and kept the whole thing in a plastic bag belonging to Shafiqul. That is all!
 
 
 
Statement of first accused 
(10) Sometime in October or November 1987, my younger brother Shahjahan, male 19 years, passport No F 378518 (Bangladesh) was arrested together with three other Bangladeshi whilst working at the worksite at Simei Avenue, off Tampines. They were arrested by immigration Officers. After the arrest and through enquiries with fellow Bangladeshi workers, we knew that Islam (deceased) was the one who tipped the immigration officers about the illegal immigrants. All of us hated him because of the fact that he was an informer of the Immigration Department. 
(12) About a month prior to the deceased`s death, Linto and I made up our mind to kill the deceased Islam. The reason being that all the Bangladesh people hated him because he is a Police/Immigration Informer. Linto and I agreed to kill the deceased because we were both very close to the deceased. We are the only two who could get close to the deceased. At that time, we were staying at the uncompleted Blk 398, Yishun Ring Central. Beside the two of us, one Tony and another Mohammad were staying with us. Tony was arrested together with me whilst Mohammad`s whereabouts are not known. 
(20) Sometime around 12 midnight, we arrived at Islam`s office. Islam then switched on his cassette player and played taped music. Islam opened the four bottles of beer and stout and the three of us drank. Whilst drinking, Linto pointed to me a metal starter next to Islam`s bed indicating to me to use it against Islam later. We drank until about 2.30am on 22 January 1988. Islam then asked me whether I have any girl or not and when Linto heard that, he telephoned and spoke to a Malay girl by the name of `Rosi`. 
(21) At about 2.45am, we arrived at `Rosi`s flat at Blk 52, Circuit Road, 7th floor but I cannot remember the flat number. Islam was the first one to have sex with `Rosi`. I later learnt that he have sex with her twice and then followed by Linto and me, each having sex with `Rosi` once. After that, Islam paid `Rosi` $25 and the three of us left to Islam`s office by taxi. The sexual acts were done very fast and we left her flat at about 3.15am. At about 3.30am, we arrived at Islam`s office and he told us to sleep. I noticed that Islam was a bit tipsy. 
(22) Islam then slept on the floor while I sleep on Islam`s bed. Linto sleep on the inner table. The light in the office was not on but Islam switched on a dim table lamp. Islam did not switch on the air-condition. Linto and I have previously agreed that once Islam sleep, he will attack him first. We also agreed that Linto will light up a cigarette as a signal for me to attack Islam. Islam was then snoring and we knew that he was fast asleep. Linto then signal to me by lighting up a cigarette which he only puff a few times. After he had thrown away the cigarette, Linto immediately went and sat on the chest of Islam. At the same time, Linto used his hand to strangle Islam at his neck. I too went and catch hold of Islam`s legs. Islam managed to use force to push us away. However, Linto managed to grab Islam by the neck though Islam was standing up. As a result of that, Islam bit Linto`s two fingers. At that, Linto released the hold on Islam, and I went to catch hold of him. Linto too came and again caught hold of Islam. At that time, I remember the starter and immediately took the metal starter and wanted to strike it on Islam. Before I could strike him, Islam used his hands and scratched me on my face. I got angry and hit him twice with the metal starter on his face and head. At that, Islam fall down on the floor and Linto catch hold of his legs. I was feeling a bit giddy and I continued to hit Islam on his head with the metal starter. I hit Islam until he was motionless. When we hit him, Islam screamed several times. 
(23) Linto then told me to make sure that Islam is dead or else there would be alot of troubles for us. Linto then grabbed hold of the deceased`s balls (testicles) with his hand and tried to pull it out to make sure that he is dead. He was not successful in pulling out the deceased`s testicles. I too used my free hand to try to pull out the testicles of Islam and was not successful. Linto then asked me to search for a knife or blade. I looked around the room but unable to see any blade or knife. However, I managed to get a pair of pliers (used for pulling out nails or tighten nuts) underneath Islam`s bed. I told Linto to step aside and I used the pliers to pull out the testicles (scrotum) of the deceased. I throw the testicles beside him. The deceased did not make any sound. ...
 
 
 
Statement of the second accused 
(9) Sometime in July or August 1987, whilst I was working at Tampines worksite, I was introduced to the deceased whom I addressed as `Shafiqul` @ Shafi by King Balbu. I only met him two times when he came over to visit King Balbu. I do not know the reason why he came over to visit King Balbu but what I know was that they were on very good terms. We only have tea during those two meetings. He was not working there and at that time, I do not know where he work. 
(12) One week prior to the murder of the deceased, Bachu told me that he wanted to kill the deceased. He told me that there will be peace among the Bangladeshi in Singapore if Shafiqul is killed because no one will inform the immigration authorities anymore. He said that infront (sic) of Mohamed and Tony, my other two room-mates. Bachu asked me and Tony to follow him to kill Shafiqul but Tony does not want to come along. He said that if he come along, the deceased who do not like him would suspect something. I agreed after he threatened to tell Shafiqul to have me arrested if I did not want to follow him. 
(13) On 20 January 1988 at about 8pm or so, the four of us gathered as usual at the ground floor of the uncompleted Blk 398, Yishun Ring Road. Mohamed was drinking from a bottle of whisky at that time while the three of us Tony, Bachu and me just sat there. Bachu then planned on how to kill the deceased. He told me to take knife to stab the deceased but I told him not to do so as there will be plenty of blood. Bachu told me to let the deceased drink first before we killed him. He told me to meet him at Coronation Shopping Centre at Bukit Timah on 21 January 1988 in the evening after work before proceeding to Shafiqul`s place. 
(14) Tony and Mohamed said that they do not want to go and I too initially told him that I do not want to go. He told me that he will do the killing and I only accompany him there. After that, we retired and went to sleep. Bachu was working at Mandai while I was working at Yishun Northland Primary School. ... 
(19) At about 3.40am, we returned to Islam`s office at Jalan Kampong Chantek by taxi. On arrival, Shafiqul told us to sleep without changing as all of us need to work that day. Shafiqul only switched on a table lamp. The air-condition and the light were not switched on. Shafiqul slept on the floor, Bachu slept on Shafiqul`s bed while I slept on the second inner table. Five minutes later, we knew that Shafiqul had fallen asleep as he was snoring. I immediately lighted a cigarette and started smoking, a signal indicating to get ready for us to attack the deceased. Bachu woke up and walked to the side of the deceased. He sat on the chest of the deceased and used both hands to strangle the deceased. Shafiqul struggled to free himself from the hold of Bachu who shouted to me to help. I went to close the deceased`s mouth as he too was shouting seven to nine times. At the same time, I used one hand to catch his neck. Shafiqul immediately bit my two right fingers (index and middle) and stood up. I pulled out my fingers and by then Bachu already got hold of the metal starter. Shafiqul then asked us not to hit him saying that he had spent money on us. Bachu immediately hit the deceased on his face and head with the metal starter. At that blow, Shafiqul fall down on the floor. Bachu continued to hit Shafiqul many times on his head and face. Slowly, Shafiqul was groaning in pains. Shortly, Bachu asked me to give him a blade but I told him that there was none. He went around Shafiqul`s bed and managed to take a pair of pliers. He then asked me to unzip the deceased`s zipper and pulled out his ball but I refused. I was a bit scared when I see blood. Bachu unzipped the deceased`s pants and pulled out his testicles. He used the pliers and pulled out deceased`s testicles and placed them beside his body. Bachu told me that he want to make sure that Shafiqul die and that is why he was pulling out the testicles.
 
 
 
(Note: In the above statements, `Islam` or `Shafiqul` refers to the deceased, `Linto` the second appellant.)
 
 
 
Besides these statements, Insp Yeoh also told the court that on 3 February 1988 the two appellants led him to the container office where they demonstrated how they killed the deceased and how a pair of pliers was used to pull out the testicles of the deceased. While they were there, the appellants also pointed to a heap of blinker lamps (used to warn public that work was in progress) and told the inspector that during the fatal encounter with the deceased, a gold chain belonging to the deceased fell into that heap of blinkers. Following a search, a gold chain was found in that heap.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, counsel for the appellants did not make any submission. As the court found that a case had been made out against each of the appellants, which if unrebutted, would warrant their conviction, they were called upon to make their defence.
 Defence of the first appellant
In his evidence in defence, the first appellant told the court that he first met the deceased in 1986. They were fellow construction workers working illegally in Singapore. Subsequently, they became close friends. He had no enmity against the deceased, who was in fact his best friend. They often went out together. The first appellant`s brother also came to Singapore and remained here illegally. The brother was later arrested, imprisoned and sent back to Bangladesh in 1988. He said he did not know and had no reason to believe that the deceased was an informer of the immigration department on illegal workers and had anything to do with his brother`s arrest.
On 21 January 1988 after dark, pursuant to an invitation, the two appellants went to the deceased`s quarters at Jalan Kampong Chantek. Upon the deceased`s request they followed him to Jalan Kayu by taxi to collect some money from some Thai workers. They also had some food and some drinks there. However, the deceased failed to collect any money from the Thais because they did not have the money. From Jalan Kayu they returned to the deceased`s quarters at Jalan Kampong Chantek where they drank and talked. At a certain point the conversation turned to the subject of women. They decided to visit a prostitute by the name of Rosie at MacPherson Road. The first appellant said that he was not keen to visit Rosie as he thought Rosie was old and not worth a visit. However, he was persuaded to go along.
After they all had sex with Rosie, they returned to the deceased`s place and continued drinking. Soon thereafter they were ready to go to sleep. The deceased switched off the main light in the container and switched on a dim table lamp. The first appellant said that he was still troubled by their visit that night to Rosie, considering that Rosie was so old after all. He told the deceased thus: `what was the use of going there so late. We are illegals here. What would have happened if police were to go there. If this trend were to continue, we would have to cut off our friendship.` Then suddenly for no reason the deceased punched the first appellant on the chest and the latter retaliated. The second appellant tried to separate them. In the altercation, the deceased scratched the face of the first appellant. He also bit the hand of the second appellant and the latter cried out `Islam bit me, he bit my hand` in Bangladeshi. On hearing that, the first appellant was so incensed that he picked up something from the floor and hit the deceased once or twice and the latter fell onto the floor.
The first appellant could not recall what happened thereafter; neither could he remember anything about the removal of the testicles. The next thing he remembered was waking up at around eight or nine that morning in his own quarters at Yishun. The first appellant said that he did not know what he had picked up from the floor to hit the deceased and where he had hit the deceased. He did not intend to hit any particular part of the body. He claimed that he was so drunk that he did not know what he was really doing at that time.
He denied having told the inspector those things that were recorded in the three statements. He maintained that those things were all lies. He reiterated that the interpreter did not interpret anything other than obtaining his personal particulars. He denied any plan on his part to kill the deceased or that he was promised sums of money by other Bangladeshi nationals to dispose of the deceased. He even denied that on 3 February 1988 he led the police to the scene of the incident where he pointed out a heap of blinkers resulting in the recovery of the deceased`s gold chain.
 Defence of the second appellant
The second appellant told the court that he came to Singapore in September 1986. He thought all arrangements had been made for him to work here legally. But that was not so. He thus became an illegal worker. He worked at different places. He came to know one King Balbu at Tampines. He also knew the deceased there. He met the first appellant in Yishun. They stayed together and became good friends.
As arranged, on 21 January 1988 at about 7pm to 7.30pm, he met the first appellant at Serangoon Road (not Coronation Plaza as stated in the statements). His account of the subsequent events of going to the quarters of the deceased, of going with the first appellant and the deceased to Jalan Kayu, of their drinking and eating there, of visiting Rosie and returning to the deceased`s place to continue drinking was very similar to that given by the first appellant. He said that immediately before the incident, he was already unsteady and was feeling rather sleepy. Then he was aroused by a commotion. He saw the first appellant and the deceased punching each other. He got up and tried to separate the two. In the process the deceased bit his right hand fingers which caused him to yell `Islam bit me.` The second appellant then saw the first appellant pick something from the floor and hit the deceased once or twice, following which the deceased fell onto the floor. He saw the first appellant throwing away the thing which he used to hit the deceased. Apart from these he could not remember what happened thereafter that night. Neither could he remember how he returned to his quarters at Yishun. The next thing he remembered was waking up at his quarters at about 8am that same morning. He saw blood round his middle and index fingers. But he went to work. In the afternoon, he went to see a doctor and told the doctor that he hurt himself while at work.
The second appellant denied any part in any plan to kill the deceased. He emphasized that he knew nothing about the removal of the testicles of the deceased. He denied that he gave the three statements; he asserted they were nothing but fabrications. He claimed that he could not comprehend English or make himself understood by others in English. He bore no ill-feelings towards the deceased. He denied that on 3 February 1988 at the scene of the incident he demonstrated how the deceased was killed or how the deceased`s testicles were removed. He also denied that either of them pointed out the heap of blinkers to Insp Yeoh resulting in a gold chain of the deceased being recovered therefrom.
The second appellant recounted a traffic accident in Bangladesh in which he was involved where he suffered an injury resulting in wastage of his right deltoid muscles. Because of that he said he could not raise his right arm above the level of his chest. Counsel submitted that thus he could not have taken part in any alleged strangulation of the deceased as described in the statements.
 Findings of trial judges
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judges found the appellants guilty of the charge. The conviction rested primarily on the three statements of each of the accused, as corroborated by the evidence of Insp Yeoh. The court was satisfied that the appellants caused the death of the deceased in the way they described in their statements and in the way they demonstrated to the police on 3 February 1988. The criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a prearranged plan and was committed in furtherance of a common intention.
The trial judges found that the facts set out in the field diary statements must have been given by the appellants. As no interpreter was present at the taking of the two field diary statements, it was obvious that the appellants could converse reasonably with the inspector. The inspector could not speak Bangladeshi. They found that both the appellants could speak and understand English. As regards the s 122(6) and the long statements, the learned judges also found, even though the interpreter had some difficulty in paraphrasing the warning in compliance with s 121(2), that the facts set out in the statements were the truth.
On the evidence before the court, the trial judges ruled that the appellants had not proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the defence of sudden fight under Exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`) was applicable. Neither was the defence of sudden provocation (Exception 1) available to the first appellant as the hitting on the head of the deceased by the use of a heavy crank handle was entirely out of proportion to the provocation offered,ie punching and scratching the first appellant and biting the hand of the second appellant.
The court also rejected the defence of intoxication under ss 85 and 86(2) of the Code. It held that if the first appellant had been that intoxicated, he would not have been able to reason, as he said he did, with the deceased that they should not have gone to Rosie`s place that night as they could have been arrested by the police. Similarly, the second appellant would not have been able to reason that, unless he stopped the fight between the first appellant and the deceased, the police would come to arrest them.
 Admissibility of statements: s 26 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed)
The arguments of the counsel for the first appellant before us centred on the admissibility of the three statements given by him, particularly the field diary statement and the long statement. What counsel contends is that as the three statements amounted to a confession and as they were made by the first appellant while he was in police custody, s 26 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) (`the Act`) should be complied with and any non-compliance would render the statements inadmissible.
This point touches on the very important question of the relationship between s 26 of the Act and s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). We propose to examine this question at some length. First we will set out s 26 of the Act: 
 
Subject to any express provision in any written law, no confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.
 
 
 
Section 122(5) of the CPC reads: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:
 
 
 
There follows a proviso to that subsection to the effect that the court shall refuse to admit such a statement if the making of the statement was caused by any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority. However, for the purposes of determining the present point under consideration, the proviso is not directly relevant.
As can been seen, s 122(5) appears to be very widely worded. It seems to cover every and any statement made 
 at any time 
 to a police officer of the rank of sergeant. Therefore, the crucial question one has to ask is, is s 122(5) the `expressed provision in any written law` referred to in the introductory part of s 26? We would state that this is not the first time that the courts in Singapore are being confronted specifically with this question. It arose in the case 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  a decision of a two-judge High Court in a capital trial. A similar point was also considered by the courts of two neighbouring jurisdictions - Malaysia and Brunei - where there are in operation provisions similar to our s 26 and s 122(5). The judicial decisions seem to be in conflict. We think it might be useful if we briefly examine the approaches taken in those previous decisions in their chronological order.
The first case that dealt with this point would appear to be a decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia in 
PP v Ng Goh Weng & Anor
 
[1979] 127
 There, the alleged statement, which was a confession, was made by one of the accused persons while he was in police custody but it was not made to a judicial officer. The High Court judge was of the opinion that s 26 of the Malaysian Evidence Act 1950 (identical to ours) applied to render the statement inadmissible. However, the Federal Court (consisting of five members) disagreed. They said at p 128: 
 
that section [s 26] is expressed to be `subject to any express provision contained in any written law`. In our judgment, s 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code [similar to our
 
 
 
s 122(5)] is such written law and is an exception expressly permitted by s 26 of the Evidence Act and therefore the alleged statement is admissible if it complies with s 113.
 
 
 
The next case is from Brunei, 
PP v Emran bin Haji Md Noor & Ors
 
 [1987] MLJ 1 
 There, the court rejected the confession of the five accused on the ground that they were not made voluntarily. However, the court also went further to deal with the arguments related to s 26 of the Evidence Act and s 117(1) of their CPC (equivalent to our s 122(5)). The court (Garcia J) held that a confession made by a person in the custody of a police officer must comply with s 26 of the Evidence Act before it may be proven in evidence. After noting that the word used in s 26 was `express`, which meant that it could not be a matter implied from the language used, he said: 
 
I do not consider that the provisions of s 117 of the Code come within the definition of the words `express provision`, since the words `the person who is in the custody of a police officer` can only be included in `any person` by implication.
 
 
 
He disagreed with the views of the Malaysian Federal Court in 
PP v Ng Goh Weng
 
[1979] 127
 Of course, Garcia J`s views were purely obiter, as he had in the case ruled that the confessions were not given voluntarily. He himself had observed that the point needed to be canvassed more fully as he said, `perhaps the apparent conflict ... may be argued more fully should the opportunity present itself in the near future so that the controversy may be laid to rest.`
The next case is also from Brunei - 
PP v Zainal Abidin bin Ismail & Ors
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 741
  -where Roberts CJ disagreed with Garcia J. Citing the case 
Chorlton v Lings
 
[1868] LR 4 CP 374
 where it was stated `whatever the language used necessarily and naturally implies is expressed thereby,` Roberts CJ said that `the underlying principle of statutory interpretation is that the paramount criterion is the legislature`s intention.` His reasoning for ruling that the Bruneian s 117 superseded s 26 of the Evidence Act is as follows: 
 
The essence of s 26(1) is that no confession of any kind made to a police officer by a person in custody is to be admissible in evidence, unless made in the presence of a magistrate.
 
 
 
The essence of s 117 is that any statement, whether or not it amounts to a confession made to a police officer, at any time, whether before or after he is charged, is admissible, if it is voluntary.
Section 117 thus contains an express provision which prescribes a new procedure for the admission of statements. This procedure is wholly incompatible with s 26 of Cap 108.
A defendant facing serious charges is likely to be in custody before he is charged with the offence. But any voluntary statement which he makes after being charged will be admissible by virtue of the section.
Section 117 does not refer to s 26; nor does it in terms purport to be an `express` provision within the meaning of s 26. But it is an express provision in the sense that it enacts a law which is in clear conflict with s 26 and which is unworkable unless it supersedes it.
There can, in my view, be no doubt that the legislature intended that the procedure prescribed by s 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code should supersede s 26, that provided for by that it intended s 117 to be an express provision to the contrary within the meaning of s 26 and that it has achieved that intention.
The fourth case is also from Brunei, 
PP v Yator bin Bunta
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 163
  where O` Connor J, after referring to 
PP v Emran bin Haji Md Noor
 
 [1987] MLJ 1 
 and 
PP v Zainal Abidin bin Ismail
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 741
  said that the correct meaning to be given to the expression `express provision` was that laid down by the Privy Council in 
Shanmugam v Commissioner for Registration of Indian and Pakistani Residents
 
[1962] AC 515
[1962] 2 All ER 609
[1962] 3 WLR 200
 at p 527: 
 
Their Lordships are of the view that it is correct to state that express provision is provision the applicability of which does not arise by inference ... To be `express provision` with regard to something it is not necessary that that thing should be specially mentioned; it is sufficient that it is directly covered by the language however broad the language may be which covers it so long as the applicability arises directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom.
 
 
 
O`Connor J pointed out that the introductory words `subject to any express provision contained in any written law` was not found in the Indian version which was the original version of that provision. He noted that those words were first introduced in the Malayan version. He said that those words were intended to give a form of entrenchment to the section and were intended `to provide, as does an Interpretation Act, a guide to the construction of subsequent legislation that appears to bear on the same subject matter`. He explained that the origin of s 26 lay in a distrust of what may happen to persons in police custody and that such fears were well founded. He further added: 
 
One should consider with caution a suggestion that the fears crystallized in the section have been set aside by a side wind, repealed by inference. Section 26 is, in India, Malaysia, Brunei, and other places that have the Indian Evidence Act, or a derivative of it, probably the best known provision in all the laws on evidence. It is difficult to conceive that it would not have been in the mind of a person drafting s 117. Yet s 117 does not use a phrase such as `whether in police custody or not`. It appears to me that this omission is of great significance when one considers the detailed attributes, set out in s 117, relating to the statement and its circumstances.
 
 
 
In s 117(1), the words `made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged` do not, in my opinion, relate to the circumstances of the person in relation to custody or not. They relate to a merely temporal matter, to the sequence, in relation to charging.
A person could be charged and served with a notice under s 117(3) whilst not in custody. Nothing in s 117, in my opinion, necessitates that the section applies to a person in custody.`
The last case which addressed this issue is 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  a decision of a two-judge Singapore High Court. There, the accused was charged with the offence of murder and, while in custody, the police recorded a statement from him under s 122(6). The admissibility of that statement was objected to on the ground that s 26 of the Evidence Act operated to exclude it, there being nothing in s 122(5) which governed the admissibility of a statement made under s 122(6) and which expressly overrode s 26 of the Evidence Act. The court noted that the Brunei provisions were different from ours in that the introductory words in their s 117(1) read `In any criminal proceedings ...` and ours read `Where any person is charged with an offence ...`. Further their s 117(1) did not contain the proviso to our s 122(5). Our High Court concurred with the Federal Court in 
PP v Ng Goh Weng
 
[1979] 127
 and Roberts CJ in 
PP v Zainal Abidin bin Ismail
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 741
  and refused to follow O`Connor J in 
PP v Yator bin Bunta
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 163
  and seemed to think that the position in Singapore was clearer because of the aforesaid differences. Grimberg JC, who delivered the judgment of the court, further said (at pp 409-410): 
 
We are unable to accept the contention of the defence that, in order for a confession made while in custody to be admissible, it would be necessary for s 121(5) to contain the words `notwithstanding s 26 of the Evidence Act` or, alternatively, the words `whether in police custody or not`, in relation to a confession so made. The Privy Council has held that, for a provision to be `express`, all that is necessary is that it should not arise by inference alone, but that it should do so `directly from the language used` - see 
 Shanmugam v Commissioner for Registration for Indian and Pakistani Residents
 
[1962] AC 515
 ...
 
 
 
In our judgment, s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code lets in a confession, whether or not made pursuant to s 121(6), so long as the maker has been charged, and whether or not it is made while he is in police custody. That follows directly from the very wide language of the subsection, and not by inference. We are unable to agree that the words `at any time` have only a temporal connotation, and that they must be construed to mean `at any time so long as the accused is not in custody`. Needless to say, a confession made at any time, within the meaning of s 121(5), would be excluded by virtue of the proviso to s 121(5) if it were caused by inducement, threat or promise.
It would be observed that Grimberg JC referred to s 121(5). That was the previous numbering of what is now s 122(5).
In view of these differences of judicial opinion, we think it might be useful for us to examine briefly the historical development of what is now s 122(5).
Section 26 of the Act, which has its origin in the Indian Evidence Act, clearly preceded s 122(5). The Indian version of this provision and the earlier version of our present s 26 did not contain the introductory words, `subject to any express provision in any written law`. It merely provided: `no confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall be proved as against such person`.
Before 1960, the position was that the police were empowered to require the attendance of persons who appeared to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case. Any statement made by such a witness would be reduced into writing. The witness was required to state the truth except that he could decline to make with regard to any fact or circumstance a statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. But, generally, statements so made by any person to a police office in the course of a police investigation could not be used in evidence.
In 1960, by two amending Ordinances (Nos 17 and 18 of 1960), the Evidence Act and the CPC were amended. The present introductory words to s 26 of the Act were added. Further what was then s 121 (now numbered s 122) of the CPC was amended by the insertion of a new sub-s (5), the relevant part of which reads: 
 
 
(5) Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether such statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing made at any time, whether before or after such person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not by such person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of Inspector shall be admissible at his trial in evidence ... 
 
Provided that no such statement shall be admissible or used as aforesaid - 
 
(a) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise ... ; or, 
 
(b) in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest unless the court 
 
is satisfied that the statement was made and recorded in compliance with the 
 
provisions of the rules set out in Schedule E to this Code.
  
 
 
Schedule E to the CPC, which was also added in 1960 by the same amending Ordinance, set out the rules governing statements obtained from accused persons who had been arrested. Some of the pertinent rules were these: 
 
 
(3) Persons in custody shall not be questioned without the usual caution being first administered. 
 
(4) If the prisoner wishes to volunteer any statement, the usual caution shall be administered. 
 
(5) In any case before the formal charge the usual caution shall be: `You are not obliged to say anything but anything you say may be given in evidence.` 
 
(6) The caution to be administered to a prisoner when he is formally charged shall be in the following words - `Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.`
  
 
 
From the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that the legislature amended s 26 of the Evidence Act by inserting the introductory words in order to make way for what was then the new s 121(5) of the CPC, which permitted a confession made by a person in police custody to be admitted in evidence against that person. The presence of the proviso to s 121(5) clearly showed that it was the intention that the main provision of that subsection should apply to statements given by accused persons while under police custody. The effect of the proviso was to narrow down the scope of the subsection. If the main part of s 121(5) was not intended to apply to a statement made by a person while under police custody, then there would be no need for proviso (b). While we agree that there was nothing in s 121(5) which explicitly referred to s 26, in our view there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that s 121(5) was in clear conflict with s 26 and that the situation came squarely within the introductory words `subject to any express provision in any written law`.
The next significant development occurred in 1966. The proviso to the then
s 121(5) of the CPC was deleted and a new proviso was substituted in these terms: 
 
Provided that the court may in its discretion refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid - 
(a) [no change - same as before] 
(b) In the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the Rules set out in Schedule E to this Code.
 
 
 
The changes made to the proviso in 1966 further liberalized the admissibility of the statements of accused persons, whether in police custody or otherwise. Under the pre-1966 law, so long as there was inducement, threat or promise or if the provisions in Schedule E were not strictly complied with, the statement could not be admitted. Under the 1966 amendment the court was given a discretion whether to refuse to admit such a statement. The second area of change concerned the compliance with Schedule E. Whereas previously strict compliance with Schedule E was required, that had been altered to one of substantial compliance.
The next major development occurred in 1976. The changes made in that year are still the law today. But we should add that before that, in 1973, a very minor alteration was made to the then s 121(5) where the word `Sergeant` was substituted for the word `Inspector`. The consequence of this minor amendment was that a statement need no longer be recorded by an inspector to be admissible; a sergeant would suffice.
The alterations made to s 121 in 1976 were these: 
 
 
(i) the proviso to s 121(5) was deleted altogether and a new proviso substituted 
 
in its place which reads as follows:
  
 
 
Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
 
 
 
(ii) new sub-ss (6)-(8) were added to the section and they read: 
 
 
(6) Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect: `You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for - (set out the charge) 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.` 
 
(7) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to subsection (5), if it is otherwise voluntary. 
 
(8) In subsection (6), `officially informed` means informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders. 
 
(iii) Schedule E was repealed.
  
 
 
As a result of these amendments: 
 
 
(i) A statement which is tainted by inducement, threat or promise is no longer admissible. No discretion is vested in the judge to admit such a tainted statement. 
 
(ii) The common law right of silence of an accused person is in a sense curtailed. Rule 6 of Schedule E reflected that common law position. Under the new 
 
s 122(6) the accused is now more or less obliged to tell the police officer, after the prescribed warning has been given to him, of the facts he intends to rely on by way of defence. If he fails to disclose his defence, the court may draw an adverse inference against him. Having said that, we would add that he is still not compelled to incriminate himself or even say anything at all.
  
 
 
What then is the effect of the repeal of the previous proviso (b) to s 121(5), that is, the inadmissibility of a statement by a person under arrest which was not recorded in substantial compliance with Schedule E (hereinafter referred to as `the second limb`)? As stated before, in the context of s 121(5) as it stood before the 1976 amendment, the proviso operated as a limitation on the general scope of that provision. We have stated that s 121(5) was intended to apply to statements made by a person while under police custody, otherwise there would have been no need to impose restrictions of the kind set out in the proviso. If this is the correct construction of s 121(5), as we think it is, then the repeal of the second limb of the proviso could not have further restricted the scope of that subsection. On the contrary, it can only mean that the applicability of s 121(5) is further widened and that the only circumstance where a statement made by an accused, whether in police custody or not, may not be admitted in evidence is where it is tainted by inducement, threat or promise.
We have earlier opined that the introduction of the new sub-s (6) in a sense curtails the right of silence of an accused person. We are unable to accept the contention that this new subsection is the equivalent of what was previously the second limb. The thrust of the second limb was to restrict the admission of statement made by a person under arrest if the statement was not recorded in substantial compliance with the rules in Schedule E. Indeed r 6 of Schedule E expressly cautioned the accused in custody that he was not obliged to say anything. On the other hand, the object of the new sub-s (6) is to ask him to state the facts upon which he intends to rely in his defence and if he fails to state those facts there and then and chooses only to state those facts at the trial, such facts may be less likely to be believed by the court. Admittedly, he is not compelled to state those facts. But he has to bear the consequences for remaining silent. The aim of the new subsection is to prevent or reduce the incidence of an accused person springing a defence at the last minute leaving the police with no opportunity or possibility to investigate the defence due to the long lapse of time.
Viewed in its historical perspective, it was clearly the intention of the legislature, by the enactment of the then s 121(5) (now renumbered s 122(5)), to admit in evidence a statement made by an accused person even while he was under police custody.
Turning to the wording of s 122(5) itself, the crucial words in that subsection are obviously these: `made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged`. In our view these words must be given their plain ordinary meaning. After a person is charged it is just as likely that he would be in police custody as he would be on bail. To give it the meaning contended by counsel for the first appellant would be to read these additional words into it, `so long as the person is not under arrest or custody`. It is further contended that if that was the intention of the legislature, it would have inserted the words `whether in police custody or not`. O`Connor J so said in 
Yator bin Bunta
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 163
  after noting that s 26 of the Evidence Act was such a well-known provision. But if it is the intention of the legislature that one is looking for, then from the historical development of the provision which we have outlined above any doubt which may exist would have been removed. To insert in the subsection the words `whether in police custody or not` would really be quite tautologous.
In our judgment, in so far as a statement, including a confession, is recorded under s 121, and provided there is no inducement, threat or promise, it is admissible under s 122(5) irrespective of whether the person giving the statement is in police custody or not. Section 122(5) is an `express provision` within the meaning of the introductory words of s 26 of the Act. What is meant by `express provision` was elucidated by the Privy Council in 
Shanmugam v Commissioner for Registration of Indian and Pakistani Residents
 
[1962] AC 515
[1962] 2 All ER 609
[1962] 3 WLR 200
 as follows, which we respectfully adopt: 
 
Their Lordships are of the view that it is correct to state that express provision is provision the applicability of which does not arise by inference ... To be `express provision` with regard to something 
 it is not necessary that that thing should be specially mentioned; it is sufficient that it is directly covered by the language, however broad the language may be
 which covers it so long as the applicability arises directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In our opinion s 122(5) covers the situation where an accused person gives a statement while under police custody. It does not arise merely by inference.
While we agree with O`Connor J that the introductory words in s 26 give a form of entrenchment to the section, we would say that it is only a limited form of entrenchment. It may be overridden by express provision. Words such as those in question are commonly found in legislation. In each case it is a question of determining whether the subsequent legislation is an `express provision` to the contrary. The explicit mention of the earlier provision is not necessary.
 Is a caution necessary under s 121(2)?
The next point submitted by counsel for the first appellant is that there is no power in the police to record a field diary statement after the first appellant had been arrested. Furthermore, even if there is such a power, the statement should not be admitted because s 121(2) of the CPC had not been complied with as no caution was administered to the first appellant before he made the statement. Section 121(1) empowers a police officer who is making an investigation into a crime to examine any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts of the case. There is nothing in that provision which suggests that such a power of the police will not apply where the person who is being examined is a person who is under arrest and against whom a reasonable suspicion exists for being involved in the crime. Police investigations into a case do not cease merely because a suspect has been arrested.
As regards the question of the necessity to give a caution to the first appellant in accordance with s 121(2), the learned deputy public prosecutor relied on two decisions of the High Court: 
PP v Tan Ho Teck
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 264
  
 PP v Chandran a/l Gangatharan & Ors 
. 
PP v Chandran a/l Gangatharan & Ors
 (Unreported) However, no authority was cited by the first appellant. In those two cases the High Court decided that it was not necessary that a caution must be administered to the person making the statement advising him that he was entitled to decline to make any statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.
However, since we reserved judgment in this appeal, another High Court consisting of two judges, had in the case 
 PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor 
 
 PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor
 (Unreported) ruled otherwise. The trial judges went on the basis that a failure to advise a suspect or an accused person of his right of silence would infringe art 9(1) of the Constitution. They said: 
 
Section 121(2) of the CPC sets out the so-called `right of silence` enjoyed by suspects when interrogated by the police. It is expressed in the Latin maxim nemo debet se ipsum prodere and has been described by the Privy Council in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  at p 50 as one of the fundamental rules of justice within the meaning of the word `law` in art 9(1) of the Constitution. Article 9(1) provides that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. Since that right is a constitutional right, an accused or a suspect should, in our view, be cautioned of his right to decline to make an incriminating statement notwithstanding that sub-s (2) of s 121 does not specifically require that any such caution be administered. In our view a statute should be construed in such a way as will give effect to a constitutional right.
 
 
 
Since the decision of the High Court in 
 Mazlan bin Maidun 
 
 PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor
 (Unreported) the Attorney General has, in exercise of the powers conferred upon him under s 265(3) of the CPC, requested the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider the following points of law which arose in the case: 
 
 
(i) Whether a suspect or an accused must be expressly informed of a right to remain silent whenever any statement is recorded from him pursuant to 
 
s 121(1) of the CPC. 
 
(ii) Whether a failure to so inform him is a breach of his constitutional rights under art 9(1) of the Constitution. 
 
(iii) Whether any statement recorded from a suspect or an accused under s 121(1) and sought to be admitted in evidence under the provisions of s 122(5) of the CPC cannot be so admitted if no caution has been read to him in terms of 
 
s 121(2) of the CPC.
  
 
 
In view of these developments, it is evidently desirable, before this court makes a ruling on the matter, that it should have the benefit of full arguments, especially when it touches on a constitutional point.
At any rate, for the purpose of the present appeal it is unnecessary to decide this issue. Assuming that the field diary statements of the appellants were not admitted in evidence, there remained the following statements, namely: (i) the
s 122(6) statements, and (ii) the long statements recorded under s 121(2). Both these statements were held admissible and were admitted in evidence by the trial judges, and, in our opinion, were rightly admitted. On the basis of these statements alone there was ample evidence for the trial judges to hold at the close of the case for the prosecution that a case against the appellants had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions. Upon their defence being called, the appellants gave evidence, which we have summarized earlier. On the basis of their evidence counsel for the first appellant raised the defences of sudden fight and sudden provocation and also the defence of intoxication and unsoundness of mind, all of which were rejected by the trial judges, and, in our opinion, they were rightly rejected. Counsel for the second appellant submitted that the second appellant did not participate in the fight between the first appellant and the deceased; that his involvement was merely to separate them, and that there was no proof of motive or common intention. These submissions were rejected by the trial judges and they were justified in so doing. Disregarding the field diary statements, the evidence before the trial judges then consisted mainly of the
s 122(6) statement and the s 121(2) long statement. The trial judges were satisfied with the truth of the facts contained in these statements. They said: 
 
As for the second and the third set of statements, ie the 122(6) and the long statements, notwithstanding the competence or otherwise of Mr Chakravarti as to his ability to paraphrase the warning contained in s 121 and having observed and heard the witnesses, we had no doubt that the facts stated in the statements were in fact the truth and not otherwise. Furthermore, as to the first accused`s protestation that he did not comprehend any English, it was our perception that he could speak and understand English from the remarkable way he repeated many times those English words allegedly uttered by Corporal Koh, Detective Police Constable Low and Insp Yeoh in logical sequence and without once rearranging the order or sequence.
 
 
 
The statements constituted overwhelming evidence against the appellants, and we are satisfied that even if the field diary statements were disregarded, the trial judges would still have come to the finding that the charges against the appellants had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
 Miscellaneous issues
We will now turn to deal with some of the miscellaneous criticisms. Counsel for the first appellant made three points in relation to the s 122(6) statement. First, he said the notice under s 122(6) was not served on the first appellant immediately after his arrest; it was done only some 22 hours later. Secondly, the interpreter was incompetent. Thirdly, that it was tainted by the recording done earlier in the field diary. In our opinion there is no merit in any of these criticisms. Under
s 122(6) the notice in writing is only required to be served after the person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it. The duty to serve the notice does not arise immediately after arrest. Next in so far as the competence of the interpreter is concerned, the learned trial judges who heard the interpreter in court, accepted the statement. There is no basis for us to disagree with the trial judges that the statement was the statement of the appellant and that what was stated therein was true, at least in so far as the main things were concerned. Similarly we do not see how it could be argued that the s 122(6) statement was not his statement merely because the appellant had earlier given the field diary statement. The question in each occasion must be whether the statement was in fact the statement of that person given voluntarily.
As regards the long statement, counsel for the first appellant first submitted that there was no power in the police to record such a statement from the first appellant. In our view, the answer to this is in s 121(1). Nowhere is it provided that the police may not take a statement from a person after he is charged or after a s 122(6) has been obtained from him. Police investigations into an offence do not necessarily cease on a person being formally charged for the offence. We think this point of view is entirely in line with the provision of s 122(5) which expressly permits the admission of a statement made by a person after he has been charged.
Counsel also raised two other points on the long statement: (i) Was the caution required under s 121(2) given? (ii) Should the questions posed by the inspector in eliciting the statement be also recorded? The statement itself (exh 59) clearly shows that a caution was given to the first appellant before he started to give the long statement. The trial judges accepted the evidence of Insp Yeoh and the interpreter on this. Indeed the same position prevailed as regards the long statement of the second appellant. There is really no basis for us to dissent from them. As regards the second point, counsel submitted that this is undesirable and he urged this court to disregard this statement. No authority has been submitted in support of this contention. The case cited below, 
PP v Subramaniam & Anor
 
 
[1956] MLJ 58
  is of no assistance to the first appellant.
The final point submitted on behalf of the first appellant is that he should not be convicted on his own confession when the confession has been retracted. His counsel further submitted that in any case there should at least be corroborative evidence. This submission is clearly unsustainable in the light of three previous decisions of this court or its predecessors: 
Yap Sow Keong & Anor v PP
 
 
[1947] MLJ 90
  
Osman & Anor v PP
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 137
  and 
Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v PP
 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 180
 
In 
Yap Sow Keong
 
 
[1947] MLJ 90
  the appellants were convicted of the offence of armed robbery. The only evidence against the first appellant was a confession made by him to a magistrate, which he subsequently retracted at the trial, alleging that he had made the confession because he was beaten up while in police custody. Willan CJ, who delivered the judgment of the Malayan Union Court of Appeal, said: 
 
In our view the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions in evidence is clear and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth. We do not agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on his retracted confession there must be corroborative evidence to support it.
 
 
 
This statement of the law was expressly cited and adopted by the Federal Court sitting in Singapore in 
Osman
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 137
  and by this court in 
Ismail bin Abdul Rahman
 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 180
 
Counsel for the appellant referred to the Malaysian High Court case of 
PP v Chong Boo See
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 292
  where Edgar Joseph Jr J said at p 298: 
 
...although in principle it is possible for an accused person to be convicted on his confession standing alone provided - I hasten to add - the court is of the opinion that the incriminating parts thereof are true, in practice it always looks for corroboration.
 
 
 
But quite clearly there is not anything said by the learned judge in 
Chong Boo See
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 292
  which alters the position we have stated.
While both the appellants claimed that the statements they were alleged to have made were fabricated by the police, we see that in many aspects what were stated in the statements corresponded with the appellant`s evidence in court.
Finally we would like to refer briefly to the submission of the counsel for the second appellant. Firstly, he associated himself with the legal points raised by counsel for the first appellant. On that, what we have said hereinbefore as regards the first appellant will also apply to the second appellant. Secondly, he said, and this is really his main point, that the trial judges had misdirected themselves on the defence of sudden fight. He submitted that the trial judges had failed to consider that defence against each accused separately. Instead they were lumped together.
It is quite clear from the grounds of decision that the trial judges accepted that the incriminating facts stated by the second appellant in his statements were true, and were made by him voluntarily. From his statements it is clear that there was common intention on the part of both appellants to inflict the deadly injuries on the deceased. The trial judges did not accept the evidence given in court of either appellant as to how the killing took place that fateful night.
The defence of sudden fight, Exception 4 to s 300 of the Code, is only available to an accused if the killing was committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. On the evidence before the court, there was clear premeditation. The remarks of the trial judges: 
 
Looking at the facts of this case, it is clear from the evidence that a punch or two by the deceased and the scratching of the first accused`s face did not warrant a heavy crank handle being used to hit the head or face of the deceased more than once. The story of the first accused that the whole thing started when he was trying to reason with the deceased that their visit to Rosie was wrong could not be believed. Furthermore, the pulling out of the testes of the deceased at or after the time of the deceased`s death does not go hand in hand with the defence of sudden fight. The first accused`s story that his mind went blank the moment the deceased fell to the ground is nothing but a device to escape being questioned.
 
 
 
were really to reinforce the point that the defence was not available to them. The version they put up was not believed. It was contrary to what they stated in their statements. As between the statements of the two appellants the court preferred those of the first appellant, as having set out more accurately what, in fact, happened and the role each of the appellants played. This was not a case of a sudden fight but a planned fight. Accordingly we would dismiss the appeal.

The appellant was convicted in the High Court for importing into Singapore not less than 1,026g of cannabis on 9 October 1991, at 6.46am, at customs inspection lane No 3, inward car bay, Woodlands checkpoint, Singapore, thereby having committed an offence under s 7 read with s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). His appeal to this court against conviction was dismissed by us and we give our reasons for so doing.
The facts are as follows.
In the early hours of 9 October 1991, Customs Officer Lim Tiong Khoon (`CO Lim`) and Higher Customs Officer Png Boon Hock (`HCO Png`) were on duty at lane 3, inward car bay, at Woodlands checkpoint. Their duties involved inspecting motorcycles and scooters for dutiable goods and contraband coming into Singapore.
At about 6.45am, the appellant, riding a blue scooter BAJ 1786 (`the scooter`), entered lane 3 for inspection. CO Lim spoke to the appellant and asked him whether he was carrying any cigarettes to which he replied in the negative. As CO Lim noticed that the appellant appeared nervous and spoke in a trembling voice, he decided to search the appellant`s scooter thoroughly. The scooter was pushed to lane 1 which was closed at that time to facilitate the search.
CO Lim first inspected the compartment on the left side of the scooter and found a pair of pliers and screw drivers. He then directed the appellant to lift the seat of the scooter. This revealed the petrol tank and CO Lim noticed that, of the four screws used to bolt down the tank, one was missing and the other three were loosened. CO Lim used the pliers to remove the screws and asked the appellant to lift up the petrol tank. The appellant was reluctant to do so, turned around and tried to walk away. CO Lim stopped him and asked him in Malay where he was going but the appellant did not answer. He then asked the appellant in Malay whether he was carrying any `barang` (thing). The appellant replied in Malay, `Ada barang, encik` ([I] have something, sir), and when CO Lim asked, `Apa barang?` (What thing?), the appellant replied, `Saya ada satu kilo ganja` (I have a kilo of cannabis).
CO Lim informed HCO Png of what the appellant had said and, in the presence of both customs officers, the appellant lifted up the petrol tank of his scooter. CO Lim retrieved a white plastic bag with the words `Kedai Kain Kay Tack` with a Kelantanese address below. Inside the bag was some plant material which CO Lim believed to be cannabis. CO Lim asked the appellant, `apa ini?` (what`s this?) and the appellant replied, `ganja` (cannabis). The plant material was seized and the appellant arrested.
He was later interviewed by superintendent of customs, Ni Teck Seng (`SCO Ni`), who questioned the appellant as to his place of work. The appellant replied that he worked at Bukit Timah Road and also informed SCO Ni that he had a kidney problem and needed money for an operation.
The plant material seized was subsequently analyzed by Ms Helena Granroth (`Ms Granroth`) of the department of scientific services and found to be not less than 1,026g of cannabis.
With the weight of the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) of the Act operating against him, his defence was called. His defence was that the plant material had been planted in his fuel tank without his knowledge by one Mi who had borrowed his scooter for an errand. The learned judge disbelieved him and convicted him of the charge.
Before us, Mr Almenoar did not challenge the learned judge`s finding that the appellant knew of the presence of the plant material hidden in his scooter and that he had imported that plant material into Singapore. Instead, he raised the following two grounds: 
 
The first was that there had been a procedural irregularity in the conduct of the trial as the learned judge had proceeded with the trial without providing a suitable or duly qualified interpreter for the appellant ...
 
 
 
The second was that the plant material carried by the appellant had not been analyzed properly by Ms Granroth to show beyond a reasonable doubt that it was 1,026g of cannabis.
Mr Almenoar submitted that the appellant hailed from Kelantan and could only speak and understand the Kelantanese dialect. Although a suitably qualified interpreter in the Kelantanese dialect was eventually provided for the appellant, this was only after the first day of the proceedings and after ten witnesses had given evidence and seven statements had been admitted in evidence. The absence of a suitably qualified interpreter on the first day of the proceedings had thus resulted in a material irregularity in the trial below.
On the question of interpreters, the relevant provision is to be found in s 209(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) which reads as follows: 
 
Whenever any evidence is given in a language not understood by the accused and he is present in person, it shall be interpreted to him forthwith in a language which he understands.
 
 
 
Section 209 and other provisions in the CPC as to interpreters are statutory safeguards to ensure that an accused is substantially able to comprehend the proceedings to enable him to best present his defence. The ability to understand the prosecution case against him will allow him to decide whether to give evidence himself, whether to call witnesses on his behalf or whether to instruct his counsel to rebut any particular piece of evidence given by the prosecution.
However, to that a caveat must be added. Notwithstanding that there has been non-compliance with s 209(1) or any provision requiring the accused`s comprehension of the proceedings, an appellate court will only interfere if the accused has been prejudiced such that there has been a failure of justice. Mere irregularities which do not result in the accused being prejudiced in his defence are defects which can be cured by s 396 of the CPC.
One such failure of justice was occasioned in the recent Privy Council decision of 
 Kunnath v The State 
. We are indebted to Mr Almenoar for referring it to us.
The facts there were that Kunnath, an uneducated Indian peasant, was charged with drug trafficking. He claimed trial, and at his trial, which was conducted in English, he was represented by experienced counsel and an interpreter had translated the charges to Kunnath as well as his statement from the dock. The interpreter, however, did not translate the evidence of the witnesses to Kunnath who stated that he had not understood what any of the witnesses had said. He was convicted and sentenced to death. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Mauritius was dismissed as that court was of the view that, since neither Kunnath nor his counsel had demanded the right to a translation of the evidence, that right was `lost for all time`. Kunnath appealed to the Privy Council.
Lord Jauncey, in delivering the judgment of the Board, held that it was an essential principle of criminal law that a trial for an indictable offence should be conducted in the presence of the accused and this meant not simply that there should be a corporeal presence of the accused but that the accused, by reason of his presence, should be able to understand the proceedings and decide what witnesses he wished to call, whether to give evidence, and, if so, upon what matters. Since Kunnath had not understood the evidence, the trial was for all practical purposes conducted without his presence and he had been deprived of a fair trial. The Board accordingly quashed his conviction.
It is therefore the court`s duty to ensure that the accused is able to substantially understand the evidence given in the proceedings. The right to an interpreter cannot be waived by an accused or his counsel and this was stated succinctly by the Lord Chief Justice of England in 
 R v Lee Kun 
 at p 299: 
 
If [the accused] does not understand the English language, he cannot waive compliance with the rule that evidence must be translated; he cannot dispense with it by express or implied consent, and it matters not that no application is made by him for the assistance of an interpreter. 
 It is for the court to see that the necessary means are adopted to convey the evidence to his intelligence, notwithstanding that, either through ignorance or timidity or disregard of his own interests, he makes no application to the court
. The reason is that the trial of a person for a criminal offence is not a contest of private interests in which the rights of parties can be waived at pleasure. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Mr Almenoar took us through the verbatim notes and we noted that, from the very beginning of the trial, the appellant`s counsel had raised the need for a Kelantanese interpreter for the appellant. The learned judge was fully alert to this need and instructed the Bahasa Melayu (Malay language) interpreter who had been provided to enquire of the appellant if he understood Bahasa Melayu. After some questions put to the appellant, the Bahasa Melayu interpreter informed the court that the appellant understood some Bahasa Melayu as well as broken English and this satisfied the learned judge, who carried on with the trial, but also added that, should the appellant experience difficulty following the proceedings, arrangements would have to be made for a Kelantanese Malay interpreter.
As the day went on, it turned out that the appellant only partially understood what was going on and the learned judge instructed the interpreter to find out what the appellant`s command of Bahasa Melayu was. The problem was eventually rectified the following morning, when the services of a Kelantanese speaking gentleman from the Royal Malaysian Navy was secured. The learned judge`s instruction to him was that he was to interpret to the appellant the evidence of the witnesses as well as what the court said.
The relevant irregularity, according to Mr Almenoar, occurred on the first day when the Kelantanese interpreter was not present. We examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to see if, by only partially understanding what had been said, it could be said that the appellant had been prejudiced in his defence. It is significant that, of the witnesses who took the stand and of those whose statements were admitted without challenge, only one of them gave contentious evidence and that was Ms Granroth. The rest of the witnesses were really formal witnesses, whose evidence, in our view, could not have merited any serious challenge by the accused through his counsel.
As for Ms Granroth`s evidence as to how she analyzed the plant material, we do not see how the appellant has been prejudiced by not understanding her evidence of the procedure she adopted as even a layman who could understand English would not have been any better equipped to challenge the intricacies of scientific procedures. In our view, there was nothing that the appellant could have added to his counsel`s robust challenge of the scientific procedure, assuming that he had actually understood what Ms Granroth was saying. The really contentious evidence in the present case was the evidence of HCO Png and, especially, that of CO Lim, who alleged that the appellant had made certain incriminating confessions to them. By that time, however, the services of the Kelantanese interpreter had already been secured and the appellant was able to understand what was being said.
We regard 
 Kunnath 
`s case1 as correct on its facts as well as for the propositions of law made by Lord Jauncey, given that Kunnath had not understood any of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. It is, nonetheless, a case that finds itself at the extreme end of the spectrum. On the other hand, there is nothing in the present case, for the reasons we have cited above, to suggest that the appellant had, in any way, been prejudiced by only partially understanding the witnesses on the first day of the proceedings.
Mr Almenoar submitted that the prosecution had failed to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entire plant material was 1,026g of cannabis since Ms Granroth had only carried out tests on 45g out of the entire 1,026g of plant material.
The same point was raised below by Mr Tiwary, counsel for the appellant, and in his grounds of decision, the learned judge set out in extenso the procedure adopted by Ms Granroth on the plant material: 
 
First, I have to set out in some detail the evidence of the government chemist, Helena Granroth. She testified that, when she received the [plant material], she carried out various tests. She first measured the size of the plastic bag and recorded the seal number. She then weighed the exhibit; she next emptied the plastic bag and weighed the plastic bag. The weight of the substance in the plastic bag was 1,026g.
 
 
 
After that she visually examined the substance in the plastic bag which she described as plant material. She found it to consist uniformly of characteristic features of the cannabis plant, ie compressed fruiting flowering tops with seeds and small leaves and small stalks. In answer to defence counsel, she said that, though she is not a botanist, there were no other plants with similar characteristics.
After the visual test, she divided the substance into nine sectors. From every sector she sampled randomly 5g of the substance and obtained nine samples. These she kept in nine different containers. Ms Granroth had followed the accepted standard practice in obtaining the nine samples.
She next carried out microscopic tests on all of the nine samples. She looked for the presence of systolic hair which is one of the characteristic features of cannabis. To a question from defence counsel, she readily agreed that systolic hair can also be found in other plants. However, besides systolic hair, she also examined under the microscope for the presence of resin. She saw an abundance of resin on the surface of the samples which, she said, had oozed out from the epidermal glands of the samples.
After the microscopic tests, she carried out chemical tests ... what is important to note is that there are no chemical tests to determine the presence of resin which can only be seen under a microscope.
As all the tests were positive, Ms Granroth concluded that what was in the plastic bag was cannabis.
Counsel for the defence cross-examined, at times vigorously, to challenge the tests she had carried out. This I allowed, on the basis that the defence would be calling a chemist. But, at the end of the day, no expert witness was called. So, at the close of the case, there was only her evidence which in the event must remain unchallenged.
As to Mr Tiwary`s submission that there must be some doubt as to whether the bulk of the unanalyzed substance was cannabis, the learned judge held: 
 
... Mr Tiwary, for the accused, argued that the prosecution had not proved their case, that the bulk of the substance (96%) in the plastic bag was cannabis. It was more than implied in the submissions that tests ought to be carried out, if not on the whole of the contents of the plastic bag, at least on a substantial portion of it. This I promptly rejected as an absurd proposition. Even the suggestion that the government chemist should examine all the stalks in the nine samples to look for resin was an impossible task no chemist should be required to do.
 
 
 
Mr Almenoar took issue with the learned judge`s comments that to analyze the whole of the contents or a substantial part of it was `an absurd proposition` and `an impossible task no chemist should be required to do`. He referred us to the case of 
 PP v Ang Soon Huat 
, where Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) had held that, due to the unsatisfactory nature of the scientific analysis of the drugs, there had been a reasonable doubt as to the exact weight of diamorphine which the accused had been charged with trafficking.
Mr Almenoar submitted that, since the trafficking or importation of more than 500g of cannabis attracted the death penalty, it was incumbent upon the director of scientific services to test at least 500g of every sample seized as opposed to such a small quantity as 45g which was done in this case. His submission was that the appellant could, at best, be convicted of importing 45g of cannabis since there was a doubt as to whether this 45g was representative of the entire sample seized.
In considering this submission, we first looked to the definition of cannabis as set out in s 2 of the Act which is as follows: 
 
`Cannabis` means any part of any plant of the genus cannabis from which the resin has not been extracted, by whatever name it may be designated;
 
 
 
The definition demands the satisfaction of two criteria of the material analyzed. Firstly, that it must belong to the genus cannabis and, secondly, that the resin must not have been extracted.
Having said that, it must be stated that the procedure outlined by the learned judge which Ms Granroth followed was the standard procedure set out in the laboratory manual of the director of scientific services for the analysis of cannabis. This procedure is approved by the United Nations in their 
 Manual on the Recommended Methods for Testing Cannabis 
. Counsel for the appellant below did not call any expert to challenge the correctness of this procedure as was done in 
 Ang 
`s case.3
The United Nations` manual makes the following comments on the analysis of cannabis: 
 
Cannabis products represent a special problem to the analyst in that the items under examination are often of enormous size and the chemical tests used only require a very small aliquot. Homogenization is not appropriate or useful in such situations. The analyst must ensure that the entire item or seizure is a controlled drug. 
 The importance of visual examination, which plays a very minor role in the examination of the powder drugs, cannot be over-emphasized in the analysis of cannabis products
 ... the analyst should ... carefully use visual testing to ensure that all the exhibit is material which is controlled under the legislation within which he or she works. [Emphasis is added.]
 
 
 
In other words, 
 Ang 
`s case3 has no relevance to the present case as the court there was concerned with the analysis of diamorphine, a powder drug, which demands a completely different procedure to be adopted from the analysis of cannabis which exists in plant form.
With regard to the analysis of cannabis, the United Nations` manual is quite specific in that once the analyst has visually examined the exhibit and is satisfied that it displays the characteristics of the cannabis plant, chemical tests need only be carried out on a very small sample of the entire material.
In the court below, Ms Granroth gave evidence of how she had visually examined the entire plant material and noted the presence of small twigs, stems and fruiting, flowering tops which were all characteristics of the cannabis plant.
Mr Tiwary had submitted that, even assuming that the entire plant material was the cannabis plant, there was a possibility that resin had been extracted from it since Ms Granroth did not use a microscope to examine each and every twig, flower and stem to see if there was resin on them. However, it was Ms Granroth`s evidence that, when she received the plant material it was generally intact, save for some twigs broken off due to the handling and transportation of the exhibit. In other words, there was no sign that it had been interfered with, either manually or chemically, in an attempt to extract the resin out of the plant.
After the visual examination, she described how she had divided the entire plant material into nine lots and sampled 5g randomly from each lot: 
 
... when I mixed the whole exhibit, I already made the exhibit into small aggregates because the fruiting, flowering top is sometimes quite big so it doesn`t fit into my cup or vial so I have to cut up the fruiting flowering tops into smaller aggregates. After that, I mixed the whole lot together and then I sampled out into nine sectors.
 
 
 
All nine samples of 5g each were subjected to a series of chemical tests which confirmed that they belonged to the genus cannabis. She had also examined each sample under a microscope which revealed substantial quantities of resin.
We were unable to see how much more random the sampling and analysis procedure could have been. As such, we were entirely satisfied that the scientific tests which were carried out on the nine 5g samples were representative of the entire plant material and it was unnecessary for Ms Granroth to carry out tests on at least 500g of the plant material. As the tests had shown that all nine samples belonged to the plant of the genus cannabis from which the resin had not been extracted, we had no doubt that the prosecution had proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the plant material seized from the appellant was not less than 1,026g of cannabis as defined by s 2 of the Act.
Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned judge on the appellant.

The appellant was convicted in the High Court on 30 September 1993 of the following charge: 
 
You, Goh Lai Wak, are charged that you, on or about 26 March 1992 between 5.25pm and 5.55pm at Fern Tree Cafe, Miramar Hotel, Havelock Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, four packets of substance containing not less than 120.03g of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
After hearing submissions from counsel for the appellant, we dismissed the appeal and we now set out our reasons.
 Introduction
The appellant was arrested at Fern Tree Cafe, Miramar Hotel (`the coffee-house`), on 26 March 1992 following an undercover operation mounted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) in which Narcotics Officer Ng Beng Chin (`NO Ng`) had posed as a buyer of heroin. NO Ng had agreed to buy four pounds of heroin from the appellant on 6 March 1992 and the delivery was subsequently arranged to be made at the coffee-house at 6pm on 26 March 1992. At about 5.53pm, the appellant arrived at the coffee-house with a white `NTUC Fairprice` plastic bag. NO Ng had arrived at the coffee-house earlier at about 5.45pm with several officers from the Police Tactical Team. NO Ng waved at the appellant when he saw him enter the coffee-house and the appellant then proceeded to sit at the same table. NO Ng asked for the bag carried by the appellant and took it with him to the washroom to check if it contained the heroin which he had ordered. After ascertaining that the bag contained four packets of powdery substance which he suspected was heroin, NO Ng returned to their table. He gave a pre-arranged signal and the police officers moved in and arrested the accused. A struggle ensued and a revolver with five bullets in the chambers was recovered from the appellant, tucked at his waist. The learned trial judge indicated in his judgment, however, that he had excluded this piece of evidence from his consideration of the guilt of the appellant on the charge of trafficking in drugs. NO Ng took possession of the plastic bag containing the drugs and the four packets of powdery substance were later analyzed and found to contain not less than 120.03g of diamorphine.
Substantial segments of the prosecution evidence were strongly disputed by the appellant. His defence at trial was simply that he had arrived at the coffee-house with a white cloth bag containing five cartons of duty-free Salem cigarettes. He claimed that a Mr Wee, the police informer who introduced NO Ng to the appellant, requested him to deliver the cigarettes to NO Ng. The appellant asserted that NO Ng took the white cloth bag with him to the washroom to check its contents and only returned to the table after five minutes without the white cloth bag but with a white plastic bag instead. He denied possession of the drugs found in the white plastic bag and alleged that NO Ng planted the drugs on him. The appellant denied arranging to supply heroin to NO Ng.
 Prosecution evidence
The principal prosecution evidence was the testimony of the agent provocateur, NO Ng. He was introduced to the appellant on 6 March 1992 at about 11.05am, at the same coffee-house by an informer, Mr Wee, who was not called as a witness. NO Ng posed as a buyer of drugs and the appellant was introduced to him as Ah Goh. The appellant apparently had six pounds of heroin for sale and they agreed on the sale of the drugs at the price of $5,500 per pound. NO Ng sought delivery of the drugs on the same day but was told by the appellant that he could not do so, and instead the appellant offered to deliver the drugs on 9 March 1992. They then exchanged pager numbers and agreed to the use of a code, after which they left the coffee-house at about 11.20am.
Counsel for the appellant, during cross-examination, had put it to NO Ng that the three of them had actually met earlier on 1 March 1992 at the same place but not on 6 March 1992. NO Ng denied any earlier meeting and maintained that his first meeting with the appellant was on 6 March 1992. He denied counsel`s assertion that he was introduced by Mr Wee as a businessman who was planning to give Mr Wee boat repair contracts. NO Ng also denied that at this meeting he and Mr Wee only discussed matters regarding boat repairs and that the appellant did not actively participate in those discussions. He denied asking the appellant to supply duty-free cigarettes to him and denied that he had purchased such cigarettes from Mr Wee. NO Ng maintained that he had agreed with the appellant to the purchase of six pounds of heroin at $5,500 each at their first and only meeting on 6 March 1992.
NO Ng paged for the appellant on 10 March 1992 and enquired about the delivery. The appellant replied that he needed another six or seven days. There were no other communications between them until 26 March 1992 when NO Ng paged the appellant at about 3.50pm. The appellant responded that he had about four pounds of drugs for NO Ng but, as his supplier was busy at that time, they should get in touch again later in the day. NO Ng paged the appellant again at about 5.35pm and the appellant confirmed that he had the drugs ready in his car boot. On hearing this, NO Ng arranged for the appellant to meet him at the coffee-house at about 6pm with the drugs.
NO Ng arrived at the coffee-house at about 5.45pm and sat at a table with his back to the entrance of the coffee-house. NO Ng testified that he had only a small brown leather bag and a handphone with him. The appellant walked in at about 5.53pm. In looking around the coffee-house, the appellant had walked past NO Ng, but NO Ng waved to him and he went over and sat at the table. NO Ng testified that he saw the appellant carrying a white `NTUC Fairprice` plastic bag which the appellant placed on the floor. He invited the appellant to order some food and drink. He asked for the `thing` in Hokkien from him. At that time, there was no mention of the contents of the plastic bag as being drugs. The appellant then took the bag from the floor and placed it on the table.
NO Ng told the appellant that he would be taking it to the washroom to check its contents. At the washroom, he unwrapped the plastic bag and saw another white plastic bag with red markings at the side. He unwrapped that bag and came across four newspaper wrappings tied with rubber-bands. He took one out, unwrapped it and saw a transparent plastic bag containing heroin. He then rewrapped the newspaper covering and walked back to his table. On the way back, he gave a pre-arranged signal by looking at his pager and he replaced the bag on the floor. He told the appellant that he would be paying him slowly to avoid suspicion. He then reached out for his handphone pretending to make a call when the police officers moved in and arrested the appellant.
NO Ng stated in cross-examination that he had spent, at most, two minutes in the washroom and maintained that he had managed to unwrap and rewrap the bag in that time. He denied that he was in the washroom for five minutes and that he had substituted a white cloth bag containing cigarettes which the appellant had brought at the request of Mr Wee, with the white plastic bag. It was also put to NO Ng by counsel for the appellant that on 26 March 1992 itself the appellant did not speak to NO Ng on the telephone at all, but NO Ng had asked Mr Wee for five cartons of Salem cigarettes, which Mr Wee informed him would be delivered through the appellant. NO Ng denied this contention.
In view of the nature of the appellant`s defence, a considerable amount of time during the trial was taken up by evidence about the bag. The evidence of the undercover police officers stationed in various positions in the coffee-house essentially supported the evidence that the appellant had carried a white NTUC Fairprice plastic bag into the coffee-house. The officers who participated in the arrest and gave evidence were Inspector Gwee Hian Kwee, Senior Staff Sergeant Kong Sing Chiong, Staff Sergeant Soo Beng Hooi, Senior Narcotics Officer Adrian Tan Hock Chuan, Acting Chief Narcotics Officer Tay Soon Nghee and Narcotics Officers Thng Joo Seng and Shah Ni bin Shah Rom.
Inspector Gwee testified that he saw the appellant carrying a plastic bag on entering the coffee-house. However, under cross-examination, Inspector Gwee said that he could not remember what kind of bag he was carrying. Senior Staff Sergeant Kong in his evidence-in-chief said that he saw the appellant carrying a shopping plastic bag with a white background. Under cross-examination, he reiterated that it could not possibly be a white cloth bag.
Staff Sergeant Soo`s testimony was that the appellant carried a white plastic bag and he said during cross-examination that he could not remember if there were any markings on it but he was certain it was not a cloth bag. SNO Tan testified that he saw the appellant carrying a white plastic bag with red-blue prints on it. This was also the evidence of NO Thng. During cross-examination, SNO Tan said that it could not possibly be a white cloth bag. Ag CNO Tay was certain that he saw the appellant carry a white plastic bag. NO Shah said that he saw the appellant at the lobby of the hotel walking towards the coffee-house carrying a white plastic bag with red and blue markings.
 Defence case
The trial judge was satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellant that he delivered the plastic bag containing the four packets of drugs to NO Ng at the coffee-house. The appellant was called upon to enter on his defence and he elected to give evidence.
The appellant said that he worked as a hawker`s assistant and supplemented his income by selling duty-free cigarettes. He used to supply Mr Wee with duty-free cigarettes which he obtained from Malaysian Navy personnel. He had known Mr Wee since October 1990. On 1 March 1992, Mr Wee paged him and asked him to fetch him to the coffee-house to meet NO Ng. Mr Wee told him that NO Ng wanted Mr Wee to repair his boat as they were both in the boat business. The appellant said that he was not introduced to NO Ng at the coffee-house and he said that he did not participate in the discussions between Mr Wee and NO Ng as they were in English. He said that he left the coffee-house after a short while and waited for Mr Wee outside. He denied exchanging pager numbers with NO Ng and denied meeting him on 6 March 1992 at all.
The appellant testified that, on 26 March 1992 at about 5.30pm, Mr Wee paged for him and he was told by Mr Wee that NO Ng wanted five cartons of duty-free Salem cigarettes. He said that Mr Wee told him that NO Ng would be waiting outside Miramar Hotel between 6pm and 6.15pm. When he reached the hotel, he did not see NO Ng and he proceeded to the coffee-house. He did not recognize NO Ng until he waved at him. He had with him the five cartons of cigarettes which he had placed in a white cloth bag. They spoke in Hokkien and NO Ng asked him to put the bag, which he had earlier placed on the floor, on the table. Under cross-examination, the appellant had initially said that he did not speak to NO Ng at the coffee-house at all until his arrest but later retracted and admitted that he did speak a few words to him in Hokkien.
The appellant said that NO Ng wanted to take the cigarettes to the washroom to check and he asked NO Ng why there was any need to do so as there was nothing wrong with the duty-free cigarettes. He claimed that NO Ng took about five to six minutes before he reappeared and with a plastic bag and not his cloth bag.
 Findings of the trial court
The learned trial judge found that the prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence that the appellant had trafficked in the heroin contained in the plastic bag by delivering it to NO Ng at the coffee-house. In doing so, he accepted the entire evidence of NO Ng of the meeting on 6 March 1992. He found as a fact that the appellant carried the NTUC Fairprice plastic bag containing four pounds of heroin into the coffee-house. He also accepted NO Ng`s evidence that he took the bag into the washroom to verify that the contents were drugs, and he rejected the appellant`s contention that NO Ng spent five minutes in the washroom. He found the appellant to be not a credible witness and therefore his allegation that NO Ng planted the drugs to be incredible and unworthy of belief.
 Grounds of appeal
Mr Tan Teow Yeow, counsel for the appellant, contended before us that the learned trial judge had failed to treat the evidence of NO Ng, being an agent provocateur, with great circumspect especially as the only evidence of the contents of the bag before the appellant`s arrest was the oral evidence of NO Ng. In consequence, it was submitted by Mr Tan that the learned trial judge had failed to adequately consider the defence that NO Ng replaced the white cloth bag containing Salem cigarettes with the white plastic bag containing drugs. He contended that NO Ng had actively made all the necessary moves to ensure that the sale of the drugs was made to him and therefore he had a vested interest in securing the conviction of the appellant. He submitted that NO Ng was, accordingly, not an independent witness. He sought to highlight the absence of any consideration by the learned trial judge in his written grounds of decision of the fact that NO Ng was an agent provocateur, and therefore that the learned trial judge had failed to appreciate that the crucial evidence against the appellant came from the oral testimony of an enthusiastic undercover agent which should only be accepted after close scrutiny.
As to the position of agent provocateurs, such a defence is not provided anywhere in the Penal Code (Cap 224), and the law in Singapore is settled following the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
 How Poh Sun v PP 
, which followed the English position in 
 R v Sang 
, that the defence of entrapment is not available in Singapore. In 
 Sang 
, Lord Salmon said at p 443: 
 
... it is now well settled that the defence called entrapment does not exist in English law: 
 R v McEvilly
 60 Cr App R 150; 
 R v Mealey
 60 Cr App R 59. A man who intends to commit a crime and actually commits it is guilty of the offence whether or not he has been persuaded or induced to commit it, no matter by whom.
 
 
 
We recognize that there are inherent difficulties in the detection and proof of drug offences and a large number of drug enforcement operations in Singapore carried out by the CNB must necessarily involve the use of undercover agents. In such circumstances, it is unrealistic to raise objections to such entrapment measures per se which are undertaken by the CNB. In 
 How Poh Sun 
, we clearly held that it was not the province of the court to consider whether the CNB should have proceeded about its work in one way or the other. We are, therefore, of the opinion that there is no additional need to consider the evidence of a so-called agent provocateur with special caution over and above that of any other witness. It is clear from 
 Teja Singh v PP 
 (per Spenser-Wilkinson J):3 
 
... the credit of any witness depends on the facts of the case and not upon any particular label which is attached to him.
 
 
 
An agent provocateur is also not, at law, an accomplice and therefore his evidence should not be treated with caution as in the case of accomplices under s 116, illustration (b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed).
The learned trial judge here had ample opportunity to observe the witness and was clearly entitled to find that the evidence of NO Ng was reliable and to reject the defence of the appellant. In this context, the reasoning of Baggallay JA in 
 The Glannibanta 
, bears mention: 
 
Great weight is due to the decision of the judge of first instance whenever, in a conflict of testimony, the demeanour and manner of witnesses who have been seen and heard by him are material elements in the consideration of the truthfulness of these statements.
 
 
 
Having perused the verbatim notes of evidence, there was nothing in them to suggest to us that the evidence of NO Ng was unreliable. Instead, we found his testimony to be clear and consistent as to the events which took place from their first meeting on 6 March 1992 up to the arrest of the appellant on 26 March 1992. Although NO Ng was cross-examined robustly at the trial, his evidence remained unshaken and showed without doubt that there was a meeting on 6 March 1992 during which the appellant agreed to sell drugs to him, that the appellant agreed to deliver the drugs to him on 26 March 1992, and that the appellant did so deliver the drugs to him at the coffee-house. Further, there were strong corroborative evidence to support the fact that the appellant carried the `NTUC Fairprice` bag into the coffee-house from the testimony of no less than seven police and narcotics officers who took part in the arrest. We were left in no doubt that the learned trial judge was correct in accepting the evidence of NO Ng as to the first meeting on 6 March 1992 and of the events leading up to the appellant`s arrest.
 Delivery of an oral judgment and subsequent written grounds of decision
At the conclusion of the hearing on 29 September 1993, the trial judge delivered a brief oral judgment (of about 300 words in the verbatim record) which briefly summarized the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence, and included at the end the following passage: 
 
Having reviewed all the evidence tendered by the prosecution, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you did traffic in the quantity of diamorphine as charged. I do not believe your defence. It is incredible. I therefore find you guilty as charged and convict you accordingly.
 
 
 
After convicting and sentencing the appellant, the trial judge subsequently delivered on 13 December 1993 his detailed grounds of decision running to 13 pages in which he rehearsed the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence respectively, gave his reasons for not accepting the submission of defence counsel on the evidence of NO Ng and gave his reasons for disbelieving the appellant.
The decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya in 
 Ankur Nath Ganguli v PP 
, was cited by counsel as authority for the proposition that a court which has given its reasons for convicting an accused person is precluded from giving subsequent written grounds of decision. Counsel also cited s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) which reads: 
 
When a notice of appeal has been filed, the trial judge shall, if he has not already written his judgment, record in writing the grounds of his decision, and such written judgment or grounds of decision shall form part of the record of the proceedings.
 
 
 
This is in pari materia with s 21(1) of the Courts Ordinance 1948 of the Federation of Malaya which was the statutory provision in question in 
 Ankur Nath 
. In that case, Mathew CJ held at p 207: 
 
This means clearly that, if reasons for convicting an accused person have not been given and recorded, a trial judge may record in writing the grounds of his decision and those grounds shall form part of the record. In this case, the learned trial judge gave reasons for convicting the appellant, and his judgment was taken down by his secretary and was reduced to a written form. This not-too-happily phrased subsection means, in our view, that, if a trial judge gives no reasons which are recorded for convicting an accused person, then and then only he can, on notice of appeal being given, write his grounds of decision which shall form part of the record. The subsection permits only of a written judgment or grounds of decision being included in the record, and this must be either the one or the other, not both. We, therefore, hold that what has been termed an addition to the learned trial judge`s oral judgment cannot form part of the record, and we can have no regard to it.
 
 
 
All that this case decides is that under s 21(1) of the Courts Ordinance 1948, where a trial judge has given his reasons for convicting an accused, these reasons shall form part of the record, and where no such reasons have been given, the trial judge can, on notice of appeal being filed, write his grounds of decision which shall then form part of the record.
In the recent case of 
 Van Damme Johannes v PP 
, Rajendran J delivered an oral judgment (which was recorded) at the conclusion of the trial, during which he indicated that he would be reviewing the evidence in full in a written grounds of decision. In his oral judgment, he had set out in detail the prosecution and defence case and, significantly, his reasons for disbelieving the defence. He did not subsequently write the additional grounds of decision as he felt bound by s 46(1) (supra) and 
 Ankur Nath 
, that there cannot be subsequent grounds of decision following a judgment which has already been delivered.
Mr Tan for the appellant, therefore, contended before us, first, that the trial judge, having delivered an oral judgment on 29 September 1993 was precluded from subsequently delivering the written grounds of decision on 13 December 1993 and, therefore, the oral judgment must be considered to explain his reasons for convicting the appellant to the exclusion of the later written grounds of decision; and, secondly, following from this, that it was clear from the oral judgment that the defence case had not been adequately considered by the court. The trial judge had merely held that the appellant`s defence was incredible.
We note that 
 Ankur Nath 
, has been followed by the Malaysian Supreme Court in 
 Lorraine Phylis Cohen & Anor v PP 
. In 
 Lorraine 
, the trial judge signed and delivered a written judgment at the conclusion of the trial and, some 15 months later, purported to deliver a second written grounds of decision to supplement the first judgment. The Malaysian statutory provision in question there, s 52(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964, is in pari materia with s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and s 21(1) of the Courts Ordinance 1948. Lee Hun Hoe CJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, held at p 289F: 
 
Since there was already a written judgment, signed and delivered on 1 September 1987, no second written judgment or grounds of decision could be delivered subsequently to supplement the first judgment. We do not think it is competent for the learned judge to supplement the first judgment by delivering a second judgment or grounds of decision. This is clearly against fundamental principle as is normally understood.
 
 
 
Later, at p 289C, in adopting Mathew CJ`s judgment in 
 Ankur Nath 
, Lee Hun Hoe CJ said: 
 
We support the sentiments expressed therein since the said provision (s 21(1) of the Courts Ordinance 1948) is similar in substance to s 52(1) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964. We consider it wrong in principle to allow a judge to supplement his original judgment by a second judgment. If we allow this, what is there to prevent a third or fourth judgment to supplement an earlier judgment.
 
 
 
We agree with the propositions enunciated in 
 Ankur Nath 
 and 
 Lorraine Phylis Cohen 
. A judge cannot subsequently give his grounds of decision if he has already delivered a prior judgment at the conclusion of the trial which contains his reasons for convicting the accused. This principle does not affect the operation of s 218 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides that a judgment shall be explained to the accused. There cannot be any objection to a judge providing briefly at the conclusion of a trial an outline of the issues before him and the evidence on them, and to indicate briefly, without reasons, his findings on them. In such circumstances, there should be no objection if subsequent written grounds of decision are delivered in which the evidence is fully reviewed and the judge`s detailed reasons or grounds for his findings are comprehensively recorded.
On the facts of this case, we found this submission by counsel to be of no merit whatsoever. The trial judge had merely provided an oral summary of the evidence adduced at the trial, and had only indicated in a general sense that he disbelieved the appellant`s defence and that he found the prosecution to have proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In the context of this case, what the trial judge said in his oral statement did not amount to giving his reasons or grounds for convicting the appellant. We, therefore, disagreed with the contention that the trial judge was precluded from writing his grounds of decision and that we should disregard the grounds of decision. Even if the grounds of decision were excluded from the record, there was overwhelming evidence which amply justified the trial judge`s findings (which he made in his oral judgment) that the defence put up by the appellant was incredible and that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
For all the above reasons, we were of the view that there were no grounds for us to interfere with the trial judge`s findings. We accordingly dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed on the appellant.

 Brief facts
The construction of the building started in June 1969 and its certificate of fitness was obtained on 22 September 1972. As early as 1974, cracks started to appear in some sections of the building, but on Ng`s instructions these cracks were just patched over with cement. These cracks developed progressively until the building collapsed at 11.15am on 15 March 1986.
The material events which took place that morning, prior to the collapse of the building, were briefly as follows. At about 10am on 15 March 1986, Albert Sim and Cheong Cheng Guan, both bank officers of the appellants who were at the appellants` premises, heard a distant rumbling sound followed by a tremor. They also felt the building vibrate. They and the other staff of the appellants were shocked at first but as the disturbances lasted for only a few seconds, they continued with their work.
At 10.30am, Annie Quek @ Quek Ah Suan, a customer of the appellants, was on her way to the appellants` premises when she saw some cracks on a pillar in the ground floor car park of the building. The watchman of the building then told her to inform her employer who parked at the car park to remove his car from the car park. She further witnessed cement falling off the rear of the building and saw the cracks herself. Hence she proceeded to inform her managing director of the cracks.
Subsequently, she informed Albert Sim and Cheong Cheng Guan of the cracks on a pillar at the ground floor car park. On hearing that the pillar was cracked, Albert Sim was worried that his car might be hit by the cement that was falling off the pillar. He then left the appellants` premises, went to the rear of the building and shifted his car to the basement, thinking that the basement was a safer location.
Thereafter, Albert Sim told the appellants` branch manager, Albert Kan (a victim of the collapse), of the cracks and together they inspected the cracks on a pillar in the car park. After examining the cracks, Albert Kan felt that they posed no danger to his car.
In the meantime, the watchman and some other helpers, under the supervision of Ng, were seen by Albert Sim and Annie Quek putting up a wooden prop at the car park in an obvious attempt to remedy the cracks on the pillar.
At about 11.30am, the building collapsed. 33 persons died in this tragedy including the two deceased, Song and Sit who were at the appellants` premises when the building collapsed.
On 22 March 1986, a commission was issued by the President for an inquiry to be held to determine the cause of the collapse and to make recommendations for such appropriate measures that can be taken to prevent a similar occurrence. The Honourable LP Thean J (as he then was) was appointed the Chairman of the Commission of the Inquiry. The report was published in February 1987.
In 1989, the estates of the two deceased commenced actions for lost years, and their dependants for loss of dependency. Lian Yak Realty Co Pte Ltd and the estate of Ng admitted liability whereas the appellants disputed both liability and quantum. At the end of the two hearings, the learned judge found Lian Yak Realty Co Pte Ltd and the estate of Ng two thirds to blame and the appellants one third to blame. The estates of the two deceased and their dependants were also awarded costs of their actions: 40% was ordered to be borne by the appellants and 60% by Lian Yak Realty Co Pte Ltd and the estate of Ng. Against the learned judge`s decision on the apportionment of liability and the issue of costs, these two appeals have been brought.
At the end of hearing counsels` submissions, we allowed both appeals. We now give our reasons for so doing.
 Issues on appeal
The main issue in this appeal was whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the appellants were at all liable to their customers who were invitees. It was not disputed that the appellants had control of the premises and were occupiers of the ground floor premises at the building, and that the two deceased, customers of the appellants, were invitees of the appellants at the material time.
 The law on occupier`s liability for `invitees`
The law on occupiers` liability in Singapore is derived from English common law. However, legislation in England has been passed which has made significant changes to the common law. In Singapore, there is no such parallel legislation, and the English statutes on occupiers` liability are not applicable.
At common law, a person is an invitee if he is on private or public premises for a business purpose of material benefit to the occupier. This is usually referred to as a `common interest` as the invitee himself more often than not also has an economic interest in being on the premises. Bank customers such as Song and Sit at the material time were undoubtedly invitees on the bank`s premises and would have been there with the bank`s consent.
The duty owed by an occupier to an invitee is stated by Willes J in in the following terms: 
And with respect to such a visitor [invitee] at least, we consider it is settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as a matter of fact ... .
In short, the duty of an occupier to an invitee would be to prevent damage or injury from any 
 unusual dangers on the premises he knows or ought to know 
 and which the invitee 
 does not know about 
.
Thus, the appellants would only be liable to the estates of the two deceased and their dependants for their claims for lost years and loss of dependency respectively if:
(a) the appellants actually 
 knew or ought to have known 
 of the danger that caused the injury; 
(b) the danger was 
 unusual 
 to the two deceased, having regard to the nature of the place and their knowledge; 
(c) the danger was 
 unknown 
 to the two deceased and the significance not appreciated by them; and 
(d) the appellants had 
 failed to use reasonable care 
 to prevent damage from occurring, whether by notice, lighting, guarding or otherwise.
 Appellants` knowledge of the danger
Before us, the respondents conceded that the appellants had no actual knowledge of the danger of the building collapsing as a number of the appellants` employees were also victims of the disaster, including Albert Kan, their branch manager. However, they contended that the appellants ought to have known of the danger of the building collapsing. They submitted that the distant rumbling sound heard by the appellants` staff, the tremor and vibration felt, the cracks on the pillar, the description of cracks and falling concrete given by Annie Quek, were all warning signs that should have put the appellants on notice of the danger.
The appellants` counsel however pointed out that in 1986 no one would contemplate that a building, which had stood for more than ten years, would suddenly collapse. Moreover, unlike the owners of the building, the appellants were in the business of banking and possessed no skills or knowledge in the area of architectural design or structural safety of buildings.
The appellants further submitted that, on the facts of the case, they had no knowledge that the collapse of the building was imminent as they could not be expected to know the signs and symptoms of dangerous stresses to parts of the building that were outside their premises. Albert Sim in answer to certain questions during the Commission of Inquiry hearing had stated clearly that no cracks were ever present in the appellants` premises prior to the collapse.
 Appellants used reasonable care to prevent damage and injury
Before us, the respondents also submitted that the officers of the appellants had failed to use reasonable care to prevent injury to the two deceased. In fact, they claimed that the appellants` officers failed to do anything at all. The respondents further pointed out that all Albert Sim did after he was informed of the cracks on the pillar was to shift his car from the ground floor car park to the basement car park, and contentions were made that his sense of priority in preferring the safety of his car over the safety of the invitees of the appellants was a clear breach of the appellants` duty.
 Causation
On the issue of causation, the appellants relied on the report of the Commission of Inquiry which found that the building collapsed from causes which emanated from outside the appellants` premises. The relevant parts of the report stated: 
The cause of the collapse, in our opinion, had their origin more than 15 years ago when the structural design of the building was still on the drawing board ... The root and main cause of the collapse lies in the structural design of the building. This was so grossly inadequate that, in our opinion, it was a matter of time before the building would collapse ... from the evidence before us, it is our opinion that the collapse of the building probably commenced at columns 26 and 32 in the nightclub on the second floor and column 30 at the car park on the ground floor ... .
The appellants further submitted that their duty of care to their invitees extended only to areas within their control. Since the collapse originated from parts of the building that were not within their control, they contended that they owed no duty of care for such risk of injury or damage.
The respondents, on the other hand, submitted that since the premises of the appellants formed an integral part of the building, any danger to any other parts of the building would have affected their premises. As such, it did not matter where the collapse originated from.
 Findings
We now come to the issue whether the appellants ought to have known of the unusual dangers to the invitees and whether they had breached their duty of care by failing to take precautionary measures.
 Danger unusual to the two deceased
It seemed plain to us that the danger of the premises collapsing was a danger which was unusual to the two deceased. No bank customer is expected to guard against such dangers when he walks into the bank`s premises as an invitee.
 Knowledge of unusual dangers
On the question of knowledge, the learned judge stated that: 
In my view, having experienced the tremor, been made aware of the cracks in the pillar, Albert Kan as the manager and other officers should have at once evacuated every one in the bank. By their failure to do so without even giving any warning to the customers, [the appellants] were in breach of duty as occupiers to [the deceased] their invitee in respect of this danger of collapse of the building which they ought to have known ... .
It was not disputed that the appellants` officers and staff heard the distant rumbling, felt the tremor and vibration, and were aware of the cracks on the pillar in the ground floor car park. However, the evidence also revealed that the tremor and vibration lasted for only a few seconds and Albert Sim had also seen the managers of the building send men to remedy the cracks on the pillar.
Whilst we accepted that the distant rumbling, tremor and vibration felt and cracks on the pillar were signs of unusual danger, it was difficult in all the circumstances for the appellants to ascertain the extent of the unusual danger at that point in time. It must be pointed out that no debris was ever seen to be falling off the ceiling at the appellants` premises and none of the walls in the appellants` premises were cracked prior to the collapse.
With respect, we were unable to agree with the learned judge on the point on imputed knowledge. Before us, counsel for the appellants cited for the basic proposition that in assessing whether the appellants had breached their duty by risking the dangers that were known or ought to have been known to them, one must examine the dangers with the 
 state of knowledge 
 at the time.
Briefly the facts of the case were as follows. Two patients were operated in a hospital on the same day and a spinal anaesthetic, nupercaine, was injected into the spine of the patients. The nupercaine had been contained in sealed glass ampoules and stored in phenol. After the operation, both patients became paralysed from the waist down due to the phenol which had percolated into the ampoules through invisible cracks or molecular flaws. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the relevant standard of medical knowledge was the knowledge in existence in 1947 and found that neither the anaesthetist nor any member of the hospital staff had been negligent.
On p 83 of the judgment, Denning LJ stated: 
Doctors like the rest of us have to learn by experience; and experience often teaches in a hard way. Something goes wrong and shows up a weakness, and then it is put right. This is just what happened here. Dr Graham sought to escape the danger of infection by disinfecting the ampoule. In escaping the known danger he unfortunately ran into another danger. He did not know that there could be undetectable cracks, but it was not negligent for him not to know it at that time. 
 We must not look at the 1947 accident with 1954 spectacles
 ... . [Emphasis added.]
Although that case was one concerning medical negligence and had other policy considerations, we agreed that the officers of the appellants should only be imputed with the state of knowledge of a reasonable man in 1986. Until 1986, there had been no instance of a building in Singapore such as this, which after standing firm for more than ten years, suddenly collapsed like a pack of cards. After this incident and the recent collapse of the Highland Tower in Kuala Lumpur, the possibility of `high rise` buildings in Singapore collapsing is no longer as unimaginable as it was in 1986. Of course, whether each instance of a building collapsing in the future will give rise to liability would depend on the circumstances of the case.
 Precautionary measures
The next issue was what the appellants` officers had to do, after receiving the warning signs. The learned trial judge stated in his judgment that they should have evacuated everyone in the bank and on appeal, the respondents adopted the same stand.
On receiving the information, Albert Kan proceeded to examine the cracked pillar. One must not forget that he was a lay person with no civil engineering expertise. In concluding that his car was not in danger from the falling debris, he must have also felt that no one would be injured as a result of these cracks. The possibility of the building collapsing was just not contemplated by him. Moreover, Albert Sim and Annie Quek had seen Ng supervising some workmen to remedy the cracks. To the staff and officers of the appellants, this must have been sufficient to put their minds at ease.
Thus, it was our view that the officers of the appellants had taken the necessary measures by checking on the cracked pillar and leaving the work of remedying it to the building`s management.
Based on the circumstances at the material time, we were of the view that Albert Kan had not acted unreasonably by not evacuating the customers of the appellants. He had considered the possible dangers but had reasonably concluded that the dangers were not sufficiently imminent to necessitate an evacuation of the appellants` premises.
It was unfortunate that Albert Kan became a victim of the collapse. The appellants have relied on this and contended that he must have considered the safety of those at the appellants` premises and had not foreseen the collapse of the building. The respondents on the other hand pointed out that Ng Khong Lim, the managing director of Lian Yak Realty Co Pte Ltd, had himself died while trying to remedy the cracked pillar but his being a victim of the collapse did not affect his liability in negligence.
In our view, this analogy drawn by the respondents` counsel was misconceived. Ng was the managing director of the landlords and managers of the building. Moreover, he had also chosen to merely patch up the cracks that surfaced as early as 1974 without making the necessary investigations or examinations. The standard of care and knowledge imputed on Ng, as a person who was entrusted with the management of the building, was much higher than that expected of Albert Kan, as the branch manager of a bank.
 Conclusion
We were thus of the view that the appellants would not have known of the possibility of the building collapsing in 1986. On the facts, the precautionary measures taken by the appellants, through Albert Kan and Albert Sim, were also adequate. Accordingly, we allowed the appeals on the issue of liability with costs. The liability is thus to be borne equally by Lian Yak Realty Co Pte Ltd and the estate of Ng Khong Lim.
On the issue of costs, in CA 95/94, we ordered that the costs here and below of the appellants were to be borne equally between the first and second respondents on one part and the third and fourth respondents on the other. In CA 96 of 1994, we ordered the costs here and below of the appellants to be borne equally between the first, second and third respondents on one part and the fourth and fifth respondents on the other.

This was an appeal brought by the appellants against their convictions in the district court for being in possession of publications published by the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society (WTBTS), which are prohibited by gazette notification No 123 dated 14 January 1972 (Order 123), made pursuant to s 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 358) (the UPA). The appellants were convicted under s 4(2) of the UPA. Fines of $800, $500, $500 and $700 were imposed on the four appellants respectively. A fifth accused who was jointly tried with the appellants was acquitted. After hearing the submissions of counsel for both parties, I dismissed the appeal. I now set out my reasons.
The facts were largely undisputed. On 2 July 1992, a team of police officers seized a total of 173 booklets, including those which formed the subject-matter of the charges in the district court, from the five accused persons in and around Blk 12, Marsiling Drive. These publications were sent to the Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA). A subsequent report from the Controller, Undesirable Publications, identified 13 publications which were prohibited under s 3 of the UPA. Not all of these publications were published solely by WTBTS. Several were published jointly by WTBTS and an organization known as the International Bible Students Association (IBSA) whereas some were published solely by IBSA. In the court below, the district judge held that the publications published solely by IBSA were not within the scope of Order 123 although they were identical with some of those published by WTBTS. The charges against the accused persons were accordingly amended and, as a result, the fifth accused was acquitted. This finding was not in issue in the appeal.
The appellants were adherents of the sect known as the Jehovah`s Witnesses. The Jehovah`s Witnesses have little or no association with other Christian denominations. Theologically, they differ from orthodox Christianity in many respects. The most controversial aspect of the Jehovah`s Witnesses` doctrine is their belief that `Satan is the God of this world`. They maintain a complete separation from governments and regard world powers and political parties as the unwitting allies of Satan (see 
 The New Encyclopedia Britannica 
 Vol 6, p 525). As a result, Jehovah`s Witnesses refuse to salute the flag of any nation or perform any form of national service or participate in public elections. It was on this aspect that on 14 January 1972 the Singapore Government de-registered the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah`s Witnesses. In a press statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs, it was stated that: 
 
... its [the Jehovah`s Witnesses] continued existence is prejudicial to public welfare and good order in Singapore. The doctrine of the sect and nature of its propaganda are based on its claim that Satan and its dispensation are responsible for all organized Government and religion. The result of the impending `Armageddon` will be the destruction of everyone except Jehovah`s Witnesses who will inherit the earth. By virtue of this doctrine the sect claims a neutral position for its members in wartime. This has led to a number of Jehovah`s Witnesses in the National Service to refuse to do any military duty. Some of them even refuse to wear uniforms.
 
 
 
The dissolution of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah`s Witnesses as a society was ordered by the Minister for Home Affairs pursuant to his powers under s 24(1) of the Societies Act (Cap 311) and via gazette notification No 179 (Order 179). At the same time, the Minister for Culture (now MITA) by Order 123 banned all publications by WTBTS, the parent body of the Jehovah`s Witnesses, pursuant to his powers under the UPA.
In the trial below, the accused persons elected to remain silent when they were called upon for their defence. Instead, they called one Francis Wan (DW1), a self-professed Jehovah`s Witness for 24 years who had known the five accused persons for several years, as a defence witness. Wan disagreed with the press statement and said that it was not part of the claim of the Jehovah`s Witnesses that all governments act for Satan. According to Wan, the Jehovah`s Witnesses `did not foment rebellion or resistance to the police and are willing to submit to the laws of the land`. He denied that the Jehovah`s Witnesses preached that national service should not be undertaken by their adherents and that they, in fact, advocated an official policy to tell persons not to break the law. His `qualifications` as an expert witness, outlined in a `confidential professional profile`, were not challenged by the prosecution. It seemed to me however that his evidence had to be treated with caution as, for reasons which will be addressed below, this aspect of the doctrine of the Jehovah`s Witnesses appeared to be of great significance.
The appellants did not dispute that they were caught in possession of the prohibited publications. Instead, they raised before me through their counsel the same issues which were canvassed before the district judge. At the commencement of the trial below, the following issues were raised by way of a preliminary objection: 
 
 
(1) whether Order 123 was ultra vires the UPA; and 
 
(2) whether Order 123 was ultra vires art 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.
  
 
 
Suffice it to say for now that the district judge dismissed these preliminary objections. An additional ground was contended before me at the hearing of this appeal. The appellants also sought to declare that Order 179 was ultra vires and unconstitutional. The two orders were alleged to have unlawfully denied the appellants and other Jehovah`s Witnesses the free exercise of their religious liberty as guaranteed under the Constitution. Further, the appellants contended that the two orders were null and unenforceable as having been promulgated arbitrarily and by a denial of natural justice, without notice or hearing, on secret evidence wholly irrelevant to the public interest. The appellants also claimed that the official statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs was inaccurate and misleading, and that no opportunity was given to respond to it.
A crucial aspect of this case was the fact that the lower court was a subordinate court and this court was of course now sitting as an appellate court. The jurisdiction of the district court was limited, as there was no provision in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) which was equivalent to para 1 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA) which conferred upon the High Court the power of judicial review. As such, the district court could not have determined the constitutional issues raised.
The position in Singapore is unique. It is provided in the recently enacted s 56A(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act that a proceeding can be stayed for reference of questions on the Constitution to the High Court when the subordinate court is faced with such issues. Section 56A reads: 
 
 
(1) Where in any proceedings in a subordinate court a question arises as to the interpretation or effect of any provision of the Constitution, the court hearing the proceedings may stay the proceedings on such terms as may be just to await the decision of the question on the reference to the High Court. 
 
(2) An order staying proceedings under this section may be made by the court of its own motion or on the application of any party and shall be made at such stage of the proceedings as the court may see fit having regard to the decision of such questions of fact as may be necessary to be settled to assist the High Court in deciding the question which has arisen and to the speedy and economical final determination of the proceedings. 
 
(3) Where an order for stay of proceedings has been made under this section, the court shall state the question which in its opinion has arisen as to the interpretation or effect of the Constitution in the form of a special case which so far as may be possible shall state the question in a form which shall permit of an answer being given in the affirmative or the negative. 
 
(4) The court shall cause the special case to be transferred to the High Court and the High Court shall hear and determine the constitutional question arising out of the case in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. 
 
(5) Notice of the hearing of the special case by the High Court under this section shall be given to the Attorney-General who shall have a right to be heard.
  
 
 
The issues raised in this case clearly fell within the scope of this provision. Unfortunately, the district judge did not make such a reference to the High Court as he ought to have done. However, there was no error in law on his part as the wording of s 56A implies that any such reference is at the discretion of the court and is not mandatory. The purpose of this discretion is simple. It is to prevent unnecessary stays of proceeding each time a party purports to raise a constitutional issue. The merits of the case can then be considered by the district judge before deciding whether such a reference ought to be made to the High Court.
In any event, the district judge ruled that he had no jurisdiction to review the exercise of discretion by the minister. However, he held that the accused persons were entitled to raise as a defence the validity of Order 123 and that the court was entitled to rule on whether there was a patent invalidity in that order, in the sense that it was ultra vires its parent Act. This was limited to the examination of the wording of the provisions and no more. Anything over and above this amounted to an exercise of the powers of judicial review. The district judge proceeded to rule that there was no patent invalidity in Order 123. He did not find anything in the wording of the order to suggest that it was ultra vires s 3(1) of the UPA, and that, by virtue of s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), he was entitled to presume that the minister had regularly exercised the powers conferred on him by s 3(1). He further ruled that Order 123 was not ultra vires the Constitution, as the order which was made under s 3(1) concerned the safeguarding of public interest and was within the scope of s 3(1) of the Act. Although no authorities were cited by the district judge, his findings with respect to the scope of his powers in dealing with the issues raised before him were clearly correct.
Mr How accepted that the district judge was correct in his preliminary rulings. However, he contended that this court had the unlimited jurisdiction to determine all the issues which he raised as it was possessed of the necessary powers under art 93 of the Constitution and s 18 and para 1 of the First Schedule to the SCJA. Section 18 reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) The High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in Singapore. 
 
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule. 
 
(3) The powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in accordance with any written law or Rules of Court relating to them.
  
 
 
Paragraph 1 of the First Schedule referred to above is in the following terms: 
 
Power to issue to any person or authority directions, orders or writs, including writs of the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any others, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by any written law or for any purpose.
 
 
 
Quite clearly, the High Court has the powers of judicial review as outlined. However, Mr How`s submissions were too simplistic. They overlooked the fundamental basis of these proceedings before me. These proceedings, as noted above, were conducted in the court`s appellate jurisdiction. As such, this court`s powers were necessarily limited to that of the subordinate court from which the appeal emanated (
 PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny 
). I think it is useful to highlight some of the observations of the Court of Appeal in that case, at p 889: 
 
Mudholkar J in delivering the judgment of the (Indian) Supreme Court (in 
 Jagat Bahadur v State of Madhya Pradesh
 AIR [1966] SC 945) quoted with approval from the judgment in 
 Sitaram v Emperor
 [1911] 7 Nag LR 109 also reported in 11 Ind Cas 788 the following:
 
 
 
`Nevertheless, it is a rule underlying the whole fabric of appellate jurisdiction that the power of an appellate court is measured by the power of the court from whose judgment or order the appeal before it has been made ... It is a fundamental principle that every Court of Appeal exists for the purpose, where necessary, of doing, or causing to be done, that which each court subordinate to its appellate jurisdiction should have, but has not, done, or caused to be done, and nothing further. Therefore, the jurisdiction in appeal is necessarily limited in each case to the same extent as the jurisdiction from which that particular case comes. It is a proposition which cannot be disputed that all powers conferred upon an appellate court, as such, must be interpreted as subject to the general rule above stated.`
 
 
 
And from 
 Muthiah v Emperor
 [1906] ILR 29 Mad 190, the following:
 
 
 
`We think that the power given to an appellate court ... is not an unlimited power to make such an order in any circumstances, but is to be taken as giving the appellate court power to do only that which the lower court could and should have done.`
 
 
 
And concluded: 
 
`An appeal court is after all `a court of error`, that is, a court established for correcting an error. If, while purporting to correct an error, the court were to do something which was beyond the competence of the trying court, how could it be said to be correcting an error of the trying court.`
 
 
 
We entirely approve of the submissions made by counsel and the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in 
 Jagat Bahadur v State of Madhya Pradesh
.
 
 
 
The issues which the appellants contended before me were essentially matters which in my view ought to have been properly adjudicated and determined in proceedings before the High Court for judicial review under Order 53. In view of the fact however that this court was exercising its appellate jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding, and bearing in mind the limitations of the lower court, I had to consider whether this court was precluded from considering all these issues. Here, the relevant minister`s order was not directly challenged by the application of a prerogative writ but instead arose in criminal proceedings where the validity of the respective orders was raised as a defence. It was on this basis that Mr Bala Reddy, the deputy public prosecutor, conceded that this court had the power to hear and determine the constitutional issues raised before it. He submitted that, notwithstanding the remedy of judicial review, it was always open to the defence in criminal proceedings to raise the issue that a ministerial order was ultra vires. The net effect of s 18 and para 1 of the First Schedule to the SCJA did not preclude this right but in fact conferred jurisdiction on this court. He further contended that the High Court had such power under its supervisory jurisdiction over the subordinate courts. This power of revision was contained in s 23 of the SCJA: 
 
The High Court may exercise powers of revision in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure.
 
 
 
Mr Reddy referred to s 268(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), being the relevant written law, which reads as follows: 
 
The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
 
 
 
Section 256 of course refers to the powers of the High Court exercisable in an appeal from a subordinate court.
At the same time, Mr Reddy sought to distinguish 
 Lee Meow Sim Jenny 
 on the basis that it was a criminal reference which dealt with a narrow and restrictively worded question: 
 
Whether the High Court, in exercising its jurisdiction in an appeal as to sentence, has the power to enhance the sentence beyond the limit of the power of the subordinate court which imposed the sentence.
 
 
 
He contended that the decision there only dealt with the limitation of the powers of an appeal court to enhance sentences and no more. As such, he submitted before me that 
 Lee Meow Sim Jenny 
 was not relevant here. In summary, his submissions were to the effect that it was in the interests of justice that the issues raised by the appellants should be determined in this proceeding once and for all, and not be constrained by such procedural technicalities.
Be that as it may, both parties did not provide me with any substantive legal propositions to support their contentions that this court has an unlimited jurisdiction. In this context, the general principles referred to in 
 Lee Meow Sim Jenny 
1are equally applicable here. Undoubtedly, ss 18 and 23 and the First Schedule to the SCJA set out the general powers of the High Court. However, it is one thing to say that the court has a specific power and another to imply that the court can exercise that power in every proceeding brought before it. This is especially so when issues of public law rights are raised.
There is no local case law directly on point. In the court below, 
 PP v MM Pillay 
 was cited by the appellants. It is useful to examine the facts. The defendant was charged with contravention of r 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975 (viz entering into the restricted zone without an area licence). It was alleged that the rules were ultra vires s 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276), in the sense that it did not confer any power on the minister to make rules to prohibit, except upon payment of a fee, cars from using any road. The magistrate accepted the contention and acquitted the defendant. In doing so, he was of the view that there was no statutory provision which prohibited a subordinate court from considering the validity of subsidiary legislation in the course of a criminal proceeding. The learned Chief Justice allowed the appeal by the prosecution. He did not consider the magistrate to have acted wrongly in assuming that he had jurisdiction to rule that the rules were ultra vires. Instead, he held that the magistrate had erred in interpreting the words of the enabling Act. He was of the view that the rules were enacted to regulate traffic into and within the restricted zone and that their purpose was not to collect fees. The imposition of a fee was merely the means adopted to achieve the purpose of the Act and was incidental to it. In my opinion, 
 PP v MM Pillay 
 is not a strong authority for the purpose of the appeal before this court. On the facts in that case, the challenge to the subsidiary legislation was not with respect to the exercise of a minister`s discretionary power. In the circumstances, it would be desirable to embark upon an examination of the English authorities.
In England, until the alteration to O 53 of the Rules of Supreme Court and the enactment of s 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, it was always assumed that a court could decide on the validity of subsidiary legislation when raised as an issue, without proceeding to judicial review (
 R v Rose, ex p Mary Wood 
, 
 Kruse v Johnson 
). However, in the landmark decision of 
 O`Reilly v Mackman 
, Lord Diplock, delivering the unanimous judgment of the House of Lords, held at p 285 that it would: 
 
... as a general rule be contrary to public policy, and as such an abuse of the process of the court, to permit a person seeking to establish that a decision of a public authority infringed rights to which he was entitled to protection under public law to proceed by way of an ordinary action and by this means to evade the provisions of [RSC] O 53 for the protection of such authorities.
 
 
 
However, in the next paragraph, he noted: 
 
... I have described this as a general rule; for though it may normally be appropriate to apply it by the summary process of striking out the action, there may be exceptions, particularly where the invalidity of the decision arises as a collateral issue in a claim for infringement of a right of the plaintiff arising under private law, or where none of the parties objects to the adoption of the procedure by writ or originating summons.
 
 
 
Despite Lord Diplock`s observations, uncertainty arose as to the extent to which 
 O`Reilly v Mackman 
 affected the traditional position on collateral challenge. In 
 Wandsworth London Borough Council v Winder 
, the House of Lords held that 
 O`Reilly 
 did not extend to the situation where ultra vires was raised as a substantive defence in civil proceedings. It was decided that the validity of a decision of a local authority could be raised as a defence to an action for breach of contract. Wandsworth LBC had instituted civil proceedings for an order of possession and rent, and for non-payment by the defendant of rent, which was increased by the authority`s exercise of statutory powers. The defendant was held to be entitled to raise the contention that the authority`s decision to increase the rent was ultra vires. Lord Fraser observed at p 509 that: 
 
It would ... be a very strange use of language to describe the [tenant`s] behaviour in relation to this litigation as an abuse or misuse by him of the process of the court. He did not select the procedure to be adopted. He is merely seeking to defend proceedings brought against him by the appellants. In so doing he is seeking only to exercise the ordinary right of any individual to defend an action against him ...
 
 
 
The position for civil proceedings was therefore settled. Uncertainty remained with respect to criminal proceedings until recently. In 
 Quietlynn Ltd v Plymouth City Council 
, the defendant company was convicted in the magistrates` courts of operating a sex shop without licence by the local authority. The company argued that its application for a licence was refused in circumstances which rendered the refusal ultra vires. This was raised as a defence to the prosecution before the magistrates. The divisional court was asked in effect whether on a prosecution, the magistrates` court had jurisdiction to `investigate and determine the validity of the licensing authority`s decision`, and it was held that it did not. The court held that 
 O`Reilly v Mackman 
applied. Webster J in delivering the judgment of the court observed at p 131 that: 
 
It has, of course, long been the practice for justices to decide for the purposes of a case immediately before them upon the validity of bye-laws ... But those practices were established long before applications for judicial review were given statutory recognition in s 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981. The law relating to judicial review has become increasingly more sophisticated in the past few decades, and in our view justices are not expected to have to assume the functions of the divisional court and consider the validity of decisions made by a local authority under this Act in the light of what is now a complex body of law. If a bona fide challenge to the validity of the decision in question is raised before them, then the proceedings should be adjourned to enable an application for judicial review to be made and determined. In our view, therefore, except in the case of a decision which is invalid on its face, every decision of the licensing authority under the Act is to be presumed to have been validly made and to continue in force unless and until it has been struck down by the High Court; and neither the justices nor a Crown Court have power to investigate or decide upon its validity.
 
 
 
The exception of invalidity on its face was derived by the court from the House of Lords decision in 
 DPP v Head 
. The court did not only invoke considerations of the competence of the court but also took into account matters of consistency and legal certainty. There was a concern that the issue in question might arise in different proceedings in a different court and that the other court might reach a different conclusion. The court observed that a ruling on whether an act was ultra vires is `binding in no other case and it could not be suggested that justices or the Crown Court are a competent authority to strike down [an official] decision in the sense of declaring it invalid for all purposes`.
On the other end of the scale is the competing interest of ensuring that all issues properly arising in a particular proceeding are decided and settled in that proceeding. The divisional court reverted back to the traditional view in 
 R v Reading Crown Court, ex p Hutchinson 
. Lloyd J disapproved of 
 Quietlynn 
 in so far as the judgment called into question the jurisdiction of magistrates to inquire into the validity of a bye-law when such invalidity was raised by the defendant as a defence and applied 
 Winder 
 instead. Such a jurisdiction did exist and it was not an abuse of the process of the court to raise such issues by way of a defence as the process was instituted by the prosecution and not by the defendant. Initially, 
 Quietlynn 
 was thought of as having confined 
 Winder 
 to cases where a defendant was complaining of the infringement of a private law right. However, Lloyd J at p 395 noted: 
 
I find it hard to follow the distinction between civil and criminal proceedings in this context. If the validity of a decision of a local authority is an essential element in the proof of the crime alleged, then I can see no reason why it should not be challenged in the magistrates` court or the Crown Court as the case may be.
 
 
 
Further, Lloyd J was of the view that it could not be possible to distinguish 
 Quietlynn 
 on the grounds that it involved a challenge to an individual administrative decision whereas 
 ex p Hutchinson 
 involved a challenge to a bye-law. Significantly, Mann J who also sat in 
 Quietlynn 
 agreed with Lloyd J and considered that the result in 
 Quietlynn 
was correct but that he did not consider that case to be applicable to a challenge to bye-laws. Support for 
 ex p Hutchinson 
 was provided by a separate divisional court in 
 R v Oxford Crown Court, ex p Smith 
.
The conflicting decisions seem to have been finally determined by the divisional court in the recent case of 
 Bugg v DPP 
. Woolf LJ identified two situations in which a defendant charged with the breach of a bye-law seeks to challenge the validity of that bye-law: 
 
The first is where the bye-law is on its face invalid because either it is without the power pursuant to which it was made because, for example, it seeks to deal with matters outside the scope of the enabling legislation, or it is patently unreasonable. This can be described as substantive invalidity.
 
 
 
The second situation is where there is what can be described as procedural invalidity because there has been non-compliance with a procedural requirement with regard to the making of that bye-law. This can be due to the manner in which the bye-law was made; for example, if there was a failure to consult. When the bye-law itself is alleged to be substantively invalid because of 
 Wednesbury 
 unreasonableness (
 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp 
 
[1948] 1 KB 223
), for present purposes what has to be attacked is not the decision to make the bye-law but the bye-law itself. That decision would have to be the subject of judicial review. In the criminal proceeding what has to be established is that the bye-law is unreasonable in the way in which it operates.
As can be seen, substantive invalidity has been given a narrow meaning. After reviewing the authorities, including 
 Quietlynn 
 and 
 ex p Hutchinson 
, Woolf LJ held that a criminal court has jurisdiction to consider a defence alleging that a bye-law is substantially invalid but cannot consider whether the bye-law is procedurally invalid. A bye-law can therefore only be challenged if it is ultra vires its enabling Act or is invalid on the face of it. Any challenge to the exercise of the discretion, as noted in the last part of the passage above, should be properly brought by judicial review. At p 652, Woolf LJ held: 
 
So far as procedural invalidity is concerned, the proper approach is to regard bye-laws and other subordinate legislation as valid until they are set aside by the appropriate court with the jurisdiction to do so. A member of the public is required to comply with bye-laws even if he believes they have a procedural defect unless and until the law is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. If before this happens he contravenes the bye-law, he commits an offence and can be punished. Where the law is substantively invalid, the position is different. No citizen is required to comply with a law which is bad on its face. If the citizen is satisfied that that is the situation, he is entitled to ignore the law.
 
 
 
Woolf LJ offered two explanations for the distinction. First, a criminal court cannot inquire into allegations of procedural invalidity because it is not part of its jurisdiction to do so and a criminal court is not properly equipped to carry out the necessary investigation. Secondly, the evidence with respect to a particular allegation of procedural invalidity is highly significant and may result in differing outcomes in different proceedings whereas there is no need for evidence to establish substantive invalidity.
There is no provision in England similar to our s 56A. The English position can therefore be distinguished in this respect. However, in the context of this case, I am of the view that the English principles are relevant. Section 56A can be read as being confined to constitutional issues alone. The issues raised here include challenges to the validity of orders on the basis that they are ultra vires. Ultra vires issues are not necessarily issues arising out of or with respect to an interpretation of the Constitution and therefore cannot be referred to the High Court under s 56A. As I have stated earlier, the district judge`s ruling on these preliminary issues was correct. I would add however that it should also be subject to the refinement enunciated by Woolf LJ in 
 Bugg v DPP 
. It is clearly not proper to raise ultra vires issues which extend beyond substantive validity, in the sense of being clearly wrong on the face of it, in subordinate court proceedings.
Having considered the relevant principles, I had to still take into account the fact that both parties were in fact ad idem with each other as to this court`s competence in determining all the issues raised. I think that this is an appropriate case for the application of Lord Diplock`s second exception in 
 O`Reilly v Mackman 
.5 Neither party has objected. Most significantly, the public prosecutor has considered that the issues here were of such considerable importance that they outweighed other considerations. The facts of this case are undoubtedly exceptional. I am of the view that in the interests of justice and in consideration of the fact that the invalidity of the orders, if proved, would constitute substantive defences to the charges, this court, despite sitting as an appellate court in a criminal proceeding, is competent to address itself to all the issues. As I have stated, this is an exceptional case and does not do damage to the principles already considered above.
 Appellant`s motion
Prior to the hearing of the appeal proper, I heard two criminal motions, from both the appellants and the public prosecutor. Mr How submitted that if the orders were proved to be invalid, this would be a complete defence to the charges laid. According to him, it was in the interest of justice for the court to make a decision on such questions of law of public and constitutional importance based on the most complete evidence before it. The appellants thus applied by criminal motion for various orders seeking leave to adduce additional evidence (Criminal Motion No 16 of 1994). These orders were generally for: 
 
 
(1) an order under s 257(1) of the CPC that counsel for the appellants be at liberty upon hearing of the appeal to adduce and read the additional evidence set out in the motion; 
 
(2) an order under s 58 of the CPC directing: 
 
(a) the production of the files and documents of the respective ministries in making Orders 123 & 179; 
 
(b) a full response from the respective ministries to interrogatories which the appellants intend to send with respect to the making of Orders 123 and 179; 
 
(3) an order permitting counsel for the appellants to call an expert witness to give evidence, either viva voce or by affidavit, of the beliefs and practices of the Jehovah`s Witnesses for the purpose of correcting alleged misstatements relied upon by the Minister for Home Affairs in making Order 179.
  
 
 
The additional evidence referred to in (i) were mainly publications and articles relating to the Jehovah`s Witnesses and were in fact prohibited publications by way of Order 123 and s 3(1) of the UPA. The appellants` purpose in adducing all the additional evidence was to establish their contention that the doctrines of the Jehovah`s Witnesses were not against the public interest and that Orders 123 and 179 were therefore ultra vires the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion.
Section 257(1) dictates that any additional evidence may only be adduced if it is necessary and, I repeat what I have previously held in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
, that means `necessary in the interests of justice`. The relevant principles governing the grant of leave to adduce additional evidence were also set out in 
 Juma`at 
 at p 343: 
 
The question is whether the above evidence is `necessary`. Certain principles are to be applied in determining this question and these were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Rajendra Prasad v PP
 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 1
 . The court held that in applying s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA), which is materially similar to s 257(1) of the CPC, the principles encapsulated in the following statement from Denning LJ`s judgment in 
 Ladd v Marshall
 should be observed:
 
 
 
`In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence for a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: first it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.`
 
 
 
These three conditions - non-availability, relevance and reliability - are, of course, similar to those enunciated by Lord Parker CJ in 
 R v Parks
 [1961] 3 All ER 633 and which have been time and again affirmed in the Singapore and Malaysian courts: 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP, Lo Fat Thjan v PP, Khamis v PP, Che Din bin Ahmad v PP, Dol bin Lasim v PP
.
 
 
 
In short, the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited.
Mr How had contended before me that, as the court below did not have the jurisdiction to consider all the issues fully, such evidence was therefore not of relevance there. As such, it could not also have been obtained at the trial. In this appeal, in relation to the validity of the respective orders, the main purpose of adducing the additional evidence was to show that the Jehovah`s Witnesses were a respectable religious group whose fundamental tenets could not have been in any sense objectionable and contrary to public order and the public interest. Having heard counsel`s submissions on this, it must be pointed out that there had never been a suggestion that the adherents of Jehovah`s Witnesses were not otherwise law-abiding citizens. The contention that they were respectable citizens was not in dispute either. The issue at hand was simply their belief which prohibits any form of military or national service, which is a fundamental tenet in Singapore. Anything which detracts from this should not and cannot be upheld. In the course of listening to submissions, it was evident to me that Mr How was wholly unfamiliar with the context of the society in Singapore and was inevitably handicapped in his submissions under the circumstances.
I did not find the conditions as stated in 
 Juma`at bin Samad 
 to be satisfied here and accordingly dismissed the appellants` motion. I could not see the relevance of the publications and articles which the appellants sought to adduce with respect to this appeal. Such evidence was unnecessary and would only prolong the hearing to no purpose. For the same reasons, this would include the expert evidence on the beliefs and practices of the Jehovah`s Witnesses which was sought to be adduced. This evidence was directed essentially towards the same contention that they were respectable, peace-loving individuals, whose good faith and bona fides were not disputed by the court. On the other hand, the bone of contention was simply their refusal to do national service.
As for the production of files and documents of the respective ministries, Mr How made a broad submission that the interests of justice required that the court inspect such documents to see whether they were relevant and whether the suppositions in which the respective ministers had proceeded upon were founded on fact. In my view, this could not be allowed unless the prohibition under ss 125 and 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) was surmounted. The relevant provisions are in the following terms: 
 
 
(125) No one shall be permitted to produce any unpublished official records relating to affairs of State, or to give any evidence derived therefrom, except with the permission of the officer at the head of the Department concerned, who shall give or withhold such permission as he thinks fit, subject, however, to the control of the President. 
 
(126) No public officer shall be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence when he considers that the public interests would suffer by the disclosure.
  
 
 
Although the court has wide powers under s 58, this clearly did not affect the substantive provisions of ss 125 and 126. Mr Reddy cited to me, and I quote with approval, the maxim 
 `salus populi est suprema lex` 
, ie the safety of the people is the supreme law. Having heard the submissions of both counsel, I was not convinced, even apart from ss 125 and 126, that the public interest dictated that such documents be produced before this court. The importance of preserving the confidentiality of state papers need not be stressed. As such, the appellants` application for such papers was dismissed.
As for the response to interrogatories, there is no legal provision in Singapore with respect to criminal proceedings which allows either the prosecution or the defence to obtain evidence from the opposite party by such means. Save for the bland submission that it was in the interest of justice, Mr How failed to indicate to me any legal basis for the making of such orders. Further, it seemed to be obvious that the only response the appellants would get from such interrogatories would simply be the statement that the de-registration and prohibition orders were based on the Jehovah`s Witnesses` refusal to do national service.
 Respondent`s motion
I shall now deal with the prosecution`s criminal motion (Criminal Motion No 19 of 1994). By it, they sought to adduce additional evidence by way of the affidavits of the following: 
 
 
(1) Peter Chan Jer Hing, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
 
(2) Goh Kim Leong, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Information and the Arts. 
 
(3) Lieutenant-Colonel Lim Theam Poh, Assistant Director of Manpower of the Ministry of Defence. 
 
(4) Lee Kee Yong, Director of Personnel, Ministry of Education.
  
 
 
Mr Reddy submitted that, as the appellants were raising the invalidity of the ministerial orders as a defence, it was necessary and relevant to have before the court the above additional evidence, which would enable the court to inquire fully into the challenges raised. He adopted the contention of the appellants that, as the court below could not determine all the issues, the evidence was therefore unavailable then. He further contended that no prejudice would be suffered by the appellants in admitting them. Upon an examination of the contents of the various affidavits, it appeared to me that, to a certain extent, they in fact amounted to what was sought by the appellants in their motion, primarily, the explanations and reasons for the making of the respective orders. In the circumstances, I found that they were relevant to the issues in the appeal and I could not see any objection to admitting this additional evidence. The motion was accordingly granted.
Prior to the hearing of the appeal, Mr How had applied to cross-examine the deponents of the affidavits. He contended that the affidavits contained broad allegations based on mere speculation and were without any factual basis. He claimed that he ought to have a right to question them and that the evidence should not be admitted on its own.
It is settled law that cross-examination on such affidavits is never allowed in judicial review proceedings. Although the proceeding at hand here was not strictly a judicial review, this rule was clearly applicable as this court was essentially exercising the same powers. In 
 O`Reilly v Mackman 
, Lord Diplock observed at p 282: 
 
It may well be that for the reasons given by Lord Denning MR in 
 George v Secretary of State for the Environment
 (1979) 77 LGR 689, it will only be upon rare occasions that the interests of justice will require that leave be given for cross-examination of deponents on their affidavits in applications for judicial review. This is because of the nature of the issues that normally arise upon judicial review. The facts, except where the claim that a decision was invalid on the ground that a statutory tribunal or public authority that made the decision failed to comply with the procedure prescribed by the legislation under which it was acting or failed to observe the fundamental rules of natural justice or fairness, can seldom be a matter of relevant dispute upon an application for judicial review, since the tribunal or authority`s findings of fact, as distinguished from the legal consequences of the facts that they have found, are not open to review by the court in the exercise of its supervisory powers except on the principles laid down in 
 Edwards v Bairstow
 
[1956] AC 14
, 36; and to allow cross-examination presents the court with a temptation, not always easily resisted, to substitute its own view of the facts for that of the decision-making body upon which the exclusive jurisdiction to determine facts has been conferred by Parliament.
 
 
 
Even then, the Malaysian Supreme Court has held in 
 Yii Suok Ting v Sibu Municipal Council 
, that the above passage was made with reference to the provision in O 53 r 8 in the English rules which expressly provides for the cross-examination of deponents of affidavits in judicial review proceedings. There is no similar provision in Malaysia or Singapore. As a result, the Malaysian Supreme Court was of the view that the applicable test was the narrower test which existed before the amendments to the rules, ie that leave can only be granted in very special circumstances as laid down in 
 R v Stokesley, Yorkshire, Justices ex p Bartram 
. Wan Suleiman SCJ, in delivering the judgment of the court, concluded at p 236: 
 
We would agree with learned judge in the court below that the conflict of evidence here does not constitute the sort of exceptional circumstances envisaged in the 
 Stokesley Justice
 case which would justify an order to cross-examine, and also since our procedure in its unamended state is dissimilar to the corresponding English O 53 after its 1977 amendment, the test for allowing cross-examination should not be `whenever the justice of a particular case so requires`, but the more stringent one in the 
 Stokesley
 case.
 
 
 
I would respectfully adopt the above propositions and state that this is also the position in Singapore. I accepted Mr Reddy`s contention that there was no dispute of facts nor any exceptional circumstance which required the cross-examination of the deponents of the affidavits. I could not see how the proposed cross-examination could have been relevant to the legal issues raised in this appeal. The application was accordingly dismissed.
Turning to the appeal proper, the grounds of appeal raised were essentially these: 
 
 
(a) whether Order 179 was ultra vires the Constitution; 
 
(b) whether Order 123 was ultra vires the Constitution; 
 
(c) whether Order 123 was patently invalid or ultra vires the UPA; and 
 
(d) whether the ministerial decision in making Order 123 and 179 was so unreasonable and arbitrary as to violate the fundamental liberties of individuals as enshrined in the Constitution.
  
 
 
For the reasons which I have stated above, I accepted that these grounds could be raised as a defence in this appeal. It must be borne in mind that this appeal is not primarily concerned with the right of the Jehovah`s Witnesses to exist as a religion. The de-registration of the Jehovah`s Witnesses as a society was never the subject of challenge in the court below. Nevertheless, I shall deal with it as it has been raised before me and would amount to a substantive defence, if proved. The relevant provisions of art 15 of the Constitution are as follows: 
 
 
(1) Every person has the right to profess and practise his religion and to propagate it. 
 
(2) No person shall be compelled to pay any tax the proceeds of which are specially allocated in whole or in part for the purposes of a religion other than his own. 
 
(3) Every religious group has the right - 
 
(a) to manage its own religious affairs; 
 
(b) to establish and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes; and 
 
(c) to acquire and own property and hold and administer it in accordance with law. 
 
(4) This Article does not authorise any act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health or morality.
  
 
 
As was stated by Sir Harry Gibbs, the former Chief Justice of Australia, in 
 Law, Justice & the Judiciary: Transnational Trends 
, the court has the power and duty to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution are observed. The court also has a duty to declare invalid any exercise of power, legislative and executive, which exceeds the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution, or which contravenes any prohibition which the Constitution provides.
It must be stated at the outset however that where the principal issue is the interpretation of the Constitution, the observations of Thomson CJ in
 Government of the State of Kelantan v Government of the Federation of Malaya & Anor 
 are pertinent: 
 
... the Constitution is primarily to be interpreted within its own four walls and not in the light of analogies drawn from other countries such as Great Britain, the United States of America or Australia.
 
 
 
This approach was recently affirmed by the Malaysian Supreme Court in 
 PP v Pung Chen Choon. 
 I am clearly of the view that this would also reflect the position in Singapore.
In the course of the hearing of this appeal, Mr How referred me to various judicial pronouncements in the United States on the right to freedom of religion. There is a fundamental difference between the right to freedom of religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art 15. The American provision consists of an `establishment clause` which proscribes any preference for a particular religion (
 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion) 
 and a `free exercise clause` which is based on the principle of governmental non-interference with religion (
 Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise thereof) 
. Significantly, the Singapore Constitution does not prohibit the `establishment` of any religion. The social conditions in Singapore are, of course, markedly different from those in the United States. On this basis alone, I am not influenced by the various views as enunciated in the American cases cited to me but instead must restrict my analysis of the issues here with reference to the local context.
As I have referred to earlier, the main contention of the appellants was that the respective orders were without any factual basis. The appellants contend that the Ministry of Home Affairs`s press statement was wrong and misleading, save for the point that they were a non-violent group which declined to join the military. The ban was therefore described by the appellants as being, in the circumstances, irrational, oppressive, unreasonable, overboard, a violation of the freedom of religion as enshrined in the Constitution and also a violation of international declarations of human rights. All things being said, I think that the issues here are best resolved by a consideration of the provisions of the Constitution, the Societies Act and the UPA alone.
The basic proposition in judicial review is that the court will not question the merits of the exercise of the ministerial discretion. There can be no enquiry as to whether it was a correct or proper exercise or whether it should or ought to have been taken. The court cannot substitute its own view as to how the discretion should be exercised with that actually taken. It is pertinent to note the observations of Abdoolcader J in 
 Yeap Hock Seng @ Ah Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia 
 in connection with proceedings for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus with respect to preventive detention: 
 
... the court does not sit in appeal against the decision of the minister regarding materials on which the detention order was made. The court does not examine the adequacy or truth of these materials and cannot interfere with the decision on the ground that if the court had examined them it would have come to a different conclusion.
 
 
 
In addition, there is a presumption that the orders were valid and the burden of proving that they were ultra vires or unconstitutional therefore lay on the appellants who challenged them on such grounds (
 Chng Suan Tze v Minister for Home Affairs 
). The appellants had to show that the ministers had acted ultra vires in the sense that they had exercised their discretion on irrelevant grounds, or that they had exceeded their powers under the enabling statutory provisions, or that the actions were unconstitutional as contravening art 15(1) of the Constitution.
Mr How`s first contention was that a purposive construction ought to be adopted in considering art 15. He claimed that the right of freedom of religion was required for the protection of the religious liberties of minority groups. In support of this contention, he cited arts 9(1) and 152(1) of the Constitution which read: 
 
Article 9(1)
 
 
 
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
 
 
 
Article 152(1)
 
 
 
It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.
 
 
 
Mr How`s submissions centred upon the concept of broad unreasonableness, and little legal argument was presented in support of this allegation. However, if I understood him correctly, one of the challenges he was making was with respect to whether the minister had exercised his discretion based upon the correct criteria as stipulated under the relevant empowering sections. He attacked the dissolution of the Jehovah`s Witnesses in Singapore as impinging on the affected individuals` right of religious freedom, and referred to art 15(4), which provides that the right of freedom of religion can only be constrained if public order, public health or morality is affected, and s 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act, which states that registered organizations can be dissolved on the ground that they are a threat to public peace, welfare or good order. At the same time, the decision of Abdoolcader J in the Malaysian case of 
 Tan Boon Liat v Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri, Malaysia 
 was cited: 
 
The expression `public order` is not defined anywhere but danger to human life and safety and the disturbance of public tranquillity must necessarily fall within the purview of the expression... The test to be adopted in determining whether an act affects law and order or public order is this: Does it lead to disturbance of the current of life of the community so as to amount to disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an individual leaving the tranquillity of the society undisturbed?
 
 
 
It was then contended that there was nothing which showed that the activities of the Jehovah`s Witnesses, being a small, non-violent Christian group, were in any way against public order. Mr How contended that the membership of the Jehovah`s Witnesses in Singapore was small and the alleged prejudice to public welfare was therefore insignificant. Further, he submitted that there needed to be a clear and immediate danger to public order before the right of freedom of religion could be curtailed, and, in this case, the de-registration orders could not have been justified since there was no such threat at all. In my view, Mr How`s submission that it must be shown that there was a clear and immediate danger was misplaced for one simple reason. It cannot be said that beliefs, especially those propagated in the name of `religion`, should not be put to a stop until such a scenario exists. If not, it would in all probability be too late as the damage sought to be prevented would have transpired. In my opinion, any administration which perceives the possibility of trouble over religious beliefs and yet prefers to wait until trouble is just about to break out before taking action must be not only pathetically naive but also grossly incompetent.
There has been judicial pronouncement on the Jehovah`s Witnesses` right of freedom to exercise their beliefs. The High Court of Australia had the opportunity of determining, by way of a case stated, whether s 116 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia (which, inter alia, prohibits the making of any law which prevents the free exercise of any religion) prevented Parliament from legislating to restrain the activities of the Jehovah`s Witnesses (
 Adelaide Co of Jehovah`s Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth 
). In stating the case, Starke J described the beliefs of the Jehovah`s Witnesses at p 118 as these: 
 
... Jehovah`s Witnesses are Christians entirely devoted to the Kingdom of God, which is `The Theocracy`, that they have no part in the political affairs of the world and must not interfere in the least manner with war between nations. They must be entirely neutral and not interfere with the drafting of men of nations that go to war. And also that wherever there is a conflict between the laws of Almighty God and the laws of man the Christian must always obey God`s law in preference to man`s law. All laws of men, however, in harmony with God`s law the Christian obeys. God`s law is expounded and taught by Jehovah`s Witnesses. Accordingly, they refuse to take an oath of allegiance to the King or other constituted human authority, though they do not object to take an oath in a court of law to speak the truth nor do they refuse the protection of the King`s Courts or other constituted human authority.
 
 
 
In that case, in January 1941, the Governor-General, pursuant to the authority conferred by the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations, declared certain bodies, including the Adelaide Company of Jehovah`s Witnesses Incorporated, as `prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth and the efficient prosecution of war`. As a result, possession of the Jehovah`s Witnesses` premises in Adelaide was taken over by the government. The Jehovah`s Witnesses sought an injunction and contended, inter alia, that the Regulations impinged on the Constitution. The court was of the unanimous view that Parliament was not prohibited from making laws which prohibited the advocacy of doctrines and principles which, though advocated in pursuance of religious convictions, were prejudicial to the prosecution of a war engaged by the Government. Latham CJ held at p 147 that the Governor-General was fully justified in making the declarations as: 
 
It needs no argument to show that the doctrine that the Commonwealth is an organ of Satan is prejudicial to any defence of the Commonwealth against any enemy.
 
 
 
The appellants have claimed that the Jehovah`s Witnesses in Singapore were a responsible, honest and law-abiding group, which kept strictly out of politics. As I have noted above, none of these contentions were in issue in this appeal. The only real complaint, as the appellants finally conceded, was their refusal to undertake national service. I think it is quite settled, in the light of the evidence adduced, that adherents of the Jehovah`s Witnesses clearly believed that military duty was prohibited by their religion, and, as a result, they refused to do national service.
The appellants contended that there was no evidence produced or even alleged to show that the Jehovah`s Witnesses were a threat to public order. Article 15(4) clearly envisages that the right of freedom of religion is subject to inherent limitations and is therefore not an absolute and unqualified right. This was succinctly described by Hashim Yeop Sani CJ in 
 Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia v Jamaluddin bin Othman 
: 
 
The freedom to profess and practise one`s religion should not be turned into a licence to commit unlawful acts or acts tending to prejudice or threaten the security of the country.
 
 
 
I am of the view that religious beliefs ought to have proper protection, but actions undertaken or flowing from such beliefs must conform with the general law relating to public order and social protection. The right of freedom of religion must be reconciled with `the right of the State to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace, security and orderly living without which constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery` (
 Commissioner, HRE v LT Swamiar 
). The sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution and anything, including religious beliefs and practices, which tend to run counter to these objectives must be restrained.
I think it is useful to consider parts of the additional evidence submitted by the prosecution. The Assistant Director of Manpower of the Ministry of Defence had stated in his affidavit that from 1972 until May 1994, 108 persons, who claimed to be Jehovah`s Witnesses and who were liable to serve national service, had been disciplined under s 17 of the Singapore Armed Forces Act (Cap 259) for wilfully refusing to comply with orders to put on military uniforms. Their reasons were that they were unable to render any form of military service, including obeying military orders or even saluting the flag, because their religion forbade them from doing so. The Assistant Director expressed the concern that such wilful disobedience of orders would affect the motivation of the Singapore Armed Forces and noted that `the beliefs subscribed to by persons who profess to be Jehovah`s Witnesses would, if recognized, mean that persons who enjoy the social and economic benefits of Singapore citizenship and permanent residence are excused from the responsibility of defending the very social and political institutions and structure which enable them to do so`. This concern was in fact reflected in arts 128 and 131 of the Constitution under which a citizen may not renounce his citizenship unless he has discharged his liability for national service. It would appear that this problem was not limited to the armed forces alone. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs referred to the fact that since the establishment of the Singapore Civil Defence Force in 1986, eight national servicemen have been disciplined for failing to wear uniforms on the ground that they were Jehovah`s Witnesses.
During the Second Reading of the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill (
 Hansard 
, 23 February 1990, p 1181), the then Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence (Services), BG Lee Hsien Loong noted: 
 
National Service is clearly a secular issue in Singapore. Most religious groups recognize that. But one group maintains otherwise - the Jehovah`s Witnesses. They refuse to do National Service, claiming that their religion does not allow them to do so. They do so in all sincerity, with great courage of conviction. Each year, a few dozen young men who are Jehovah`s Witnesses have to be court-martialled because they refuse to do National Service, and then sentenced to detention. After two years, when they are released, the enlistment order is served upon them again. They refuse again, so we court-martial them again. They serve a second period of detention until, after two periods, we call it quits and deem it equivalent to your having served National Service. This was the first issue which I learnt about when I went into Mindef when we were dealing with these people harshly. So I asked, as a young officer, `Why do we do that? It is a matter of conscience.`
 
 
 
But we have no alternative, as I learned, because they are violating the law. In many Western European countries, they would count as conscientious objectors. But the idea of conscientious objection does not apply in Singapore. There is no such tradition in Singapore. If we try to introduce the practice here, the whole system of universal National Service will come unstuck. Many other people will ask: why should I also not decide to have conscientious objections and therefore exempt myself from National Service? And of course, even in Western Europe, not all countries acknowledge conscientious objectors. In Switzerland, those who do not do National Service also go to jail. Therefore, the Enlistment Act in Singapore does not recognize conscientious objection. National Service is a secular issue, subject to government laws. Everybody accepts this, including all the other religious groups. In this case, the line between religion and politics is drawn clearly. But it is not drawn in the same place as in other countries.
To summarize the appellants` contentions so far, the appellants merely alleged that there were no facts to support the de-registration in the sense that their practices and beliefs were not prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order. Likewise, they contended that Order 123 was also ultra vires: as the relevant minister had to form the opinion that it was contrary to the public interest, and as the press statement only referred to the ban as there being `no further need for such literature`, it was clearly an irrelevant consideration for making the prohibition order.
In my view, it was not for this court to substitute its view for the minister`s as to whether the Jehovah`s Witnesses constituted a threat to national security. As I have outlined earlier, the appellants had the burden of showing that the minister had exercised his powers wrongly. This court was not here to review the merits of the decision and conclude that the Jehovah`s Witnesses were or were not a threat to public order. From the evidence adduced, it appeared that the minister was of the view that the continued existence of a group which preached as one of its principal beliefs that military service was forbidden was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. That was, in essence, the relevant finding. I could not see how the concept of public order as envisaged under art 15(4) is dissimilar to the notion of public peace, welfare and good order within s 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. Therefore, Order 179 could not have contravened art 15(1) or been ultra vires s 24(1)(a).
I now come to Order 123. Section 3 of the UPA reads: 
 
 
(1) If the Minister is of opinion that the importation, sale or circulation of any publication or series of publications published or printed outside Singapore or within Singapore by any person would be contrary to the public interest, he may in his discretion, by order published in the Gazette, prohibit the importation, sale or circulation of that particular publication or series of publications or all publications published or printed by that person. 
 
(2) If an order made under subsection (1) specifies by name a publication which is a periodical publication, the order shall, unless a contrary intention be expressed therein, have effect with respect to - 
 
(A) all past and subsequent issues of such publication; and 
 
(b) any publication published or printed under any other name if the publishing or printing thereof is in any respect a continuation of, or in substitution for, the publishing or printing of the publication named in the order. 
 
(3) If an order made under subsection (1) prohibits the importation, sale or circulation of all publications published or printed by a specified person that order shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, have effect not only with respect to all publications published or printed by that person before the date of the order but also with respect to all publications so published or printed on or after that date. 
 
(4) An order made under subsection (1) shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed therein, apply to any translation into any language of the publication specified in the order. 
 
(5) The Minister may at any time revoke, vary or amend any order made under this section.
  
 
 
For the same reasons, the court cannot interfere by substituting its own judgment for that of the minister. Section 3(1) clearly confers a discretion on the minister to order the prohibition of a publication if he is of the opinion that the importation, sale or circulation of that publication would be contrary to public interest. The court can only interfere with this opinion to the extent of ensuring that the minister exercises his discretionary powers according to the statutory limitations. The minister`s reasons for the ban emanated from considerations of national security and that the continued existence of the Jehovah`s Witnesses `would be prejudicial to public welfare and good order in Singapore`. Such considerations are clearly related to the public interest, and there could therefore be no objection that the prohibition order was made on an irrelevant ground. At the same time, I am of the view that it was a necessary corollary to the dissolution of the Jehovah`s Witnesses that their publications be prohibited. In essence, Order 123 reinforced the ban on the movement proper.
As the prohibition under Order 123 was with respect to all publications by WTBTS, it was argued that the order was unexpected, undiscriminating, excessive and sweeping. It was contended that such power to prohibit all publications of a specified publisher should only be exercised when the publisher habitually published materials contrary to the public interest. It was argued that many of the publications could not have been regarded as contrary to the public interest. Counsel illustrated this contention by stating that the ban would extend to the King James Version of the Bible as well, as long as it was printed and published by WTBTS. It was argued that this was wholly unreasonable as the King James Version was widely circulated in Singapore.
I do not see the merit of this contention. The fact that one publication is unobjectionable as to its contents, be it the King James Version or `Alice in Wonderland`, does not make the ban unreasonable per se. Instead, it was not unreasonable, in my view, for the minister to prohibit all publications by WTBTS. The minister`s actions were clearly to stop the dissemination and propagation of beliefs of the Jehovah`s Witnesses and this would of necessity include every publication by WTBTS. Any order other than a total blanket order would have been impossible to monitor administratively.
Mr How also argued that Order 123 was flawed in the sense that the Minister for Culture did not himself exercise his discretion but had acted on the basis that the Minister for Home Affairs had made a decision under a different statute, being the Societies Act. It was contended that this amounted to a failure to exercise on a lawful basis the discretion that belonged to him. He cited the decision of Willis J in 
 H Lavender & Son Ltd v Minister of Housing and Local Government 
. In that case, the respondent minister refused planning permission on the ground that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had objected. Willis J quashed the minister`s order. In doing so, he held that the minister had failed in the proper exercise of his discretion as he had improperly delegated his duties in relation to the making of the order with which he was entrusted to the Minister of Agriculture who had no status to make the effective decision.
I think that the circumstances leading up to the making of Order 123 were different from those in 
 H Lavender v Minister of Housing and Local Government 
. The Permanent Secretary of the MITA deposed in his affidavit that the then Minister for Culture was satisfied that the Jehovah`s Witnesses` teachings and beliefs contained in publications published or printed by WTBTS would be contrary to the public interest, in that they were prejudicial to the Government`s efforts in nation building, in setting up the national armed forces and in maintaining national security, unity, integrity and sovereignty, and the minister therefore consequently exercised his powers under s 3(1) of the UPA. It was clear to me that the process of de-registration and the prohibition of the publications were a joint operation by both ministers. The logical inference from the evidence could not be otherwise. This submission was therefore equally without merit.
The next submission made by the appellants was on the ground that the respective orders were made in breach of the requirements of natural justice - 
 `audi alteram partem` 
. They contended that the orders were made without any notice or hearing and that the affected parties were not given an opportunity to explain or correct the allegations against them. This submission, of course, tied in with the appellants` contention that there was no evidence that the interests of the State were in immediate and grave danger. In this respect, the respective provisions of the Societies Act and the UPA should be examined. On doing so, I can see no express requirement in either s 24 of the Societies Act or s 3 of the UPA for the relevant minister to give the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders are made. If so, can it then be said, as the appellants have argued, that the ordinary principles of natural justice should still be complied with? I think it is pertinent to note that the orders here were both made with respect to the public interest and the public order. The objective was therefore clearly for the preservation of national security. In this respect, the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified accordingly (per Lord Denning MR in 
 R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex p Hosenball 
). As such, there is no room for the appellants` contention that the requirements of natural justice must to be complied with fully.
The relevant ministers have to be satisfied that the matters relied on by them fall within the scope of the specified provisions. As alluded to above, the appellants have not shown to this court that the ministers had based their conclusions on facts which were false or unfounded. It cannot be disputed that it is part of the Jehovah`s Witnesses` doctrine that military service is prohibited for its adherents. The ministers were entitled to consider and conclude that this fact was contrary to national security and therefore contrary to public order and the public interest. Since the basis for the orders clearly could not be disputed, no purpose would be achieved if a hearing or inquiry was held.
The final submission made by the appellants was that the orders were disproportionate to the interests of the State and operated unfairly. The Court of Appeal has already held in 
 Chng Suan Tze 
 that the principle of proportionality was not a separate ground for judicial review but was subsumed under the ground of `irrationality` in the sense that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.
As I understood it, the respective ministers were clearly of the view that the continued existence of the Jehovah`s Witnesses was prejudicial to the national interest. The basis for the de-registration clearly flowed from the danger of allowing absolute freedom of religion which might create a complete denial of a government`s authority and ability to govern individuals or groups asserting a religious affiliation. The Jehovah`s Witnesses were not mere conscientious objectors to national service but were engaging in conduct which was prejudicial to national security. The activities of the Jehovah`s Witnesses were therefore restricted on the basis that they were against the `public order`. Equally, the prohibition on their publications was a natural consequence and was therefore in the `public interest`. In my view, the respective decisions were not irrational or disproportionate.
For the reasons indicated, I found no merit in the appeal and dismissed it accordingly.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the court): These two appeals, which we heard together, raise an important question of law. It is whether the Central Christian Church, the respondents in both appeals, have the necessary legal personality or are 
 persona legalis 
 to enable them to sue for libel in respect of two publications, one in the 
 Lian He Wan Bao 
 dated 23 November 1991 (CA 60/95) and the other in 
 The New Paper 
 also dated 23 November 1991 (CA 61/95), which the respondents allege were defamatory of them. This question was answered in the affirmative both by the senior assistant registrar and on appeal from him, by the learned judge. [See 
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 115
 .]
The question arose in this way. The respondents who are an unincorporated association registered under the Societies Act (Cap 311) commenced separate actions against the editors, publishers and printers of the 
 Lian He Wan Bao 
 and 
 The New Paper 
, to whom we will collectively refer as `the appellants`, alleging that in the publications referred to above the respondents had been described as `cult organizations` who might organize `harmful activities here` and who `stretch the truth and have ""exclusive"" practices.` It is not necessary to refer to the pleadings any further. The appellants then took out a summons-in-chambers in the two actions claiming that the statements of claim be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court on the ground that they did not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the appellants, were frivolous and vexatious and were an abuse of the process of the court.
Both summonses-in-chambers were heard together by the senior assistant registrar as were the appeals from him by the learned judge. The sole question, at least before the learned judge as framed by him in his judgment, was `whether a society registered under the Societies Act has a legal personality which is capable in law of being defamed.` Before us, counsel for the appellants framed three issues as follows:
 
 
(a) Whether an unincorporated association registered under the Societies Act (Cap 311) (registered society) has a legal personality separate from that of its members by virtue of its registration. 
 
(b) Whether a registered society has a reputation capable of being defamed. 
 
(c) Whether s 35(b) of the Societies Act is in reality a procedural provision which does not in any way affect the substantive law in respect of the tort of defamation.
  
 
 
Although issue (b) was not specifically raised as an issue before the learned judge and notwithstanding that counsel for the respondents objected to it being raised as an issue before us, we allowed it to be raised as, in our view, it was a corollary of the question before the learned judge, that is to say whether the respondents, a society registered under the Societies Act, were capable in law of being defamed. Issue (c) may be considered a sub-issue under issue (a) as it was contended in the court below and so held by the learned judge that one of the indicia which gave a registered society legal personality was s 35(b) of the Societies Act which gave the registered society the right to sue or be sued in its name, whereas the appellants contended that s 35(b) was in reality a procedural provision which did not give any substantive rights to the registered society.
The approach taken by the learned judge in determining the question put to him, in our view, is eminently correct. In his judgment he said: 
 
[T]he answer to the question depends on a true and natural interpretation of the provisions of the Societies Act and also on a review of the English case law which had to grapple with the legal personality of associations such as trade unions and friendly societies. Such associations were and are registered under English statutes which have analogous, though not exactly similar, provisions nor [sic] analogous statutory framework as those of our Societies Act. The underlying principles of the law of status and of persons, however, are the same.
 
 
 
We will begin by considering the legal status of unincorporated associations under the common law. It is a settled principle of the common law, of which there can be no doubt, that an unincorporated association consisting of a mere aggregate of individuals is not a legal entity. Lord Buckmaster, Lord Chancellor, in 
 London Association for Protection of Trade & Anor v Greenlands Ltd 
 
[1916] 2 AC 15
, referring to the association said: 
 
The association consisted of some 6,200 members; it was unincorporated and consequently could not be made a defendant to the action in any capacity whatever. As an entity it could neither publish nor authorize the publication of a libel; and this appears to have been recognized before your Lordships` House, as the plaintiffs have consented to strike out the association from the action.
 
 
 
In 
 Electrical, Electronics, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union v Times Newspapers Ltd & Ors 
 [1980] 1 All ER 1097, to which we will refer as the `the
 EETPU 
 case`, O`Connor J referring to the common law position of unincorporated associations in the context of the tort of libel said at p 1099: 
 
[T]he action for defamation is a personal matter because it is the reputation of the person which is defamed, and unless one can attach a personality to a body, it cannot sue for defamation. The best examples of this are found in the well-established law that a voluntary unincorporated association cannot maintain an action for libel on itself. Let me give an example. If one says of the Longbeach Anglers` Association that at the competition last Saturday they cheated, there is a defamatory statement; but the Longbeach Anglers` Association cannot maintain an action in respect of it. It may be that the individuals of the association who were partaking in the competition could successfully sue by saying that, although they were not named, the defamatory statement pointed at them with sufficient clarity and was so understood by those who knew that they were members of that association to enable them to sue for libel; 
 but the association could not do so, and it could not do so, as I see it, on the principle that it has no personality of its own which is capable of being defamed. It may well be that an unincorporated association cannot sue in its own name for anything, but I am restricting what I have to say to defamation. So you have got to have personality which is capable of being defamed before a plaintiff can bring an action for libel.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
But Parliament can clothe an unincorporated association with legal personality or make it 
 persona legalis 
 and vest it with powers, generally or with limitations, to enable it to sue or to be sued in its own name, either in contract or in tort which of course includes an action of defamation. It cannot be gainsaid that a trade union consisting of an aggregate of individuals formed for the purpose of protecting or advancing their individual or collective rights in trade and industry is an unincorporated association. But the trade union was an unincorporated association with a difference unlike the Longbeach Anglers` Association referred to by O`Connor J in the 
 EETPU 
 case. The former being an association of individuals in the restraint of trade was unlawful whereas the latter formed in the pursuit of leisure and recreation was lawful.
In 1871 the English Parliament passed the Trade Union Act 1871, providing for the registration of trade unions and the legalization of such registered trade unions; `but they were without question unincorporated associations, and as such one would have thought that they could neither sue in their own names, nor be sued, and as such could not be defamed in their proper name` as O`Connor J observed in the 
 EETPU 
 case at p 1100.
In 1901 the question of whether a trade union registered under the Trade Union Act of 1871 and the amending Act of 1876 may be sued in its registered name came for consideration before the English Courts in the case of 
 The Taff Vale Railway Co v The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants 
 
[1901] AC 426
. It will be noted that the Trade Union Acts of 1871 and 1876 did not contain any specific provision that the trade union may sue, or be sued in its registered name. Notwithstanding that, Farwell J at first instance and the House of Lords held that The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants could be sued in its registered name.
The Taff Vale Railway Co had sought an injunction against The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, its general secretary and the organizing secretary from picketing the premises of the railway company for the purpose of persuading or preventing those working for the railway company from entering the premises of the railway company in connection with their employment. The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants applied to the court for its name to be struck out as a defendant on the ground that it being neither a corporation nor an individual could not be sued in a quasi-corporate or any other capacity. Farwell J whose judgment was highly commended by their Lordships in the House of Lords, and is most instructive to us, addressed himself as follows at pp 427-428: 
 
The questions that I have to consider are what, according to the true construction of the Trade Union Acts, has the legislature enabled the trade unions to do, and what, if any, liability does a trade union incur for wrongs done to others in the exercise of its authorized powers? The Acts commence by legalizing the usual trade union contracts, and proceed to establish a registry of trade unions, give to each trade union an exclusive right to the name in which it is registered, authorize it through the medium of trustees to own a limited amount of real estate, and unlimited personal estate `for the use and benefit of such trade union and the members thereof`; provide that it shall have officers and treasurers, and render them liable to account; require that annual returns be made to the registry of the assets and liabilities and receipts and expenditure of the society; provide that it shall have rules and a registered office, imposing a penalty on the trade union for noncompliance; and permit it to amalgamate with other trade unions, and to be wound up.
 
 
 
At p 429 Farwell J continued as follows: 
 
Now, although a corporation and an individual or individuals may be the only entity known to the common law who can sue or be sued, it is competent to the legislature to give an association of individuals which is neither a corporation nor a partnership nor an individual a capacity for owning property and acting by agents, and such capacity in the absence of express enactment to the contrary involves the necessary correlative of liability to the extent of such property for the acts and defaults of such agents. It is beside the mark to say of such an association that it is unknown to the common law. The legislature has legalized it, and it must be dealt with by the courts according to the intention of the legislature.
 
 
 
Farwell J then concluded at p 430 that a trade union could be sued for tort. He said: 
 
Now, the legislature in giving a trade union the capacity to own property and the capacity to act by agents has, without incorporating it, given it two of the essential qualities of a corporation - essential, I mean, in respect of liability for tort, for a corporation can only act by its agents, and can only be made to pay by means of its property. The principle on which corporations have been held liable in respect of wrongs committed by its servants or agents in the course of their service and for the benefit of the employer ... is as applicable to the case of a trade union as to that of a corporation. If the contention of the defendant society were well founded, the legislature has authorized the creation of numerous bodies of men capable of owning great wealth and of acting by agents with absolutely no responsibility for the wrongs that they may do to other persons by the use of that wealth and the employment of those agents. They would be at liberty ... to disseminate libels broadcast, or to hire men to reproduce the rattening methods that disgraced Sheffield thirty or forty years ago, and their victims would have nothing to look to for damages but the pockets of the individuals, usually men of small means, who acted as their agents.
 
 
 
In the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor, Earl of Halsbury was content to adopt Farwell J`s judgment. Lord Macnaghten at p 439 said: 
 
It is quite true that a registered trade union is not a corporation, but it has a registered name and a registered office. The registered name is nothing more than a collective name for all the members. The registered office is the place where it carries on business. A partnership firm which is not a corporation, nor, I suppose, a legal entity, may now be sued in the firm`s name. And when I find that the Act of Parliament actually provides for a registered trade union being sued in certain cases for penalties by its registered name, as a trade union, and does not say that the cases specified are the only cases in which it may be so sued, I can see nothing contrary to principle, or contrary to the provisions of the Trade Union Acts, in holding that a trade union may be sued by its registered name.
 
 
 
Lord Shand at p 441 said: 
 
[T]he power of suing and liability to be sued in the society`s name is clearly and necessarily implied by the provisions of the statutes. ... A registered trade union has an exclusive right to the name in which it is registered, a right to hold a limited amount of real estate and unlimited personal estate for its own use and benefit and the benefit of its members, the power of acting by its agents and trustees, and is liable to be sued for penalties, as it appears to me, in the society`s name. I am clearly of opinion that these and the provisions generally of the statutes imply a liability on the society to be sued in its trade union name, and a privilege of thus suing.
 
 
 
Lord Brampton said in p 442: 
 
I think that a legal entity was created under the Trade Union Act 1871, by the registration of the society in its present name in the manner prescribed, and that the legal entity so created, though not perhaps in the strict sense a corporation, is nevertheless a newly created corporate body created by statute, distinct from the unincorporated trade union, consisting of many thousands of separate individuals, which no longer exists under any other name. The very omission from the statute of any provision authorizing and directing that it shall sue and be sued in any other name than that given to it by its registration appears to me to lead to no other reasonable conclusion than that in so creating it, it was intended by the legislature that by that name and by no other it should be known, and that for all purposes that name should be used and applied to it in all legal proceedings unless there was any other provision which militated against such a construction as, for instance, in the case of trustees by s 9 of the same Act, who hold real and personal property of the society.
 
 
 
Only Lord Lindley demurred somewhat. He said in p 445: 
 
My Lords, a careful study of the Act leads me to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal held, and rightly held, that trade unions are not corporations; but the court held further that, not being corporations, power to sue and be sued in their registered name must be conferred upon them; and further that the language of the statutes was not sufficient for the purpose. Upon this last point I differ from them. The Act appears to me to indicate with sufficient clearness that the registered name is one which may be used to denote the union as an unincorporated society in legal proceedings as well as for business and other purposes. The use of the name in legal proceedings imposes no duties and alters no rights: it is only a more convenient mode of proceeding than that which would have to be adopted if the name could not be used. I do not say that the use of the name is compulsory, but it is at least permissive.
 
 
 
The corollary of the conclusion reached by Farwell J and the House of Lords in 
 Taff Vale 
 is that a trade union may also sue in its registered name. It will further be noted that the Societies Act by s 35(b) provides that `every such society may sue or be sued in the name in which it was registered under this Act` (ie the Societies Act (Cap 311)); but we will return to analyse the Societies Act in detail later.
Before looking further it is just as well to look, briefly, at another English statute which has dealt with another unincorporated association as dealt with by the Trade Union Acts of 1871 and 1876. The Friendly Societies Act 1896, is one such statute. In 
 Longdon-Griffiths v Smith & Ors 
 
[1951] 1 KB 295
, four trustees of a friendly society had prepared a report on the activities of the plaintiff, general secretary of the society, which was read out by one of them at a general meeting of the society, the occasion being one of qualified privilege. Each of the trustees had a right and a duty independent of the other to publish the report. It contained statements defamatory of the plaintiff. One of the four trustees was actuated by malice. The plaintiff brought an action for libel against the trustees both in their personal capacity and as trustees. It was held that an action for libel against a friendly society must be brought against it in its registered name and the plaintiff was not entitled to judgment against the defendants as trustees of the society. The 
 Taff Vale 
 case was applied. We have referred to this case to illustrate that trade unions are not in a special position and different from other unincorporated associations which under the relevant statute applicable to them provides for their registration.
We next refer to 
 National Union of General and Municipal Workers v Gillian & Ors 
 [1946] KB 81. In this case the Court of Appeal affirming Birkett J applied the 
 Taff Vale 
 case and held that a trade union could sue for libel in its registered name. The defendants had argued that a trade union was neither a natural person nor a corporation and hence had no powers and no existence except what was conferred in express terms by Parliament in the relevant statutes affecting registered trade unions. This argument was rejected by Scott LJ, who said at p 85: 
 
That argument is, however, fallacious. That is a 
 tertium quid
. A trade union has many activities; it has some existence, and it is something. The omission of Parliament to christen it with some new generic name is immaterial, for Parliament has absolute sovereignty and can make new legal creatures if it likes. It is able, for instance, to create a 
 persona juridica
 not previously known to the law, if it so chooses, or to clothe an existing association of natural persons with what may be called co-operative personality so as to give it the status of a 
 persona juridica
. In my view that is just what it did in 1871. It expressly assumed the possession by every trade union, when duly registered, of so many of the main attributes of judicial personality that I find any other inference of the intention of Parliament impossible.
 
 
 
He then referred to several provisions of the Trade Union Act 1871, already discussed in the judgment of Farwell J and in the speeches of their Lordships in the House of Lords in passages from the 
 Taff Vale 
 case we have cited, and concluded in pp 85 and 86 as follows: 
 
These illustrations from the Act of 1871 are, in my opinion, conclusive of the intention of Parliament to attribute legal personality to trade unions, and that quality or characteristic must of necessity connote the general power to act, or, in other words, to do at any rate many of those things which are inherent in the legal concept of personality.
 
 
 
Uthwatt J referring to the 
 Taff Vale 
 case said at p 88: 
 
That decision involves, to my mind, that a registered trade union is recognized by the law as a body distinct from the individuals who from time to time compose it. It is not a corporation; but it is very much like one. The association is not merely the aggregate of the persons who compose it, and the presence of the corporate fiction is not necessary to secure its individuality. In an age of neologism it might be called a `near-corporation.`
 
 
 
... It is well established that in certain cases a trading corporation may bring a suit in respect of an imputation on its trading reputation, and I see no reason why a non-trading corporation should not have the same rights as respects imputations on the conduct by it of its activities. A trade union to my mind stands in the same position. It, too, has its reputation. Why should it not be protected? The social duty so to conduct the affairs of the union as not to invite well-founded criticism is hardly forwarded by a denial of the right to seek redress for an unjustified disparagement of its activities.
Scott LJ expressed a similar opinion. He said at p 87: 
 
It being assumed that a trade union can sue in tort, I see no ground for excluding the action of defamation. The attack made in the present case, the merits of which are of course in no way before the court, is a sufficient illustration of the disintegration of a trade union which might be produced by unjustifiable libels uncontrolled by the fear of action in the King`s courts.
 
 
 
The next case of importance is 
 Bonsor v Musicians` Union 
 [1955] 3 All ER 518, although the issue was whether Bonsor, a member of the Musicians` Union, could sue the union in its registered name in contract for being wrongfully expelled from the union. The House of Lords by a majority held that the union was capable of being sued for damages for breach of contract. What Lord Keith of Avonholm, one of the majority, said is of interest and highly persuasive. He said at pp 538-539: 
 
My Lords, I think that the decisions of this House show that, in a sense, a registered trade union is a legal entity, but not that it is a legal entity distinguishable at any moment of time from the members of which it is at that time composed. It remains a voluntary association of individuals but it is capable of suing and being sued in its registered name; it holds property, through trustees, against which a creditor holding a decree against it could levy execution; it acts by agents; and it has other rights and is subject to other liabilities set out in the Trade Union Acts. It differs from an unincorporated association in that it is unnecessary to consider who were the members at any particular time. For instance, it is immaterial who were the members at the time that any cause of action arose, or what members have joined the union since the cause of action arose. The registered trade union may be said to assume a collective responsibility for all members past, present and future, in respect of any cause of action for which it may be made liable, irrespective of the date of the cause of action. On the other hand, the judgment creditor can look only to the funds of such a trade union to satisfy his debt and, to the extent to which these may be augmented from time to time by contributions of members, whether new or old, they will still be available for the unsatisfied judgment creditor. These are important attributes, or characteristics of a registered trade union which, in my opinion, differentiate it from other voluntary associations and may entitle it to be called a legal entity, while at the same time remaining an unincorporated association of individuals. As an association, its membership is constantly changing, but as a registered trade union, it has a permanent identity and represents its members at any moment of time. It would not, I think, be wrong to call it a legal entity.
 
 
 
From the foregoing English cases, from which we have quoted extensively, it will be appreciated, readily, that the proper approach in interpreting the Societies Act is to discern from the totality of its provisions whether Parliament intended that an unincorporated association of individuals registered under s 4 thereof as a society should have legal personality such that the society is capable of having an identity separate and distinct from the members who comprise it such that the society is capable of suing or being sued in its registered name even without the aid of s 35(b) which provides that all societies registered under the Societies Act may sue or be sued in the name in which it was registered.
Before we examine the provisions of the Societies Act we should mention that the same approach taken in England has been taken in Canada. In 
 International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc v Therien 
 [1960] 22 DLR (2d) 1, the Supreme Court of Canada in interpreting the Labour Relations Act 1954, of British Columbia, applied the 
 Taff Vale 
 case and held that a trade union in British Columbia could be sued in tort or contract for damages.
Reference should also be made to two local cases the learned judge referred to in his judgment. In the first, 
 Workers` Party & Anor v Tay Boon Too & Anor 
 
 
 [1975] 1 MLJ 47 
, Chua J at p 49 said, `The Societies Act does not create a body corporate. It creates an association of individuals which is given the right, inter alia, to sue or be sued in its registered name.` The question of whether the Workers` Party which was a society registered under the Societies Act could sue for a libel in its registered name was not an issue, nor was the issue `whether a registered society had the `quasi-corporate` personality or legal personality so as to have a reputation to protect and to sue for any defamation against it.` The Workers` Party failed in its action on other grounds. In the other, 
 Karting Club of Singapore v Mak David & Ors 
 
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 280
 , Chua J following 
 London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenland Ltd 
 (opp cit) said at p 283: 
 
An unincorporated member club, not being a partnership or legal entity, cannot sue or be sued in the club name. The Karting Club of Singapore is unincorporated and consequently cannot be made a plaintiff to this action.
 
 
 
The learned judge noted in his judgment: 
 
Counsel for the club, P Suppiah, failed to draw the court`s attention to the express provisions under s 35(b) of the Societies Act and it was conceded before me that for this reason the defendants in the present case could not rely on it.
 
 
 
The learned judge was not assisted by these two cases; we too are not assisted by them.
The only other local case that need be mentioned is 
 Standard Chartered Bank v Chip Hong Machinery (S) Pte Ltd & Anor 
 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 20
 . In this case, the second defendants were registered as a society under what was then the Societies Ordinance and counsel for the second defendants conceded that the second defendants being an unincorporated society could not hold a tenancy but contended that they could not be precluded from claiming an equity in the premises. Coomaraswamy J at p 22 said: 
 
However, the second defendants` claim that they have an equity in the upper floor and therefore a defence to the plaintiffs` claim for possession was wholly untenable. In the first place, the second defendants could not claim an equity in the upper floor of the premises for the same reason they could not hold a tenancy, namely, that they had no legal personality as they were only a composite entity of fluctuating content and not a 
 persona legalis
: see 
 Ang Bock Chwee`s
 case 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 174
  and 
 Vengadasalam`s
 case 
 
 
[1985] 2 MLJ 449
 .
 
 
 
Whether or not the second defendants` were 
 persona legalis 
, they still could not hold immovable property and thus an interest in the immovable property, as, being an unincorporated association albeit registered under the Societies Ordinance, they could only hold such property through trustees. This is settled law but if authority be needed, see 
 Jarrott v Ackerlay 
 [1915] 113 LT 371.
Whatever the legislative history of the Societies Act and the necessity for its legislation in 1889, the fact remains that the Societies Act is the only statute in Singapore which provides for the registration and, through registration, the legalization of all unincorporated associations except for those unincorporated associations like trade unions which are the subject of special legislation and are excluded by paras (a)-(g) of the definition of `society` in s 2 of the Societies Act. An unincorporated association coming within the definition of `society` in s 2 and which is not registered under s 4(1) is deemed to be an unlawful society; see s 14.
The respondents come within the definition of `society` in s 2 of the Societies Act and are registered under s 4(1). It must follow that the respondents must have satisfied the requirements of s 4(2) and (3), otherwise they would not have been registered under s 4(1).
How then are the respondents who are an unincorporated association but are a registered society under the Societies Act to sue for libel in their own name? O`Connor J provided the answer in the
 EETPU 
 case at p 1100. He said: 
 
The answer on the cases is, I think, now beyond dispute. It is that the necessary personality must be found in some statute, or alternatively, in some grant which enables one to say of an unincorporated body that it has a sufficient personality which it is entitled to protect by bringing an action in libel.
 
 
 
It is therefore necessary to examine the Societies Act to see whether it has conferred on an incorporated association registered as a `society` under the provisions of the Societies Act sufficient personality for it to sue in defamation. It would be too tedious to examine each and every section of the Societies Act. However, two sections of the Societies Act should be set out in full as their meaning is plain and obvious. They are ss 35 and 36: 
 
Section 35
 
 
 
The following provisions shall apply to all registered societies:
 
 
 
(a) the movable property of a society, if not vested in trustees, shall be deemed to be vested for the time being in the governing body of the society, and in all proceedings civil and criminal may be described as the property of the governing body of the society by their proper title;
(b) every such society may sue or be sued in the name in which it was registered under this Act; 
(c) a writ of summons or other legal process may be served on a society by serving it on an officer of the society, or by leaving it at, or sending it by registered post to, the registered address of the society; 
(d) except as otherwise provided in section 36, no judgment in any suit against a registered society shall be put into force against the person or property of any officer or member of the society but only against the property of the society; 
(e) any member who is in arrears of subscriptions which, according to the rules of the society, he is bound to pay, or who takes possession or detains any property of the society contrary to those rules, or who injures or destroys any property of the society, may be sued for the arrears or for the damage accruing from his wrongful possession, detention, injury or destruction of that property by and in the name of the society; 
(f) any member of the society who steals, purloins or embezzles any money or other property, or wilfully and maliciously destroys or injures any property of the society, or forges any deed, bond, security for money, receipt or other instrument whereby the funds of the society may be exposed to loss, shall be subject to the same prosecution, and, if convicted, shall be liable to be punished in like manner as any person, not a member, would be subject and liable to in respect of the like offence; 
(g) in the absence of any specific provision in the rules of a society any number not less than three-fifths of the members for the time being resident in Singapore of the society may determine that it shall be dissolved forthwith, or at a time agreed upon, and all necessary steps shall be taken for the disposal and settlement of the property of the society and its claims and liabilities according to the rules of the society applicable thereto, and if none, then as the governing body finds expedient: 
Provided that in the event of any dispute arising among the members of the governing body or the members of the society, the adjustment of its affairs shall be referred to the High Court, and the Court shall make such order in the matter as it thinks fit; 
(h) no society shall be dissolved unless three-fifths of the members so resident as aforesaid have expressed a wish for such dissolution by their votes delivered in person or by proxy at a general meeting convened for the purpose.
 
 
 
Section 36
 
 
 
(1) Where a registered society or any of its officers purporting to act on its behalf is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding, the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the society or the officer will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his defence, require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given.
(2) Where a society is required to give security for costs under subsection (1) and the amount of the security is not sufficient to pay the costs of the defendant - 
(a) the officers of the society who approved the institution of the action or legal proceeding; and 
(b) any person who, on subsequently becoming an officer of the society, does not take any reasonable measure for the purpose of seeking the discontinuance of the action or legal proceeding,
 
 
 
shall be jointly and severally liable for any part of the costs awarded against the society which, after deducting the amount of the security, remains unsatisfied after one month from the date the costs became payable.
 
 
 
In addition s 4 of the Societies Act provides for the registration of a society and the grounds on which registration may be refused. These include situations where the rules of the society are insufficient to provide for its proper management and where the society is likely to be used for unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore. Section 7 provides for the voluntary dissolution of the society. Section 9 stipulates who may be an officer of the society. Section 19 provides for penalties for the misuse of money or property of the society by a member or officer. Section 24 states that the minister may order the dissolution of a registered society, inter alia, if it is used for unlawful purposes or if the society is being used for purposes incompatible with the objects and rules of the society or if the society has contravened any provision of the Societies Act. In the case of a dissolution under s 24, the property of the society vests, by virtue of s 25 in the Official Assignee and any surplus after satisfaction of all its debts and liabilities and the costs of winding up the society shall be paid over to the members of the society unless the minister makes an order for the surplus to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
From all of the above it is clear to us that an unincorporated association registered under the Societies Act as a `society` is very much like a registered trade union under the English Trade Union Acts of 1871 and 1876. The `society` has a registered name and address which it may change, albeit only with the consent of the registrar. It has objects which it may pursue and it may set up branches. Section 35(a) specifically provides that it may hold moveable property through its trustees or governing body and although there is no specific provision regarding the holding of immovable property, we have no doubt that it can do so through trustees. Such property are considered to be a separate fund from the assets of the members, as can be seen from ss 19, 25 and 35. Sections 10, 12 and 36 envisage that the society may act through its agents and officers.
Last but not least by virtue of s 35(b) a society may sue or be sued in its registered name and by reason of s 35(d) where a judgment is obtained against a society, the judgment may only be put into force against the property of the society and not those of its officers or members. Furthermore by reason of s 36, a society commencing an action in its registered name can be ordered to furnish security for the costs of the defendant and only where the amount of the security is shown to be insufficient to pay the defendant`s costs will the officers of the society who approved the institution of the action be held jointly and severally liable for the defendant`s costs in excess of the amount of the security.
It is clear to us from the totality of the provisions of the Societies Act that an unincorporated association registered as a `society` under the Societies Act has sufficient legal personality such that in effect the provisions of the Societies Act have created a `near-corporation` or a `quasi-corporation`. In our judgment, and confining ourselves to the facts of this case, there is no reason why a registered society, may not sue or be sued for defamation. A registered society may have many activities and many objectives which it may pursue. In the words of Scott LJ in 
 National Union of General and Municipal Workers v Gillian & Ors 
`it has some existence, and is something.` It can be wounded and it is capable of having its own reputation. If it is able to pursue objectives and carry out activities, it is possible for defamatory statements to injure it in its ability to carry out such function. So also defamatory statements may directly affect the society by causing a diminution in its funds and its ability to raise subscriptions. In the words of Lord Keith of Avonholm in 
 Bonsor v Musicians` Union 
 it has a collective identity which is distinct from that of its members at any moment in time. The members may change, but the registered society retains its permanent identity. Whether it is called a `near-corporation` or a `quasi-corporation` or having a `collective identity` distinct from its members for the time being or any other thing does not detract from the intention of Parliament to be gathered from the whole of the Societies Act which is to give an unincorporated association registered under the Societies Act as a `society` a legal persona.
It was contended before us that s 34(b) of the Societies Act was purely a procedural provision. That may well be so. In fact Chua J in 
 Workers` Party v Tay Boon Too 
 thought it was. But the question of whether a registered society can sue for defamation in its registered name is not decided by s 34(b) alone but by the combined effect of all the provisions of the Societies Act.
For the foregoing reasons we confirm the learned judge`s decision that the respondents, as a registered society under the Societies Act, have the necessary legal personality to sue for defamation in their registered name.
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals with costs and direct that there shall be only one set of `getting up` fees for the two appeals. The security deposit for costs in each of the two appeals shall be paid out to the respondents to account of their costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the court): The High Court has reserved for decision of this court two questions of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of an appeal before it, the determination of which had affected the event of the appeal. The questions are:
 
 
(1) whether the High Court, exercising its appellate criminal jurisdiction, has the power to amend a charge pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68);and 
 
(2) whether a fresh consent of the public prosecutor is required when a charge preferred under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) is amended by the appellate court.
  
 
 
The relevant facts that gave rise to the questions before us are these. The applicants, who were the appellants (`the appellants`), were at the material time police officers. Before the district court, the first appellant was charged with having corruptly accepted from one Barlly Tan Kim Hock a gratification of a sum of $2,000 as an inducement to recommend that no further action be taken on a complaint against one Leong Kin Eng which the first appellant was then investigating, an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed) (`the Act`). The second appellant was charged with having abetted the first appellant in the commission of that offence by arranging for Barlly Tan Kim Hock to give the money to the first appellant, an offence punishable under s 29(a) read with s 6(a) of the Act. They both claimed trial to their respective charges and were tried jointly. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the respective charges against the appellants were, on application by the prosecution, amended by the addition of alternative charges against the appellants respectively, and fresh consents from the public prosecutor were tendered in respect of the alternative charges. Except for the date on which the offences were alleged to have been committed, the alternative charges were exactly the same as the charges originally framed. The learned district judge called upon the appellants to enter upon their defence on the amended charges and the appellants each gave evidence in their defence. At the close of the case, the learned district judge found them guilty of the alternative charges respectively and convicted them accordingly. The appellants were each sentenced to six months` imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $2,000 and in default of payment to serve a term of imprisonment of one month.
Against their convictions and sentences, they appealed to the High Court. Their appeals were heard before Yong Pung How CJ. In a reserved judgment, reported in 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 701
 , the learned Chief Justice dismissed their appeals. The learned Chief Justice held, inter alia, that the district judge erred in allowing the prosecution to amend the charges by adding the alternative charges against the appellants respectively. He opined that these charges gave rise to a suggestion that there were two separate offences of corruption on the two different dates, namely, 6 and 10 July 1991, when it was clear that the appellants were each being prosecuted in respect of only one offence of corruption which was alleged to have taken place on either of the two dates. The alternative charges were only introduced because the prosecution was unable to pin-point the precise date when the offence of corruption took place. The learned Chief Justice amended the original charges by adding an alternative date of 10 July to the existing date of 6 July 1991 in respect of both the appellants and eliminated the alternative charges. In doing so, he held that fresh consent from the public prosecutor was not necessary. In amending the charges the learned Chief Justice invoked the court`s powers under s 256(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). We shall refer to this provision in greater detail shortly. As amended, each charge averred that the offence took place `on or about the 6th or the 10th day of July 1991`. The appellants were convicted on the amended charges and their sentences were maintained.
After the judgment was delivered, counsel for the appellants made an oral application for the two questions to be reserved for determination by this court under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act as questions of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal, the determination of which had affected the event of the appeal. The application was allowed by the learned Chief Justice, and hence the questions have come before this court.
 Question (1): The High Court`s power to amend a charge
We turn first to s 256 of the CPC which sets out the powers of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. This section, in so far as relevant, provides: 
 
At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may -
 
 
 
(a) ...
(b) in an appeal from a conviction - 
(i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial; 
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or 
(iii) with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Clearly there is no express power conferred by these provisions on the High Court to amend the charge at the hearing of an appeal from the court below. There are two previous decisions to the effect that the High Court in exercising its appellate jurisdiction has no power under this section to amend the charge.
In 
 Quek Ching Kim v R 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 54
 , the accused was convicted before the magistrate`s court of an offence against s 4(c) of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. On appeal to the High Court, a point was taken that the charge was erroneously worded and did not disclose an offence against s 4(c). That was conceded by counsel for the Crown; and it was further conceded by him that he was not entitled to ask the appellate court to amend the charge at that stage. Whyatt CJ, who heard the appeal, agreed with counsel. The learned Chief Justice said, at p 54: 
 
... Counsel for the Crown did not seek to press the point that he was entitled to ask the appellate court to amend the charge at the appellate stage. In adopting this attitude counsel for the Crown stated that he was influenced by the fact that sub-s (2) of s 156 [now s 163] of the Criminal Procedure Code provided that any amendment to a charge should be read and explained to the accused, but since on appeal the accused was not necessarily present, it seemed to follow that the intention was that such amendments could only be made during the proceedings before a magistrate.
 
 
 
I agreed with the view of counsel for the Crown that the charge as worded did not disclose any offence and it was now too late to amend it so as to bring it within the provisions of s 4(c) of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. I accordingly allowed the appeal.
In 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
 , the accused was convicted before the district court of five charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. On appeal to the High Court, it was argued on his behalf and conceded by the prosecution that the fourth charge had not been made out and ought to be set aside. The prosecution then invited the court to act under s 246 (now s 256) of the CPC and substitute `a conviction on the original fourth charge`. Wee Chong Jin CJ declined to do so. He said, at p 198: 
 
The powers of this court sitting as an appellate court are statutory and clearly s 246 [now s 256] gives no power on appeal to alter or amend a charge and accordingly the conviction and sentence on the amended fourth charge cannot stand.
 
 
 
With respect, it seems to us that strictly speaking the prosecution was not asking the court to amend the charge; the prosecution was asking the court to alter the finding made below and in consequence to substitute a conviction of an offence with which he had not been charged for the conviction of the fourth charge which could not be sustained. That, on the authorities which we shall discuss in a moment, the court has power to do under s 246.
The Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6) contains provisions very similar to those of s 256 of the CPC, and the relevant provisions are in the following terms: 
 
316 At the hearing of the appeal the Judge may, if he considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may -
(a) ... 
(b) in an appeal from a conviction or in an appeal as to sentence (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried or committed for trial; or (ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or with or without altering the finding reduce or enhance the sentence or alter the nature of the sentence; 
(c) ...
 
 
 
The Malaysian courts have followed 
 Quek Ching Kim 
. In 
 Lee Swee Tee v PP 
 
 
[1960] MLJ 161
 , the accused was charged with assisting in the `management` of a public lottery contrary to the provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance 1953 and was convicted. On appeal to the High Court, Rigby J held that the charge did not disclose an offence and was bad in law. He held that the accused, on the facts, could and should have been charged with the offence of assisting in carrying on a public lottery, and said, at p 161: 
 
I have seriously considered whether in the interests of justice I ought not to amend the charge at this stage and, on the facts, convict the appellant of what would have been the correct charge of assisting in carrying on a public lottery. But the same point fell for consideration before Whyatt CJ, in the Singapore case of 
 Quek Ching Kim v R
 
 
[1956] MLJ 54
 . His Lordship in that case agreed with the attitude taken by counsel for the Crown that having regard to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code before any amendment to a charge was made such amendment should be read and explained to the accused who should be called upon to plead to the charge as amended. His Lordship, agreeing with the view taken by counsel for the Crown in that appeal, held that it was then too late to amend the charge so as to bring it within the provisions of the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance. In the result, unsatisfactory as it may be, I must hold that the trial and conviction in this case was a nullity and that the conviction must accordingly be quashed.
 
 
 
In 
 Yoong Hock Pin v PP 
 
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 178
 , the accused was charged with criminal breach of trust of a sum of $1,411.25 and the president of the sessions court found that some money had been handed to the appellant which had not been accounted for and convicted the accused. On appeal the High Court entertained some doubts as to the actual sum handed over to the accused and found that the money received by him was $392.21 and accordingly he varied the conviction to one of criminal breach of trust of that sum. He then reserved certain questions for the decision of the Federal Court of Malaysia. The Federal Court held, inter alia, that it was not competent for the learned judge on appeal to amend the charge following the decision in
 Quek Ching Kim 
.
In all these cases, a literal construction of the relevant statutory provision was adopted. On the basis of such construction, the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, would have no power to amend the charge. On the other hand, there are at least two cases where the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction amended the charge. The first is the case of 
 Lew Cheok Hin v R 
 
 
 
[1950] MLJ 131
 , which was decided by Taylor J of the High Court of Singapore. There, the accused was tried on three charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Ord 4 of 1871), each alleging that he obtained delivery of the jewellery by tendering a false cheque. At the close of the case, the prosecution submitted that the offences proved were cheating under s 417 of the Code. The district judge convicted the accused under that section in respect of each of the charges. The district judge considered that an offence under s 417 was a `minor` offence as compared to that under s 420 and he could therefore convict the accused of the offence under s 417 without amending the charge by virtue of s 168(2) (now s 175(2)) of the CPC. On appeal to the High Court, it was argued on behalf of the accused, and conceded by the prosecution, that the view entertained by the district judge was erroneous; but the prosecution submitted that the trial court was authorised to convict the accused of a different offence, without amendment of the charge, under s 166 (now s 172) of the CPC. Taylor J held, first, that on the facts before him the offence under s 417 was not a `minor` offence compared to the one under s 420, and the trial court had convicted the accused of an offence composed of different particulars and that was not authorised by s 168(2). He held, secondly, that s 166 dealt with an entirely different situation, and laid down two tests in applying that section. He said, at p 134: 
 
There are two main tests. First, the facts must be such that the unframed charge was available from the start and could have been framed and tried concurrently under s 165; secondly, the evidence must have been presented in such a way as to raise all the same issues of fact as would have been raised had the unframed charge been framed and trial claimed on it. Not only must the evidence for the prosecution be the same but the court must be satisfied that the evidence for the defence would also have been the same.
 
 
 
Applying the tests to the case before him, the learned judge held that the actual conviction by the court below could not be supported under s 166. However, he held that the charges could and should have been amended below before the close of the case for the prosecution. He then amended the charges during the hearing of the appeal and the amended charges were explained to the accused who claimed trial. His counsel then applied to recall three witnesses for further cross-examination on the amended charges, and that was allowed. The witnesses were recalled and were further cross-examined. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned judge found their evidence consistent and was satisfied that the offences finally charged had been established and he convicted the accused accordingly. Although he considered in some depth the powers of the court in convicting the accused of an offence with which the accused had not been charged, he did not consider the question of the power of the court at the appellate stage to amend the charge. He proceeded on the basis that he had the power to do so.
The other case is a Malaysian case, 
 Siah Ik Kow v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 217
 . There, the accused was convicted by the magistrate of two charges, the first of using a motor car for carriage of goods for trade without a haulage permit and the second of so using the motor car without the relevant policy of insurance. The second charge, however, was expressed to be under a certain statutory provision, which did not exist. Chang Min Tat J at the hearing of the appeal amended that charge by correcting the reference to the relevant statutory provision. He said, at p 217: 
 
There is of course no section or r 74(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks) Rules 1959 published under LN169 of 1959. Clearly the offence alleged to be committed came under s 74(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance and was punishable under s 74(2). No objection was taken to the charge either at the trial or at the appeal. In the circumstances of the case and in particular having regard to the fact that the appellant was not misled, the mistake had not occasioned any failure of justice and I now amend the second charge to bring it under s 74(1) and s 74(2) of the Road Traffic Ordinance.
 
 
 
The learned judge also did not consider the question whether he had the power to amend the charge; he proceeded on the basis that he was empowered to do so.
We now revert to the decision of the learned Chief Justice in the instant case. The learned Chief Justice declined to follow the two previous decisions of the High Court of Singapore: 
 Quek Ching Kim 
 and 
 Wee Toon Boon 
 (supra). He held that the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has the express power under s 256(b)(ii) of the CPC to alter the finding made by the court below and on the basis of that power the High Court in several cases had suggested that it could alter the findings and convict the accused on a `substituted charge`: 
 Ng Ee v PP 
 
 
 
[1941] MLJ 180
 ; 
 Lim Teck Seng v R 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 71
 ; 
 Sivalingam v PP 
 
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
  and 
 Periasamy v PP 
 
 
 
[1993] 2 MLJ 551
 . He said, at p 722: 
 
I am mindful that neither the prosecution nor the defence has voiced any objection to an amendment to the charges, save that the defence contends that the Attorney General`s fresh consent is required. I have already clarified my views on this contention. I should state nonetheless that in doing so, I respectfully decline to follow the decisions of 
 Quek Ching Kim v R
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 54
  and
 Wee Toon Boon v PP
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
 . In these cases, it was held that the High Court, acting in its appellate capacity, could not amend the charge. In 
 Wee Toon Boon
, no reasons were given for Wee Chong Jin CJ`s ruling. In 
 Quek Ching Kim
, it was conceded by the prosecution that the court could not convict the accused on an amended charge. Whyatt CJ agreed that this was because s 156 (now s 163) CPC requires the amended charge to be read and explained to the accused, and it was not necessarily the case that the accused would be present on appeal. It appears that Whyatt CJ`s concern was because the accused might then wish to tailor his evidence to the amended charge or to adduce fresh evidence or recall witnesses.
 
 
 
With respect, the reason given in
 Quek Ching Kim 
 is not persuasive. Where a custodial sentence is involved, the accused is bonded to appear in the High Court whenever he lodges an appeal against his conviction. There is thus no question of his absence from the High Court when his appeal is being heard, unless the sentence was a fine only. Furthermore, there are authorities which suggest that the High Court may `alter the finding` pursuant to the current s 256(b)(ii) CPC and convict the appellant on a substituted charge (see 
 Ng Ee v PP 
 
 
 
[1941] MLJ 180
 , 
 Lim Teck Seng v R 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 71
 , 
 Sivalingam v PP 
 
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
 , and 
 Periasamy v PP 
 
 
 
[1993] 2 MLJ 551
 ). It is hard to see why the High Court may not also `alter the finding` by convicting on an amended charge. After all, substituting a charge surely has more far-reaching consequences than amending a charge.
The learned Chief Justice drew support for his conclusion from the Malaysian cases. It is necessary to examine these cases in some detail. In 
 Ng Ee v PP 
 
 
 
[1941] MLJ 180
  the accused, an omnibus conductor, was charged with and was convicted of having caused the omnibus under his charge to be used in contravention of the condition of the licence in respect of such vehicle by conveying 17 instead of 16 passengers, an offence under s 80(6) of the Road Traffic Enactment. On appeal, Cussen J held that the evidence on which the charge was based in no way indicated or supported such an offence. The prosecution, however, applied to the court to alter the conviction to one of an offence under rr 3 and 65 of the Public Service (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment and Use) Rules 1937, submitting that the facts before the court proved that an offence under these rules had been committed. Cussen J after examining the evidence found that that offence had not been proved. He therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction. In the course of his judgment in dealing with the application by the prosecution to substitute a conviction for the one under appeal, he said, at p 181: 
 
Now, the provisions of s 316(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 6) [which was the equivalent of s 256(b) of our CPC] which empower this court in an appeal from a magistrate`s court to `alter the finding ...` do allow of the substitution of a conviction under a different provision of the law for the conviction found by the magistrate, to substitute the right section for the wrong section. It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same - that the prosecution evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused`s defence the same.
 
 
 
What Cussen J said there is in substance what Taylor J had said but in somewhat more precise language in the passage of the latter`s judgment in 
 Lew Cheok Hin 
 
 
[1950] MLJ 131
  which we have quoted above.We agree in principle with what Cussen J said on the caution to be exercised in substituting a conviction for the one under appeal. However, the learned judge, with respect, appeared to be confusing the power of the court to alter a finding made by the court below with the power to substitute a charge for that which had been preferred against the accused in the court below. There was no question before him of substitution of one charge for another. The court below found that the offence under s 80(6) of the Road Traffic Enactment had been committed and convicted the accused accordingly. That conviction was unsustainable on the evidence. The prosecution then invoked the court`s power under s 316(6) and asked the court to find that the accused had committed an offence against rr 3 and 65 of the Public Service Vehicles (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment and Use) Rules, ie to alter the finding below, and accordingly to substitute a conviction of the latter offence for that under appeal. The basis for this is clearly that under ss 167, 168 and 169 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 6) [the equivalents of ss 173, 174 and 175 of our CPC] the trial court in certain circumstances could, on the evidence adduced, convict an accused of an offence for which he had not been charged. In our opinion, 
 Ng Ee 
 is not an authority to the effect that the High Court, in exercising the power under s 256(b)(ii) to alter the finding and in consequence to substitute a conviction for the one under appeal, is convicting the accused on a `substituted` charge.
In 
 Lim Teck Seng 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 71
 
 , 
 the accused was charged with inconsiderate driving contrary to s 5 of the Motor Vehicles (Driving Offences) Proclamation. At sessions court amended the charge to a more serious one of negligent driving contrary to s 4(2) of the Proclamation. On appeal, the question before the High Court was whether the court below was justified in amending the charge in those circumstances. Rigby J held that it was unjust in those circumstances for a more serious charge to be substituted for the charge then preferred against the accused, and he accordingly altered the conviction from one under s 4(2) of negligent driving to one under s 5 of driving without reasonable consideration and convicted the accused of the latter offence. We do not find that decision of any assistance on the issue before us.
We now come to 
 Sivalingam 
 (supra)
 . 
 There, the accused was charged before the sessions court under s 420 of the Penal Code and was convicted. On appeal, the High Court found that an offence under s 420 was not proved, but the court was satisfied that an offence under s 409 was established. The High Court therefore `substituted the charge` under s 409 for the charge on which the accused was convicted. A question of law was reserved for the Federal Court of Malaysia for determination as to whether the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction could substitute the charge under s 409 for that under s 420 without having regard to ss 158 and 162 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (the equivalents of ss 163 and 167 of our CPC). The matter directly before the Federal Court was the scope of the power of the High Court under s 316(b) [which is the equivalent of s 256(b) of our CPC] and in particular the power to alter the finding below. Abdul Hamid FJ delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 173: 
 
... Now the appeal before the learned judge was an appeal from a conviction, and evidently, as we can see, there is a specific provision under our law that empowers a judge to alter a finding. The pertinent question that calls for determination, however, is the scope of such power.
 
 
 
We refer firstly to 
 Mallal`s 
 
 Criminal Procedure Code 
 (4th Ed) at p 466 where it is stated that: 
 
`The finding which an appellate court may alter under para (b) may relate to an offence with which the prisoner was charged in the court below or to one of which he might be convicted without a distinct charge.`
 
 
 
The reason for this seems obvious. If for example, the prisoner is charged in the court below with a charge under s 420 of the Penal Code or with s 420 and alternatively under s 406 of the Penal Code and is convicted under s 420 in an appeal against the conviction, the appellate court may, provided the facts support either charge or the alternative charge, as the case may be, alter a finding and substitute a conviction for a different offence, for example, with one under s 406 Penal Code. That power to alter is derived from s 167 of our Criminal Procedure Code [s 173 of our CPC] which provides for the conviction of another offence a person is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it provided however the case is one that comes within the confines of s 166 of our Criminal Procedure Code [s 172 of our CPC] and there is evidence to support the conviction for that different offence.
 
 
 
The learned judge continued, at p 174: 
 
Our law clearly allows the judge of a High Court in an appeal against conviction to alter a finding. Section 316(b) provides that power. This is consistent with s 26 of the Courts of Judicature Act ... . Certain provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code general in nature are also relevant for purposes of hearing such appeals. Sections 166 and 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code are examples of such provisions. In hearing an appeal from a conviction the power of the judge to alter a finding must in our view be exercised subject to ss 166 and 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code [ss 172 and 173 of our CPC].
 
 
 
The requirement of ss 166 and 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code must be satisfied before a High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction alters or substitutes a conviction for a different offence. Although therefore an appellate court is possessed of the power which it can lawfully exercise, it is equally essential that such power be exercised within the confines of the law. The question is to what extent and under what circumstances such power can be invoked. What is clear in our minds is, and we emphasise, that such power must be exercised under limited circumstances and with great caution subject to the restriction imposed by s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and it must be done so as not to prejudice the case of an accused.
Thus far, we respectfully agree with what Abdul Hamid FJ said on the scope of the court`s power `to alter the finding` made below. However, with respect, in the ensuing paragraph he appeared to have treated a substitution of a conviction on the basis as if a substituted charge had been preferred against the accused. He said at p 174: 
 
In our view 
 Ng Ee
`s case was correctly decided and to warrant a substitution there must be clear evidence that a case for the substituted offence would have been made out or established against the accused in the court below. To put it in another way before there can be an alteration of a finding the appellate court must be satisfied that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge, the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded have been same. Further, if the substituted charge was one of the charges preferred against the accused or was an alternative charge the prosecution evidence would have been sufficient to satisfy the elements to constitute the charge and the accused`s evidence must have been substantially unchanged in that the accused`s defence would have been the same.
 
 
 
The learned judge was clearly not dealing with the question of amendment of a charge or for that matter the substitution of one charge for another. He said immediately after the above paragraph, the following, at p 174: 
 
We hasten to observe that we are not dealing with the question of amendment of the charge by a judge on appeal. We do not therefore see any necessity to deal with 
 Yoong Hock Pin v PP
 
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 178
 . In this regard we do not consider s 158 and s 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code referred to in the question reserved relevant to the determination of the question. Section 158 deals with the power of the court to alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced and as such cannot apply to the issue at hand which essentially is related to and concerned with the question of the power of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. Section 162 is a consequential provision dealing with recall of witnesses after an alteration of a charge.
 
 
 
There are two reported cases where our High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction altered the finding made by the court below and substituted a conviction for the one under appeal. In 
 Ng Eng Huat v PP 
 
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 417
  the accused was charged in the subordinate court with (i) negligence in reversing a car and colliding into the front portion of another car and (ii) giving a false report about the accident to the police. He was convicted on both the charges. On appeal it was argued, inter alia, that in relation to the first charge what he had done was not a negligent act but an intentional and deliberate act and therefore the trial court had erred in convicting him of the offence under s 336 of the Penal Code. Chua J accepted the submission but he found that on the evidence the accused had committed an offence under s 352 of the Penal Code. Having come to that finding the learned judge applying the tests laid down by Taylor J in 
 Lew Cheok Hin 
 substituted a conviction under that section for that under s 336 of the Penal Code.
Next, in 
 Cheong Seok Leng v PP 
 
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 481
  the accused was convicted in the subordinate court of the offence of desertion under s 15(1) of the Vigilante Corp Act (Cap 80, 1970 Ed). On appeal to the High Court by the accused, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) found, inter alia, that on the evidence the accused had not committed the offence of desertion under s 15(1) but had committed an offence under para 10 of the schedule to s 20 of the Act. He therefore substituted a conviction under para 10 of the schedule for the conviction under s 15(1) of the Act. The learned judge said, at p 493: 
 
... I think the defence succeeds. However, on the evidence, it is abundantly clear that he was absent without leave from his place of duty. He was under a lawful duty to report to and remain at Civil Defence School II even though he was not under a lawful duty to undergo civil defence training. It is, therefore, clear that the appellant had committed an offence under para 10 of the schedule to s 24 of the Vigilante Corps Act which provides for the offence of absence without leave in the following terms:
 
 
 
`10 Absents without leave or good cause from service or from the place where he is lawfully required for the time being to be.`
 
 
 
In the circumstances, I substitute for the conviction under appeal a conviction under s [20(1)] of the Vigilante Corps Act of being absent from the place where he was lawfully required for the time being to be.
 
 
 
In our opinion, it is not correct to say that when the High Court exercises its power under s 256(b)(ii) to alter the finding and substitute a conviction for the conviction under appeal, the court is in effect convicting the accused on a `substituted` charge. The scope of such power allows the court in appropriate cases, where it finds that the accused did not commit the offence with which he was charged but had committed an offence on which no charge has been preferred against him to alter the finding below and in consequence to substitute a conviction of the latter offence for that under appeal. In effecting this substitution the court is convicting the accused of an offence with which he has not been charged. The finding which the appellate court may alter under s 256(b)(ii) may relate either to the offence with which the accused was charged and convicted in the court below or to one which he might or could have been convicted without a distinct charge: 
 Golla Hanumappa & Ors v Emperor 
 1912 ILR 35 Mad 243 at p 246. The power to substitute a conviction of an offence with which the accused has not been charged for the conviction of the offence on which he has been charged is limited to those circumstances set out in ss 173, 174 and 175 of the CPC. The High Court as an appellate court can only do that which the court below can do and should have done under ss 173, 174 and 175 of the CPC: 
 PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny 
 
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 885
  and 
 Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP 
 
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
 .
The question still remains whether it is implicit in s 256(b) of the CPC that the High Court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction has the power to amend the charge. If a literal and strict construction is adopted, it is clear that the High Court has no such power. However, such a construction would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. Further, the High Court has the revisionary powers under ss 266-268 of the CPC. In view of these extensive express powers, it is inconceivable that it was the intention of the legislature that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, should not have the power to amend the charge preferred against the accused and set the record straight. A more purposive construction should in our view be adopted. We think that such power is by necessary implication implied in s 256(b). In the result, our answer to the first question is in the affirmative, subject to what we have to say below.
The power that an appellate court has in amending a charge under s 256(b) of the CPC is not unlimited and obviously such power has to be exercised with great caution and not to the prejudice of the accused. The same tests laid down by Taylor J in 
 Lew Cheok Hin 
 and Cussen J in 
 Ng Ee 
 substituting a conviction for the one under appeal are, subject to necessary modifications, appropriate and applicable to the exercise of the power of amendment of a charge. The purpose of these tests is to prevent any prejudice to the accused.
Reverting to the instant case, we agree with the learned Chief Justice on the amendments of the charges. The amendments only took the form of an insertion of the alternative date 10 July to the date of 6 July with the effect that the charges alleged that the appellants committed the offences respectively either on 6 or 10 July 1991. The amendments satisfy fully the tests laid down by Taylor J and Cussen J and could not possibly prejudice the appellants` defence at the trial. The learned Chief Justice considered the safeguards the court should bear in mind in exercising the power of amendment. He said, at p 723: 
 
In short, the court must be certain that the amendment should not affect the substance of the evidence given in the proceedings below. There is no practical utility in requiring the charge to be read and explained again to the accused, since there is no question of him seeking to tailor his evidence or adduce fresh evidence to meet the amended charge.
 
 
 
We should add that even if the amendments to the charges were not made or ought not to have been made by the learned Chief Justice, the convictions of the appellants would still stand. The error made by the district judge to add the alternative charges is immaterial. It is amply clear from the terms of the original charges and the alternative charges that the appellants were charged with having committed the respective offences either on 6 or 10 July 1991. We do not see how it can be argued that the appellants would have been misled by such an error. Nor can it be said that the appellants would have been prejudiced by it. Section 162 of the CPC, in our opinion, would apply in respect of such an error. That section reads: 
 
No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission.
 
 
 
 
 Question (2): Whether the public prosecutor`s fresh consent is required
 
Before the district judge, fresh consents from the public prosecutor were tendered before amendments were made to prefer the alternative charges against the appellants. On appeal before the learned Chief Justice it was argued that if he were minded to amend the charges, as he did, fresh consents would have to be obtained as the amendment would bring in new or different charges. With respect, such an argument had absolutely no merit and the learned Chief Justice was justified in rejecting it. The amendments made by the learned Chief Justice were to eliminate the alternative charges and to add the alternative date of 10 July 1991 to the date of 6 July in the original charges. The amendments to the charges so made by the learned Chief Justice did not bring in new or different charges. The consent which has been obtained from the public prosecutor fully covered the charges including those which have been amended. It was quite evident that the alternative date had been reflected in the second set of consents tendered at the close of the prosecution. In our judgment, with reference to this case specifically, no fresh consent from the public prosecutor is required arising from the amendments to the charges made by the learned Chief Justice. The learned Chief Justice said, at p 721: 
 
Reverting to the present case, the public prosecutor has given his consent to prosecution in clear terms and has specified the appropriate charge in each case. The essential facts have also been set out in the consents and the charges from the outset. They have remained unchanged. Indeed, consents from the public prosecutor were in fact obtained twice, for both the original charges as well as for the amended alternative charges. The amendments which I propose to make do not bring the charges beyond the scope of the PCA, nor do they seek to introduce any material new facts. In the circumstances, I see no reason why the public prosecutor`s consent should be obtained a third time.
 
 
 
We are in entire agreement with him. Both sets of consents were clearly sufficient to indicate that the public prosecutor had consented to the prosecution of the appellants for the offences they each committed.
We turn to consider the second question more generally. In our opinion, much depends on the extent of the amendments of the charge. In this connection, the crucial question is whether the amendments proposed to be made would take the charge outside the scope of the consent already given. Clearly amendments such as merely in respect of the date or time would not. On the other hand, if the amendments introduce a new set of material facts or introduce a different offence such amendments would generally take the charge outside the scope of the consent, in which case a fresh consent is required. Hence, our answer to the second question is in the negative unless the amendment or proposed amendment would take the charge, as amended, outside the scope of the consent originally given.
Our answers to both the questions in this case do not in any way affect the conclusion arrived at by the learned Chief Justice, namely, that the appellants stand convicted on the amended charges and the appeals before him ought to be dismissed. His decision therefore stands.
Order accordingly.",1996-01-31 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

The appellants were both former directors of Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd (IPH). They were each convicted in a district court on three charges of having conspired with each other to commit criminal breach of trust as agents of IPH, contrary to s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charges averred that over three separate durations in 1989, being directors of IPH, and being entrusted in such capacity with dominion over IPH`s funds, they did dishonestly use such funds in violation of s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1988 Ed) (CA), thereby causing IPH to disburse sums totalling $8,453,629.20 to Aquiline Pacific Ltd (APL), a company incorporated in Hong Kong. I allowed their appeals and ordered that their convictions be quashed. I now give my reasons for doing so.
 The charges 
The appellants were originally charged with having dishonestly misappropriated the moneys from IPH by causing the moneys to be disbursed to APL, which moneys APL was not entitled to. These charges were amended on the first day of trial to state that the appellants had dishonestly misappropriated the moneys by causing the moneys to be disbursed to APL without consideration emanating from APL. The charges were finally re-amended to their present form on the 17th day of trial, before the respondent closed its case.
Section 405 of the Penal Code defines the elements of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The re-amended charges drew on the following elements of s 405: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with ... dominion over property, ... dishonestly uses ... that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged ... commits `criminal breach of trust`.
 
 
 
For ease of reference, I shall refer to this as the `direction of law` limb of s 405. The direction of law allegedly violated by the appellants was s 157(1) of the CA, which states: 
 
A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.
 
 
 
In the district court, the appellants argued unsuccessfully that the charges were bad in law. They argued that the incorporation of s 157(1) CA into the charges effectively introduced a different mens rea (ie `honesty` under the CA and/or lack of reasonable diligence) which constitutes a separate offence under s 157(3) CA. Accordingly, there was a departure from the concept of `dishonesty` as defined in s 24 of the Penal Code, which reads: 
 
Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.
 
 
 
The concepts of `wrongful gain` and `wrongful loss` are explained in s 23 of the Penal Code thus: 
 
`Wrongful gain` is gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining it is not legally entitled.
 
 
 
`Wrongful loss` is loss by unlawful means of property to which the person losing it is legally entitled.
 
 
 
By way of explanation, s 23 further states: 
 
A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property, as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.
 
 
 
On appeal, both appellants reiterated their submission below that s 157(1) CA cannot constitute a direction of law for the purposes of the `direction of law` limb of s 405 of the Penal Code. Counsel submitted that the concept of `honesty` bears different meanings under s 157(1) CA, and under s 405 of the Penal Code. It was not disputed that the former term covers a wide spectrum of obligations relating to a director`s fiduciary duties. The only mens rea required for a s 157(3) CA offence is knowledge that what is being done is not in the interests of the company, adopting Gowans J`s views as expressed in 
 Marchesi v Barnes & Keogh 
 [1970] VR 434. In breaching a director`s duty under s 157(1) CA, an objective test would apply to determine whether the act or omission in question was done honestly, in the interests of the company. Counsel submitted that in contrast, the term `dishonestly` under s 405 Penal Code has to be assessed by a two-stage process. This embraces both an objective test of `dishonesty` and a subjective appreciation that the act or omission was `dishonest`. A dishonest intention is a sine qua non for proof of criminal breach of trust. An offence contrary to s 157(3) CA 
 simpliciter 
 would not constitute criminal breach of trust.
Counsel submitted that the respondent`s attempt to marry the concept of `honesty` in s 157(1) CA with that of `dishonesty` in s 405 of the Penal Code resulted in a real danger of prejudice to the appellants. They were at risk of being convicted for criminal breach of trust on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty under s 157 CA. As a consequence of the manner in which the charges had been framed, the focus shifted from whether there was `dishonesty` as defined in s 24 of the Penal Code to whether the appellants had acted honestly and with reasonable diligence. In effect, the respondent was asserting that a breach of directors` duties under s 157 CA was evidence of wrongdoing or dishonesty, being the `unlawful means` employed which would establish an offence under s 409 of the Penal Code. Adopting this approach, the district judge`s treatment of the evidence and her findings were materially affected.
In her grounds of decision, the district judge noted that similar charges to the re-amended charges had been framed in cases such as 
 Tay Choo Wah v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 95
 ; 
 PP v Tan Koon Swan 
 
 
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 18
 ; and 
 Tong Keng Wah v PP 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 152
 . Counsel submitted that 
 Tay Choo Wah 
and 
 Tong Keng Wah 
 were not authorities to this effect. While reference to s 157(1) CA was made in the grounds of decision of the district court in 
 Tay Choo Wah`s 
 PARA> case (Magistrate`s Appeal No 45 of 1975, unreported), it was unclear whether the prosecution had relied on it as the relevant direction of law violated in that case. Counsel further emphasized that in 
 Tan Koon Swan`s 
 case, the accused had pleaded guilty and the issue of the legality of the charges was never addressed.
In reply, the DPP argued that the offence created under s 157(3) CA was not identical to, nor inconsistent with, a s 409 Penal Code offence. Relying on 
 R v Sinclair 
 [1968] 3 All ER 241, he argued that the appellants were dishonest in having taken a `dishonest risk` with the entrusted funds, such a risk being one which was not in the best interests of IPH. The DPP clarified that he was not arguing that mere negligence would suffice to prove a charge under s 409 of the Penal Code. He submitted that s 157(1) CA could constitute a direction of law for the purpose of s 405 of the Penal Code in so far as it compelled company directors to use entrusted funds in the best interests of the company. In imposing this duty, s 157(1) is the `mode` in which the trust is to be discharged. As for the allegations of potential prejudice, he submitted that the appellants had suffered no prejudice since the charges were specific about the amounts of moneys used and the purposes to which they were applied.
Perhaps the only case where a charge similar to the present ones was proceeded with was 
 Tan Koon Swan 
 . However, as counsel correctly pointed out, the accused pleaded guilty in that case. There were no arguments as to the propriety of the charge. In the other two cases cited by the district judge, it was unclear whether the prosecution did in fact rely on s 157(1) CA. In 
 Tay Choo Wah 
and 
 Tong Keng Wah 
 , both judgments of the High Court contain no reference to this section, whether in relation to the charge or otherwise. Hence, it was still necessary to consider whether reliance on these cases was well-founded.
For the purposes of the present appeals, the basic elements of an offence of criminal breach of trust relying on the `direction of law` limb were as follows:
 
 
(a) the accused must be entrusted with property; 
 
(b) the accused must have been dishonest (ie the 
 mens rea 
 of the offence); 
 
(c) the accused must have used the entrusted property in violation of a direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged (ie the 
 actus reus 
 of the offence).
  
 
 
The appellants accepted the proposition that directors of a company are trustees as to the company`s moneys which are under their control, and that they can be proceeded against for misapplication of these moneys. The main difficulty arose in relation to the characterization of the actus reus in the charges. Does the direction of law which is alleged to be violated (s 157(1) CA) expressly prescribe any specific 
 mode 
 as to how the appellants were to deal with the entrusted property? The requirement for some degree of specific direction as to the mode in which the trust is to be discharged is apparent from a perusal of illustration (e) to s 405, which states: 
 
A, a collector of Government money, or a clerk in a Government office, is entrusted with public money, and is either directed by law or bound by a contract, express or implied, with the Government, to pay into a certain treasury all the public money which he holds. A dishonestly appropriates the money. A has committed criminal breach of trust.
 
 
 
The following passage from Gour (
 Penal Law of India 
(10th Ed) Vol 4 at p 3503) is also instructive in indicating the bounds of the `direction of law` limb in s 405: 
 
The treasurer in a bank or Government Treasury is bound to account to his official superior all sums received and paid out by him. The same obligation is cast upon other servants of Government who have, in the course of their employment, to receive and make payments. They would be, therefore, guilty of this offence if they, in violation of the direction of law, convert to their own use property or money with which they are so entrusted within the course of their employment. But 
 such direction of law must be express and explicit and it must prescribe the mode in which the property or money is to be used or disposed of ... .
In order to place a person under an obligation to account, there must be not only an obligation legally created, but it must, moreover, prescribe the mode in which it is to be discharged. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
 Sathiadas v PP 
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 241
 , Raja Azlan Shah J suggested, obiter, that the direction of law allegedly violated could be `express or implied`. The learned judge stated at p 243: 
 
The offence (of criminal breach of trust) is complete when there is dishonest misappropriation or conversion to one`s own use, or when there is 
 dishonest user in violation of a direction, express or implied, relating to the mode in which the trust is to be discharged.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
With great respect, the interposition of the phrase `express or implied` as set out in the passage cited above may be misleading, in so far as it suggests that the direction need not be explicit or stated with precision. The learned judge appears to have obtained the phrase from another limb of s 405 which refers to violation of `any legal contract, express or implied`. The `legal contract` limb specifies a separate and distinct actus reus. The distinct limbs of s 405 are set out for the sake of clarity as follows: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, ... dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation:
 
 
 
(a) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or
(b) of 
 any legal contract, express or implied 
, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust...
 
 
 
It is clear that the phrase `express or implied` therefore has no application to the `direction of law` limb of s 405. Azlan Shah J did observe, however, that the direction of law had to stipulate a 
 particular purpose 
 for the use of the property. In the learned judge`s opinion: 
 
.. mere retention of money would not necessarily raise a presumption of dishonest intention but it is a step in that direction. 
 The fact that money entrusted to be used for a particular purpose, was not used for such purpose
; that there was retention for a sufficiently long time would, together with other facts and circumstances justify the inference that the appellant had dishonestly misappropriated or converted the money to his own use. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
I would concur with the learned judge`s opinion that the property has to be `entrusted to be used for a particular purpose`. Correspondingly, the respondent has to show that it was `not used for such purpose`. Taking its natural and ordinary meaning, the word `mode` in the `direction of law` limb connotes that there must be a degree of specificity in the direction of law in question. It should not be construed so expansively as to extend to a general direction to `act honestly`. On this analysis, there was clearly serious difficulty with the respondent`s reliance on s 157(1) CA in the present case. This section mirrors a director`s general fiduciary duty at common law. This is evident from the case law cited (see 
 Re Kie Hock Shipping (1971) Pte Ltd 
 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 411
 ; 
Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd & Ors
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 282
  ; 
 Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd 
[1925] Ch 407 and 
 Byrne v Baker 
 [1964] VR 443). No doubt, s 157(1) CA stipulates a legal obligation. However, a review of the relevant cases fortifies my view that it is inappropriate to frame charges relying on the `direction of law` limb of s 405 unless a specific mode of discharging the trust is prescribed.
Counsel for the second appellant relied on 
 PP v Yeoh Teck Chye 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  as an example of a case falling within the `direction of law` limb of s 405. In this case, the second accused was entrusted with the funds of the Bank Buruh (Malaysia), of which he was its manager. He was actually charged with having dishonestly used the funds `in violation of a legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust`, rather than with having acted in violation of any direction of law. In any case, dicta in 
 Yeoh Teck Chye`s 
case suggest that had the charge been one under the `direction of law` limb, the relevant direction must be precise and specific. As Wan Suleiman FJ opined at p 178: 
 
A government functionary holding money on behalf of his principal would for instance have 
 precise directions of law (the Financial General Orders and the Financial Procedure Act, etc) prescribing the manner of disposal of the money.
 We are however, inclined to favour (the) view that no law governs or prescribes the manner in which accused 2, a bank manager, may dispose of the bank money entrusted to him as a manager. The prosecution would therefore have to prove that there had been a breach of contract (express or implied) on his part touching the discharge of the money entrusted to him.. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
 
 
 Tong Keng Wah 
 
`s case, which was cited by the district judge and relied upon by the respondent, further buttresses the view that the word `mode` in s 405 should be interpreted narrowly. The appellant in this case was a police inspector who was charged with committing criminal breach of trust of a service revolver and 12 rounds of ammunition. He had been dismissed from the Force but he had failed to deliver up these items subsequently, contrary to the express requirements of s 24(1) of the Police Force Act (Cap 78) (PFA), which read: 
 
Every police officer who by resignation, dismissal, discharge or otherwise leaves the Police Force, shall before leaving deliver up in good order (fair wear and tear only excepted) any arms, ammunition, accoutrement, uniform or other article supplied to him and any other property belonging to the Government which may be in his possession.
 
 
 
Section 24(2) of the PFA created a specific offence for non-compliance with s 24(1). The appellant argued that the charge was improper, and that he should have been charged under s 24(2) PFA instead of s 406 Penal Code. This was rejected by Chua J on appeal, who went on to uphold the validity of the charge and affirm the appellant`s conviction. It is clear that the charge involved the violation of a direction of law which prescribed a specific mode for the appellant to deal with the entrusted property; he was to deliver up the property in his possession in good order before his departure from the Force for any reason. It was not simply a general direction, such as one exhorting the appellant to maintain good order and discipline, which would be akin to the s 157(1) CA direction to `act honestly`.
The facts in 
 Mohamed Adil v PP 
 
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 151
  may well support a charge of criminal breach of trust relying on violation of a direction of law. The appellant was a headmaster who had misappropriated certain sums from the salaries of his teachers. This was in violation of the Financial General Orders 122(3), under which he was required to pay these sums by crossed cheque to the Malay Teachers` Co-operative Society. The charge was perhaps somewhat deficient, since it only alleged that the appellant, `being entrusted with certain property, to wit, $1,457.50, committed criminal breach of trust and .. thereby committed an offence punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code`. It appears that the particulars to support the charge were set out in a schedule to the original charge. Accordingly, there was no real discussion whether the offence involved a violation of a direction of law. Nonetheless, the facts in 
 Mohamed Adil 
 would provide a clear example of when a charge averring use of property in violation of a direction of law may be properly framed.
 Murni b Haji Mohamed Taha v PP 
 
 
 [1986] 1 MLJ 260 
 is also illustrative. In this case, the appellant was the paymaster and accounting officer of an army camp who was convicted on a charge of criminal breach of trust. He was entrusted with public money and was to use cheques issued by the Treasury to pay serving soldiers their salaries. The prevailing practice, originally laid down in State Financial Regulations which had since been revoked, specified a system for disbursement of moneys from the Treasury and the appellant`s duties as paymaster. These regulations had remained in use as a matter of administrative practice. Deficiencies were discovered in the accounts submitted by the appellant. The magistrate found that these arose because the appellant had misappropriated the moneys from cheques issued by the Treasury, in breach of the directions in the regulations. The court upheld his conviction, finding that the regulations, as adopted, were part of a contract of service between him and the Government of the State. Presumably, had the regulations remained in force, he would have been properly convicted for having used the moneys in violation of those directions of law, which expressly provided for the specific mode in which the trust was to be discharged.
The above cases demonstrate that the charges in the present case were anomalous, as no particular mode for discharging the trust is prescribed by s 157(1) CA. Another difficulty with the respondent`s approach in the present case was the potential danger of confusing the mens rea with the actus reus. Referring to the `legal duty` which is constituted by the direction of law prescribing the mode of discharging the trust, Gour has observed at p 3502: 
 
.. the mere violation of such duty .. is not criminal, 
 unless it was at the same time dishonest, and it manifested itself in some overt act
, such as (a) misappropriation, (b) conversion to one`s own use, (c) or disposal of the property. 
 The mens rea constituting criminality here consists then, of dishonesty and violation of the legal .. obligation, but the act following upon such a state of mentality must be a positive act.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
These observations make it clear that the mens rea and the actus reus of the offence should be separately addressed. The criminal intent must be accompanied by an `overt` or `positive` act. The re-amended charges amounted to an allegation that the appellants had dishonestly used property in violation of a direction to act honestly. In effect, the actus reus is `using property dishonestly`. This blurs the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of criminal breach of trust to an unacceptable degree. The resulting circularity in reasoning is evident from the respondent`s reliance on 
 R v Sinclair 
, and the argument that the appellants were dishonest in having taken a `dishonest risk` with the entrusted funds, such a risk not being in the best interests of IPH. Alongside this, the respondent contended that the actus reus was the breach of directors` duties, and the fact that the appellants had placed themselves in a position of conflict of interest.
In my opinion, 
 Sinclair 
 `s case was of little assistance to the respondent. The concept of `dishonesty` considered in that case is not subject to any statutory definition. In contrast, the definition of `dishonesty` stated in ss 23 and 24 of our Penal Code have to be addressed in the present case. As I will subsequently explain, the district judge`s assessment of the evidence of `dishonesty` along these lines was not satisfactory. The mens rea of dishonesty is not proved by merely showing that the appellants had placed themselves in a position of conflict of interest, or that they had failed to act in the best interests of IPH. Similarly, the actus reus under the direction of law limb of s 405 is not made out simply by showing that the appellants had breached directors` duties, or even that they had not acted in IPH`s best interests. Not every offence contrary to s 157(3) CA simpliciter constitutes criminal breach of trust. It is conceivable, however, that in appropriate circumstances, serious breaches of s 157(3) CA may well fall within the scope of s 409 Penal Code. Nonetheless, for the reasons I have stated earlier, this does not mean that it will be appropriate to employ s 157(1) CA as the `direction of law` allegedly violated in order to support a charge of criminal breach of trust.
In the circumstances, I accepted the appellants` submission that the re-amended charges were materially defective, in that s 157(1) CA was welded to s 409 of the Penal Code. The general exhortation contained in s 157(1) CA cannot constitute a `direction of law` for the purpose of s 405 of the Penal Code, since s 157(1) CA does not prescribe any specific mode in which the trust is to be discharged. From the manner in which the re-amended charges were framed, the appellants were seriously prejudiced in that they were at risk of being convicted, and were convicted, of criminal breach of trust under s 409 of the Penal Code on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty under s 157(1) CA.
On the basis of the charges being defective alone, the appeals would have been allowed. Notwithstanding this, I was also satisfied that the principal findings of the district judge were against the weight of the evidence. In this connection, it is necessary to highlight the key aspects of the evidence, to which I now turn.
 The respondent`s evidence 
The gravamen of the respondent`s case was that the appellants had acted in breach of s 157(1) CA, the breach being so serious as to constitute the offence of criminal breach of trust. The main aspects of the respondent`s case were as follows. The appellants had conspired to dishonestly use funds belonging to IPH for the purchase of three blocks of shares in Lucky Man Properties Ltd (LMP). LMP was a public-listed company, incorporated in Hong Kong. The respondent contended that the appellants had initially wanted to purchase the LMP shares themselves but could not afford to do so. The LMP shares were then locked in complex and expensive litigation in Hong Kong. LMP itself was voluntarily de-listed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, pending the outcome of the litigation. The appellants, however, saw the prospect of LMP being relisted and its share prices escalating, and considered that it would make a worthwhile investment. Their original intention was to acquire the LMP shares for themselves, but they realised that they lacked the necessary funds to do so.
The appellants, together with Sia Leng Yuen (Sia), a director and one-third shareholder of APL, devised a scheme whereby IPH would provide the funds to buy the shares, or to settle the claims of the contesting parties so as to free the shares for acquisition. Sia was also a director and shareholder of Causeway Investments Ltd (Causeway), one of the parties to the claims against LMP. APL was the chosen vehicle for the purchase and Sia`s skills as a negotiator would be utilised. APL itself was formed in January 1989, having previously taken the name of Moorfield Ltd, a company which was purchased by Sia and the second appellant in 1988. At all material times, neither of the appellants was a registered shareholder or director of APL.
Sia gave evidence of the appellants` `spiritual shareholding` in APL. He understood that the appellants each had an unregistered one-third beneficial interest in APL. He treated them as partners of APL `in spirit`. In January 1989, Sia had proposed to the second appellant to bring in the first appellant as a shareholder of APL. Pursuant to this proposal, the second appellant had written to the first appellant on 20 January 1989 (exh P18) to request for payment of $5,000 for his proposed shareholding in APL. The relevant portions of P18 read: 
 
... The paid up of the company is to be HK$60,000 which is about S$15,000. Please issue me a $5,000 cheque and I will issue a $10,000 cheque to SIA. He will make out his own cheque of $15,000 to the bank - we will in no way be connected with the paid-up.
 
 
 
The first appellant did give a cheque for $5,000 to the second appellant only four days after P18 was sent. The first appellant`s DBS Bank account statement for January 1989 (exh P41) was produced to support this contention. The respondent argued that this permitted the inference that the payment was meant to secure the first appellant`s share in APL. There was no evidence that the second appellant had sent any money to Sia. Sia himself said that APL`s capital was never paid up.
According to the respondent, the motive in using APL was to make a profit for APL, which would be shared equally between the appellants and Sia. LMP transactions were the only business conducted by APL. Pursuant to the scheme, the first appellant approached the Board of IPH on or about 15 May 1989 for a mandate to acquire LMP shares within the price ceiling of $2.90 per share. By a directors` circular resolution (exh PB90), the appellants and Gopinath Pillai, a fellow director of IPH, were authorized to act as follows: 
 
... to negotiate and conclude the acquisition of a significant strategic stake in Lucky Man Properties Limited of not less than 40% and not more than 92% of the issued and paid-up capital of Lucky Man Properties Limited at an all in price of HK$2.90 per share and other terms and conditions they may in their discretion think expedient in the interest of the company (ie IPH).
 
 
 
In addition, they were authorized to: 
 
...do all such acts, take all such steps and to enter into all agreements, arrangements, undertakings, indemnities and guarantees as they may deem necessary or expedient in order to finalize and give full effect on the said proposed investment.
 
 
 
A second directors` circular resolution in substantially similar terms was subsequently obtained from the full board of IPH directors on 20 September 1989 (exh PB106). The respondent contended that after the circular resolution in exh PB90 was obtained, the purchases of the LMP shares were made in secrecy. APL was used to purchase two blocks of LMP shares, amounting to 8,424,000 (the 8,424,000 block) and 1,937,984 shares (the 1,937,984 block) in June 1989 and October 1989.
As far as Lional Tseng, IPH`s company secretary and financial controller, was aware, he was told by the first appellant that the intended acquisition would be put on hold sometime on or about 6 June 1989. Unknown to Lional Tseng, APL entered into simultaneous sale and purchase agreements with two Malaysian-registered companies, Lambang Maju Sdn Bhd `Lambang Maju) and Wartakaya Sdn Bhd (Wartakaya) to sell them the LMP shares. APL`s sale of the first block of 8,424,000 shares was evidenced by two agreements (exhs PB57 and PB153), both dated 28 June 1989, which recorded the sale of 1,924,000 and 6,500,000 shares respectively from APL to Lambang Maju. Another block of 1,937,984 was acquired from APL by Wartakaya in October 1989 (exh D4).
Briefly, the mechanics of the flow of IPH`s funds were as follows. Between 19 to 20 June 1989 and 16 July 1990, a total of $8,453,629.20 was remitted by IPH to Innovest Bhd (IB), which was IPH`s Malaysian-incorporated holding company. IPH had an arrangement with IB whereby IPH would provide loans to IB. Remittance would be through a moneylender arrangement, employing Innovest Credit and Leasing Sdn Bhd (ICL), a subsidiary of IB. The respondent adduced evidence of this arrangement through Mohamed Sirajudeen s/o Mohamed Salahudeen of ICL, who testified that IPH remitted these funds. It was not documented, however, that these remittances were for the purchase of the first two blocks of LMP shares, comprising 8,424,000 and 1,937,984 shares respectively. In addition, remittances were also made for IPH to acquire a third large block of 24 million shares. The 10% deposit moneys for this block were sent directly by IPH to Hong Kong with the knowledge of Lional Tseng and Gopinath Pillai.
The Notes Issuance Facilities (NIF) Covenant which IPH had entered into with its bankers stipulated that inter-company loans between IPH and its holding company IB could not exceed $12m. The respondent contended that it was not made known to either Lional Tseng or Gopinath Pillai prior to the end of December 1989 that any of the remittances were for the purchase of the 8,424,000 and 1,937,984 blocks of LMP shares on behalf of IPH. As such, the remittances were recorded as loans, thus causing the NIF covenant to be breached. This risked IPH`s credit facilities being revoked by the banks.
Moreover, up to the end of 1989, there was no attempt by the appellants to draft any documents to show that the shares were indeed bought and held in trust for IPH. In December 1989, Lional Tseng enquired what the inter-company loans between IPH and IB were for. It was only then that Lim Cheng Seng, financial controller of IB, informed Lional Tseng about the purchase of the two blocks of LMP shares, and the fact that Malaysian nominee companies were holding the shares on trust for IPH. Prior to this, Lional Tseng and Gopinath Pillai had no knowledge of the existence of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya or about the acquisition of the two blocks of LMP shares. The respondent therefore contended that the appellants` concerns with maintaining secrecy and minimizing disclosure of the proposed acquisition were only consistent with some guilty purpose. The fact that a secret code with reference to the acquisition plans (exh PB44) was used between the appellants and Sia in their communications supported this contention.
In February 1990, Lambang Maju entered into a sale and purchase agreement (exh PB128) and executed a trust deed (exh PB160) on the 8,424,000 block of shares in favour of Top Text Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IPH. As for the block of shares acquired by Wartakaya, this was also passed on to IPH as documented in a sale and purchase agreement dated 15 December 1989 (exh PB120). The respondent emphasized the fact that APL had bought the shares at HK$1.82 and HK$2.40 per share for each of the blocks respectively but had resold them to Lambang Maju and Wartakaya at the higher price of HK$2.58 per share. There was a mark-up of HK$0.76 and HK$0.18 per share respectively. From this price difference, the appellants stood to, and did, make secret profits in their capacities as beneficial shareholders of APL.
The respondent contended that the true reason for using Lambang Maju and Wartakaya (the Malaysian companies) was to prevent IPH from discovering how its funds were actually being used. The Malaysian companies were actually the appellants` private vehicles. Depending on the prevailing circumstances, if it suited their purpose, the appellants could have the option of claiming the LMP shares as their own if the share prices went up. In the alternative, they could claim that the Malaysian companies were holding the shares on trust for IPH as secret nominees if conditions were not favourable.
In support of the contention that the appellants had employed the Malaysian companies as their private vehicles, the respondent pointed to four letters of indemnity which the first appellant had issued in his personal capacity to the directors of these companies (exhs P19 to PB22). In addition, the sale and purchase agreements between the Malaysian companies and IPH or Top-Text contained put options which enabled IPH to require the Malaysian companies to buy back the LMP shares in the event that LMP was not relisted. The respondent contended that such options were inconsistent with any alleged nominee arrangement.
Sia said that had the entire acquisition been successful, APL stood to gain some HK$309m. In any event, Sia said that there was a profit or interim surplus of US$450,000 derived from APL`s sale of the first block of 8,424,000 shares to the Malaysian companies. According to his understanding, this profit would be distributed equally between the appellants and himself. Sia testified that he gave US$300,000 to the second appellant on or about 6 July 1989 for distribution, when the transaction relating to the 8,424,000 block was concluded. This was on his understanding that the appellants were his partners in APL `in spirit`. Sia`s evidence was that he encashed a bank draft for HK$7.2m with the office of Malayan Banking Berhad in Hong Kong in the second appellant`s presence, and subsequently handed over the US$300,000 to the latter.
 The appellants` defences 
The common thread in both appellants` defences was that they were acting in IPH`s interests, actuated by genuine commercial concerns. The appellants argued that the proposed acquisition of LMP shares was always fully disclosed to IPH. By the directors` circular resolution (exh PB90), they, together with Gopinath Pillai, their fellow director, had a valid mandate for the acquisition of the LMP shares. They had merely acted in accordance with that mandate.
The first appellant emphasized that the original plan was for Ocean Hope Ltd (Ocean Hope), IPH`s Hong Kong subsidiary, to acquire the first block of 8,424,000 LMP shares from APL. Lional Tseng advised that upon execution of the proposed Sale and Purchase Agreement for these shares, a public announcement had to be released immediately as Ocean Hope was IPH`s wholly-owned subsidiary. Under Part V of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) Listing Manual, disclosure was necessary where transactions exceed 5% of `the value of the assets acquired ... compared with the assets of the acquiring ... company`, and for this purpose, the SES `may aggregate separate transactions and treat such transactions as if they were one transaction if they were all completed within a short period of time`. As for the block of 24 million shares, attempting to acquire this block would trigger the Hong Kong Takeover Code requirement for IPH to make a general offer to all the remaining shareholders for their shares.
The appellants contended that there was a genuine commercial concern with minimizing disclosure of IPH`s acquisition plans. Accordingly, at an early stage in the discussions, a secret code in communications was used (see exh PB44). Making a public announcement after acquiring the 8,424,000 and 1,937,984 blocks of shares might be prejudicial to the subsequent acquisition of the 24 million block of shares. Disclosure of IPH`s interest in acquiring the shares could lead to the possibility of other parties acquiring the remaining shares or that of the owners of the remaining shares raising their asking price. As for the block of 24 million shares, the first appellant did not want to make a general offer for all of the shares, as IPH was not in any financial position then to make such an offer.
The first appellant sought unsuccessfully to meet with the SES for a waiver of the disclosure requirements. Thereafter, in June 1989, Lional Tseng went to Kuala Lumpur to meet him, Lim Cheng Seng and Carol Chan (both of IB) to discuss how to avoid making a disclosure or announcement of the purchase of the LMP shares. Lim Cheng Seng and Lional Tseng came up with the idea of using nominee companies outside the IB Group to purchase the shares for IPH, instead of Ocean Hope. This would involve sending IPH`s moneys to the nominees in Malaysia via inter-company loans to IB. The first appellant sought the advice of Lee Choon Wan, a lawyer with M/s Nik Hussain & Partners, a Kuala Lumpur law firm, and approved of this proposed arrangement. Shortly after the meeting, upon the first appellant`s instructions to look for suitable nominee companies, Lambang Maju and Wartakaya were purchased `off the shelf` by Lim Cheng Seng or Carol Chan.
APL would be used to act as an intermediary on IPH`s behalf in the purchase of the LMP shares. APL would act as a buffer or shelter, and Sia`s skills as a negotiator as well as his insight into the LMP litigation could be effectively utilized. APL was formed sometime in January 1989 for the purpose of doing business in China. It was previously known as Moorfield Ltd, a company which Sia and the second appellant had acquired. The second appellant subsequently withdrew from the registered shareholding of Moorfield. The registered directors and shareholders of APL were Sia (33% shareholding), Hatsuo Otsuki (33%), Radius Christanto (33%) and Tan Sok Khee (1%). Hatsuo Otsuki and Radius Christanto were both friends and business associates of the second appellant, while Tan Sok Khee was holding a 1% share as nominee for the second appellant`s secretary, one Doris Seow.
According to the appellants, the advantage of using the Malaysian companies was that they were private companies which were not subject to SES` rules on disclosure. Had Lambang Maju gone on to purchase the 24 million block of shares, it would still have to make a general offer on completion in accordance with the Hong Kong Takeover Code. Unlike IPH, however, it had greater flexibility as it did not have to give any undertaking to the merchant bankers that it had sufficient resources to make a general offer. It did not have to issue a circular to its shareholders seeking their approval to buy the 24 million shares. In short, the Malaysian companies, being private companies, could delay complying with obligations under the Hong Kong Takeover Code and possibly even avoid them.
The second appellant denied that he had conspired with the first appellant as alleged by the prosecution. He asserted that IPH had been fully apprised of the LMP transactions. His duties with regard to the LMP matters were piecemeal and intermittent. He had very little to do with the LMP shares. He declared that his motivations came from his duties as director of IPH. Where he was involved in the LMP acquisition, such as arranging for payment on the 24 million block of shares, his actions clearly showed that he was protecting IPH`s interests.
Exhibit P46 was a fax transmission which the second appellant had sent to Lim Cheng Seng of IB dated 1 November 1989, in which mention was expressly made of `Labanmaju`. The second appellant maintained, however, that there was nothing incriminating in this. He knew nothing about the use of Lambang Maju as a secret nominee company of IPH at the material time. He maintained that he was merely passing on a message to Lim Cheng Seng which he had received from Kan Tien Siong of Causeway Investments. His ignorance explained why he could not even spell `Lambang Maju` correctly.
Both appellants contended that they were not beneficial shareholders in APL. Sia`s evidence of their `spiritual shareholding` was vague and unreliable. The first appellant submitted that there was insufficient evidence pointing to his involvement in APL. In particular, there was no evidence which showed that he had received any share of the alleged US$300,000 profits derived from the share sale by APL. The second appellant denied having received the US$300,000. He submitted that his conduct clearly showed that he was acting only in IPH`s interests. This was inconsistent with any allegation that he had any interest in APL. As for APL`s role in the transactions, the appellants maintained that Sia was the one actually in control of APL. It was Sia`s idea to use APL as a buffer or shield against the litigating parties in Hong Kong. This would avoid getting IPH embroiled in negotiating a settlement of the Hong Kong litigation. In this way, IPH could obtain the LMP shares `clean` and not rouse suspicion of an impending takeover.
 The decision below 
The district judge`s principal findings were as follows. She found that the appellants had succumbed to the temptation of potential immense profits should LMP be relisted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. She found that the appellants were `determined at all costs to acquire the shares`, and hence decided on a scheme which they knew from the outset was clearly improper, placing themselves in a position of conflict of interests and using IPH`s funds to make a wrongful gain for themselves.
The district judge saw no reason for secrecy or any covert measures unless the appellants had something to hide. She found support for her views from the appellants` use of a code in their communications (exh PB44). She observed that once they had obtained the mandate for the acquisition of the LMP shares, `all caution was thrown to the winds` as the appellants proceeded to take risks with IPH`s funds pursuant to their scheme. They were not mindful of breaching IPH`s NIF covenant. At one point, IPH was on the verge of insolvency, a state caused partly by the appellants` handling of the LMP acquisition.
The appellants had explained that the reason for using APL to buy the shares from LMP was to avoid IPH being enmeshed in the negotiations and litigation and payment of costs and other expenses to free the shares for sale. The district judge doubted that this was the real reason. She went on to observe that the appellants` uneasiness about any suggestion that they had recommended the use of APL to buy the LMP shares was sufficient in itself to indicate that APL was a company in which each of them must have had a personal interest. She found that each appellant clearly had an undisclosed one-third shareholding in APL. She found that the second appellant was in control of APL. Among other things, he opened a bank account for APL, and he ensured that its debts were paid and he set up his own friends to front the company. He took it upon himself to supervise its secretarial duties.
There was no evidence that the first appellant had any control over APL`s affairs, but the district judge found clear evidence that he also held a one-third interest. She inferred this from: (i) Sia`s evidence of his belief in the appellants` `spiritual shareholding` of APL; (ii) the contents of exh P18, which was a fax from the second appellant updating the first appellant on APL and requesting him to the issue a cheque for $5,000 for APL`s share capital; (iii) the first appellant`s bank account (exh P41) which showed the payment of $5,000 into the second appellant`s account only four days after the fax in exh P18. The first appellant had made a bare statement that he could not remember why he paid $5,000 to the second appellant. The district judge found it `incredible` that he had not ascertained what the payment was for, when he was facing criminal charges for which he could be sentenced to 14 years` jail.
Turning next to Sia`s alleged payment of US$300,000 to the appellants, the district judge noted that apart from Sia`s own evidence to this effect, there was the evidence of the second appellant`s driver, one Ismail bin Sampan (DW8). DW8 recalled one particular occasion when the second appellant had personally given him a sealed envelope containing a stack of cash with instructions for him to deliver it to the first appellant. The second appellant claimed, however, that he had regularly handed cash to DW8 for transmission to the first appellant. The second appellant said that these were routine loans of cash for the first appellant`s use at the Singapore Turf Club. He suggested that the first appellant`s payment of $5,000 to him in January 1989 was merely a repayment of previous loans and was part of this arrangement. DW8 could not recall any occasion on which the second appellant had asked him to hand over money to the first appellant other than on the particular occasion when he was given the sealed envelope. The district judge therefore found it `absolutely clear` that DW8 had spoken the truth and that the second appellant had lied about the reasons for the payment of the $5,000 to him. She considered that the second appellant`s lies reinforced the respondent`s allegation that the appellants had undisclosed shareholdings in APL.
The district judge noted that IPH`s funds were used not only to acquire the LMP shares from APL at $2.58 per share, but to pay for the costs of settlement, of litigation, of legal advisers and other expenses to be incurred by APL. She found that this was clearly a use of IPH`s funds without the knowledge of the other directors of IPH. From the finding that the appellants held undisclosed interests in APL, the district judge opined that they intended to and did make staggering profits in using IPH`s funds to acquire the LMP shares and subsequently selling them to IPH at a marked-up price. It was not even necessary for LMP to be relisted before they could stand to make these profits.
To ensure secrecy lest their true intentions be revealed, and to circumvent the need for disclosure and the takeover obligations, the appellants made use of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya to buy the shares from APL. The district judge commented that the first appellant`s need for secrecy was `clearly obsessive`. He was determined to withhold information of the acquisition while enriching himself secretly. If LMP was not relisted, the appellants, as shareholders of APL, would make no additional gain or loss and they could simply let IPH take over the shares, on the premise that the Malaysian companies were its `nominees`. But if LMP had been relisted, and the share prices escalated to the anticipated levels, the appellants could claim that the Malaysian companies were not IPH`s nominees but really their private vehicles, in order to claim the shares for themselves.
The first appellant`s plans were `thrown into disarray` by Lional Tseng in December 1989 when the latter queried Lim Cheng Seng about the inter-company loans. It was only then that Lional Tseng was first informed about the purchase of the two blocks of LMP shares and the existence of the Malaysian companies. Lim Cheng Seng was thus compelled to state in exh PB124, a fax sent to Lional Tseng on 10 January 1990, that the Malaysian companies were holding these two blocks of shares on trust for IPH.
The district judge found that IPH did suffer huge losses as a result of the sale and purchase of LMP shares, while APL had made a considerable profit of over HK$8m. She concluded that the appellants had knowingly placed themselves in a position of conflict of duty and interest. They had put their interests before those of IPH, and had used IPH`s funds to enrich themselves personally. LMP did eventually achieve a relisting and its share prices did surge to nearly triple what IPH had paid. However, the relisting was not achieved by the appellants` efforts but by those of unconnected third parties. In the district judge`s view, even if the appellants had achieved a relisting, their actions were no less criminal. They were found guilty on each of the charges and convicted and sentenced to serve an aggregate term of four years` imprisonment each.
 The appeal 
On appeal, the appellants sought primarily to show that the principal findings of fact which the district judge arrived at were unsupportable and against the weight of the evidence. The following key issues were raised in their submissions:
 
 
(1) the motives behind the LMP acquisition; 
 
(2) the appellants` interests in APL; 
 
(3) the use of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya;
  
 
 
 
 (1) The motives behind the LMP acquisition
 
Counsel for the first appellant submitted that a `commercial` interpretation of the documentary evidence and the undisputed evidence would yield a more objective portrayal of the entire transaction. The appellants` explanations, viewed in this light, would show that there had never been an ulterior motive behind the LMP acquisitions.
In any case, the appellants submitted that there was a fair measure of transparency in their conduct of the matter. They had brought the attention of the IPH Board to the available blocks of LMP shares from the very beginning. It was implausible that they should have done that if their covert plan was to somehow acquire the shares themselves ultimately. One of the IPH directors, Dato Mokhzani, had been told by the first appellant about the use of nominees since August or September 1989. Numerous professionals and employees had been involved in giving advice about the purchase of the shares. These included Lee Choon Wan from Nik Hussain & Partners, Rothschilds Merchant Bank and also Chang See Hiang from Khattar Wong & Partners. IPH itself was openly putting up funds for the payment of the 10% deposit on the 24 million block of shares in September 1989. Gopinath Pillai clarified that he had never maintained that things were kept hidden from him.
Lional Tseng`s queries about the inter-company loans arose only because proper documentation would be required at year`s end for auditing purposes. Lambang Maju and Wartakaya were not the appellants` private vehicles, but only resorted to once it was clear that Ocean Hope was still bound to make disclosure about any purchase of the shares. There was no way the appellants could possibly have claimed the LMP shares for themselves, contrary to what the district judge found. It would simply not have been possible to have used millions of dollars of inter-company loans for a secret purpose. The first appellant thus submitted in his petition of appeal as follows: 
 
On a proper interpretation of this case, your petitioner was concerned with acquiring Lucky Man for IPH without disclosing the build-up of its stake in the company. The case was about non-disclosure and not about seeking to acquire personally the Lucky Man shares.
 
 
 
The first appellant maintained that he sought to avoid disclosure of the purchases for genuine commercial reasons. He had acted in IPH`s best interests in seeking to avoid the takeover obligations. He unsuccessfully sought a meeting with SES for a waiver of the disclosure requirements. APL was only used because IPH needed a Hong Kong company to act as an intermediary on its behalf. APL would act as a buffer or shelter and ease administration and registration in Hong Kong of the purchased shares. Khattar Wong gave its blessing to this course of action. APL had the added advantage of already being associated with IPH through Aquiline Resources, with whom it had a joint venture in Tianjin. Moreover, Sia was regarded as a good negotiator who had a valuable insight into the LMP litigation as well as a good relationship with the potential vendors of the shares.
The second appellant`s primary contentions were not unlike those of the first appellant. He submitted that IPH was never kept in the dark. They had disclosed their intentions openly and had obtained a proper mandate from the IPH Board. The use of a secret code in communications (exh PB44) was devised only to ensure that the LMP acquisition was not sabotaged by parties unfriendly to Causeway, and by extension, to IPH`s interests. The only object of the LMP acquisition was to purchase an affordable listed company in Hong Kong for IPH as part of its strategic expansion plans.
 (2) The appellants` interests in APL
The first appellant submitted that Sia`s evidence about their beneficial interest in APL had to be evaluated carefully. Between 1988 and April 1989, APL was the private business of Sia and the second appellant, handling fast-food projects in China. To secure some `international financial and corporate muscle` for their proposed China ventures, Sia asked the second appellant to obtain the first appellant`s support and assistance. It was in what the second appellant describes as the `second stage`, in May 1989, that APL became IPH`s agent in Hong Kong for the purchase of LMP shares. Sia never gave evidence that the second appellant`s involvement was sought or required for this activity. In any event, Sia`s evidence was no more than a `belief` that the first appellant had accepted the second appellant`s invitation to be involved in APL`s China business.
Sia himself had maintained that the capital for APL was never paid-up. The evidence that the first appellant had paid $5,000 to the second appellant on or about 25 January 1989 could not be sufficient to show that he thereby became a shareholder of APL. The first appellant stated that he could not remember what the payment was for. He submitted that his inability to remember was perfectly understandable given that the relevant bank statement was only produced during his cross-examination, more than five years after the payment had been made. He had never had any opportunity to ascertain what the payment was meant for.
The district judge found that the second appellant had lied about the reasons for the payment of the $5,000, and that such lies only reinforced the respondent`s contention that both appellants had an interest in APL. The first appellant submitted that the district judge erroneously imported her findings about the second appellant`s lies into the evidence against the first appellant, a co-accused. Finally, there was no evidence that the first appellant had ever received any share of the alleged profit distribution of US$450,000.
In addition to aligning himself with the first appellant`s submissions, the second appellant further emphasized that when APL was formed in January 1989, it had nothing to do with the acquisition of LMP shares. The intention at that time was for APL to do business in China. APL`s shareholders such as Hatsuo Otsuki and Radius Christanto were not merely his `front-men`, but were businessmen of considerable standing, participating in their own rights in the shareholding. In any case, the second appellant maintained that his conduct at all material times showed that he was acting solely in IPH`s interests. As for the significance of exh P18, the second appellant submitted that the first appellant did not respond at all to P18. Sia had also testified that the second appellant did not revert to him in relation to P18. Sia had only assumed that the appellants had agreed to participate in APL. Moreover, P18 was written in January 1989, in the context of investment in business opportunities in China. This was well before any of the LMP transactions took place.
Sia`s evidence of the appellants` `spiritual shareholding` in APL was vague and nebulous and thus unreliable. As for the alleged US$450,000 profit distribution, Sia`s own computation of the expenditure and costs incurred in the LMP acquisition left no room for any surplus or profit. In any event, Sia himself had agreed that any profit received had to be ploughed back into APL. Sia had also claimed that the second appellant was with him at the Hong Kong branch office of Malayan Banking Berhad when the cheque for US$450,000 was encashed. Yet, the branch manager of Malayan Banking Bhd, Wong Kim Leng, had testified that he could not recall any occasion when he saw Sia and the second appellant together at the bank.
 (3) Use of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya
The first appellant submitted that the plan to use nominees had been discussed between Lim Cheng Seng and the first appellant, and the advice of Lee Choon Wan of Nik Hussain & Partners had been sought. Dato Mokhzani had been told about the proposed use of nominees. The first appellant submitted that Lambang Maju and Wartakaya were clearly IPH`s nominees since they had sold to IPH or its subsidiaries the shares at the same price that APL had sold to them. In addition, there was undisputed evidence that two of the three blocks of shares were held on trust for IPH by Lambang Maju and Wartakaya. As for the third block, comprising 24 million shares, Lambang Maju was IPH`s nominee for that contract. The mere fact that a personal indemnity had been given by the first appellant to the directors of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya did not mean that these companies were his private vehicles. After all, the first appellant had been authorized under the circular directors` resolutions (exhs PB90 and PB106) to `take all such steps and to enter into any ... indemnity and guarantee` which he deemed necessary to finalise and give full effect to the proposed investment.
The second appellant clarified that he was not involved nor present at the discussions between the first appellant and Lim Cheng Seng relating to the use of Lambang Maju and Wartakaya. He was not involved in the purchases of the 8,424,000 and 1,937,984 blocks of shares.
 Analysis of the submissions 
On my understanding of the grounds of decision, the district judge based her decision to convict the appellants on four main premises. First, she found that the appellants were inexplicably obsessed with secrecy and non-disclosure in the way they conducted the LMP transaction. Secondly, they held undisclosed beneficial interests in APL. Thirdly, the arrangement to use Lambang Maju and Wartakaya was a sham, since these companies were not IPH`s nominees but were really the appellants` private vehicles. Finally, the appellants had acted dishonestly and had intended to obtain, and did obtain wrongful gains for themselves, while IPH had suffered wrongful loss as a result of the use of its funds for the LMP acquisition. With respect to the district judge, I did not think these findings could be supported on the evidence.
(i) `Dishonesty`
A myriad of evidence was presented at trial. Nevertheless, the issues on appeal were fairly clear. Leaving aside the difficulty with the charges, the pivotal consideration was whether the appellants had acted `dishonestly`. This had to be determined with reference to s 24 of the Penal Code. Dishonesty may be established by showing that the appellants had done acts `with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person`, as spelt out in s 24. The concepts of `wrongful gain` or `wrongful loss` have to be examined within the rubric of s 23 Penal Code, ie according to whether there was gain (or loss) by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining (losing) it is not legally entitled, or is legally entitled, as the case may be. It would be insufficient to merely show that the appellants had acted in breach of directors` duties, contrary to s 157 CA.
(ii) The merits of the decision to acquire LMP shares
It was evident that much reliance was placed by the respondent on what was perceived to be the inherent risks involved in the LMP acquisition. According to the respondent, the appellants had committed IPH to what was, on hindsight, a `disastrous` course of action, motivated by the prospect of making secret profits from the scheme. This was endorsed by the district judge in her grounds of decision. She considered that `all caution was literally thrown to the winds in the way the two accused persons took risks with IPH`s funds pursuant to their scheme`. In effect, the district judge adopted the respondent`s arguments and imputed dishonesty from the fact that financial risks were taken by the appellants.
With respect, even if the appellants had taken risks with IPH`s funds, it would still be necessary to determine whether there was `dishonesty` within the meaning prescribed by s 24 read with s 23 of the Penal Code before charges alleging criminal breach of trust can be established. The respondent was still bound to show that they had done so using `unlawful means`, within the meaning of 23 of the Penal Code. The appellants could not be said to have been `dishonest` unless this was established beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent approached this task by attempting to show that the appellants had acted in violation of s 157 CA. Contravention of s 157 CA was the `unlawful means` whereby the appellants made their `wrongful gains`, and the charges were framed in corresponding terms. I did not consider this approach to be appropriate, for the reasons stated earlier.
Even assuming that the charges were correctly framed, I was of the view that there was no real evidence of the appellants` dishonesty to be gleaned from the merits of the decision to acquire LMP shares. Directors may take risks with the company`s property where they honestly believe that to do so is in the interests of the company. It is settled law that if directors take risks which no director could honestly believe to be taken in the interests of the company, such actions could well support allegations that the directors in question had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties to the company. However, this would not carry the respondent`s case very far. It was not enough for the respondent to suggest that the appellants were dishonest in having taken risks with the entrusted funds, such risks not being in the best interests of IPH. The respondent could only maintain that the acquisition would have imposed financial constraints on IPH, and that there was still uncertainty surrounding the status of the ongoing litigation in Hong Kong. Yet, the appellants had explained that the entire purpose of the acquisition was to enable IPH to acquire a listed vehicle `on the cheap`. It was not as if the LMP acquisition would inevitably be a loss-making enterprise.
In the circumstances of the case, in order for the respondent to extract any inference of `dishonesty` out of the merits of the decision to acquire LMP shares, it would have to show that the degree of risk involved in the venture was palpably unreasonable. I was not satisfied that the respondent could establish this. If the decision to acquire LMP shares had been palpably unreasonable, the mandate to acquire the shares would not even have been obtained from the IPH Board. In this connection, I noted that in the directors` circular resolution (exh PB90), the three signatories were the first appellant, Dato Mokhzani and Herman Hochstadt. It was not simply a case of the two appellants endorsing their own scheme. The second resolution (exh PB106) was in fact signed by the full Board of IPH`s directors. In addition, the defence had adduced evidence to indicate that if the acquisition had gone through successfully and IPH had held on to the shares until LMP was eventually relisted, the investment would have been considered worthwhile. In all probability, there would not even have been any prosecution.
(iii) The implications of non-disclosure and secrecy
The district judge stated that she found the first appellant`s reasons for secrecy and non-disclosure to be `contradictory and not convincing`. In my opinion, the reasons offered by the appellants for requiring secrecy and refraining from disclosure were not as unconvincing as the district judge suggested. From a lay person`s perspective, the need for secrecy may have appeared questionable. I agreed with counsel`s submission, however, that the commercial realities of such transactions had to be carefully considered. It was perfectly plausible that if LMP`s shareholders, as well the share market, were to perceive a takeover bid, this would have been prejudicial to IPH`s acquisition plans. In particular, the constraints imposed by IPH`s financial arrangements would mean that if the share prices should be raised on account of the perceived demand for shares, the entire acquisition could well be abortive. Regrettably, the district judge gave no weight at all to the appellants` explanations.
On the basis that there was no genuine reason for non-disclosure or secrecy, the district judge found that the appellants had sought to conceal dishonest motives. In spite of this, it was clear that IPH was told about proposed acquisition of LMP shares. The IPH Board had authorized the acquisition plan. The block of 24 million shares was clearly meant to be bought by IPH directly from APL. The other two blocks of shares were also referred to in documentation such as exhs PB94, 95, 96, 97, 98, in respect of the block of 8,424,000 shares and exh PB82, in respect of the block of 1,937,984 shares. Moreover, advice from numerous professionals, such as merchant bankers as well as law firms in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, was obtained. Draft agreements for the proposed acquisitions were prepared. Dato Mokhzani testified that he was in fact told that nominees would be used as part of the arrangement. The first appellant even wanted to meet with the SES to discuss the possibility of waiving the disclosure requirements. All this supported the appellants` contentions that while they were concerned about undue disclosure of their acquisition plans, there was a fair amount of transparency in the arrangements. It was unfortunate that no adequate consideration was given to these aspects by the district judge.
There was, of course, no way that IPH could avoid disclosure altogether to SES or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, once a takeover was imminent. The appellants acknowledged this. They readily admitted that they were endeavouring to get around or at least delay complying with the SES` rules pertaining to disclosure. It may also be pertinent to consider the fact that IPH had been advised of their takeover obligations by Rothschilds and Khattar Wong. This may have only been in respect of the block of 24 million shares, and not for the 8,424,000 or 1,937,984 blocks. Nonetheless, if the appellants had truly had any questionable motives, surely such a course of action would not even have been adopted.
The evidence suggested that the first appellant, in particular, may have been overzealous or even `obsessive` in his concern about disclosing the build-up of IPH`s stake in LMP. The district judge was quite prepared to draw adverse inferences from what she considered to be the first appellant`s `obsessive` need for secrecy. She also stated that the appellants` uneasiness about any suggestion that they had recommended the use of APL to buy the LMP shares was sufficient 
 alone 
 to indicate that they had personal interests in APL. With great respect, the district judge`s readiness to draw such a conclusion was somewhat alarming. The basis for this conclusion was surely far too tenuous and even speculative. This was a clear indication that her overall assessment of the appellants` evidence may not have been entirely objective.
I noted that a major plank in the respondent`s case was the fact that, to quote the learned DPP, `IPH, in the form of Lional Tseng` did not know about the acquisition of the initial two blocks of shares, or the use of nominee companies. Gopinath Pillai also testified along similar lines. Curiously, Gopinath Pillai also stated that he did not maintain that things were kept hidden from him. I could only infer that Gopinath Pillai`s evidence was really neutral as to whether the appellants had committed any dishonest acts. It appeared to me, however, that too much reliance was placed on Lional Tseng`s ignorance of these matters. Lional Tseng was the company secretary and financial controller, but the appellants were not accountable to him for their actions. They were not obliged to keep Lional Tseng updated at every turn when each of them had been validly authorised to act in the acquisition of the LMP shares.
In any case, after Lional Tseng made his queries about the inter-company loans, he was immediately informed by Lim Cheng Seng about the mechanics of the LMP acquisition. There was no prevarication on Lim Cheng Seng`s part. This was not the type of response one might have expected from Lim Cheng Seng if indeed the appellants had engineered a covert plan which had been unceremoniously exposed. All in all, the evidence did not support the inference that the appellants` concerns for non-disclosure or secrecy must have served to conceal a guilty purpose.
(iv) The allegations of `dishonesty`
According to the respondent, the incriminating aspects of the evidence, apart from Sia`s testimony, consisted largely of the contents of exh P18 - the letter from the second appellant requesting the first appellant for payment of $5,000, as well as the fact that the first appellant did give the second appellant a $5,000 cheque four days later, as evidenced by his bank statement (exh P41). These were said to support the contention that the appellants had some undisclosed beneficial interests in APL.
The contents of exh P18 certainly required some explanation. The district judge rejected the appellants` claim that exh P18 was merely meant to convey Sia`s proposals and was not followed up with. As counsel for the appellants rightly pointed out, the district judge did not give adequate consideration to the context in which exh P18 was sent. In January 1989, the LMP acquisition was not even on APL`s agenda. APL was then involved in obtaining fast-food franchises in China. APL`s involvement for the LMP acquisition only evolved in May 1989.
It was critical to examine Sia`s evidence on this count. He testified that the appellants were treated only as partners `in spirit`, whatever that may connote. To his knowledge, APL`s share capital had never been paid up. He never obtained any response from the second appellant as to the proposal for the first appellant`s participation in APL as contained in exh P18. I found it exceedingly difficult to attach any weight to Sia`s ubiquitous references to the appellants` `spiritual shareholding` in APL. The issue was not who Sia believed to be APL`s `spiritual shareholders`, but whether there was any real evidence of the appellants` alleged beneficial interests in APL. In my view, there was none. The fact that $5,000 had been paid by the first appellant to the second appellant was of no assistance to the respondent. After all, Sia himself had said that APL`s capital had never been paid up. This was a glaring inconsistency in the respondent`s case which had not been noted by the district judge.
There was also never any suggestion that the second appellant had been given the money for the purpose alleged by the respondent and had pocketed the $5,000 for his own use. The second appellant had explained that the money was probably paid by the first appellant in repayment of routine loans for the latter`s use at the Turf Club. The district judge disbelieved this. She opined that the second appellant`s `lies` on this `material point only served to reinforce the prosecution`s evidence that he and Cheam had an unregistered one-third share each` in APL. In this respect, the district judge clearly erred. Even if the second appellant had lied, there was no legal basis to import any adverse inferences thereby drawn into the case against the first appellant.
The district judge considered that it was `incredible` the first appellant could have claimed to have forgotten and had not ascertained what the $5,000 payment was for, despite facing serious criminal charges. This observation was patently unfair. It was not disputed that the first appellant`s bank statement reflecting the payment of $5,000 (exh P41) was only produced during his cross-examination. It would be unreasonable to expect him to be able to ascertain there and then precisely what this payment was for, given that the event had transpired some five years ago.
Sia`s evidence was that he had given US$300,000 of APL`s interim profits from the sale of the 8,424,000 block of LMP shares to the second appellant for distribution between both appellants according to their respective `shares` in APL. This allegedly took place after Sia had encashed the money in the second appellant`s presence at the Hong Kong branch office of Malayan Banking Bhd. The district judge disbelieved the second appellant, who denied having received any such sum. She found that the evidence of the second appellant`s driver, Ismail bin Sampan (DW8), corroborated Sia`s allegations. I was of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence to support the district judge`s findings. Sia had never mentioned the distribution of any moneys until he gave evidence in court. DW8 could not even say how much cash he had been asked to deliver to the first appellant, nor could he remember when the delivery had taken place. In respect of the first appellant, there was no evidence that he had even received any share of the money from the second appellant. As for the second appellant, counsel emphasised that there were no profits available for distribution, even on Sia`s own computation of his expenditure and costs incurred in the LMP acquisition. The district judge also failed to consider the evidence of Wong Kim Leng, who testified that he could not recall any occasion when both Sia and the second appellant had appeared together at the Hong Kong office of Malayan Banking Berhad.
The district judge emphasized that IPH`s funds were used not only to pay for the LMP shares at $2.58 per share, but also to pay for the costs of settling the ongoing litigation in Hong Kong. She found that `this was clearly a use of IPH`s funds without the knowledge of the other directors of IPH`, since the Circular Resolution (exh PB106) contained no mention of such use. It may be noted, however, that cl (2) of the same resolution states: 
 
M/s Cheam Tat Pang, Thomas Chong Teck Fook or Gopinath Pillai be and he is hereby empowered to do all acts, take all such steps and to enter into any agreement, arrangement, undertaking, indemnity and guarantee as the director may deem necessary or expedient in order to finalize and give full effect to the aforesaid proposed investment.
 
 
 
A clause in similar terms was also present in the earlier circular resolution of May 1989 (exh PB90). However, the district judge considered that as there was no express mention of using funds for this purpose, and since the other directors of IPH did not know about it, there was a misuse of IPH`s funds. On the contrary, it appeared to me that the terms of the above resolution could encompass acts committing IPH`s funds towards resolving the ongoing litigation surrounding the LMP shares. Similarly, they were broad enough to include the issuance of personal letters of indemnity by the first appellant to the directors of the Malaysian companies.
To impute dishonesty to the appellants, it was not enough to contend that they had failed or neglected to keep all other directors of IPH, such as Gopinath Pillai, or the company secretary informed of their every move. I should add that two of the six signatories to the circular resolution (exh PB106), Herman Ronald Hochstadt, and Lim Geok Chan @ Lim Yock Ching, were not called as witnesses by the respondent. In any case, Dato Mokhzani, a director and signatory to both circular resolutions (exhs PB90 and PB106) was a defence witness. He testified that he had been informed about the intended use of nominees. His evidence was apparently dismissed by the district judge as being of no assistance since he `had no knowledge of the accused persons` interest in Aquiline Pacific`. No other attempt was made by the district judge to explain why Dato Mokhzani`s evidence did not merit any consideration. I found this to be unsatisfactory, since his evidence would have supported the appellants` claims that they were not running a clandestine operation.
In the circumstances, I had serious doubts as to whether there could have been a larger scheme for personal enrichment involving the appellants eventually claiming all three blocks of shares as their own. Such a conclusion was clearly unsupportable in respect of the blocks of 24 million and 1,937,984 shares. IPH was to have bought the 24 million block directly from APL. Lional Tseng`s queries in late 1989 about the inter-company loans leading to his discovery of the existence of nominee companies had nothing to do with this block of shares. Moreover, the first appellant had made clear to IPH his proposals for the LMP acquisition as early as May 1989. Dato Mokhzani was told about the use of nominees. It did not make sense that the appellants would have obtained a mandate from IPH for the share purchases if their actual plan was to claim the shares as their own.
The charges further stated that the appellants had conspired with each other to use IPH`s funds dishonestly. I could not see how these allegations of conspiracy had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The first appellant did not deny that he was primarily responsible for orchestrating the acquisitions of the LMP shares. From the available evidence, the second appellant`s role in the LMP acquisition was peripheral at best. There was no cogent evidence that they had acted in the pursuit of a common object or design involving the commission of criminal breach of trust. Perhaps the only discernible common object or design was the acquisition of LMP shares in their capacities as directors of IPH.
On the evidence, I found little support for the district judge`s finding that the appellants had some undisclosed interests in APL, and that they had intended to use IPH`s funds to gain profit in their capacity as APL`s shareholders. They could not be said to have obtained any wrongful gain or caused wrongful loss. There were no `unlawful means` employed in the process of acquiring the LMP shares. To my mind, the nature and degree of dishonesty required under s 405 of the Penal Code had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the charges alleging criminal breach of trust had therefore not been established. I was satisfied that even if there had been no objection to the propriety of the charges, the findings of the district judge were against the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, the convictions of the appellants could not be upheld.
 Whether a retrial should be ordered 
In the course of his submissions, the learned DPP suggested that, if I were minded to rule that the charges were improper, I could consider amending the charges to one under s 157 CA itself and directing a retrial in the district court, pursuant to s 256(b)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). I regarded this submission with some cynicism. The charges had already been amended twice before. The original charges averred that there was dishonest misappropriation in the appellants` disbursement of moneys to which APL was `not entitled`. At the commencement of trial, the allegation of `lack of entitlement` was abandoned and replaced with the more particular allegation of APL not having provided proper legal consideration for the moneys disbursed. The re-amended charges eventually emerged only after 17 days of trial. Even then, the respondent had suggested, as an alternative, that the district judge could have called for the defence on the basis of amended charges under s 157 CA itself.
From the various shifts in the respondent`s case, I was drawn to infer that the respondent had never been quite sure whether the appellants had committed criminal breach of trust, let alone which of the limbs of s 405 they could be prosecuted under. The entire process translated into a protracted and unproductive voyage of discovery for the respondent. The trial spanned 43 days in the district court. Costs of the prosecution were awarded at $200,000. In my opinion, to amend the charges yet again at the appellate stage and remit the case for a retrial would be unfair and highly prejudicial to the appellants. I did not see how the interests of justice would be served by such a course of action, and I therefore refused to accede to the DPP`s request.
For the above reasons, I allowed both appeals and set aside the convictions and sentences imposed by the district judge. I was informed that each of the appellants had already paid $100,000 towards the costs of the prosecution in full satisfaction of the district court`s order. I ordered that the appellants be refunded their respective amounts of costs paid.

Whether sentence of imprisonment consecutive with reformative training appropriate
 
This is an appeal against sentence only. The facts are undisputed. The appellant was placed on probation for 18 months on 28 June 1995 after he pleaded guilty to a charge, under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), of rioting with hurt in DAC No 11081/95. The statement of facts showed that he played an active role in the offence and that he had struck the victim on the head with a wooden stick.
On 13 October 1995, the appellant was charged in DAC No 16679/95 with an offence of unlawful assembly with the common object of committing affray, punishable under s 143 of the Penal Code. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to undergo reformative training. On 28 November 1995, he was taken before the district judge for breaching his probation order due to his conviction for the s 143 offence. In view of the appellant`s youth, the district judge sentenced him to 18 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, the sentence to begin after the appellant completes his reformative training. The appellant appealed against this sentence.
There does not appear to be any local case dealing with this situation. However, s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) is based on the system of Borstal training in the United Kingdom, under s 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 1948, which has since been abolished. A perusal of the relevant cases on Borstal training reveals a number of applicable principles.
In 
 R v Fry, George Thomas 
 (1954) 38 Cr App R 157, the accused had been given a conditional discharge for an earlier offence of larceny. He was subsequently convicted of storebreaking and larceny and sentenced to Borstal training. He was also before Quarter Sessions for breach of the conditional discharge. The court declined to pass any sentence, taking the view that a substantial sentence of imprisonment would be inconsistent with the Borstal training. The Court of Appeal agreed that a substantial sentence of imprisonment would indeed be inconsistent with the Borstal training. However, it expressed the view that a nominal sentence of one day`s imprisonment should have been passed as otherwise the offence for which the appellant was conditionally discharged would not rank as a conviction.
A similar approach was taken with respect to corrective training under s 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 in 
 R v Sokell 
[1965] Crim LR 562. A substantial prison term consecutive to corrective training was held to be undesirable as the imprisonment would undo whatever value was obtained from the training. However, in that case, the court ordered the prison sentence to begin immediately.
In my view, the same principle is applicable here. It seems quite clear that the whole basis of sentencing the appellant to reformative training is that the appellant is considered to be amenable to reform. The length of reformative training is governed by Sch D to the CPC. In short, the appellant would be detained for such period not exceeding three years as the Visiting Justices may determine, provided that the period shall not be less than 18 months except by direction of the President. He would then be subject to supervision until the expiration of four years from the date of sentence.
It seems quite apparent that a lengthy prison term after the appellant is released from reformative training would run counter to the aim of reformative training, as it could well undo what the reformative training is meant to do. The same is even more true of caning. In addition, it would be unfair to the appellant as the prospect of caning would hang heavily on his mind during the entire period of reformative training. The prospect of a lengthy prison term after release would be detrimental to reformative training. For this reason, I was of the view that the sentence was inappropriate.
In considering what other sentences are appropriate, there are a number of applicable principles. First, in 
 R v Beamon, Arthur 
(1948) 32 Crim App Rep 181, it was held that consecutive sentences of Borstal training were undesirable because they make the scheme unworkable. In the context of reformative training, the same difficulty arises - if the Visiting Justices thought fit to release the appellant on licence after 18 months, what would become of the other sentences? Hence, consecutive sentences are inconsistent with the scheme of reformative training. If the view is that the appellant is so intractable that he might not profit from reformative training, then he should be sent to prison.
There appears, however, to be nothing wrong with imposing concurrent sentences of Borstal training. This was done in 
 R v Dangerfield, Terence Edwin 
(1959) 43 Cr App R 164. Applying it to the Singapore context, it would mean that there is nothing wrong with concurrent sentences of reformative training.
There are also cases on the converse situation of Borstal training consecutive to imprisonment. The general rule was that this was undesirable - 
 R v Donoghue 
 [1963] Crim LR 375 and 
 R v McMurray 
 [1966] Crim LR 347. This, however, was not an intractable rule. In 
 R v Hannah, Peter John 
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 734, it was held that while it was in general undesirable for a Borstal sentence to follow a prison sentence, in a case where in the accused`s interest and in the public`s interest Borstal was the only appropriate way of dealing with him, then the fact that, when he was sentenced to Borstal, he was in the course of serving a prison sentence was no reason why the appropriate sentence of Borstal should not be passed. However, in such a case, the Borstal sentence commenced from the moment it was passed and the prison sentence merged with it.
There appears to be no case on the reverse situation of a Borstal sentence merging with a prison sentence. However, it appears that the principle in 
 R v Sokell 
 applies. In that case, it will be recalled, it was held that imprisonment consecutive with corrective training was undesirable. Instead, the accused was sentenced to imprisonment concurrent with the corrective training. It should, however, be noted that in that case the term of imprisonment was longer than the term of corrective training.
Applying the principles, I am of the view that the sentence of 18 months imprisonment and six strokes of the cane consecutive to reformative training is inappropriate. However, in view of s 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252), it would also be inappropriate to not impose any sentence on the appellant. Unless the appellant is sentenced for the earlier offence, the conviction will not count as a conviction for the purposes of relevant provisions in the CPC such as s 12.
Hence, if the court is of the view that the offender is amenable to reform, then there are two courses open to it. First, it can impose a nominal sentence of imprisonment on the accused for the first offence, the sentence to begin after he has completed his reformative training. However, as nominal sentences of imprisonment should not usually be imposed, it would be preferable to sentence him also to reformative training in respect of the first offence. This second sentence of reformative training should be concurrent, as consecutive terms of reformative training are wrong in principle and could give rise to problems in practice.
If, however, the court is of the view that reform is not the primary consideration in the present case, then the appropriate manner of dealing with the appellant is to send him directly to prison (together with any sentences of caning). However, in so doing, it would be necessary to have regard to the fact that the order for reformative training still stands. It would not be desirable if the effect is that he returns to the reformative training centre for only a short period after his prison term. This is a problem that did not arise in 
 R v Sokell 
.
It is desirable that an offender is dealt with at the same time for both the breach of the probation order or order for conditional discharge and the subsequent offence. However, the provisions of s 9 of the Probation of Offenders Act make it difficult, where the order for probation or conditional discharge is made by a court other than a magistrate`s court, for the court to deal with the offender at the same time for both the second offence and the offence for which the offender had been given probation or conditional discharge. The scheme envisages that the court will have to deal with the offender for the second offence before he is dealt with, often before another court, for the first offence. It seems to me that in such a case, in order to avoid, as far as possible, the sort of difficulty that has arisen here, the court, in dealing with the offender for the second offence, should have regard to the fact that the offender would later have to be dealt with for the offence for which he had been given probation or conditional discharge as well. This is because sentences passed for the second offence may restrict the types of sentences that can be passed by the court dealing subsequently with the offence for which the offender had been given probation or conditional discharge.
In the present case, I have another option open to me, and that is to call for the records of DAC No 16679/95 with a view to quashing the order for reformative training as an inappropriate sentence and substituting it with another term of imprisonment. This, of course, is an option available only to the High Court, under s 266 of the CPC, if the court is of the view that the appropriate manner of dealing with the appellant is to send him directly to prison. This would have avoided the difficulty of having to send the appellant back to the reformative training centre for what could turn out to be a short period after he has served his prison term.
However, in view of the appellant`s youth, I was minded to give him one last chance at reform. In the circumstances, I substituted an order for reformative training under s 13 of the CPC for the 18 months imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the offence for which he had been given probation. As consecutive terms of reformative training are not desirable, I ordered the second reformative training sentence to commence on the same date as the first. Accordingly, I allowed the appellant`s appeal.

ss 256(b)(ii), 266 & 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
This was an application by the Public Prosecutor for a criminal revision in respect of a notice to attend court No 114249 (the notice). The notice was served on the respondent on 5 October 1995, requiring its attendance in a subordinate court in answer to a charge of having committed an offence under s 25(1) of the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Cap 79) (DDBIA). The respondent was alleged to have failed to comply with an order served on them by the Ministry of the Environment (ENV) pursuant to s 9 of the DDBIA, which requires the offender to take specified preventive measures as to premises or anything therein which is or may become favourable to the propagation or harbouring of disease-bearing insects. The maximum fine prescribed under s 25(1) DDBIA is a sum of $1,000.
The present application arose because of what was described by the petitioner as a `clerical error`. It appears that the offence section was inadvertently entered into a computerized data entry system as s 6(1) DDBIA instead of s 25(1) DDBIA. As a consequence, the charge sheet generated for the court`s reference in Night Court 13N of the subordinate courts recorded the charge against the respondent as being one under s 6(1) DDBIA, which states: 
 
No person shall take, do or perform any act or thing which may, or be liable to, create such conditions as may be favourable to the propagation or harbouring of disease-bearing insects.
 
 
 
The maximum fine prescribed for contravention of s 6(1) DDBIA is $1,000. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction, the maximum fine is $2,000.
The respondent`s case was first mentioned in Court 13N on 14 November 1995. A two-week adjournment was granted. The respondent, represented by Mr Ranjit Singh who also appeared in the present proceedings, eventually pleaded guilty to the charge under s 6(1) DDBIA on 28 November 1995. The prosecuting officer informed the presiding magistrate in Court 13N that the respondent had eight previous convictions under s 6(1) DDBIA and was last fined $1,500 on 26 September 1995. The magistrate therefore imposed a fine of $2,000.
The prosecuting officer subsequently discovered the error in the charge which was presented in Court 13N. The present application for criminal revision was thus filed at the instance of the Public Prosecutor, seeking an order from the High Court reversing the conviction and sentence, and directing a retrial in the subordinate courts on the intended charge of s 25(1) DDBIA. Before me, the learned DPP submitted that the High Court could amend the charge and direct a retrial pursuant to s 256(b)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Counsel for the respondent, Mr Ranjit Singh, stated that he had no objection to the DPP`s application.
There was clearly an administrative or clerical error. The error was compounded both by counsel`s failure to clarify the matter before the court, as well as by the ENV`s listing of eight antecedents under s 6(1) DDBIA. Nevertheless, there was never any doubt which offence the respondent had committed. The respondent had been notified that it would be charged with an offence under s 25(1) DDBIA and had intended all along to plead guilty to that charge. Indeed, counsel informed me that the respondent would still plead guilty to that charge once the existing conviction and sentence were quashed. Bearing all the above matters in mind, I was doubtful of the purpose of ordering a retrial.
In the premises, I sought the views of the DPP and counsel as to whether I could not amend the charge to the correct one under s 25(1) DDBIA in the exercise of my revisionary powers pursuant to s 266 CPC, set aside the conviction and sentence imposed, and reduce the sentence to a fine commensurate with the prescribed maximum fine under s 25(1) DDBIA. Neither the DPP nor counsel saw any difficulty with this.
In 
 State of Orissa v Nakula Sahu 
 AIR 1979 SC 663, Jaswant Singh J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of India, observed: 
 
... normally the jurisdiction of the High Court under [our s 266 CPC] is to be exercised only in exceptional cases when there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error on a point of law which has consequently resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice.
 
 
 
The revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court exists to set right serious injustice. In this connection, Dua J, in the Supreme Court decision of 
 Akalu Ahir v Ramdeo Ram 
 AIR 1973 A 2145, stated: 
 
The High Court has been invested with this power to see that justice is done in accordance with the recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and that the subordinate courts do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse the power conferred on them by law. As a general rule, this power, in spite of the wide language of [the equivalent sections] Cr PC, does not contemplate interference with the conclusions of fact in the absence of serious legal infirmity and failure of justice.
 
 
 
As I have stated in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  , there is no precise definition of what constitutes serious injustice. A wide discretion is vested in the High Court, the exercise of which depends largely on the particular facts. Section 27(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA) provides: 
 
In addition to the powers conferred on the High Court by this Act or any other written law, the High Court shall have general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts, and may in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, if it appears desirable in the interests of justice, either of its own motion or at the instance of any party or person interested, at any stage in any matter or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in any subordinate court, call for the record thereof, and may remove the matter or proceeding into the High Court or may give to the subordinate court such directions as to the further conduct of the matter or proceeding as justice may require.
 
 
 
On the facts of the present case, it was evident that there was a serious injustice. It was common ground that a clerical error was the unfortunate cause. As a consequence, the charge was wrongly stated, and the conviction and sentence which flowed from the mistaken plea of guilt could not be permitted to stand. The only question was what course of action the High Court could adopt to set right the apparent injustice. The powers of the High Court on revision are stated in s 268 CPC as follows: 
 
(1) The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
 
 
 
 
(2) No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused unless he has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate in his own defence. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.
  
 
 
By s 256(b)(ii) CPC, the High Court has the power, in an appeal from a conviction, to: 
 
alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence.
 
 
 
Reading this provision literally, there is no express power of amendment conferred on a High Court acting in its appellate capacity. On this basis, the decisions of 
 Quek Ching Kim v R 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 54
  and 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 191
  have suggested that the High Court does not have any such power. On the other hand, in 
 Ng Ee v PP 
 
 
 
[1941] MLJ 180
  at p 181, Cussen J had this to say in respect of the High Court`s powers under s 256(b) to `alter the finding` of a lower court: 
 
... the provisions of s 316(b) [our s 256(b)] of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 6) which empower this court in an appeal from a magistrate`s court to `alter the finding ... do allow of the substitution of a conviction under a different provision of law for the conviction found by the magistrate, to substitute the right section for the wrong section. It is, of course, a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of the evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused. It must be clear that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge that the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same - that the prosecution`s evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused`s defence the same.
 
 
 
Cussen J`s views were cited with approval by the Malaysian Federal Court in 
 Sivalingam v PP 
 
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 172
 . The relevant Malaysian statutory provisions on the High Court`s appellate powers are substantially similar to our s 256(b) CPC. In this case, Abdul Hamid FJ, delivering the judgment of the Federal Court, observed at p 174: 
 
In our view 
 Ng Ee`s
 case was correctly decided and to warrant a substitution there must be clear evidence that a case for the substituted offence would have been made out or established against the accused in the court below. To put it another way, before there can be an alteration of a finding the appellate court must be satisfied that if the substituted charge had in fact been the original charge, the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded have been same.
 
 
 
In 
 Lim Teck Seng v R 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 71
 , the accused was charged with inconsiderate driving contrary to s 5 of the Motor Vehicles (Driving Offences) Proclamation. After hearing all the evidence, the President of the Sessions Court amended the charge to a more serious one of negligent driving contrary to s 4(2) of the Proclamation. The only issue on appeal before Rigby J was whether the substitution of the charge to a more serious one was warranted, bearing in mind the circumstances in which it was done. Rigby J adopted the judgment of Taylor J in 
 PP v Salamah binti Abdullah 
 
 
 [1947] MLJ 178 
 and held that it was unjust in those circumstances for a more serious charge to be substituted only after all the evidence had been heard. Rigby J altered the conviction to one under the original lesser charge. There was apparently no question of the evidence being insufficient to support a conviction on the more serious charge of negligent driving. Accordingly, it appears that Rigby J proceeded on the basis that he had the power to amend the charge.
The facts of 
 Siah Ik Kow v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 217
  may provide the closest analogy to the present case. In that case, the appellant was originally charged under `s 74(1) of the Motor Vehicles Third Party Risks, Road Traffic Ordinance 49 of 1958 and punishable s 74(2) of the same Ordinance`. Such a statute did not exist. The appellant was nonetheless convicted of the offence as charged. He did not take any objection to the charge either at the trial or on appeal. There was no dispute that what was intended was a charge under s 74(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance, which was punishable under s 74(2). Chang Min Tat J amended the charge to bring it under the correct provision of law, having considered that the appellant was not misled by the charge and that the error had not occasioned any failure of justice. Chang Min Tat J appears to have acted on the assumption that he had the power to amend the charge.
It must be said that in the cases referred to above, there was no actual consideration whether the High Court had the power to amend the charge. It is well-settled that the High Court as an appellate court can only act within the limits of the lower court`s powers. A subordinate court is entitled to amend the charge at any stage of the proceedings before judgment is given: s 163 CPC. It would be highly anomalous if the High Court has no similar power of amendment. This would mean that the subordinate court`s powers exceed those of the High Court. It would also mean that the High Court is powerless to correct even obvious errors in the charge. Reasoning in the abstract, and assuming that a literal and narrow construction is adopted in relation to the High Court`s powers under s 256(b) CPC, the two remaining options open for consideration are as follows.
First, the High Court could consider whether it could alter the lower court`s finding by substituting a conviction, having regard to ss 173, 174 or 175 CPC. These provisions indicate specific scenarios where the court may convict an accused of particular offences, although he was not charged with those offences. Under s 173 (read with s 172), the offence must be `of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute`. Under s 174, the accused may be convicted of attempt or abetment, despite having only been charged with commission of the offence proper. Under s 175, the accused may be convicted of a `minor` offence even though he was not charged with it, but with `an offence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete minor offence`. In the present case, s 25(1) and s 6(1) DDBIA specify quite different offences. The former cannot be said to be a complete minor offence in relation to the latter. The actus reus of a s 25(1) offence is the refusal, failure or neglect to comply with an order served pursuant to s 9(1). In contrast, the actus reus of a s 6(1) offence is the doing or performance of `any act or thing which may, or be liable to, create such conditions as may be favourable to the propagation or harbouring of disease-bearing insects`. It will be noted that the error in the charge in the present case could not be rectified in any of the above ways.
In the alternative, the High Court could consider the error in the charge as being immaterial, provided that the accused was not misled by the error (s 162 CPC). The lower court`s finding need not be altered or reversed on account of the error, unless it had occasioned a failure of justice (s 396 CPC). This approach does not lend itself easily to application in the present case, where a plea of guilt was mistakenly entered to an incorrectly-framed charge. The finding that the respondent was guilty of an offence under s 6(1) DDBIA was patently wrong and would occasion a failure of justice if permitted to stand. Accordingly, the finding had to be altered.
The approaches adopted in both 
 Siah Ik Kow 
and 
 Lim Teck Seng 
 provide strong support for the proposition that the High Court must at least have the implied power in s 256(b)(ii) CPC to amend a charge if the charge is incorrectly framed. Moreover, as suggested in 
 Ng Ee 
and 
 Sivalingam 
 , the High Court may, in appropriate cases where there is no prejudice to the accused, substitute a charge and convict the accused on that charge. Substituting a charge necessarily involves amending the charge to introduce different terms. Whether the amendment introduces an entirely different offence section or not, a new and different charge is in place. The necessity to observe the safeguards against prejudice operates to ensure that the substituted charge does not stray beyond the limits imposed by ss 173 to 175 CPC. In other words, an amendment to introduce a substituted charge should be no different in effect from a substituted conviction.
More generally, it is difficult to see why the High Court should not be able to amend the charge to reflect the fact that it has altered the finding of the lower court such that the altered finding conforms with what the correct or appropriate charge should be, having regard to the evidence adduced. If no such power exists, the intention of s 27(1) SCJA which confers upon the High Court `general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts` would be virtually nullified. For the reasons above, I was of the view that the High Court, in its revisionary capacity, has the power to `alter the finding`, and correspondingly has the implied power to correct errors in the charge pursuant to s 256(b)(ii) CPC. This would include the power to amend the charge to introduce the appropriate offence section, such as s 25(1) DDBIA in the present case.
The power of amendment is clearly not unfettered. It should be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against prejudice to the defence, as laid down by Cussen J in 
 Ng Ee`s 
case and subsequently endorsed by the Federal Court in 
 Sivalingam 
 . The court must be satisfied that the proceedings below would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded would have been the same. The primary consideration is that the amendment will not cause any injustice, or affect the presentation of the evidence, in particular, the accused`s defence. These safeguards must be rigorously observed.
Quite aside from the fact that the respondent had no objections whatsoever to the proposed amendment, there was no possibility of the amendment occasioning any prejudice to the respondent. After all, the purpose of the amendment was to set right the injustice to the respondent of having been erroneously convicted of a charge which would have attracted a heavier punishment, in view of the respondent`s previous convictions under s 6(1) DDBIA. There was no question of any requirement for fresh evidence, since a plea of guilty would be entered by the respondent in any event to the amended charge. I was satisfied that it would be in the interests of justice to amend the charge.
In my view, it would serve little purpose to order a retrial in these circumstances. I therefore set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the magistrate and amended the charge to the intended charge under s 25(1) DDBIA. Upon counsel`s confirmation that the respondent would plead guilty to this charge, I reduced the fine to $1,000, the maximum prescribed under s 25(1) DDBIA. As the respondent had already paid the $2,000 fine imposed by the magistrate, a refund of $1,000 was ordered.
 Petition allowed. Conviction and sentence set aside. Respondent convicted and sentenced on amended charge under s 25(1) of DDBIA instead.",1996-01-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

s 43(3B) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed)- s 386 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The appellant was charged with driving while disqualified, contrary to s 43(3A) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) (the Act) as well as driving without insurance, contrary to s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189). The appellant was convicted on both charges, and was sentenced to a total of three months` imprisonment and six years` disqualification. The Public Prosecutor made an application for the forfeiture of the vehicle concerned under s 43(3B) of the Act, and this was granted by the judge. The appellant appealed only against the forfeiture. After hearing the submissions of both counsel for the appellant and the Deputy Public Prosecutor, I dismissed the appeal. I now set out my reasons for doing so.
The judge found that the present conviction was a second conviction under s 43(3A), and that therefore s 43(3B) applied. Additionally none of the exceptions to s 43(3B) were relevant. In the judge`s view, the appellant was, for the purposes of the Act, the owner of the vehicle even if it was subject to a hire-purchase agreement. No discretion existed as to forfeiture, unlike the situation under the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed). The position if there was such a discretion was also examined. A number of factors governing the exercise of the discretion to forfeit a vehicle involved in illegal dumping, as listed in 
Chandra Kumar v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
  , were examined and applied; the conclusion reached was that forfeiture should be ordered even if a discretion did exist.
 The appeal 
The appellant argued that he was only the nominal owner of the car. The judge thus erred in not applying the exception in s 43(3B) to the appellant. As the judge was aware that ownership of the vehicle was questionable - he had considered the possibility that it could have been owned by the finance company - a disposal inquiry ought to have been held. If it had been, the judge would have discovered that the car was bought by Prime Systems, a partnership involving the appellant, upon a loan from the finance company, which was secured by the deposit of the logbook with the company. It was said that the vehicle was the property of Prime Systems. The failure to hold a disposal inquiry was thus an error. It was further said that the order of the judge resulted in making an innocent owner liable for the action of others.
 The respondent`s case 
It was contended that the judge did not err in considering the appellant as the owner of the vehicle. No disposal inquiry could have been held as the relevant provision is subject to special provisions in any Act, and s 43(3B) is such a provision. There was no failure to observe the rules of natural justice as the finance company had the opportunity to be heard but chose not to argue. No arguments were directed to the point that the vehicle was in fact owned by the partnership.
 The issues 
The following issues arose:
 
 
(i) the interpretation of the section; 
 
(ii) whether a disposal inquiry ought to have been held; 
 
(iii) whether the evidence concerning the ownership by the partnership is further evidence; and 
 
(iv) whether the appellant was the owner for the purposes of the Act.
  
 
 
 
 
 The interpretation of the section 
 
 
 
Section 43(3B) of the Act reads: 
 
Where any person has been convicted of an offence under subsection (3A) and such conviction is a second or subsequent conviction and it is proved to the satisfaction of a court that a motor vehicle has been used in the commission of the offence, the court shall, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the motor vehicle except that the court shall not make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle if the court is satisfied that -
 
 
 
(a) the person who has committed the offence is not the owner of the vehicle; and
(b) the person who has committed the offence had used the vehicle without the consent of the owner or where he had used the vehicle with the consent of the owner, that the owner had no knowledge of his disqualification under this Act from holding or obtaining a driving licence.
 
 
 
The section is clearly mandatory both as to forfeiture and non-forfeiture in the stipulated circumstances.
This provision is very much unlike s 20 of the Environmental Public Health Act, which was the subject of discussion in 
Toh Teong Seng v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 273
  . There it was found because of the peculiarities of the wording of the operative subsections of s 20, a discretion was available to the judge. Section 20(4) reads: 
 
A court on convicting any person of an offence under subsection (1) shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.
 
 
 
Subsection (5) states: 
 
An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection (4) may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1) has been or will be held.
 
 
 
The basis of the decision in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 was basically that if the word `shall` in sub-s (4) was read literally as being mandatory, it would conflict with sub-s (5). This court thus had to find that sub-s (4) is merely directory.
Neither that case, nor 
 Chandra Kumar 
, which followed soon after, is authority for any general proposition that the word `shall` when used in a forfeiture provision is to be taken to be directory only. It is hoped that this clears any misinterpretation of those two cases. Furthermore, the observations made in those two cases are largely premised on the directory nature of the provision under consideration. Where there is no ambiguity of the sort as found in s 20, and the provision is actually mandatory, it is difficult to see how any of those observations made in the two cases could be relevant.
In the present case, no ambiguity arises which would justify the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge.
 The holding of a disposal inquiry 
There was no scope, contrary to the arguments of the appellant, for the holding of a disposal inquiry. Section 386 CPC governs the holding of such inquiries. Subsection (2) reads: 
 
The power conferred upon the court by this section includes the power to make an order for the forfeiture ... of any property regarding which any offence is or was alleged to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence but shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture ... contained in the Act under which the conviction was had or in any other Act applicable to the case.
 
 
 
Section 43(3B) is such a special provision regarding forfeiture. Section 386 is clearly intended to apply only in a residual role, that is when the offence-creating provisions do not deal with the issue of the disposal of property used or concerned in any offence. This was made clear by this court in 
Hoh Chee Kim & Ors v PP
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 105
  , a case cited by the appellant. In that decision, it was held that s 386 could not apply where forfeiture had been made under s 20(4) of the Environmental Public Health Act. The Malaysian decision of 
 Hoh Chee Kim & Ors v PP 
, in which the s 386 equivalent was held subject to s 20 of the Pawnbrokers Enactment, was also cited in 
 Chandra Kumar 
.
It could be argued that a distinction has to be drawn in this situation because the ownership is in question. But the fact that ownership is in dispute between the prosecution and the accused is not a sufficient ground for the holding of a disposal inquiry contrary to the express wording of s 386. Such issues could and should have been raised upon the hearing of the application of the Public Prosecutor to forfeit the vehicle. It is at that stage that all the relevant issues have to be addressed. Any other approach would render the forfeiture provision meaningless. It cannot be said that this approach is overly harsh on either third parties or the accused for the trial judge has to be satisfied that the owner, as defined in the Act, of the vehicle in question, did not consent to its use or know that the accused is disqualified.
That being so, it would next have to be examined whether the contentions on ownership of the car by the partnership amounts to the adducing of further evidence.
 Further evidence 
It appears that no evidence was adduced below as to the fact that the car was obtained by the partnership through a loan from the finance company. Before this court, the appellant relied upon various facts concerning the purchase of the vehicle by the partnership. Strictly speaking then, these were further evidence. No motion to adduce further evidence under s 257 CPC was sought.
It was irrelevant that these facts were not adduced owing to a misunderstanding of the law, or of the stage at which they ought to have been adduced below. Indeed if the appellant had been under an initial mistaken assumption about when such evidence should have been given, when it was indicated that a disposal inquiry would not be held, he ought to have applied for an adjournment so that he could have time to provide such evidence. As it was, there was nothing in the records to indicate this.
To adduce further evidence it is necessary that it be shown that the evidence was at the time of trial unavailable, that it is relevant and that it is reliable ( 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  ). It is also a consideration that no injustice ought to arise if the evidence were not so adduced. Though the evidence might have been reliable, and possibly relevant, evidence in the instant appeal was available at the time of trial. Because of the very nature of the evidence, it would have existed, and been known to the appellant at that time. No leave could then be allowed to adduce it.
However, in the event, it was found that even if the evidence had been admitted, the appellant would still not have succeeded. This is the subject of the next portion of the grounds.
 The concept of ownership under the Act 
An issue arose as to whether the fact that the appellant was the registered owner of the vehicle is sufficient for the purposes of the Act or whether it had to be taken into account that the vehicle was paid for by and was the property of the partnership. Below, the judge proceeded on the basis that it was claimed that the vehicle belonged to the finance company. He noted that s 2(1) of the Act defines an owner of a vehicle subject to a hire-purchase agreement for the purposes of the Act to mean the person in possession of that vehicle under that agreement.
Section 2(1) reads: 
 
`owner` in relation to a vehicle which is the subject of a hiring agreement or hire purchase agreement means the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement
 
 
 
That definition dates back to 1941.
Though not of direct relevance to the present appeal, that definition provides an indication that in some circumstances, the Act regards as the owner a person who would not qualify as such under general law.
The opinion of this court is that it is the registered owner who would in most cases be the relevant owner for the purposes of the Act. Difficulties would otherwise arise in the application of the provision. Suppose A buys a car, and registers it in the name of his son B without intending it to be a gift to the latter. B commits an offence under s 43(3A) and the car is liable to forfeiture under s 43(3B). If A were to allowed to assert his beneficial ownership, the prosecution would be left in most cases with the onerous task of obtaining full details of who the beneficial owner is before they may even consider forfeiture. Even if A were to volunteer such information himself, the possibility of persons claiming beneficial ownership would always have to be considered, and it is likely then that the provision would become unworkable. That could not have been Parliament`s intention.
The forfeiture was therefore correct and it was not disturbed.
 Miscellaneous 
The fact that the appellant was a partner did raise the issue of whether there was an implied approval from the other partner. The appellant appears to have said in mitigation that he was trying to get the vehicle to a potential customer. It could then be said that the property was being used for the purposes of the partnership. From that it would follow that there was an implied approval to so use the property. But it is thought to go too far, however likely it may have been in this instant appeal, to presume that the partner would have known that the appellant was disqualified. This approach would also be subject to the objection that the implied approval would have been an approval only to use the property legally, which was not the case here.

The appellant was charged in the court below as follows: 
 
You, Low Khoon Hai, M/35 yrs, IC No 5847932 (FOM), are charged that you, between May 1994 and 9 June 1994, at Kuala Lumpur and elsewhere in Singapore, did engage with Teh Chong Beng and one other male person `Meetro`, in a conspiracy to do certain thing, namely, to commit robbery, and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 9 June 1994, at 15 Dalkeith Road, Singapore, to wit, four male persons, namely, Yong Ngan Choon, Seah Theam Hock, Fung Kuin Yew and Kok Peng Kuen, committed robbery of cash S$1,800, cash US$4,000 and an assortment of gold/diamond jewellery, amounting to a total value of S$6m, belonging to one Ruhaizah bte Ibrahim and while committing the said robbery, voluntarily caused hurt to one YAM Pengiren Anak Hamlatul Arsymulia, and you have thereby abetted the offence of robbery with hurt, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 109, read with s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and his defence was a bare denial of any involvement. At the conclusion of the trial, he was found guilty on the charge and was convicted thereon.
 The prosecution case 
A preliminary observation on the law is that s 116 Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) provides that the court 
 may 
 presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution. But s 135 Evidence Act provides that it is not obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, provided the court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused`s guilt.
The prosecution case rested solely on the testimony of Teh Chong Beng (Teh) who had already been convicted and sentenced before giving evidence. Broadly, he implicated the appellant in the following ways:
 
 
(1) the appellant had told him in mid-May 1994 that a friend of his knew of a rich family in Singapore who normally kept a large amount of jewellery and cash in their home; 
 
(2) the appellant was looking for someone to do the job and had allegedly asked him whether he knew of any interested parties; 
 
(3) the appellant offered to pay him RM150,000 for a large piece of diamond and to evaluate the rest before offering him a price; 
 
(4) the appellant told him on 3 June 1994 to wait at his shop on 4 June 1994 at 8am as he (the appellant) would be leaving for Singapore; 
 
(5) on 4 June 1994, the appellant introduced him to one Meetro who drew a plan of the house at 15 Dalkeith Road and explained that there would be only two women and two children in the house. Teh was also told to use the side entrance. Subsequently, all three of them proceeded in the appellant`s car to Singapore to view the house. Teh then later briefed Yong Ngan Choon, Seah Theam Hock, Fung Kuin Yew and Kok Peng Kuen who carried out the robbery; 
 
(6) when the four men made the second attempt to rob the house on 8 June 1994, having aborted the first on finding that there was too much activity in the vicinity of the house, they saw an additional car in the compound and again aborted the plan. The appellant subsequently provided information that the car belonged to the owner, that it was for sale and there was nothing to worry about. The robbery was finally carried out on the third attempt on 9 June 1994; 
 
(7) after the robbery on 9 June 1994, Teh returned to Kuala Lumpur with the diamond ring whereupon the appellant paid him RM150,00 in cash. No one was present during the transaction. The remaining loot was valued and the appellant paid RM120,000 for the items.
  
 
 
Teh also testified that he became angry when he later discovered from a newspaper that the jewellery stolen amounted to S$6m. He stated that none of the four men who carried out the robbery knew the appellant, nor did they know that he was dealing with him.
Teh`s testimony indicated that the appellant`s role lay mainly in the disposal of the jewellery. However, the meetings and conversations between Teh, the appellant and Meetro clearly revealed that the appellant had abetted the robbery by conspiracy under s 109 Penal Code. Therefore he was liable and punishable under s 394 of the Penal Code.
 The defence 
The defence was essentially a total denial of any complicity or involvement in the commission of the robbery. The appellant`s evidence was as follows. He was licensed to deal in second-hand goods, which licence he had possessed since 1987. He was also a dealer in watches and he operated from his shop in Kuala Lumpur. He had known Teh for a few years, who had sold watches to him and pawned watches with him. His dealings with Teh were purely on a business level and he did not regard Teh as a personal friend.
The appellant claimed that he did not engage in any conspiracy to commit robbery. He knew of no one called Meetro, neither did he know the other four men, namely, Yong Ngan Choon, Seah Theam Hock, Fung Kuin Yew and Kok Peng Kuen, who carried out the robbery. He stated that he was unfamiliar with Singapore and denied participation and knowledge of everything which Teh had implicated him in. The appellant said that he only read about the robbery in a Malaysian Chinese newspaper. It was the appellant`s contention that Teh had implicated him in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence and his counsel attacked the credit of Teh by pointing to his colourful criminal record.
 The decision below 
The trial judge found that Teh`s evidence on the appellant`s involvement was in no way self-serving. There was no improper motive and nothing to gain from implicating the latter. He found Teh to be a truthful, fair and reliable witness. Teh testified that Meetro was the mastermind. If he was indeed lying and wanted to frame the appellant, he could have implicated him in many particulars but he did not. On the other hand, the trial judge found that the appellant had made great attempts to portray himself as a timid and quiet person who could never have been involved in the conspiracy. Despite his denial of any involvement, he only admitted to entering Singapore alone on 4 June 1994 when pressed in cross-examination. He claimed that he met someone called Tok Kong whom he knew to be dealing with watches. He said that he had frequent dealings with this person and he contacted him by telephone. Yet this person was never produced in court although this could have been done easily. Although the appellant was not required in any way to prove his innocence, the trial judge concluded that he was clearly lying about his non-involvement. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.
 The issues before the court 
There were three main issues raised by the appellant`s counsel before this court. First, it was contended that there was documentary evidence which showed that Teh was lying, hence leave of the court was sought to adduce fresh evidence. Secondly, it was argued that the trial judge had failed to consider the glaring inconsistencies and contradictions in Teh`s evidence, thereby failing to appreciate that Teh`s testimony was self-serving. Thirdly, counsel contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
 The criminal motion 
Adducement of fresh evidence
The adducement of fresh evidence was the crux of the appellant`s case. Apparently sometime in September 1995, in Changi Prison, the appellant was given a handwritten note of Teh`s. The note, reproduced verbatim below, read as follows: 
 
Your Lordship,
 
 
 
Re: To whom it may concern
 
 
 
This is to confirm that I, Teh Chong Beng I/C No. 8070519 duly wish to confess that as material witness in the trial of Mr Low Khoon Hai in the district court, I have repeatedly told lies and fabrications as I was under tremendous pressure and anxiety. However, I deeply regretted my selfish acts and would wish to submit my sincere apology for any inconveniences caused.
 
 
 
Yours Humbly,
 
 
 
Teh Chong Beng
 
 
 
Prisoner No: L 35999/94
 
 
 
Subsequently, this handwritten note was obtained by the appellant`s lawyer from the Changi Prison Authority after the same had been cleared with the Attorney General`s Chambers.
Before this court, the appellant sought to adduce this piece of evidence which was unavailable at his trial. Under s 257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), this court may make an order to take further evidence before proceeding to dispose of the appeal. The subsection provides: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
In determining whether the fresh evidence is `necessary`, the court is guided by three principles. First, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. Secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive. Thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible (see 
Juma`at bin Samad v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
  ,
 Rajendra Prasad v PP 
 
 
 [1991] 2 MLJ 
 1, 
 Ladd v Marshall 
 [1954] 3 All ER 745). Finally, I must emphasize that the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are very limited. As Barakbah LP stated 
 in Lo Fat Thjan & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 1 MLJ 274
  at p 277: 
 
...we would deprecate generally the admission of additional evidence on appeal except in clearly exceptional circumstances. The adversary system in our trials is hardly compatible with allowing 
 lacunae
in the case of any party to be filled in by afterthoughts or countenancing reconstruction of any case after it has failed at the trial.
 
 
 
Indeed, there will be no end to litigation if people who gave evidence were also allowed to return to court and say that they lied the last time.
Applying these conditions of unavailability, relevance and reliability to the instant case, it was obvious that the evidence was unobtainable at trial. Secondly, the confession could not be more relevant to the defence of bare denial, having an important and decisive effect on the result of the trial. The third condition, however, was most demanding here - the confession must be apparently credible or presumably to be believed. To quote Lord Denning in the civil case of
 Ladd v Marshall 
at p 748: 
 
We have to apply those principles to the case where a witness comes and says: `I told a lie but nevertheless I now want to tell the truth`. It seems to me that the fresh evidence of such a witness will not as a rule satisfy the third condition. A confessed liar cannot usually be accepted as credible. To justify the reception of the fresh evidence, some good reason must be shown why a lie was told in the first instance, and good ground given for thinking the witness will tell the truth on the second occasion.
 
 
 
His Lordship then went on to point out that bribery or coercion in the first instance, if proved, would be a good ground for a new trial. On the facts of this case, an admission of the fresh evidence would have entailed the acquittal of the appellant. Under the third condition, the confession must be regarded as `apparently credible` before being admitted. This standard of reliability is a high one. Therefore, adducing the confession would have cast a reasonable doubt on the appellant`s guilt. Effectively, the court would be saying that this confession is well capable of belief. As the entire prosecution case centred on Teh`s uncorroborated testimony, this meant that the prosecution would have failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
Defence counsel tried to impress upon this court that Teh had very real reasons to lie at the appellant`s trial. Promises were made to him by the police officers. He was harassed by the police and there was the offer of his own charge being reduced. Out of self-interest, he had to comply. In his affidavit of 16 November 1995 which supported this application, Teh had affirmed that the police repeatedly warned him that, if his cooperation was not given, he would be tried under the more serious charge of s 394 Penal Code which carried a prison term of up to 20 years instead of s 392 which carried a lighter sentence. Thus, out of self interest, he had no choice but to cooperate. Accordingly, he signed a form committing himself to testify as a prosecution witness and pleaded guilty to his s 392 charge. Teh further alleged that two weeks before the appellant`s trial, two policemen, namely, Inspector Wong Dick Son and Sergeant Chu Weng Kong had come to see him in Changi Prison. They warned him that, if he failed to give evidence according to his cautioned statement, he would be charged for perjury which carried a prison term of another five years. He claimed that the police officers even cited a case of a Thai national who was jailed for five years for telling lies in court. Under pressure and anxiety, Teh gave evidence which implicated the appellant. However, he claimed that his conscience later troubled him after the appellant`s conviction and he felt compelled to write a note confessing to his lies in court. He further added that the note was written voluntarily and no one had influenced him in any way.
As a general rule, a confessed liar cannot be regarded as credible. In particular, when it involves a confession of lying and fabrication by the prosecution witness who had participated in the offence, an appellate court has to exercise additional caution. It will be all too easy if a convicted criminal who had testified against his accomplice could simply turn round after the conviction of the latter, and say that he had fabricated his evidence at trial so as to get the other off (see
 Ditch v R 
(1969) Cr App R 627). Thus, the appellate court must look again at the whole matrix of evidence in deciding whether the fresh evidence which is sought to be adduced is credible.
In the case at hand, I had to decide to what extent Teh`s confession could be believed. In this respect, the prosecution submitted that Teh`s decision to plead guilty to his charge and admit to a statement of facts (exh P5), both of which incriminated the appellant, was an informed and voluntary one. From 5 August 1994 up to the time when Teh pleaded guilty, he was advised by his counsel regarding the charge which he faced. If he were under any compulsion from the police, the matter could have been taken up by his counsel. Moreover, the initiative to reduce Teh`s charge came from him. Prior to his guilty plea on 10 January 1995, Teh had asked his counsel to make representations to the prosecution to reduce his charge. When he pleaded guilty in court, his counsel was also present. Thus he was fully aware of the consequences of his plea. Furthermore he admitted, without qualification, to the statement of facts which implicated the appellant. In fact, one of the grounds of his mitigation was that he had agreed on his own accord to testify for the prosecution.
At the appellant`s trial, Teh had every opportunity to inform the trial judge that he had been pressurized into falsely implicating the appellant. Yet he never said anything. In fact, he gave evidence which incriminated the appellant and stated that his admission to the statement of facts was unqualified. He also maintained on two occasions at the trial that he had testified to the truth in court. A perusal of the statements made by Teh to the police also revealed that, from the time of his arrest until his conviction, he had on six occasions and to three different police officers consistently maintained the involvement of the appellant. These statements were also consistent with the material aspects of his evidence in the appellant`s trial. The effect of Teh`s allegations, it seemed, was that the police had deliberately set out to frame the appellant for an offence the latter never committed. No explanation was offered as to why the police might want to do this. After all, the appellant was a Malaysian with an unblemished record in Singapore and Malaysia, who was living outside Singapore`s jurisdiction at the time of the offence. In any case, all the allegations of pressure and inducement by the police contained in Teh`s affidavit were refuted by Inspector Wong and Sergeant Chu in their affidavits. Both of them also stated that they did not visit Teh in Changi Prison two weeks before the appellant`s trial.
I was of the view that the account by Teh of the appellant`s involvement was of such considerable detail that it could not have been made up. If indeed the appellant had nothing to do with the robbery, then how could Teh come up with all this information? Besides, Teh was cross-examined at great length and in detail. Yet he was able to maintain what he had said during his evidence-in-chief. Furthermore, prior to giving evidence for the prosecution, he had already made several statements setting out the course and manner of the robbery. All these complemented what was eventually said at trial. Even after Teh`s guilty plea, further statements taken from him were consistent with what he had stated previously as regards the appellant`s involvement. I would have thought that, at this point, it might be said that he no longer had any incentive to fabricate anything. At the appellant`s trial, Teh was scrutinized by the trial judge who was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was telling the truth. Similarly, I did not have the slightest doubt that Teh was telling the truth then. In so far as the law is concerned, the principles governing the adducement of fresh evidence are very clear. I only have to consider the credibility of the confession at hand. Having looked through all the evidence very carefully, I was left in no doubt that the confession given now was insufficient to override the evidence adduced at trial. It seemed to me that the present easy way out arising out of a simple retraction was insufficient to overwhelm the tremendous evidence that was adduced at trial. The evidence was tested and considered from every angle. In the light of the overall matrix of evidence, I could reach no conclusion other than the one arrived at by the trial judge. Accordingly, I dismissed the application for fresh evidence to be adduced.
 The appeal 
Inconsistencies and self-serving testimony
Having dismissed the application for adducement of fresh evidence on the ground that it was not credible, I came to the appeal itself. This could be dealt with briefly since a natural consequence of the dismissal of the criminal motion was that Teh must have been telling the truth about the appellant`s involvement in the robbery.
The appellant`s counsel raised the following discrepancies in Teh`s testimony:
 
 
(1) the appellant only had a business relationship with Teh, therefore it was illogical and extraordinary that the appellant would call Teh out of the blue about the plan to rob the house; 
 
(2) Teh had, during examination-in-chief, said that he heard of No 15 Dalkeith Road for the first time from the appellant. However, during cross-examination, he said that it was in fact Meetro who told him about it. Then in re-examination Teh corrected himself and said that the appellant had only mentioned about a house in Singapore; 
 
(3) it was inconceivable that the robbery plan would be hatched in the shop of the appellant in full view and in the presence of many customers as stated by Teh; 
 
(4) it was inconceivable that the appellant, being an accomplice, would keep quiet throughout the entire tour of the house on 4 June 1994 with Teh and Meetro as claimed by Teh; 
 
(5) Teh had admitted that he agreed to testify against the appellant after the charge against him was reduced in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence; 
 
(6) Teh had, under cross-examination, stated that the appellant`s involvement was in the disposal of the stolen jewellery and nothing more, despite testifying to the involvement of the appellant in the several meetings Teh had with him.
  
 
 
The trial judge rightly held that the minor discrepancies raised by the defence were not material and did not affect the substratum of Teh`s testimony. The fact that Teh had prior criminal antecedents and had been sentenced did not necessarily mean that his account was untruthful. It was for the court to decide the weight of his evidence. Point (1) was explained by the fact that the appellant must have known of Teh`s past criminal record and concluded that the robbery would interest him. Otherwise defence counsel would not have put questions to Teh concerning his past convictions. Moreover at the material time, Teh had pawned a watch with the appellant who probably inferred that he was in financial difficulties. Point (2) was immaterial because it appeared that Teh was clarifying himself that he heard about the house from the appellant but knew of its address from Meetro. On point (3), Teh clarified that he spoke to the appellant in a low and soft voice, such that no one heard their conversation. On point (4), it was not surprising that the appellant kept quiet during the tour of the house since he was only concerned with the disposal of the jewellery. Point (5) did not automatically lead to the conclusion that Teh was lying. Point (6) would be understandable if it were not taken too literally. Teh probably meant that he had meetings with the appellant but the primary role of the appellant was in the disposal of the jewellery. Indeed, this was the case right from the beginning. It did not mean that the appellant never had meetings with him.
It is clear that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge had seen and observed when giving evidence, unless the findings were clearly against the weight of evidence and unsupportable. The appellate court will also usually defer to the trial judge`s conclusion on findings of fact, including a finding of inferential fact of knowledge, based on the credibility of witnesses (see 
PP v Hla Win
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 424
  ). The above discrepancies could be explained and were not material so as to affect the credit of Teh. Bearing in mind that the process of testimony is not a memory test, minor inconsistencies are often inevitable. Moreover, there may appear to be inconsistencies due to the way questions are phrased. The crux is whether the totality of the evidence was believable and, in this respect, the trial judge rightly concluded that Teh had given an account that was coherent and logical.
It was also contended by appellant`s counsel that Teh`s testimony was self-serving. However, Teh had already been convicted and sentenced prior to his testimony at the appellant`s trial. The appellant pointed out that, although the prosecution might not be able to enforce his agreement to be a prosecution witness, Teh being ignorant of the law would still have considered himself bound to testify in favour of the prosecution. While this might have operated on Teh`s mind, it did not necessarily follow that he would fabricate evidence so as to implicate the appellant. There was nothing to gain from implicating the appellant. Even if Teh`s testimony was given in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence, it did not automatically impugn the quality of his testimony or constitute an improper motive. The court would still have to look at the demeanour of the witness, the totality of his evidence and ask itself whether he could be believed. These questions clearly weighed heavily on the mind of the trial judge who in the end was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was involved in the robbery.
Therefore the alleged inconsistencies and contention that Teh`s testimony was self-serving could not sustain the appeal.
Manifestly excessive sentence
Teh was sentenced to five years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to the less serious charge under s 392 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. He was also serving an additional three years` imprisonment for two offences under the Immigration Act committed in the same transaction. The four men who carried out the robbery were sentenced to five years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane, save for Kok Peng Kuen who was spared the cane due to his age. They had all pleaded guilty to the less serious offence under s 392 read with s 397 and s 109 of the Penal Code.
The appellant was charged with the more serious offence under s 394 read with s 109 of the Penal Code. The mandatory minimum for an offence under s 394 Penal Code is imprisonment of not less than five years and at least 12 strokes of the cane. The tariff sentence is six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. This was the sentence passed on the appellant. In the circumstances, I did not see how the sentence could have been manifestly excessive.
 Conclusion 
I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. For the reasons stated above, I accordingly dismissed both the criminal motion and the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
These are appeals against the decisions of the High Court in Suit 892 of 1991. In the first appeal (CA 79/95), Mohd bin Sapri (hereinafter referred to as `the plaintiff`) appealed against the dismissal of his claim for damages against the fourth defendant to the action, Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd (SB), in respect of injuries suffered. In the second appeal (CA 81/95), the second defendants to the action, Sprinkler Engineering Pte Ltd (SE) appealed against the finding of the trial court that they were one-third liable to the plaintiff for his injuries. SE also appealed against the court`s decision as to costs. We heard both appeals in succession and we shall set out our decisions in a single judgment.
 The facts 
The material facts are fairly straightforward. In February 1988, SB successfully tendered to construct and maintain a warehouse on a site in Woodlands (the site) belonging to the third defendants, CMB Packaging Singapore Ltd (CMB). SB employed SE as specialist sub-contractors for the installation of a fire-fighting or sprinkler system at the proposed warehouse.
On 9 October 1989, the plaintiff was injured in an accident during the installation of the sprinkler system at the first storey of the warehouse. He was instructed to touch-up the paint work on certain sprinkler pipes attached to the ceiling of the first storey. For this purpose, he climbed atop a four-level mobile scaffolding or staging and stood on its platform. He had not been supplied with any safety apparatus such as a helmet or belt. The staging had been modified from a stationary one by the plaintiff and his co-workers by affixing makeshift wheels onto its base. While atop the staging, the plaintiff fell to the ground as it toppled while he was being pushed along by his co-workers.
The plaintiff instituted S 892/91 to recover damages for his injuries. By the time the matter came to trial, the action against the first defendants, Synthes Singapore Pte Ltd, had been stayed. The action against CMB was discontinued on the second day of the hearing. The substantive hearing, therefore, proceeded against SE and SB only.
 The plaintiff`s contentions 
The plaintiff contended that both SB and SE were responsible for his injuries. He alleged that they were negligent and/or in breach of their duties as occupiers of the site and/or breach of their duties as his employers. In the alternative, he further alleged that the accident was caused by a breach of statutory duty (under the Factories Act (Cap 104)) on the part of SE and/or SB as occupiers of the site.
 SE`s defence 
In its defence, SE denied having employed the plaintiff. SE maintained that he was employed by Ishak Karim (Ishak). Ishak was his brother-in-law and was one of two sub-contractors engaged by SE to install the sprinkler system, the other being one Michael Chan Im Huat (Michael Chan). Ishak and Michael Chan were responsible for the work at the first and second storey respectively. They were responsible for recruiting and supervising their own workers.
SE also denied that the accident was caused by its negligence or any breach of duty on its part. Rather, the accident was entirely due to the plaintiff`s own negligence and/or that of his co-workers employed by Ishak. The plaintiff deliberately adopted an unsafe and prohibited practice. He had remained on the staging and asked his co-workers to push the staging to the next location where further touch-up work was to be done, instead of descending to the ground before the staging was moved. As a consequence, the staging toppled and fell over. The plaintiff was thrown off and thus injured.
 SB`s contentions 
SB agreed that the accident had occurred in the manner suggested by SE. It denied having employed the plaintiff, and disclaimed responsibility for the accident. It could not be responsible as an occupier since the accident had not resulted from any latent hazard existing on the site. The breaches of statutory duty under the Factories Act were denied. SB also claimed an indemnity from SE on the basis of the sub-contract between them, should the former be found liable to the plaintiff.
 The decision below 
The quantum of damages was agreed at $90,000 (covering general and special damages). The trial judge dismissed the plaintiff`s claim against SB, but ordered judgment for the plaintiff against SE on the basis of SE being one-third responsible for the accident. SE was also ordered to pay the plaintiff`s costs on the standard basis in full up to 31 October 1994 and 50% of the plaintiff`s costs thereafter. The second order was a variant of a `Bullock` order, for SE to pay all of SB`s costs payable by the plaintiff up to 16 November 1994, and 50% of such costs thereafter.
The trial judge rejected the plaintiff`s claim that SE and SB were liable for his injuries as his employers or as occupiers of the premises. She also found no causal link between the plaintiff`s injuries and the breach of statutory duty under the Factories Act. She found that the accident had three contributory factors. First, there was the dangerous practice adopted by the plaintiff and his co-workers, of pushing the staging while the plaintiff remained on the platform. This was the major cause of the accident. Secondly, the makeshift wheels affixed by the plaintiff and his co-workers to the staging were defective. Thirdly, there was inadequate supervision of the workers in that no one stopped them from following unsafe work practices or ensuring that all obstacles were removed from the vicinity of the staging.
In the trial judge`s opinion, SE had been negligent in failing to provide adequate supervision. SE was aware that there would be various other sub-contractors and workers at the premises. Careful supervision and coordination was, therefore, required and in view of the height at which the sprinkler workers had to work, SE should have ensured that the equipment used by the workers was adequate for the purpose and was used in a proper fashion. It was in breach of this duty and the breach had contributed to the accident.
 SE`s appeal (CA 81/95) 
Although we heard P`s appeal in CA 79/95 first, it will be convenient to deal first with SE`s appeal in CA 81/95. Counsel for SE raised two main arguments. In her first ground of appeal, she submitted that the trial judge had made findings in respect of SE`s breach of duty which were not raised in the plaintiff`s pleadings. In her second and main ground, she submitted that the judgment effectively imposed duties which had thus far been recognized at common law as the non-delegable duties owed by an employer to his employee. Counsel submitted that in holding that SE owed a duty of care to an employee of Ishak, a sub-contractor, the trial judge was unsupported by authority.
We are of the opinion that it is unnecessary for us to express any views in relation to the first ground. Accordingly, we decline to do so. Even if we were to rule that the trial judge had decided the case on issues not raised in the pleadings or in the arguments, one consequence may only be that a retrial may be ordered upon an amendment of the plaintiff`s pleadings. In the event, we shall only address the second ground of appeal. This revolves around the applicability of the case of 
 McArdle v Andmac Roofing Co & Ors 
 [1967] 1 All ER 583, which was relied upon by the trial judge to support her findings as to SE`s liability.
Counsel for SE argued that the trial judge had wrongly applied 
 McArdle`s 
 , as the factual circumstances of the cases were entirely different and distinguishable. The brief facts of that case are as follows. The plaintiff (M) had been employed by Andmac, who were sub-contractors appointed by the second defendants, Pontin. Andmac was engaged by Pontin to lay felt and bitumen on the roof of an existing building which was being converted. Another sub-contractor, Newton, was engaged by Pontin by a labour only contract to place joists over a strip of the roof and to lay boards on the joists. On the day of the accident, Pontin`s engineer, who had 42 years` experience, had sent Andmac`s men to work on the roof. Newton`s men had been working on the roof earlier and had gone for their lunch-break, leaving an uncovered and unprotected aperture in the roof. M proceeded with his work on the roof as directed. While doing so, and giving strict attention to his work, M lost his balance when he reached the aperture and fell to the ground. No arrangements had been made between Pontin and its sub-contractors, or between the sub-contractors inter se, for any safety precautions.
M sued Andmac, Pontin and Newton for, inter alia, negligence. Andmac and Pontin were also sued for breach of statutory duty under reg 30 of the Building (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1948. The trial judge (Cusack J) held that all three defendants each owed M a duty of care in the circumstances. In addition, Andmac was found liable for breach of statutory duty, while M was found not to be contributorily negligent to any extent. Cusack J`s decision was upheld on appeal, except that the apportionment of liability was varied.
In the present case, the trial judge acknowledged that the facts of 
 McArdle 
 were different from those in the present case. Nonetheless, she found the principles enunciated to be equally applicable. She reasoned that SE knew that the installation work required proper supervision and involved a certain amount of danger. In her opinion: 
 
SE, therefore, had a duty to take steps to see that that danger was, as far as practicable, eliminated or reduced and it was no answer to the plaintiff`s claim to say that everything was left to Ishak Karim, their independent contractor. It was well aware that Ishak Karim was working on more than one site at a time and that during the period when the sprinkler work was being carried out there would be various other sub-contractors and workers at the Woodlands site. Careful supervision and coordination was, therefore, required and, in view of the height at which the sprinkler workers had to work, Sprinkler Engineering should have ensured that the equipment used by them was adequate for the purpose and used in a proper fashion. It failed lamentably to carry out this duty and I therefore found its breach of duty had contributed to the accident.
 
 
 
Counsel for SE highlighted certain distinguishing elements in 
 McArdle 
`s case. First, she emphasized that the danger to which M was exposed to was created by Pontin`s requirement for the two sub-contractors to work in close proximity to each other, and to the dangerous aperture itself. Secondly, M had to work in circumstances whereby he was exposed to the danger, as part of the work conditions. The danger was not in any way of his own creation. Thirdly, Pontin had employed an engineer with 42 years` experience to be directly involved in supervising the work. He personally directed the work of the sub-contractors, including the details and manner in which the work was to be done. The employees of the sub-contractors took instructions from him. He exercised control over the operations and was personally involved in the coordination of the work. Through this arrangement, Pontin had retained overall responsibility and control. Finally, Pontin itself was clearly aware of the danger created by Newton`s men.
Counsel for SE argued that the facts in the present case stood in clear contrast with the above aspects of 
 McArdle 
 `s case. In particular, the danger in question was presented by the plaintiff having adopted an unsafe practice or system of work. The plaintiff himself admitted knowing that he should not have remained on top of the staging while it was being pushed. The plaintiff and his co-workers had chosen to modify a staging left behind on the site instead of asking for a proper mobile staging to be supplied. They had invented and adopted the dangerous practice which resulted in an accident which could otherwise have been avoided. Unlike M in 
 McArdle 
 , it was not a situation where the plaintiff had been compelled to work under inherently dangerous conditions.
In 
 McArdle 
 `s case, Pontin`s appointed engineer undertook extensive supervision and control over the work of the subcontractors and their employees. In contrast, SE`s supervisor, one Ong Kai Choon (Ong), clearly played a far more limited role. He visited the site almost everyday but he had no control over the manner in which Ishak`s employees did their work. In any event, Ishak`s employees did not take instructions from Ong. The plaintiff and Ong did not even recognize each other. SE`s director, Stanley Lui, visited the site sometimes, but only to make arrangements of coordination with the main contractors. SE had effectively parted with responsibilities of involvement in the operations when they appointed Ishak as their independent contractor. It was not a case where SE were the main contractor engaging sub-contractors of different trades to work together in close proximity on the same site, and therefore having the responsibility to coordinate the work.
Various witnesses had testified that they had not seen any such dangerous practice being adopted on the first storey where Ishak`s workers were assigned to work. In addition to Ong`s evidence, there was the evidence of Henry Low, who was the site supervisor employed by SB, and Choo Ah Kow, SB`s other site supervisor. Low Hong Teck, the safety officer appointed by SB, said that he had seen the practice being adopted on the second storey, whereupon he asked the worker concerned to stop doing so. Low Hong Teck had not seen any workers at the first storey push the staging while some other worker stood atop it. Thus, unlike 
 McArdle 
`s case, where Pontin was aware of the danger created by Newton`s men, it could not be said that SE was similarly aware of the dangerous practice being adopted.
The only evidence which suggested that SE, through Ong, knew of any unsafe work practice was adduced through Ong`s acknowledgment that he had been told about unsafe practices. Ong said that Henry Low raised the complaints, and that he then approached the sub-contractor to remind them of the position. Ong could not remember the exact complaint made about unsafe work. When Henry Low gave evidence, no mention was made of any complaints about unsafe practices. Instead, Henry Low stated that he had complained to Ong about Ishak`s workers using SB`s stationary staging. Henry Low clarified that he had never seen the workers pushing a mobile staging while another worker was standing on top. Counsel for SE submitted that it may thus have been tenuous for the trial judge to infer that SE must have known about the unsafe work practice on the site, and further that SE must be deemed to have adopted it.
Counsel for SE further submitted that the trial judge had erroneously concluded that the defective wheels had contributed to the accident, since there was apparently `something wrong with the wheels on the staging as was clearly indicated by [Michael Chan`s] evidence`. Rather, Michael Chan had opined that the accident would have happened even if wheels with rubber insulators had been affixed. This part of his evidence had apparently not been considered by the trial judge.
The starting point is to establish that SE did owe a duty of care to the plaintiff. In the trial judge`s words, this duty was `to ensure that the workers of [Ishak] were not endangered in the course of carrying out their works by hazards which could reasonably have been anticipated`. The trial judge also stated: 
 
It was my view, in the circumstances of this case where the work to be done involved some element of danger and where supervision by an experienced worker was required, that [SE] (quite apart from any contractual obligation to supply the staging) had a duty to the workers of its sub-contractors to ensure that the equipment that they used was adequate and not defective and that they were properly supervised so that they did not carry out their work in a dangerous or slapdash fashion. The facts ... showed that in the case of the plaintiff, [SE] had been negligent in the way in which it carried out its duty as its supervisor was not on site with sufficient frequency to ensure that proper procedures were followed nor did it respond responsibly to various complaints made about the sprinkler workers nor, finally, did it take any steps to ensure that the workers were provided with proper equipment for the job instead of having to improvise by modifying equipment left around by [SB] with such wheels as came to hand.
 
 
 
In short, the trial judge found that SE had failed to discharge its duty of care to the plaintiff because it did not adequately supervise the operations, notwithstanding that it was not the plaintiff`s employer, and also because it did not ensure that proper equipment was provided. We shall address the latter issue first.
 
 
 
In our opinion, the fact that SE did not take unilateral steps to provide a mobile staging was, at the highest, a sine qua non of the accident. Even assuming that SE had been contractually obliged to provide the staging, SE was not in breach of any contractual duty. There was no dispute that the arrangement was for Ishak to collect the staging from SE`s premises. Ishak chose not to do so. Should SE then be required to ensure that the staging was nonetheless delivered to the site for the use of Ishak`s workers? It would be exceedingly onerous to impose such a duty, and correspondingly to find SE liable in tort for failing to provide proper equipment. It would effectively reallocate the parties` respective obligations under the original contractual arrangement.
The duty of supervision over the plaintiff was said to have arisen because `the work to be done involved some element of danger`. With respect, we do not agree with the trial judge`s reasoning in this respect. The evidence showed that the danger in question presented itself because of the unsafe work practice adopted by the plaintiff. The trial judge herself considered that `the plaintiff himself bore the greater proportion of responsibility for his injuries as he had recklessly followed a system which he knew to be dangerous`. We share her view that the plaintiff had failed to take sufficient care for his own safety. However, there was no inherent or unusual danger in the working conditions, which were quite unexceptional. The mere fact that the plaintiff was working at a considerable height above ground level would not be enough to justify the imposition of a duty of care on SE, as we shall subsequently explain with reference to the relevant authorities.
The key questions are whether SE owed the plaintiff any duty of care, despite not being his employer, and whether SE had somehow also contributed to the accident such as to justify the imposition of liability. In this regard, we derived much assistance from counsel`s careful analysis of the evidence. We are persuaded by her argument that the evidence revealed important distinguishing elements from 
 McArdle 
`s case. These were the nature of the danger in question, SE`s knowledge of such danger, and the degree of control or responsibility exercised by SE over the operations. We agree that these considerations are fundamental to the question whether SE should be pinned with liability. To determine whether SE owed any duty of supervision over its sub-contractors` workers (and if so, the extent of such duty), it is necessary to examine the reasoning in 
 McArdle 
`s case in some detail.
On one analysis of 
 McArdle 
 `s case, Pontin was held to have breached its duty to M because Pontin had taken it upon itself to exercise close supervision and control and coordinate its sub-contractors` activities, given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or danger. This imposes liability on the basis that Pontin owed duties as a `quasi-employer`. It appears that this was the basis upon which Sellers and Davies LJJ imposed the duty of care. In Sellers LJ`s words (at pp 588E and 589B): 
 
In a practical sense Pontin were conducting and organizing the operations and had not, as I see it, parted with overall responsibility to anyone. Under the conditions which changed as the work progressed there arose a continuing duty on all the defendants to take reasonable care that those who might be expected to be in the vicinity of the danger (none more obviously so than the plaintiff) were not confronted with unnecessary risks. ... Pontin ... were directly concerned with the work in hand and they did nothing to ensure safety and had no reason to think that Newton would take any safety precautions on the contract for labour only which they made with them. It would have been apparent to them, if they had contemplated the position, that danger would arise. Ordinary care required that provision should have been made expressly by them in the particular circumstances of the two small contractors working in such close proximity.
 
 
 
Along similar lines, Davies LJ stated (at p 589H): 
 
As I see it, there was a common law duty on Pontin, who were employing these two firms of sub-contractors on a task which inevitably involved that they should work in close proximity to each other, and to this dangerous hole in the roof, to take reasonable steps, or to see that Andmac and Newton took reasonable steps, to prevent the workmen from coming to harm.
 
 
 
Edmund Davies LJ approached the question somewhat differently. He treated the duty as being one created by a dangerous activity initiated through the sub-contractors. If Pontin had provided adequate supervision and equipment, the duty might have been discharged. The basis of liability, on Edmund Davies LJ`s approach, is analogous to the liability imposed on an occupier of premises (see p 592B). Citing Lord Herschell`s observations in 
 Membery v Great Western Railway Co 
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 179
, Edmund Davies LJ adapted the principles relating to an occupier`s duty to take reasonable care not to subject an invitee to unreasonable risk or to endanger his safety. He applied those principles by way of reformulation to impose a duty of reasonable care which `necessitated (Pontin) taking proper steps to see that danger was eliminated`. The roof work `was such as could well involve danger to others who, to the knowledge of Pontin, would be working in close proximity to the joiners (Newton) - danger, that is, unless proper safety precautions were taken` (p 592F).
In two other cases, a view similar to that espoused by Edmund Davies LJ was adopted, although no express reference to Edmund Davies LJ`s reasoning was made. In 
 Wheeler v Copas 
 [1981] 3 All ER 405, the defendant had provided a ladder to the plaintiff bricklayer which proved unsuitable and resulted in injury. The defendant was held liable on, inter alia, the ground that he was an occupier of property who intended that others should come onto it for the purposes of work and use appliances owned or supplied by him. He had to take reasonable care to see that the ladder was fit and safe for the purpose for which it was to be used since he had taken on the obligation to provide the equipment. The same reasoning was employed in 
 Kealey v Heard 
 [1983] 1 All ER 973, with the added observation that the defendant in that case had failed to provide any superintendence at all.
From our reading of the three judgments delivered in 
 McArdle 
, the common thread appears to be this. A person who appoints independent contractors does not, ipso facto, absolve himself of any liability in negligence to the employees of his independent contractors. He may still be liable where the working conditions were inherently dangerous, thereby requiring the exercise of a significant degree of supervision and control over persons with whom he has no contractual relationship. Alternatively, drawing from the reasoning of Sellers and Davies LJJ, he may have to observe such a duty if he had taken it upon himself to exercise a degree of control and actively coordinate the independent contractors` activities, given that the work environment itself involved inherent risks or danger. Thus, both elements of `danger` and `control` will have to be considered.
It is clear that the present case does not fit within the parameters stated above. There was no inherent danger in the working conditions or the nature of the work. The danger only arose because of the unsafe practice adopted by the plaintiff and his co-workers. There was no cogent evidence to suggest that the unsafe practice had been adopted with any actual knowledge on the part of SE. Moreover, having sub-contracted the work, SE was not controlling the operations or involved in any substantial supervisory or coordinating capacity. SE had left the matter entirely to its sub-contractors. The plaintiff and his co-workers took no instructions from SE. The plaintiff and SE`s supervisor (Ong Kai Choon) did not even recognize each other. The work was wholly the sub-contractors` undertaking and was entirely within their control.
The duty which the trial judge imposed was a duty to `take steps to see that that danger was, as far as practicable, eliminated or reduced`. It appears that the danger was perceived by the judge as being the necessity to work at a height above ground. At best, such danger may have been reduced if SE had supplied a mobile staging for the plaintiff`s use. Having carefully studied all the judgments in 
 McArdle 
, however, it is apparent that the consideration of altitude never played any part in the characterization of the danger in question. Rather, notwithstanding that M was required to work on the roof, the danger was perceived to be the condition of the roof itself, or what Davies LJ described as the `dangerous hole in the roof` (at p 589I). For these reasons, we have stated earlier that the fact that the plaintiff was working at a height above ground level would not by itself justify the imposition of a duty of care on SE.
Had SE been occupiers of the premises, the general duty, at least where invitees like the plaintiff are concerned, would be to safeguard against such unusual dangers which the occupier knows or ought to know about. The duty owed is in respect of the physical condition of the premises concerned. Cases like 
 McArdle 
, 
 Wheeler 
 and 
 Kealey 
 appear to have modified these principles to impose liability on a person who holds a position analogous to an occupier. Thus, the duty of care has even been extended to render a `quasi-occupier` liable for injuries which result where he provides unsuitable equipment for use to any invitee (see 
 Wheeler 
 and 
 Kealey 
).
In the present case, it would require a further extension of the duty of care to say that SE should have provided proper equipment for the plaintiff`s use, and that it should have supervised his use of the equipment. Such equipment would have been made available upon request by Ishak. There was no dispute that Ishak had never asked for the equipment and could not be bothered to collect it. In effect, SE was being made liable for Ishak`s sloth. The trial judge`s decision implies that while an independent contractor who employs workers (ie Ishak) may be responsible for carrying out an employer`s non-delegable duties, such duties would also have to be undertaken concurrently as a matter of general law by the party appointing the independent contractor (ie SE). As counsel for SE put it, this would `open new floodgates to claim against a whole new class of third parties` and there will be `ambiguity as to the boundary of this class of third parties as well as the extent of their rights (and) duties`.
We should add that counsel for the plaintiff indicated that SE had been in breach of its obligations under the tender, in sub-contracting the sprinkler installation works to independent contractors. However, counsel for SE rightly pointed out that this point was only relevant as between SE and SB, and only in so far as there may have been a breach of contract. We do not see how this can form the basis for an action by the plaintiff founded in tort. A fortiori, this cannot be the rationale for imposing tortious liability on SE.
The case of
 Kearney v Eric Waller Ltd 
 [1965] 3 All ER 352, which was decided shortly before 
 McArdle 
`s case, was also instructive. In 
 Kearney 
, the second defendants were engaged to do work on the exterior of a factory building. They sub-contracted part of the work, including the repainting of the roof members and trusses, to the first defendants. The repainting had to be done from scaffolding, and the second defendants arranged for a competent firm to erect the scaffolding. This firm also provided staging for making working platforms. The scaffolding was adequate, but insufficient staging was provided for the way in which the job was to be done. The available staging was nevertheless used and the working platforms were made and moved by the painters, who were the first defendant`s employees, without supervision. One of the painters lost his balance and fell to his death from a working platform, consisting of a strip of staging 18 inches wide, owing to its having been found insecurely positioned and having an inherent see-saw motion.
Lawton J found that the cause of the accident was the breach by the first defendants, as employers, of their statutory duty under Building (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1948 regs 5 and 6, and of their common law duty to provide a working place as safe as reasonable care and skill would permit. On the question whether the second defendants, as main contractors, were also liable, it was held that they were not. One of the grounds furnished by the court was that there was no evidence that the second defendants had exercised any control over the use of the scaffold, and they were not vicariously responsible for what the first defendants, their sub-contractors, did with it. As Lawton J said (at p 357D): 
 
How the staging was used was a matter for the first defendants to decide. They tried to make a little go too far and in so doing they set up the conditions which led to the accident. In my judgment all the causes operating to bring about this accident sprang from what the first defendants did and from nothing that the second defendants did or omitted to do under the regulations.
 
 
 
As for the common law duty of care, it was held that the second defendants were not liable since they were not persons occupying or having control of the structure. The working platform from which the deceased fell was not in their occupation and control but in that of the sub-contractors. The second defendants did claim and exercise a limited right of occupation and control. Nevertheless, Lawton J found (at p 357H) that `the accident happened, however, on, and because of the nature and condition of, a working platform made by the first defendants on the scaffolding`.
It is evident that the facts in 
 Kearney 
 `s case bear a close resemblance to those in the present case. Like the second defendants in
 Kearney 
 , SE had sub-contracted the work to independent contractors, who employed their own workers. These workers `tried to make a little go too far` and resorted to their own modifications of the staging, without supervision. The plaintiff, like the deceased, fell from the platform, possibly because of some defect in the construction of the staging. There was no suggestion that working at a height above ground level would pose a danger in itself against which the second defendants had to exercise special precaution. Like the second defendants in
 Kearney 
, SE had not exercised any control over the use of the staging, and they were not occupiers of the site. In our judgment, the reasoning in 
 Kearney`s 
 case is highly persuasive and would provide more useful guidance than 
 McArdle 
.
Adopting the tests enunciated in 
 Caparo Industries plc v Dickman 
[1990] 1 All ER 568 and 
 Marc Rich & Co AG & Ors v Bishop Rock Marine Co Ltd & Ors 
 [1994] 3 All ER 686, quite apart from inquiring about the foreseeability of the loss or damage, we also considered the nature of the relationship between the parties, and whether we were satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care. On the facts, we do not see any sufficient proximity of relationship between SE and the plaintiff to justify the imposition of a broad-ranging duty of care.
For the above reasons, we are of the view that the trial judge`s decision imposing liability on SE is not supported by the authorities. Accordingly, we allow SE`s appeal. We will deal with the question of costs subsequently.
 The plaintiff`s appeal (CA 79/95) 
In view of our decision in CA 81/95, the outcome of CA 79/95 is a foregone conclusion. Nonetheless, for the sake of completeness, we shall address the main arguments raised by counsel for the plaintiff. He argued that SB was in breach of its common law duties as occupier of the premises, as well as its statutory duties imposed by s 33 of the Factories Act. Counsel for the plaintiff further contended that SB was vicariously liable for the negligence of SE, its independent contractor. In view of the finding of this court that SE should not be held liable for the plaintiff`s injuries, we need not deal with the submissions on the issue of vicarious liability.
i Occupier`s liability
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that his client was injured by current operations or activities being carried out by SB. He suggested that the plaintiff could claim the benefit of an ordinary duty in negligence. We set out the relevant passages of his written case verbatim: 
 
[The plaintiff] was lawfully on the premises (invitee), the duty of negligence, reasonable care from [SB] who was conducting such activities which the current operations, the ordinary principles of negligence would apply.
 
 
 
The duty has been extended to third persons doing acts on the premises in the occupation of the owner. 
 
See: 
 Duster v Abbott
 [1953] 2 All ER 1572
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Slater v Cross 
 
 [1957] 2 QB 264
  
 
 
The result has been to impose duty liability on the occupier for the activities on the premises as the person causing/creating foresee danger to persons lawfully there.
 
 
 
In both cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff (
 Dunster v Abbott 
 [1953] 2 All ER 1572 and 
 Slater v Clay Cross Co 
 [1957] 2 QB 264), the proposition put forward was that where current operations were being carried out by the occupier on his land, his duty to licensees and invitees alike was to take reasonable care not to injure them. This does not translate into counsel`s assertion that SB may be held liable to the plaintiff on `ordinary principles of negligence`, simply because SB was the occupier of the premises. Contrary to what counsel suggests, the cases also do not say that an occupier may be liable to an invitee where third persons do acts on its premises which result in injury to the invitee.
The only duty SB, as an occupier, owed to the plaintiff was to use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual dangers which the former knew or ought to have known about. This relates to the physical condition of the premises, as opposed to current operations at the site. In this connection, the following observations of LP Thean J (as he then was) in
 Mohd Sainudin bin Ahmad v Consolidated Hotels Ltd & Anor 
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 297
  (at p 299) are pertinent: 
 
The duty owed by the first defendant (the site owner) to the plaintiff who was upon the premises as an invitee - in my opinion, he was an invitee - is to use reasonable care to prevent damage to him from unusual danger which the first defendant knew or ought to know. But the plaintiff was not injured by reason of any defective or unsafe physical condition of the premises. The plaintiff was injured by current operations at the premises, and the current operations were not carried out by the first defendant but by the main contractor or others on its behalf.
 
 
 
LP Thean J`s decision that the defendant was not liable as an occupier was upheld by the Court of Appeal (see 
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 271
 ).
In the present case, there was no proximate relationship between the plaintiff and SB to support the imposition of a general duty of care. A relationship of invitee and invitor will not be sufficient. The trial judge opined that the accident did not arise from any unusual danger on the premises, but was caused by the plaintiff`s own negligence and the defective state of the staging. Moreover, SB was not controlling the method of work employed by SE or its sub-contractors, let alone the work done by the plaintiff. Rather, the accident occurred because of the unsafe work practice adopted. In the words of Lord Keith in 
 Ferguson v Welsh & Ors 
[1987] 3 All ER 777 (at p 783): 
 
It would not ordinarily be reasonable to expect an occupier of premises having engaged a contractor whom he has reasonable grounds for regarding as competent, to supervise the contractor`s activities in order to ensure that he was discharging his duty to his employees to observe a safe system of work. In special circumstances, on the other hand, where the occupier knows or has reason to suspect that the contractor is using an unsafe system of work, it might well be reasonable for the occupier to take steps to see that the system was made safe.
 
 
 
There was no reason to expect SB to supervise SE, let alone SE`s sub-contractors or their employees. After all, there was no clear evidence which permitted the inference that even SE was aware of the unsafe work practice being adopted at the site. We would respectfully disagree with the trial judge`s conclusion that the unsafe system of work `must have been known to Ong and thus to SE` and that SE must be deemed to have adopted it. Other than this minor point, we are in entire agreement with the trial judge`s findings as regards the issue of SB`s liability qua occupier to the plaintiff.
ii Breach of statutory duty
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that at the material time, the scaffolding was defective and SB was in breach of statutory duty under the Factories Act (Cap 104) (the Act), as a result of which the plaintiff was injured. He argued that there was a breach of s 33(1)(b) of the Act, which requires that all places of work should, as far as reasonably practicable, be kept free from any obstruction. He pointed out the fact that Michael Chan had said that there were lots of steel bars and rods left lying on the floor. Counsel also submitted that SB had breached ss 33(7) and (8) of the Act. The plaintiff was not provided with a safety belt while he was working on top of the staging. Furthermore, the staging had no foothold and handhold as required by ss 33(7) and (8) of the Act.
The trial judge considered that there had been no breach of s 33(1)(b) of the Act. The stack of rods was not an obstruction. There was evidence that they were stacked in a pile and were needed for the purpose of ongoing work. There was no evidence that it would have been difficult to either move the staging around the rods or to move the rods themselves away from the pathway of the staging. The plaintiff himself did not even remark on the presence of the rods or claim that they had somehow contributed to the accident. We see no merit whatsoever in counsel`s argument that s 33(1)(b) of the Act had been breached.
We turn now to counsel`s other contention. Essentially, he asserted that SB should be adjudged liable for the plaintiff`s injuries as long as any breach of the Act is established, the duties under the Act being `strict` and `absolute`. Thus, in counsel`s words, SB `cannot argue that a safety belt would have been of no use to the [plaintiff]. The issue is not whether it would have prevented the accident, the issue is whether there was a breach by [SB]`. Counsel also submitted that SB`s breach materially increased the risk of injury to the plaintiff.
The trial judge found that there had been a breach of s 33(7) of the Act, by the failure to provide a secure foothold and handhold. Nevertheless, she rejected counsel`s contention as being unsupported by any authority. There must be a causal connection between the breach of duty and the damage suffered:
 Cummings v Sir William Arrol & Co Ltd 
[1962] 1 All ER 623; 
 Wigley v British Vinegars Ltd 
[1962] 3 All ER 161; 
 Corn v Weir`s Glass (Hanley) Ltd (L Bates, third party) 
[1960] 2 All ER 300. The judge referred to all these cases and held that there was no causal connection between the breach of s 33(7) and the plaintiff`s injury. The injury occurred because the whole of the staging toppled when it was pushed while he remained on it. Similarly, there was no causal connection between the injury and the failure to supply a safety belt (s 33(8) of the Act). The presence of a belt would not have averted the accident since there was no hook to which the belt could have been attached.
It would be wrong in principle to treat any breach of the Act as if it engendered strict liability for the purpose of claiming compensation in tort. The issue of causation must be addressed. The implications of accepting counsel`s sweeping proposition are startling and are best illustrated by a hypothetical scenario. Let us assume that the plaintiff negligently severs his thumb while operating a chainsaw on the staging. The evidence points entirely to his own negligence having caused the accident. It would be offensive to logic that a person in SB`s position must necessarily be held liable for all his loss and damage simply because no safety belt, or no secure foothold and handhold had been provided.
We see reason to differ from the trial judge`s views. We also do not see how the breaches of the Act could be said to have increased the risk of injury. As the trial judge had rightly noted, it would not have made any difference even if SB had complied with the requirements of ss 33(7) and (8) of the Act. There is absolutely no merit in the plaintiff`s appeal and we dismiss it accordingly. We turn now to address the question of costs.
 Costs 
SE has also appealed against the trial judge`s orders as to costs. As we have allowed SE`s appeal in CA 81/95, costs should follow the event and SE`s costs here and below will be borne by the plaintiff. It is appropriate, however, for us to comment on some aspects of the appeal in relation to the second order for SE to bear a portion of SB`s costs which would otherwise have been payable by the plaintiff.
In the proceedings below, the plaintiff had succeeded partially in his claim against SE but failed against SB. Counsel for the plaintiff had suggested that the trial judge could make a `Bullock` order (see 
 Bullock v London General Omnibus Co 
 
[1907] 1 KB 264
) so that SE should bear any costs which the plaintiff had to pay SB. The judge ordered SE to pay all SB`s costs payable by the plaintiff up to 16 November 1994, the date on which SB had made a very generous offer to settle (OTS) to the plaintiff at $40,000 for damages, $18,000 interest and $12,000 costs. The plaintiff did not accept the OTS. The judge did not think it fair that SE should bear all SB`s costs thereafter. As such, she ordered SE to bear only 50% of any costs payable by the plaintiff to SB for the period after 16 November 1994.
Counsel for SE submitted that the trial judge had erroneously applied 
 Bullock`s 
. A `Bullock` order would ordinarily be appropriate where the successful defendant had succeeded on the same issues on which the unsuccessful defendant had failed. In the present case, however, both SB and SE had successfully defended the action in meeting the plaintiff`s allegations that they were liable as employers or occupiers or were in breach of statutory duty. SE was found liable to the plaintiff on a wholly distinct ground, which had no application whatsoever in relation to SB.
At the outset, one point arising from the terminology used should be clarified. The order that the trial judge made was really a `Sanderson` order (see 
 Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Co 
[1903] 2 KB 533
). A `Bullock` order is one where a plaintiff (P), having failed in his action against D1, but succeeded against D2, is ordered to pay D1`s costs but is permitted to recover those costs together with his own costs from D2. A `Sanderson` order, on the other hand, requires that both P and D1 recover their costs directly from D2.
There is some support for counsel for SE`s arguments from the case of 
 Mulready v Bell Ltd 
 [1953] 2 All ER 215, where Lord Goddard stated (at p 219) that a `Bullock` or `Sanderson` order would not be appropriate where the plaintiff alleges independent causes of action against different defendants, and the respective breaches of duty `are in no way connected to one another` (see also 
 Donovan v Walters 
(1926) 135 LT 12). Logically then, it would seem that the same reasoning should apply if the basis on which SE is found liable is totally different from that on which SB succeeded in its defence. Having said that, Parker LJ has suggested in 
 Goldsworthy v Brickell 
[1987] Ch 378 that a `Bullock` or `Sanderson` order could still be made in such circumstances. Parker LJ emphasized that the court always had a wide discretion as to costs, and 
 Mulready 
 was said to be a `very special case` although no reasons for this view were given.
 Sanderson 
`s case itself seems to have favoured a broader approach. Thus, the main consideration is whether costs had been reasonably and properly incurred by the plaintiff as between himself and SB. The trial judge considered that such costs had been reasonably and properly incurred, since SE had disclaimed any responsibility whatsoever for the plaintiff`s injuries. In the learned judge`s words: 
 
... it had been reasonable for the plaintiff to sue Soil Build after Sprinkler Engineering had totally denied any relationship with the plaintiff which could possibly have founded a cause of action against it. 
 If Sprinkler Engineering had accepted that it did owe some duties to the plaintiff even though it denied that it had been in breach of those duties or that the injury had resulted from any such breach, then the plaintiff would probably not have sued Soil Build and would have confined his efforts to building his case against Sprinkler Engineering
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
With respect, we do not agree with the highlighted portion cited above. It is speculative to assume that the plaintiff would not have sued SB as long as SE accepted that it (SE) did owe him some duties, despite denying that it had been in breach of those duties or that the injury had resulted from any such breach. Indeed, the chronology of events clearly indicates otherwise. The plaintiff`s statement of claim was amended in July 1993 to include SB as a fourth defendant. At that juncture, SE`s defence had not even been filed yet. SB then proceeded to file its defence first, in September 1993. SE only filed its defence in November 1993. Thus, the decision to proceed against SB had been taken even before SE`s defence had been filed.
The effect of SE`s denial of liability was not ineluctably to compel the plaintiff to sue SB. It was not as if SE, in defending the claim, was attempting to pin liability on SB. It is apparent from our perusal of SE`s defence that by its denial of liability, it was putting the blame on the plaintiff himself. There was no suggestion that SB should be the proper party to answer for the plaintiff`s injuries. These were important considerations which the Court of Appeal took into account in 
 Mulready 
`s case in deciding that a `Bullock` order would not be appropriate.
If the plaintiff includes an additional defendant because of his uncertainty of the law rather than the facts, the court will not make either a `Bullock` or `Sanderson` order (
 Poulton v Moore 
 [1913] WN 349). Lush J had this to say (at p 350): 
 
The reason for the order in 
 Bullock v London General Omnibus Co
was that as the omnibus company had wrongly thrown the responsibility for the accident to the plaintiff on to the other defendants, they had caused the plaintiff to be in a state of uncertainty on the facts as to who was really liable, and therefore they were responsible for the extra costs he incurred in suing both defendants. ... There is no precedent for such an order being made where the joinder of an additional defendant has resulted from the plaintiff being doubtful as to the law, nor is there any principle that I can see upon which such an order can be justified. It was the fault or misfortune of the plaintiff if he was not satisfied as to his legal rights; it certainly was not the fault of [the defendants].
 
 
 
These observations are apposite in the present case. In any event, the plaintiff`s decision to sue SB has been questionable. The pleaded causes of action alleging SB`s liability qua employer and occupier were clearly unsustainable. As counsel for SE has pointed out, the plaintiff must have known that his own negligence caused the accident. The facts surrounding the accident were matters which were wholly within the plaintiff`s knowledge. The accident had nothing to do with the physical state of the premises or with any unusual dangers. He knew that he was employed by Ishak, his own brother-in-law. He did not deign to consider SB`s generous OTS. On 22 October 1994, SE had in fact also made an OTS amounting to $35,000 in general damages and $12,000 costs. Instead, the plaintiff chose to proceed with another 12 days of trial.
SE was only adjudged to be one-third liable for the plaintiff`s injuries. Thus, SE had justifiably defended the claim to the extent that it was not found liable. In principle, it would be unfair even for SE to bear all the plaintiff`s costs up to 31 October 1994, let alone all of SB`s costs up to 16 November 1994. In our judgment, the order for SE to bear the plaintiff`s costs payable to SB up till 16 November 1994 should not have been made in any event. The trial judge remarked that the matter could have been settled had the plaintiff accepted SB`s OTS of 16 November 1994. It seems curious that she then went on to make SE liable for half of the costs incurred after 16 November 1994 which would have been payable to SB by the plaintiff. With respect, we are quite unable to see why SE should be made to bear any costs for the plaintiff`s own patently unreasonable stance after 16 November 1994. There is, after all, no evidence that the plaintiff will be unable to pay SB`s costs if so ordered. The circumstances were not such that either a `Bullock` or `Sanderson` order would have been appropriate.
In the result, we allow SE`s appeal and dismiss the plaintiff`s appeal. The plaintiff will have to bear the consequences of his own choices in litigation. In addition to being liable for SE`s costs here and below, the plaintiff will be ordered to pay SB`s costs of the appeal in CA 79/95 as well as SB`s costs below. There will be an order for the security deposit in CA 81/95 to be refunded to SE or their solicitors. In addition, we order that the security deposit in CA 79/95 be paid out to SB or their solicitors to account of costs.

 Background 
 
 
 
This appeal concerns the district court`s order for forfeiture of a motor vehicle bearing Malaysian registration No JDJ 5881 (the vehicle). The driver of the vehicle was one Law Song (the accused). The appellant, Magnum Finance Bhd (MFB), was the owner of the vehicle pursuant to a hire-purchase agreement. The hirer was one Chong May Weeka, from whom the accused had borrowed the vehicle.
On 3 August 1995, the accused pleaded guilty to one charge in DAC 8480/95 under s 140(1)(d) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353) (the Charter) of bringing a Thai prostitute into Singapore, knowing that she had been procured for the purpose of prostitution within Singapore. A second charge of a similar nature was taken into consideration. An offence under s 140(1)(d) of the Charter carries a maximum punishment of five years` imprisonment or fine not exceeding $10,000. The district judge imposed a fine of $8,000, in default six months` imprisonment.
There was no dispute that the vehicle had been used in the commission of the offence, to ferry the Thai females across the Causeway from Johore Bahru. After the accused had been convicted and sentenced, the prosecution applied to forfeit the vehicle. MFB claimed to be rightfully entitled to possession of the vehicle and disputed the application for forfeiture. A disposal inquiry was thus convened pursuant to s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The district judge forfeited the vehicle at the conclusion of the inquiry. MFB has appealed against this order.
 A preliminary point 
I should point out that there is no right of appeal against an order made pursuant to a disposal inquiry. This must be regarded as settled law in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Sofjan & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 272
 , as adopted by this Court in 
Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd & Ors v Vankrisappan & Ors
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 414
  (at p 419). The appropriate course of action was for MFB to petition for revision. Notwithstanding that it has not done so, I was of the opinion that this would not preclude me from exercising the High Court`s powers of revision. I have observed, obiter, in the 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop 
 case (at p 419), that the court will be slow to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in cases involving disposal inquiries. Nonetheless, if there is a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice, the court may act on its own motion to set things right. I saw no difficulty in proceeding to hear the appeal.
 The motion 
Counsel for MFB filed a criminal motion on 16 April 1996 seeking liberty to file a supplementary petition of appeal. Counsel sought to include the following further grounds of appeal:
 
 
(a) whether a forfeiture order under s 386(2) of the CPC amounts to additional punishment for an offence under s 140 of the Charter; 
 
(b) as the Charter does not provide for forfeiture as a means of punishment, whether the court can resort to the CPC as an avenue to impose such punishment; 
 
(c) Section 386(2) of the CPC comes under the general heading `Disposal of Property`. What are the criteria or guidelines for the court when exercising its powers to order disposal of case properties? 
 
(d) Whether such power includes forfeiture of property belonging to an innocent third party.
  
 
 
I was of the view that the motion was unnecessary as no new grounds of appeal were raised. The issues had been alluded to in the submissions of counsel and the DPP. As such, I dismissed the motion, but I indicated that counsel would be at liberty to proceed with submissions on the points raised.
 The appeal 
(a) The scope of s 386(2) CPC
The relevant provisions relating to the court`s power to dispose of property are contained in ss 386(1) and (2), which state: 
 
(1) During or at the conclusion of any inquiry or trial in any criminal court the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any document, livestock or other property produced before it.
 
 
 
 
(2) The power conferred upon the court by this section includes power to make an order for the forfeiture or confiscation or for the destruction or for the delivery of any property regarding which any offence is or was alleged to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence but shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture, confiscation, destruction or delivery contained in the Act under which the conviction was had or in any other Act applicable to the case.
  
 
 
Counsel first submitted that the prosecution could not rely on s 386(2) CPC where the Charter did not expressly provide for any punishment of forfeiture. Counsel brought to my attention the case of 
 Lim Poon Pok v PP 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 172
 . In that case, the question on reference to the Court of Appeal of the Federated Malay States (FMS) was whether s 407(ii) of the FMS Criminal Procedure Code (FMS CPC) conferred a general power of forfeiture. Section 407(ii) of the FMS CPC is substantially similar to our s 386(1) and (2) CPC. Willan CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, opined that it was `clear beyond doubt` that it did. Nonetheless, counsel suggested, relying on the judgment of Syed Othman J in 
 Yeo Siow Yee v PP 
 
 
 
[1974] 1 MLJ 54
 , that the power of forfeiture conferred under s 407(ii) of the FMS CPC was merely incidental or a mere attachment to the primary power of disposal. Finally, referring to the district court judgment in 
 PP v Boon Peng Keong & Anor 
 
 [1985] 1 MLJ 
 clxviii(n), counsel argued that forfeiture under s 386(2) CPC was not intended to be a form of enhanced punishment. If this had been Parliament`s intention, the existence of specific forfeiture provisions in legislation such as the Penal Code would have been duplicitous or superfluous.
I see no real difference in principle between the judgments of Willan CJ and Syed Othman J in 
 Lim Poon Pok 
 and 
 Yeo Siow Yee 
 respectively. Both judges essentially opined that the primary power is one of disposal, which includes the power of forfeiture. Should Willan CJ`s views be adopted, the effect is that s 386(2) CPC casts a wide net rendering liable to forfeiture all seized property `regarding which any offence is or was alleged to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence`. In other words, s 386(2) CPC operates as an omnibus provision, complementing those specific instances where Parliament may have chosen to expressly provide for the power of forfeiture.
The district judge in 
 Boon Peng Keong 
 chose not to follow Willan CJ`s ruling and declined to conclude that s 386(2) CPC necessarily confers a general power of forfeiture. It may be convenient to set out the relevant portions of the district judge`s reasons as follows: 
 
In my opinion, [s 386] of the Criminal Procedure Code, although vesting the court with a power of forfeiture, is not intended and should not be used as a section to enhance punishment. It is merely to enable a criminal court to dispose of case properties where it would not be in the interests of justice to allow an offender his continued possession. This would arise in instances where the case property can be shown to be unlawfully or improperly obtained and where ownership cannot be ascertained. To return it to the offender would be allowing him to benefit from his crime and therefore, in such circumstances, a deprivative order such as forfeiture can be made.
 
 
 
With respect, I am unable to agree with certain fundamental aspects of the district judge`s reasoning in 
 Boon Peng Keong 
`s case. First, the district judge held that s 385 of the CPC (now s 386) `is not intended and should not be used as a section to enhance punishment`. It appears that in coming to this conclusion, the district judge was influenced by his perception that provisions for forfeiture had been specifically enacted in other legislation, such as the Penal Code (ss 126, 127, 243A and 489E) and also the existence of the Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (Cap 120).
 Black`s Law Dictionary 
 (6th Ed), at p 650 defines `forfeiture` as `loss of some right or property as a penalty for some illegal act`. Forfeiture is primarily a punishment (per Evans J in 
 Chee Ng v PP 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 112
 , at p 113). If ordered, it serves little purpose other than being an additional penalty. What s 386(2) CPC provides for is the power of disposal of seized properties. This covers a very broad range of items which have been seized during arrest or in the course of police investigations. The power of disposal is expressly stated to include the power of forfeiture. The power of disposal `shall be exercised 
 subject to any special provisions 
 regarding forfeiture, confiscation, destruction or delivery contained in the Act under which the conviction was had or in any other Act applicable to the case` [Emphasis added].
In 
 Boon Peng Keong 
 `s case, the district judge opined that it would be `strange, if not superfluous` to specifically enact legislation dealing with forfeiture, if s 386(2) was intended to provide a general power of punishment by way of forfeiture. In doing so, the district judge did not adequately consider the provisions of s 386(2). It is apparent from the express reference in s 386(2) to `any special provisions` that the section contemplates specific provision being made in other pieces of legislation in relation to the imposition of forfeiture. In order to give effect to s 386(2), the express power of forfeiture contained therein must refer to a general power. Correspondingly, if exercised, it would serve as an enhancement of punishment. The only qualification is that it must be exercised subject to `special provisions` which exist in other legislation.
Secondly, there is nothing in the language of s 386(2) to indicate that forfeiture should be limited to cases where the case property was unlawfully or improperly obtained or where ownership cannot be ascertained. It appears that in imposing these qualifications, the district judge may have confused s 386(2) with s 392(1) CPC, which states: 
 
The seizure by any police officer of 
 property taken under section 29
 or 
 alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence
 shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate`s Court which shall make such order as it thinks fit respecting the delivery of the property to the person entitled to the possession of it or, if that person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of the property. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Section 29(1) CPC states that where a person has been arrested, a police officer may: 
 
... search such person and place in safe custody 
 all articles other than necessary wearing apparel found upon him
 and 
 any of those articles which there is reason to believe were the instruments or the fruits or other evidence of the crime.
[Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It is also pertinent to consider s 68 CPC, which provides as follows: 
 
(1) Any police officer may seize any property which is 
 alleged or suspected to have been stolen
 or which is 
 found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence.
 
 
 
 
(2) Such police officer, if subordinate to the officer in charge of a police station, shall forthwith report the seizure to that officer. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
The exact same language from s 68(1) pertaining to the articles capable of being seized has been employed in s 392(1) CPC. Hence, the range of articles seized under ss 29(1) or 68(1) CPC, and capable of falling within the scope of s 392(1) CPC, will comprise:
 
 
(i) all articles other than necessary wearing apparel found on the person arrested (the first limb of s 29(1)); 
 
(ii) the instruments or the fruits or other evidence of the crime (the second limb of s 29(1)); 
 
(iii) stolen items (the first limb of s 68(1)); or 
 
(iv) items found in circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence (the second limb of s 68(1)).
  
 
 
Two points may be noted in particular. First, s 392(1) CPC only empowers the court to make orders respecting 
 delivery 
 of the property to the person entitled to possession, or its 
 custody and production 
 if such a person cannot be ascertained. Unlike s 386(2), no power of forfeiture exists under s 392. This must be because s 392 was intended to apply only to situations where no prosecution has commenced, or where no prosecution will commence. Section 386(1) CPC, on the other hand, clearly stipulates that there must have been an `inquiry or trial in any criminal court` before the power of disposal may be exercised. Secondly, the range of articles liable to disposal under s 392(1) CPC is clearly fairly limited. Other than articles found on the person arrested (the first limb of s 29(1)), all the other references relate to properties which are essentially the instruments or the fruits or other evidence of the crime.
I am of the opinion that s 392 CPC is a general `disposal` provision relating to all articles seized under ss 29(1) or 68(1) CPC, where there has been no prosecution, and hence no concluded `trial or inquiry in any criminal court`. Section 386(2) CPC is drafted in unambiguous and broad terms. I see no reason why s 386(2) should be read subject to the limitations laid down by the district judge, as this would be reading into the clear terms of the provision. As I have sought to show from a comparison of ss 386 and 392, the district judge in 
 Boon Peng Keong 
appears to have erroneously imported the preconditions from s 392 and applied them to s 386.
I would abide by Willan CJ`s view, as expressed in 
 Lim Poon Pok 
 , that s 386(2) CPC operates as an omnibus provision conferring a general power of forfeiture. I should mention in passing that Murray-Aynsley CJ expressed similar sentiments, albeit without giving detailed reasons, in 
 Tan Lian v R 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 196
 . Thus, s 386(2) CPC is complementary to those specific forfeiture provisions contained within other legislation.
Section 386(2) CPC is clearly directory and not mandatory. The CPC provides no guidance as to how or when it will be appropriate for an order of forfeiture to be made. The CPC also does not contain any directions in respect of the procedure for the conduct of disposal inquiries. Hence, the policy and purpose behind an order for forfeiture, as well as its potentially draconian consequences, should be carefully considered in determining whether the court`s discretion should be exercised. I turn now to address counsel`s main submission, namely, that the district judge had exercised his discretion wrongly.
(b) The exercise of discretion
The district judge`s decision to forfeit the vehicle in the present case was made pursuant to the discretionary power conferred by s 386(2) CPC. There is no provision in the Charter for the forfeiture of vehicles, whether on a discretionary or mandatory basis.
Some conceptual distinctions between the various species of applications for forfeiture of vehicles should be kept in mind. First, the relevant legislation may stipulate in clear and unambiguous terms that forfeiture is mandatory (eg s 123(2) Customs Act (Cap 70, 1995 Ed) or s 43(3B) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed)). Upon an application for forfeiture in such instances, there is no question of any discretion to be exercised by the court. A fortiori, no disposal inquiry could have been held. This is clear from my decisions in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
  ; 
Long Foo Jin v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 663
  and 
PP v M/S Serve You Motor Service
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 669
  .
Where forfeiture is discretionary, special provisions governing forfeiture may be contained in the relevant legislation (eg s 20(3) Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed) or s 28 Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)). The court retains the discretion not to forfeit the vehicle (see eg 
Toh Teong Seng v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 273
  ;
Chandra Kumar v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
  ). In these cases, there is no room for s 386 CPC to operate. As I have stated in 
 Chandra Kumar 
 and 
 Long Foo Jin 
 , s 386 CPC operates only in a residual role, when the offence-creating provisions in the relevant legislation do not deal with the issue of disposal of property used or concerned in any offence.
Reverting to the present case, it is common ground that the hire-purchase agreement had been lawfully terminated upon the default in payment of instalments by the hirer. It is also not disputed that MFB would be entitled to possession of the vehicle under the agreement unless an order for forfeiture is made. The only issue is whether there are cogent reasons to forfeit the vehicle. In this connection, I accept counsel`s submission that some of the guidelines laid down by this court in 
 Chandra Kumar`s 
 case should be considered, with the appropriate modifications.
Generally, an important consideration will be the degree of complicity of the claimant in the offence. It may also be pertinent to have regard to the fact that he could not reasonably have taken any preventive measures regarding the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence. The value of the vehicle is relevant insofar as it should be considered whether forfeiture will be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the maximum punishment which may be imposed. The extent of use of the vehicle may be relevant where the offence was a continuing offence, or where the vehicle was used on several occasions for the illegal purpose.
The main consideration which counsel for MFB has relied upon is the fact that MFB was an innocent third party. MFB had no knowledge of the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence. It did not benefit from the commission of the offence. Moreover, in practical terms, there was nothing it could have done to prevent the use of the vehicle in the commission of offences. I concur that these are pertinent considerations in the present case.
Having applied to forfeit the vehicle, the prosecution must satisfy the court that forfeiture is an appropriate order in the circumstances. Unfortunately, the learned district judge appears to have omitted to address this question altogether. His reasons for forfeiting the vehicle were as follows: 
 
The court was of the view that the appellant [MFB], in this case the hire-purchase company, suffered no financial hardship as they had ample remedies under the terms of the agreement to compensate for the loss. The court cannot enrich them twice over as they would have collected instalments in respect of the hire-purchase and should the court return the car to them, they would have the car as well. Finally the court was of the view that there was no serious injustice done to the hire-purchase company.
 
 
 
It is evident that the district judge did not direct his mind to the appropriateness of an order of forfeiture. In effect, he required MFB to show cause why the vehicle should not be forfeited. With respect, this approach was erroneous. There is no principle of law or practice which dictates that forfeiture must be ordered unless good reasons for not doing so are shown by the claimant. The onus remains on the prosecution to show that forfeiture will be appropriate in the circumstances of each case, where forfeiture is sought under s 386 CPC. After all, where the claimant has established his entitlement to possession, the appropriate order in the absence of any application for forfeiture would be to deliver the property to him.
It would also appear that the district judge was unduly influenced by the consideration that MFB would suffer no financial hardship as it had `ample remedies` in the event of breach of the hire-purchase agreement. MFB agreed that it could have recourse to the hirer and the guarantor under the hire-purchase agreement. The hirer had kept up his instalment payments until the vehicle was seized. There was no evidence of the hirer`s impecuniosity. These were essentially the same concerns noted by Brown Ag CJ in 
 Re Motor Traders Finance Co Ltd 
 
 
 
[1951] MLJ 123
  (the 
 Motor Traders 
 case). The appellants in that case were also in the hire-purchase business. They were claimants to a vehicle which the prosecution sought to forfeit, having been used by the accused in relation to an offence of possession of opium, contrary to s 3 of the Opium and Chandu Proclamation. The accused had borrowed the car from the hirer, one Tan Swee Loh, who was aware of the accused`s illegal activities involving the use of the car. Brown Ag CJ upheld the lower court`s order of forfeiture on two premises: first, that Tan Swee Loh had `guilty knowledge`, and next, that the claimants would be able to commence civil proceedings to recover the balance of money remaining due to them under the hire-purchase agreement.
I am conscious that the 
 Motor Traders 
 case has not been overruled and remains binding on our lower courts. To this extent, the district judge may have felt constrained to follow the reasoning therein. However, I would respectfully decline to adopt Brown Ag CJ`s approach. I will deal with the point as to the hirer`s `guilty knowledge` at a subsequent juncture. In relation to the other premise, I am of the opinion that it would not materially aid the inquiry to consider whether a claimant may have recourse elsewhere for civil remedies. In the present case, the alternative remedies available to MFB arise under the hire-purchase agreement. They are part and parcel of the contractual bargain. Their availability to MFB does not ipso facto provide any rational justification for forfeiting the vehicle. Similarly, the district judge`s argument that delivering the vehicle to MFB would `enrich` MFB twice over is untenable. Delivery of the vehicle merely gives effect to MFB`s rights under the hire-purchase agreement. There is no enrichment in any sense.
The learned DPP has thus argued that forfeiture was sought in the present case to deter similar offenders. I should add that the district judge did not mention in his grounds of decision that he was guided by any considerations of deterrence. Nevertheless, the question of deterrence merits some further analysis.
The objective of deterrence may well provide the only explanation why forfeiture should be ordered in any case. However, the DPP has not explained why deterrence should have been a primary consideration in the present case. He has only submitted that foreign traffic entering Singapore is heavy and detection of such offenders extremely difficult. I am not persuaded by this argument. Difficulty of detection per se would not mean ineluctably that the offence must be deterred.
Forfeiture operates most meaningfully as a deterrent where the property to be forfeited belongs to the accused, or to someone tainted with complicity. As this court has observed in 
 Chandra Kumar 
 (at p 127): 
 
[Deterrence] is only a relevant consideration when dealing with an owner who is himself guilty of an offence. An innocent owner cannot be held liable for the actions of others, no matter how much of a deterrent forfeiture of his vehicle would be.
 
 
 
A similar view was espoused by Russell J earlier in 
 Cheng Kee Huat v PP 
 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 53
  (followed in 
 PP v Lim Geok Ching 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 154
  and 
 Re Hillman Minx No SU 3503 
 [1962] 28 MLJ 250). These sentiments mirror those expressed by Pedlow J in 
 Tan Ah Lek v R 
 
 
 
[1941] MLJ 56
 . This was an appeal involving the forfeiture of a taxi under s 83 of the Liquor Revenue Ordinance. The taxi had been hailed by a passenger who had with him some dutiable liquor. There was no evidence that the taxi-driver was in possession or control of the liquor. Both the passenger and the taxi-driver were charged and convicted of being in possession or control of dutiable liquor. The taxi was forfeited. On appeal by the taxi-driver, Pedlow J quashed his conviction and ordered the taxi to be returned to him. Pedlow J held that a vehicle belonging to an innocent third party should not have been forfeited. In the learned judge`s words (at p 57): 
 
In my view the Ordinance does not call for any such forfeiture. Were the case otherwise one must reach the most absurd positions. [Is it] to be said that if a litigant is dissatisfied with a decision of mine he could out of spite, leave this Court and go downstairs to where my car is garaged and place some dutiable liquor in it or himself get into my car with dutiable liquor in his possession, have himself arrested by the Monopolies Department and have my car forfeited under this section? Surely that would be absurd? The Ordinance cannot in my opinion have such a meaning as applied to an innocent third person.
 
 
 
In the present case, MFB has not been involved in the commission of the offence. It may be argued that hire-purchase companies like MFB, however unconnected with the offence, should be prepared to bear the consequences of forfeiture as part of their foreseeable commercial risk. It has also been suggested that hire-purchase companies and rental companies should endeavour to take precautions against the use of their vehicles for illegal purposes. In most cases, they are in a position to protect themselves against pecuniary loss and may look elsewhere for remedies. However valid these considerations may be, they cannot provide the reason for forfeiture in the present case. The inevitable consequence of forfeiture where the owner is an innocent third party is to penalize him primarily. If the argument is that the accused should be penalized, perhaps it is sufficient that the vehicle be repossessed by MFB, thus depriving him of its continued use.
From the reasons I have stated, it will be apparent why I have chosen to depart from Brown Ag CJ`s views in the 
 Motor Traders 
case. The court is vested with a discretion. Its duty is to exercise it judicially. I do not see how the discretion to forfeit could be said to have been properly exercised in the 
 Motor Traders 
 case. The claimant was innocent of any complicity in the offence. The fact that the hirer may have had `guilty knowledge` does not justify punishing the claimant. The fact that the vehicle was used in the commission of the offence is similarly no justification by itself for forfeiture. Otherwise, this would lead to the patently absurd result that forfeiture would have to be ordered upon the prosecution`s application even if the accused had stolen the vehicle for use in the commission of the offence.
Finally, I note that the district judge did not consider whether forfeiture would have been proportionate to the gravity of the offence, or to the maximum punishment provided for under s 140 of the Charter. In arguing that forfeiture was necessary as a deterrent, the DPP also suggested that this was because the offence committed was a serious one. A maximum sentence of $10,000 or five years` imprisonment may be imposed by the court under s 140. The accused was fined $8,000. The offence in question was not even considered sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence, let alone the maximum fine of $10,000. This only creates further doubt as to whether forfeiture was appropriate.
One further observation should be made. The district judge had directed that the disposal inquiry be heard on 25 August 1995. On that date, he was informed that the investigating officer had not completed his investigations into the matter. As such, the inquiry was adjourned to 20 October 1995, when it was eventually heard.
In my opinion, where the prosecution intends to apply to forfeit seized properties, it should ensure that all relevant investigations pertaining to the question of forfeiture are completed before the conclusion of the trial. After all, s 386(1) CPC prescribes that disposal should be dealt with `during or at the conclusion of any inquiry or trial`, and not well after it. The properties would have been seized long before the commencement of the trial. It must be obvious that upon the conclusion of the trial, an order for disposal will have to be obtained. If thorough investigations have been carried out, I am confident that this will greatly assist the prosecution in considering the merits of each claim and determining whether an application for forfeiture should be made. Of course, it will be incumbent on any claimants to the property to notify the prosecution of their intended claim as soon as practicable.
 Conclusion 
In my opinion, the DPP has not pointed to any cogent reason why forfeiture would be justified. I am of the view that forfeiture would give rise to serious injustice. Pursuant to the exercise of my revisionary jurisdiction, and having regard to s 256(d) CPC, the district judge`s order will be altered. The order of forfeiture will be quashed. In its place, I order that the vehicle be delivered to MFB.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 8 December 1994, the plaintiff, who is currently the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister`s Office, commenced proceedings against the four defendants claiming damages for alleged libel contained in an article entitled `The smoke over parts of Asia obscures some profound concerns` published in the International Herald Tribune (IHT) on 7 October 1994. The first defendant was the executive editor, the third defendant was the editor for Asia and the fourth defendant was the publisher of the IHT. The second defendant was the author of the article containing the alleged defamation. The first, third and fourth defendants entered appearance on 12 December 1994 and filed their defence on 23 January 1995.
The relevant part in the article published in the IHT that caused offence was as follows: 
 
Intolerant regimes in the region reveal considerable ingenuity in their methods of suppressing dissent ... Others are more subtle: relying upon a compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians, or ... .
 
 
 
In the statement of claim filed on 9 January 1995 the plaintiff claimed that these words in the context of the said article were widely understood to refer to the plaintiff and that these words meant and were understood to mean, in their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo, that the plaintiff had cynically sought to suppress legitimate and democratic political activity in Singapore by the subtle means of: 
 
(1) suing political opponents for defamation knowing that he did not have a meritorious claim or claims; and/or
 
 
 
 
(2) relying on a `compliant judiciary` to grant judgment in his favour irrespective of the merits; for the purpose of using any judgment thus obtained to bankrupt the relevant political opponents and/or for the specific purpose of thereby prohibiting them from taking part in any election activity. The statement of claim gave particulars of various court actions for defamation instituted by the plaintiff in some of which bankruptcy petitions had been filed by the plaintiff upon default by the judgment debtor concerned to pay the damages awarded.
  
 
 
The first, third and fourth defendants had, in the 10-11 December 1994 issue of the IHT, apologised unreservedly to the plaintiff and to the Singapore judiciary for having published the impugned passage in the said article. In their apology they acknowledged that the passage could be understood as suggesting that the plaintiff had sought to suppress political activity in Singapore by bankrupting opposition politicians through court action in which the plaintiff relied on a compliant judiciary to find in his favour without regard to the merits of his case. The first, third and fourth defendants stated in the apology that it was not their intention to make such a suggestion and went on to say that such a suggestion would be unfounded and that they did not associate themselves with it.
The defence filed by the first, third and fourth defendants was consistent with this apology. In the defence, the first, third and fourth defendants acknowledged that the said words were capable of being construed as having reference to the plaintiff, admitted that the words were defamatory and undertook not to further publish the said words or similar defamatory words.
On 19 April 1995 the first, third and fourth defendants consented to judgment being entered against them for damages to be assessed and an order to that effect was recorded by Lai Siu Chiu J. On 27 November 1995 at the assessment hearing, Goh Joon Seng J recorded a consent order that the first, third and fourth defendants pay the plaintiff damages of $300,000 plus costs. It was recorded in the consent judgment that the plaintiff`s claim against the second defendant was expressly reserved and that the judgment shall not operate as a bar to the plaintiff`s claim against the second defendant.
The second defendant was at the relevant time living in Georgia, United States of America. To serve the writ on him, leave to serve process out of the jurisdiction of this court had to be obtained. The plaintiff applied for and was granted such leave. On 12 January 1995 the solicitors for the plaintiff formally requested that the writ of summons, the order of court for service out of jurisdiction and the statement of claim be served, through the proper channels, on the second defendant at the second defendant`s address in Georgia, USA. Pursuant to that request service of the documents was effected in Georgia on the second defendant on 7 March 1995 by the United States Department of Justice. The plaintiff`s solicitors were notified of the said service on 28 June 1995. The second defendant, however, did not enter appearance or file any defence.
In this application which I heard on 28 March 1996, Counsel for the plaintiff sought, inter alia, judgment in default of appearance against the second defendant for such sum by way of damages as may be assessed. In his submission, counsel submitted that the impugned words could only have the meaning pleaded and was not capable of any other meaning. He submitted that the said words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in the way of his office, cause damage to the plaintiff`s reputation and cause injury to the plaintiff`s feelings.
In the context in which the words were used it is clear that they referred to the plaintiff and to the judiciary of Singapore. An independent and impartial judiciary is a fundamental pillar of our society. Every judge of the Supreme Court is required by the Constitution to take an oath that he will discharge his duties `without fear or favour, affection or ill-will` to the best of his abilities. To allege that the judiciary is compliant to the wishes of the plaintiff; to say or imply that the judiciary will find in favour of the plaintiff, whatever the merits of the plaintiff`s case, is to undermine and degrade the judiciary. But it is not the undermining of the judiciary that is the issue in this case. It is the undermining of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has, throughout his political career, emphasized and advocated the need for honest government. In his affidavit filed herein the plaintiff states: 
 
I was outraged and indignant at the suggestion that I manipulated the judiciary to achieve political ends. The statements (of the second defendant) were of a particularly vicious nature as they suggest wrongdoing, dishonesty and abuse of power and authority on my part.
 
 
 
For the second defendant to suggest that court proceedings instituted by the plaintiff had no merits and that the plaintiff was able to obtain judgments in his favour because of a compliant judiciary is, in the absence of a reasonable defence, a scandalous and outrageous suggestion and a most severe slur on the honesty of the plaintiff.
When words defamatory of a person are published, the law presumes that the words are false and the burden of proving that they are true is placed on the defendant [
 Duncan & Neill on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed): para 17.02]. If the second defendant wished to dispute the plaintiff`s claims in these proceedings, the course open to the second defendant was to enter appearance and file his defence. It would, for instance, have been open to the second defendant in his defence to deny that the said words referred to the plaintiff; or, the second defendant could in his defence admit that the words referred to the plaintiff but nevertheless, if the circumstances existed, raise other defences. If, for example, the second defendant had done a careful study of the cases instituted by the plaintiff against the plaintiff`s political opponents and was able to show that in all or the majority of the cases the plaintiff had succeeded even though there was no merit in the plaintiff`s claims, the second defendant could perhaps draw the conclusion that the plaintiff succeeded in those cases because of a compliant judiciary. In such a situation the second defendant could have raised the defence of justification or perhaps fair comment. But the second defendant chose not to follow any of these courses. He opted out. He did not want to defend the plaintiff`s claim. It appears to me that he chose not to defend the claim because he knew that he had made that statement recklessly and had no defence whatsoever.
In the circumstances, I ordered that judgment in default of appearance be entered against the second defendant for damages to be assessed. I also granted the plaintiff`s application that the second defendant be restrained, whether by himself or otherwise, from further publishing or causing to be published the same or similar words. As I did not have the benefit of any submission on behalf of the second defendant and as in the assessment of damages I needed to consider the effect of the consent judgment for $300,000 on the award to be made against the second defendant, I reserved judgment on the amount of damages to award. I also reserved judgment on counsel`s application that the plaintiff be awarded costs on an indemnity basis. I now give my judgment on these two matters.
 Damages 
Our law relating to libel and slander and the principles of law on the measure of damages payable in such cases are similar to the law in England. Counsel for the plaintiff therefore relied on and quoted extensively from 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
(8th Ed) and 
 Duncan & Neill on 
 
 Defamation 
(2nd Ed) on the circumstances that the courts consider in determining damages. I accept the principles outlined therein. Apart from the nature and gravity of the libel itself, among the other circumstances that would be relevant in assessing damages in this case are:
 
 
(a) the conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the defendant; 
 
(b) the mode and extent of the publication; 
 
(c) the natural indignation of the court at the injury caused to the plaintiff; 
 
(d) the conduct of the defendant from the time the libel is published to the very moment of the verdict; 
 
(e) the failure to apologise and retract the libel; and 
 
(f) malice.
  
 
 
The plaintiff is a person of very high standing. He was the Prime Minister of Singapore and is now Senior Minister. The article was published in the IHT, an influential and reputable newspaper with a readership both in Singapore and internationally. The article contained a vicious and unprovoked attack on the integrity of the plaintiff. For the injury caused to the plaintiff by the article the damages payable was, as between the plaintiff and the other defendants, agreed at $300,000 and a consent judgment entered into to that effect. I am satisfied that that sum was a fair measure of damages to award to the plaintiff for the libel suffered considering the conciliatory way in which the other defendants conducted themselves after the publication of the libel.
But the second defendant conducted himself differently. He refused to apologise. Not only did the second defendant refuse to apologise but he has continued to repeat the libel. In particular, the second defendant, at a recent function in Hong Kong jointly organised by the Foreign Correspondents` Club and Freedom Forum, launched a book entitled `Singapore`s Authoritarian Capitalism`. In this book the second defendant recounted his version of the circumstances surrounding the publication of the article in the IHT. An indication of what the second defendant had to say in the book can be gleaned from the contents page of the book and from the following extract of a review published on the last page of the book: 
 
The very mention of Christopher Lingle`s name turns Harry Lee (Kuan Yew) and his whole compliant judiciary purple with rage.
 
 
 
Though the book was published in Hong Kong, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that it was nevertheless relevant in the assessment of damages as it reflected the second defendant`s frame of mind in respect of the plaintiff. The publication and launch of the book, he submitted, indicated that the second defendant has no qualms about repeating the libel, first published in the IHT, to as wide and as influential an audience as possible to cause further injury to the plaintiff`s reputation and standing.
I have no difficulty in accepting the submission of counsel. The conduct of the second defendant shows that he was motivated by malice and was intent on injuring the plaintiff as widely and gravely as possible. The award of the $300,000 made as against the other defendants did not take these aggravating factors into account. Also that award was against the editors and publisher who, as a general rule, would be less culpable than the author of an article.
At common law a plaintiff is entitled only to a single award in respect of any single publication of a libel or slander even though the publication was made by a number of persons. The position is put thus in 
 Gatley 
 at paras 1463 and 1464: 
 
1463 In an action against two or more persons as co-defendants in respect of a joint libel the jury may not discriminate between them in finding separate damages against the different defendants, but there must be one verdict and one judgment against all for the total damages awarded. Even though the defendants sever their defences, the jury have no power, jurisdiction or authority to apportion the damages, and if they do so, judgment cannot be entered against the several defendants for the amounts so apportioned. The unity of the verdict and of the judgment where the tort is joint is founded on and must stand with the legal theory of the liability of joint tortfeasors. It is the necessary and logical result of the legal principles applicable to this kind of action. What the plaintiff is entitled to receive is a sum representing the damage that he has suffered from a single wrong inflicted by all.
... 
(1464) In an action against two or more persons in respect of a joint libel one set of damages will be fixed and such damages must be assessed according to the total amount of injury resulting from the common act. And if any of the defendants has not participated in aggravating circumstances, aggravated damages may not be assessed. `The true criterion of damage is the whole injury which the plaintiff has sustained from their joint act.`
 
 
 
The question therefore arose whether the plaintiff, having obtained judgment for damages in the sum of $300,000 from the first, third and fourth defendants, was entitled to pursue his claim for damages as against the second defendant.
In addressing this question, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the common law position had been modified by s 19 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75). Section 19 provides: 
 
Whenever in any action for libel the plaintiff sues more than one defendant, whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative, each defendant may file a separate statement of his case and appear at the trial by separate counsel or, if he thinks fit, apologise or pay money into court or make other amends, whatever may be the defences set up by his co-defendants, and the plaintiff may accept such apology, money, or other amends and settle or compromise the suit and discontinue the action as between himself and one or more defendants 
 without reference to the other defendants
:
 
 
 
Provided that the rights and interests of the other defendant or defendants shall not in any way be prejudiced thereby. [Emphasis added.]
Counsel pointed out that it was by virtue of s 19 that the reservation had been made in the consent order that the order shall not operate as a bar to the plaintiff`s claim against the second defendant.
Section 19 provides that a plaintiff may settle or compromise a suit with one or more defendants `without reference to the other defendants`. But do these words `without reference to the other defendants` mean that the plaintiff can by virtue of s 19 preserve his claim against those defendants with whom there was no settlement? Counsel submitted that they did and in support quoted the case of 
 Raja Shariman & Anor v CA Ribeiro & Co Ltd & Ors 
(1921) 1 MC 57.
In 
 Raja Shariman 
 , the plaintiff had commenced an action claiming damages for an alleged libel published in the 
 Utusan Melayu 
 on 9 November 1920. It was brought against three defendants, who were respectively the printers, the publisher and the editor of the paper. The first defendants paid into court the sum of $1,000 which was accepted by the plaintiff in satisfaction of the claim against them. The second defendant failed to put in a defence and interlocutory judgment was entered against him. The third defendant pleaded as a defence the plaintiff`s acceptance in satisfaction of the money paid into court by the first defendants. The plaintiff, relying on s 12 of the Libel Ordinance (which is in pari materia with the present s 19), submitted that the common law had been altered by that section and that as a result a plaintiff could accept a payment into court made by one defendant in a libel action in which he is sued jointly with other defendants, and still proceed with the action and recover damages from the other joint tortfeasors. Walter Shaw CJ, in his judgment, dealt with this submission very comprehensively. It will be useful to refer at some length to his judgment: 
 
The section is a most difficult one to construe, and I have felt great difficulty in arriving at the intention of the Legislature. If the words used in the section are taken in their strict grammatical meaning, they are in no way ambiguous. But if they are so read, the section would be inoperative and fulfil no useful purpose, for a defendant may, apart from the provisions of the section, do all the things that he is thereby authorized to do, and a plaintiff may likewise do what he is by it authorized to do, 
 without referring to another defendant
.
 
 
 
I am bound to assume that the Legislature intended the section to fulfil some useful purpose and intended that some result should follow if the parties to the action take the steps authorised by it. If I can arrive with reasonable certainty at the intention of the Legislature, I am bound to give effect to it even if I have for that purpose, to disregard some of the words used or to interpolate words that are not there.
The words `without reference to the other defendants` are obviously intended to mean something more than the strict grammatical meaning which the words imply, and some consequence is intended to ensue from their use, which I must endeavour to ascertain to give effect to. For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, I am entitled to look at the scope and intention of the Ordinance, as disclosed by its other provisions,
...
Looking, however, at the Ordinance itself, I have come to the conclusion that I can gather from it with sufficient certainty the intention of the Legislature as to the operation of s 12. The Ordinance incorporated, in substance, the provisions relating to civil actions in respect of libel contained in the Imperial Acts 6 and 7 Vic C 96; 8 and 9 Vic C 75; 51 and 52 Vic C 64; and 54 and 55 Vic C 41. It also contains, in ss 7, 12, 13 and 14, provisions that have no counterpart in the Imperial Acts.
...
Sections 7 (the equivalent of our s 18) and 12 are entirely new provisions which, although separated in the Ordinance, appear to have some connection.
Section 7 effects this change in the law, namely, that, where two or more joint tortfeasors are sued in respect of the same libel, any one of them who is less culpable than the other or others may apply to have the damages separately assessed, and shall only be liable for the amount of the damages so separately assessed against him, and shall not be liable jointly with the other tortfeasors for the whole of the damages, as he would have been under the pre-existing law.
Section 12 appears to be intended to provide a corollary to s 7, and to again affirm the new principle enunciated by that section, namely, that joint tortfeasors shall only be liable to the extent of their own culpability, by providing that one of the several joint tortfeasors sued together may escape liability for the whole of the damages by compromising with the plaintiff or by paying money into court which may be accepted by the plaintiff 
 without prejudice to his rights to continue the action and to recover the rest of the damages to which he may be entitled from the other joint tortfeasor or tortfeasors 
. I, therefore, read the words `without reference to the other defendants` to mean `without affecting his right to proceed with the action against the other defendants`.
The proviso at the end of the section `that the rights and interests of the other defendant or defendants shall not in any way be prejudiced thereby` appears to me merely to mean that they shall not be prejudiced in their defence by any compromise or admission of liability made by another of the joint tortfeasors.
In my opinion, the point taken on behalf of the third defendant fails, and the action did not come to an end on the acceptance by the plaintiff of the sum paid into court by the first defendant, and the effect of the provision contained in s 12 is that he may continue the action and recover 
 any further damages 
 he may satisfy the court he has sustained from the defendants who have not paid money into court. [Emphasis added.]
I agree with Walter Shaw CJ that the section is a difficult one to construe. I also agree that not to read s 19 as enabling a plaintiff to settle with one or more defendants while preserving his right to continue with the claim for damages against the remaining defendants would deprive s 19 of any useful purpose. I accordingly accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that, by reason of s 19, the plaintiff is, despite the settlement with the other defendants, entitled to continue the action against the second defendant and, following the decision in 
 Raja Shariman 
, I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from the second defendant which damages would include the further injury to the plaintiff caused by the conduct of the second defendant.
The other three defendants had made a public apology and undertaken not to repeat the libel. Far from showing contrition the second defendant appears intent on continuing to damage the reputation of the plaintiff on a matter that strikes at the very core of the plaintiff`s integrity. The injury caused to the plaintiff is not a matter that can be measured in monetary terms, but such a measurement has to be undertaken. In so doing I am guided, to some extent, by awards made in other defamation cases quoted to me by counsel and by the danger, noted by Lord Hailsham in 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
 
[1972] AC 1027
 at p 1081G, of making an excessive award. I also took into account the fact that although the second defendant, by his conduct, aggravated the injury to the plaintiff, the main injury to the plaintiff was in the publication of the libel in the IHT in respect of which a sum of $300,000 has been awarded. In all the circumstances of this case, I assess the damages payable to the plaintiff as compensation for the libel suffered at $400,000.
This sum of $400,000 is not to be in addition to the award of $300,000 already made as against the first, third and fourth defendants. To add the two would not accord with principle. It would mean that by instituting proceedings against a multitude of defendants arising out of the publication of the same libel a plaintiff would be able to obtain overlapping amounts as compensation. In 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
 at p 1063D, Lord Hailsham, in considering such a situation, stated the law to be as follows: 
 
I think ... that awards of punitive damages in respect of joint publications should reflect only the lowest figure for which any of them can be held liable. This seems to me to flow inexorably both from the principle that only one sum may be awarded in a single proceedings for a joint tort, and from the authorities ... I think that the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from those authorities is that only one sum can be awarded by way of exemplary damages where the plaintiff elects to sue more than one defendant in the same action in respect of the same publication, and that this sum must represent the highest 
 common
 factor, that is, the 
 lowest
 sum for which any of the defendants can be held liable on this score. Although we were concerned with exemplary damages, I would think that the same principle applies generally and in particular to aggravated damages, and that dicta or apparent dicta to the contrary can be disregarded ... Plaintiffs who wish to differentiate between the defendants can do so in various ways, for example, by electing to sue the more guilty only, by commencing separate proceedings against each and then consolidating, or, in the case of a book or newspaper article, by suing separately in the same proceedings for the publication of the manuscript to the publisher by the author.
 
 
 
It is clear that s 19 of our Defamation Act overrides the above statement of the law to the extent that a plaintiff can, under s 19, settle with one or more defendants without jeopardizing his right to claim further damages as against the other defendants. But s 19 does not, in my view, mandate the award of overlapping damages against each of several defendants. The position, therefore, is that the second defendant in this case is jointly liable with the other defendants for the $300,000 and solely liable to the plaintiff for the additional $100,000.
 Costs 
Counsel for the plaintiff sought an order from this court that the second defendant pay the costs of these proceedings on an indemnity basis. Before the amendments to the Rules of the Supreme Court which introduced the standard and indemnity basis of awarding costs, the practice of the courts was, unless there were special circumstances so warranting, to order costs to the successful litigant on a party and party basis. Thus in 
 Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd (No 2) 
 [1980] Ch 515, Brightman LJ said: 
 
But the usual rule ... is that the defendant pays to the plaintiff only party and party costs. It is not, I think, the policy of the courts in hostile litigation to give the successful party an indemnity against the expense to which he has been put and, therefore, to compensate him for the loss which he has inevitably suffered, save in very special cases. Why this should be, I do not know, but the practice is well established and I do not think that there is any sufficient reason to depart from that practice in the case before me.
 
 
 
After the amendments this practice has continued and unless there are special circumstances courts award costs to the successful litigant on a standard basis.
In the case of 
 Lee Hiok Ping & Ors v Lee Hiok Woon & Anor (sued as executors and trustees of the estate of Lee Wee Nam, deceased) & Ors 
(Suit No 1401/73 and 2457/81, unreported), it was submitted, by counsel for the successful party therein, that under the new rules the need to show special circumstances justifying the award of costs on an indemnity basis had been abrogated. In dealing with this submission, Chao Hick Tin J (in an unreported decision) said: 
 
Mr Burke Gaffney boldly submitted to me that these two cases, 
 Bowen-Jones
 and 
 Berkeley Administration
, both of which were first instance decisions, were wrongly decided. He said that the only question for the court to consider under the new rule is whether the case is an appropriate one for the court to order costs on the indemnity basis. He contended that under the new rule there is no need for a successful litigant to show that there are exceptional circumstances or a special case to be entitled to costs on the indemnity basis. He submitted that the new rule places a very much lighter burden on the party seeking costs on that basis. However, he conceded that there has not been any subsequent reported case which decided otherwise.
 
 
 
It is obvious that I am not bound by these two cases. But it is not terribly helpful by merely submitted that it is up to this court to decide whether, in a particular case, it is appropriate to order costs on the indemnity basis. I need to know on what principle or premise should I decide that question. What are the sort of circumstances or considerations which the court has to take into account in determining whether it is appropriate or otherwise? No assistance is given to me in this regard. Yet I am urged to throw overboard all the previous practice. Rule 27(1) does not give any guidelines or indications as to the circumstances or situations where it would be appropriate to order costs on the indemnity basis. It leave the question entirely open to the court. But from the wording of that rule, it is clear that the standard basis is to be the norm and that the indemnity basis is to be the exception. From this it necessarily follows that costs on the indemnity basis should only be ordered in a special case or where there are exceptional circumstances.
In this regard I think it may be pertinent to bear in mind what appears to be the object behind the new rule. This is explained in 
 Butterworths Costs Service Vol 1 
 at para A54 as follows: 
 
`New legislation in 1986 did away with most of these bases, created the standard basis, and put the indemnity basis into the rules. It will be noticed that the names of all the older bases of taxation correspond to possible sources of payment of costs. This made the concept of a basis of taxation difficult to grasp because it contained two interrelated ideas, the idea of taxation criteria and the idea of `who pays`. This practice has grown up of inter partes costs being awarded fairly often on a common fund basis and even occasionally on a solicitor-and-own-client basis. Also, because the phrase `party-and-party` was often used to mean inter partes, the whole subject of bases became hard to grasp. The new system of having names for bases - standard and indemnity - which do not also suggest possible sources of payment should make the subject clearer.`
 
 
 
Having given the matter the most anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the new rule is not intended to effect a radical change in the basis for awarding costs in contentious proceedings. If that were intended, I would have expected r 27(1) to say something more explicitly. I am not prepared to disregard the previous practice. Of course the question of costs is always a matter of discretion of the court. But it is a discretion which must be exercised judicially; exceptional circumstances or a special case must be shown for the court to order costs on the indemnity basis.
 
 
 
I agree with the views expressed by Chao Hick Tin J.
The submission advanced in the present case for seeking costs on an indemnity basis was that the conduct of the second defendant towards the plaintiff was reprehensible. I have accepted that that was so and it was in recognition of that that I made the order for further damages herein. Having done so, I do not think that it would be right for me, on that ground, to depart from the normal rule and order costs against the second defendant on an indemnity basis. No other grounds for departing from the normal rule has been canvassed before me. I, therefore, order that the second defendant bear the plaintiff`s costs in these proceedings on a standard basis. The costs are to be taxed by the registrar.

The undisputed facts are that the plaintiffs had commenced an action earlier (S 1842/92) on 9 September 1992 against one Quah Wee Tiong (Wee Tiong) a stock broker employed by them, claiming a sum of $1,552,027.99 plus interest in respect of his liabilities to the plaintiffs arising from his stock and share dealings. On 
 11 September 1992 
 the plaintiffs obtained an order to arrest him in the action but the attempt to serve the order on him at 
 8 Jubilee Road where he resided with the defendant, his father 
 after it was obtained, was unsuccessful. On 
 15 September 1992 
, the plaintiffs obtained an order for interim injunction in the said action to restrain him from disposing or otherwise dealing with his assets. On the same date, the plaintiffs` solicitors, Allen & Gledhill immediately informed Wee Tiong`s solicitors, David Lim & Partners, who were then the solicitors of Wee Tiong in the sale of a property at 8-A Duchess Park of the said order that had been obtained but the order remained at that time unserved personally on Wee Tiong. Wee Tiong`s brother Quah Wee Tong (Wee Tong) was then working as a solicitor in David Lim & Partners. The said firm under their reference: DL/QWT/92-00360-8/km acknowledged Allen & Gledhill`s letter on the same day. The initials DL and QWT stand for David Lim/Quah Wee Tong. The plaintiffs` solicitors were in effect informed by M/s David Lim eventually on 21 September 1992 that after repayment of the financiers` mortgage loan there was no balance of moneys left to repay any moneys to the plaintiffs or other creditors. Wee Tiong was eventually arrested by the sheriff on 
 24 April 1993 
 at 8 Jubilee Road and brought before me in chambers. He was, however, discharged by me after a hearing. On
 3 May 1993 
Wee Tiong entered an appearance to the said action brought against him.
On 
 26 July 1993 
 the plaintiffs obtained judgment against Wee Tiong in the sum claimed as stated earlier. The plaintiffs thereafter learnt in 
 August 1993 
 that 
 720 shares 
 in a company known as Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd (Soon Aik) had been transferred by Wee Tiong to his father the defendant herein who was the patriarch of the family business Soon Aik. Soon Aik owns land in Singapore.
On 
 18 August 1993 
 , the plaintiffs` solicitors wrote to M/s Menon & Associates, the auditors of Soon Aik and asked a number of questions which were responded to by M/s Menon & Associates by letter on 19 August 1993. The questions and answers respectively were as follows: 
 
(a) Q: What is the actual date of transfer of the shares from Quah Wee Tiong to Quah Kay Tee?
 
 
 
 
A: Transfer form (from Quah Wee Tiong to Quah Kay Tee) dated 
 8 December 1992 
, duly executed.
  
 
 
(b) Q: What is the date of the instrument of transfer?
A: Directors` resolution regarding the said transfer dated 
 7 December 1992. 
 
 
 
(c) Q: What is the consideration that was given for the transfer of the share?
A: Pages 1 and 6 of Mr Quah Kay Tee and Mr Quah Wee Tiong from the statutory register.

Counsel for the plaintiffs explained that Wee Tiong was not made a party to the action because the plaintiffs already had a judgment against him which was unsatisfied. He had also told the court (when he appeared before me) on 24 April 1993 after his arrest by the sheriff 
 that he had `no house or assets in Singapore except my CPF`. 
He also said then that he could not furnish security in respect of the claim being made against him (
 PBD 42 
). At a subsequent hearing, I was also informed that Wee Tiong had returned to Singapore in December 1992 (
 PBD 47 
).
The plaintiffs in their statement of claim, inter alia, averred that:
 
 
(i) Wee Tiong`s brother, Wee Tong, was a solicitor in David Lim & Partners on 15 September 1992. Thereafter, he would have notified Wee Tiong and the defendant being the father, of the order for interim injunction. 
 
(ii) In any event, on 
 22 September 1992 
, Wee Tiong acknowledged to the plaintiffs in writing from Taipei, Taiwan, his awareness of the order to arrest him and of the order for interim injunction; and 
 
(iii) Wee Tiong would also have notified the defendant of the order for interim injunction.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs thereby averred that:
 
 
- Wee Tiong transferred the said shares to the defendant in Soon Aik as a result of a 
 conspiracy 
to injure the plaintiffs who as creditors of Wee Tiong would eventually be entitled to seize the shares to meet their claim and consequently claimed loss and damage suffered from the said
 conspiracy 
 between Wee Tiong and the defendant. 
 
- 
 Further or alternatively 
, the transfer of the said 
 720 shares 
 from Wee Tiong to the defendant was made under such circumstances that the natural consequence of the transfer was to 
 delay hinder 
 or 
 defraud 
Wee Tiong`s creditors and was accordingly
 void 
 and of no effect as against the plaintiffs under the 
 Statute of 13 Elizabethan 1571 
cl 5 entitled 
 An Act Against Fraudulent Deeds, Gifts, Alienations, etc (the Elizabethan Statute) 
 which is applicable in Singapore. 
 
- 
 Further or alternatively 
, the transfer of the said
 720 shares 
 from Wee Tiong to the defendant was made with intent to
 delay hinder 
or 
 defraud 
 Wee Tiong`s creditors and are accordingly 
 void 
and of no effect as against the plaintiffs under the
 Statute 
.
  
 
 
The Elizabethan Statute was re-enacted in a shortened form as 
 s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 
 (Cap 61) as I shall explain later and the statutes are hereinafter referred to as 
 the Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA. 
In respect of the further and alternative prayers, the plaintiffs claimed under para 19 of the statement of claim:
 
 
(1) damages; 
 
(2) (a) 
 Further or alternatively 
, a declaration that the transfer of 
 720 shares 
 in the capital of Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd from Quah Wee Tiong to the defendant, effected on or about 
 8 December 1990 
 is
 void 
 and of no effect and that such shares be vested in the plaintiffs. 
 
 (b) An order that the defendant do surrender the share certificate(s) for the said
 720 shares 
 to Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd within eight days from the date of the order to be made herein and Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd do issue new share certificate(s) to the plaintiffs for the said 
 720 shares 
 and to do all things necessary to register the plaintiffs as a registered holder of the said 
 720 shares 
. 
 
 (c) An order that, if the defendant shall fail to surrender the share certificate(s) for the said 
 720 shares 
 to Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd within eight days from the date of the order to be made herein, Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd shall at the written request of the plaintiffs or their solicitors and their written confirmation of the defendant`s said default, cancel the said 
 720 shares 
 in the name of the defendant and issue new share certificate(s) to the plaintiffs for the said 
 720 shares 
 and to do all things necessary to register the plaintiffs as a registered holder of the said 
 720 shares 
. 
 
(d) All necessary or appropriate directions and orders be given by the court in respect of the said 
 720 shares 
. 
 
 
 
 The defendant in his defence filed soon afterwards admitted 
 
 that he resided at 8 Jubilee Road in 1992 and 1993; that Wee Tiong and Wee Tong were his sons; that the 
 720 shares 
 in Soon Aik, a family-run company, were transferred to him as stated in the transfer from Wee Tiong. He, however, 
 denied 
 that Wee Tiong or Wee Tong or anyone else had notified him of the order for interim injunction or that he conspired as averred by the plaintiffs or that the plaintiffs had consequently suffered damages. The defendant further stated that on
 12 September 1992 
 the defendant was outstation. It was further stated by the defendant 
 conjunctively or in the alternative 
, that he had purchased the said 
 720 shares 
 for valuable consideration and/or in good faith and/or with no notice of any alleged interest by Wee Tiong to delay hinder or defraud Wee Tiong`s auditors or the plaintiffs. In support of this, the defendant pleaded the following particularly: 
 
(a) That sometime in 
 February 1992 
 Wee Tiong telephoned him from overseas requesting for a loan of
 $40,000 
to set up a company in Taipei but the defendant was reluctant to loan him the moneys as Wee Tiong had previously borrowed moneys from him which moneys were still owing to him. 
 
(b) That he was eventually persuaded by Wee Tiong and
 agreed 
 to grant the loan to him as requested when Wee Tiong suggested
 transferring 
 his 
 720 shares 
 in Soon Aik at $10 each being the listed value of each share to the defendant as 
 part payment 
 of the loan. 
 
(c) That pursuant to the agreement on 
 29 February 1992 
 he sent by telegraphic transfer the sum of 
 $40,000 
to Avq Tri-Union Financial Service Co Ltd as requested by Wee Tiong to do so. 
 
(d) That sometime in 
 March 1992 
 Wee Tiong signed the transfer form transferring his 
 720 shares 
 in Soon Aik to the defendant. 
 
(e) That the transfer of the 
 720 shares 
 from Wee Tiong was formalized on or about 
 8 December 1992 
.
  
 
 
The respective parties consenting, only the issue of liability was tried. It was further agreed that the question of damages would be left to the registrar to assess in the event the plaintiffs succeeded.
Having heard the evidence and submissions of counsel, I made 
 findings and orders 
to the following effect:
 
 
(i) Quah Wee Tiong in conspiracy with the defendant, transferred 720 shares in the capital of Soon Aik (Private) Ltd for a purported consideration of $10.00 in order to injure the plaintiffs. 
 
(ii) The transfer of the 
 720 shares 
 from Quah Wee Tiong to the defendant was made with the intent to defraud Quah Wee Tiong`s creditors and is accordingly void and of no effect as against the plaintiffs under the Elizabethan Statute. 
 
(iii) That damages in respect of finding (i) be assessed by the registrar. 
 
(iv) That the defendant pays the plaintiffs the taxed costs of this action. 
 
(v) The costs of the assessment of damages are reserved to the registrar.
  
 
 
I now give the grounds of my decision.
At the close of the plaintiffs` case, Defence Counsel applied under O 18 r 19(1)(d) of the Rules of Supreme Court (RSC) for an order to strike out the pleadings on the ground that the proceedings were an abuse of the process of the Court. In making the application, Counsel stressed that the application was different from a submission of no case to answer. Counsel for the plaintiffs had countered that the submission was a disguise for a no case to answer. I was nevertheless prepared to listen. The defendant`s main ground for the application was that the plaintiffs had not pleaded or adduced any direct evidence to prove that the defendant had knowledge at the relevant time of the transfer of the interim injunction obtained by the plaintiffs on 11 September 1992 although both his sons Wee Tiong and Wee Tong (as solicitor) had knowledge of the injunction; that the plaintiffs were in the circumstances merely speculating that the defendant would have acquired such knowledge through Wee Tiong or Wee Tong; that the evidence adduced in the circumstances was insufficient to prove there was any agreement, ie the concerted action by the defendant with Wee Tiong to injure the plaintiffs and cause damage to them which would amount to a conspiracy in common law; that a high degree of proof was necessary to prove the tort; that there was also insufficient evidence as well to prove that the transfer of the shares was made contrary to the Elizabethan Act. Counsel`s submission here on this point was that under the Elizabethan Statute, the plaintiffs had to show that the defendant must be so largely indebted as to show an intention to defraud or defraud must otherwise appear. The plaintiffs he said had not shown that if the value of the shares was deducted then Wee Tiong would not have left sufficient assets for the payment of his debt to his creditors, in this case the plaintiffs. Only if this could be proved, would the law under the Elizabethan Act infer an intent to defraud. Continuing, Counsel said that t he abuse of the process was in the plaintiffs requiring the defendant to be cross-examined for evidence that was wanting in establishing their case.
At this juncture, I wish to clarify that the Elizabethan Statute was replaced in the United Kingdom in a much `shortened` form as s 172(1), (2) and (3) of the Law of Property Act 1925. In Singapore, the 
 Application of English Law 
 Act ( 
 Cap 7A) amended the 
 CLPA 
 by identically replacing in a shortened form the Elizabethan Statute by adding s 73B(1)-(3) to that Act which reads: 
 
(1) Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of property, made whether before or after 12 November 1993, with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced.
 
 
 
 
(2) This section does not affect the law relating to bankruptcy for the time being in force. 
 
(3) This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property disposed of for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in good faith to any person not having, at the time of the disposition, notice of the intent to defraud creditors.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs had pleaded the 
 Elizabethan Statute 
 as governed by
 s 5 of the Civil Law Act 
 (Cap 43) as they had commenced action on 
 9 November 1993 
. Counsel for the defence had made no issue on the lack of any amendment to the pleadings by the plaintiffs to substitute the above
 s 73B 
 for 
 the Elizabethan Statute 
 as the law is in pari materia and as
 s 73B 
 refers in any case to the conveyance of property both 
 before 
or 
 after 12 November 1993 
, the operational date of the law.
Having heard the defendant`s application in full, I dismissed the same. Although such an application may be made at any stage, the defendant was making it much too late. No exceptional feature of the case was pointed out to me or a valid explanation given for the lateness of the application. In any case, the application had no merit in law and in fact. In my opinion, the plaintiffs did not have to plead or prove direct knowledge on the part of the defendant of the interim order for injunction obtained on 15 September 1992 at or about the time the transfer of the shares was made. They did not also have to prove an imputed or constructive knowledge of such an order. In my opinion, it was sufficient if conspiracy or fraud could be inferred both in the common law action and under the Statute respectively. In most cases where conspiracy or fraud is pleaded, there is seldom any direct evidence of the same because parties acting in concert will keep their bad intentions to themselves. As Lai Kew Chai J in 
Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahir & Ors
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 735
  at p 776 aptly stated: 
 
... it is not the law of evidence that every step in the allegation of fraud has to be proved by calling live and admissible evidence nor is it the law that fraud cannot be inferred in the appropriate case. In 
 Tan Chye Chew
, for instance, the court was not dealing with the standard of proof and it seems to me clear from a reading of that case that it is no authority for the proposition, which appears to be suggested on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir, that fraud cannot be inferred. This is not to say that inferences of this serious nature should be lightly made. The circumstantial evidence must be so compelling and convincing that bearing in mind the high standard of proof one is nevertheless satisfied that an inference of fraud is justified. It will therefore be necessary to consider the evidence if any.
 
 
 
The defendant`s counsel also further submitted on the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA 
. It was that, unless Wee Tiong was shown not to have other assets the court could not draw any inference to defraud and as such, the plaintiffs` action on the same was misconceived. I agreed with the plaintiffs` counsel that there was no authority for such a proposition. In any case, Wee Tiong himself had appeared before me upon his arrest on 24 April 1993 and declared unequivocally, `... I have no house or assets in Singapore except my CPF.` There could not be clearer statement than that - that Wee Tiong had no assets to satisfy the plaintiffs` claim.
Whilst the plaintiffs bore both the
 evidential (or persuasive) 
and the 
 legal 
burden in respect of the averments of tortious conspiracy under the common law and fraud under the 
 Elizabethan Act/s 73B, CLPA 
, I found that the plaintiffs had discharged the 
 evidential 
burden with probative evidence supporting the above averments through sufficiently convincing inferences which I 
 tentatively 
drew. The probative evidence was that the plaintiffs had proved that the defendant and Wee Tiong were father and son. The plaintiffs had further proved that Wee Tiong lived with the defendant at 8 Jubilee Road - in fact he had been arrested there; that there was not the slightest suggestion they were not on talking terms; that both Wee Tiong and Wee Tong, the defendant`s other son, a solicitor, was aware of the service of the interim injunction at David Lim & Partners where he worked, on behalf of Wee Tiong; that the transfer of the shares was from a family company of which the defendant was the patriarch; that the consideration for the transfer of all the shares by Wee Tiong to the defendant was a nominal sum of $10 when the 
 par 
value of 
 each 
 of the 
 720 shares 
was
 $10 
 at the relevant time that the transfer had taken place on or about
 8 December 1992 
; that the shares no doubt had a much higher value than their 
 par 
value (ie $10 per share or $7,200 for all the shares) the company being a property owning company. These facts and the fact that most of the shares which had been held by Wee Tiong for some 
 ten years 
should be disposed of to the defendant for a nominal consideration soon after the order for interim injunction had been served on Wee Tiong`s solicitors all went reasonably to show that the defendant had come to know of the interim injunction through Wee Tiong and Wee Tong and the defendant and Wee Tiong had concertedly acted predominantly to put the aforesaid shares out of the reach of the plaintiffs to cause economic loss to the plaintiffs. This 
 tentative 
conclusion raised a live issue of fact and put the 
 provisional 
or 
 tactical 
 burden (known judicially as the 
 shifting 
of the evidentiary burden) on the defendant to adduce counter-evidence in order to displace or destroy the inferences which otherwise naturally resulted from the plaintiffs` evidence. In this regard, I must say that the 
 legal 
burden borne by the plaintiffs is determined only 
 once 
and that is at the end of the case after all the evidence is adduced.
Thus if the defendant had submitted a no case to answer or having submitted one (a backdoor submission had been made according to the plaintiffs) had then submitted no evidence, they would have run a serious risk of a finding of the issues in the trial against them.
The defendant`s application having been dismissed under O 18 r 19 of the RSC, the defendant made no further submission but elected to give evidence in respect of the matters raised in his defence.
The defendant testified as did two other witnesses on his behalf one being his son Wee Tong and the other Gee Jin Lian Nancy Julia, also known as Mrs Zehnder Barry Alban (Nancy Zehnder), a secretary in the employ of M/s Menon & Associates.
At the 
 close of the defence 
 , the main issues for determination were:
 
 
(1) Whether Quah Wee Tiong, in conspiracy with the defendant, transferred 
 720 shares 
 in the capital of a company known as Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd for a purported consideration of $10 in order to injure the plaintiffs, who as creditors of Quah Wee Tiong would eventually be entitled to seize the shares to meet their claim. 
 
(2) Whether the transfer of the said 
 720 shares 
 from Quah Wee Tiong to the defendant was made under circumstances such that the natural consequence of the transfer was to defraud Quah Wee Tiong`s creditors and was accordingly void and of no effect as against the plaintiffs under the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA. 
  
 
 
The essence of the defence was that the transfer on the 
 8 December 1993 
 was but the last step to complete a purported agreement entered earlier, ie in or about
 March 1992 
 between the defendant and Wee Tiong whereby the 
 720 shares 
 were to be transferred to the defendant by Wee Tiong in purported part payment of a purported loan of $40,000 from the defendant to Wee Tiong. I had to decide whether the defence of the defendant in the light of the evidence adduced, was reasonably capable of belief in that there was credible evidence that there was an oral agreement between the defendant and Wee Tiong in or about 
 March 1992 
 in which Wee Tiong was to transfer the 
 720 shares 
 to the defendant as part payment of a loan to be made by the defendant to Wee Tiong in the sum of $40,000.
In other words:
 
 
(1) was the share transfer actually signed by Wee Tiong in purported transfer of his shares much earlier, ie in or 
 about March 
 as stated by the defendant in his evidence; 
 
(2) did the defendant on 
 29 February 1992 
 transfer the sum of $40,000 as a loan
 to 
 Wee Tiong and Wee Tiong received the money eventually in Taiwan; 
 
(3) was the transfer of the shares effected on or about 
 8 December 1992 
 only 
 as a last step 
 pursuant to the earlier arrangement.
  
 
 
I had also to determine what was the true consideration and if there was valuable consideration having regard to the defendant`s version that it was the transfer of the shares which was part payment of the loan that went to constitute part of the valuable consideration and not the $10 as stated in the transfer and recorded in the register of members.
As regards the transfer of the 
 720 shares, 
whilst the defendant in his defence stated that Wee Tiong had signed the transfer form in 
 March 1992 
 and the transfer was formalized on
 8 December 1992 
as evidenced by the transfer form the defendant in his opening address however stated that the transfer of the shares was 
 effected 
in 
 March 1992 
 (when the transfer form was purportedly signed). The plaintiffs rightly pointed out that it was incorrect of the defendant to say that the transfer was
 effected 
 in March 1992. Assuming the defence was credible, that month only represented the time when the agreement was reached.
Having regard to the transfer form dated 
 8 December 1992 
and the transfer entry in the share register of Soon Aik which is dated 
 7 December 1992 
the transfer date on the share register should not, as the plaintiffs` counsel also rightly pointed out, be earlier than the actual date of the transfer form.
I found the claim of the defendant that the transfer of the 
 720 shares 
was in consideration of the loan in the sum of $40,000 as unconvincing and incapable of belief for a number of compelling reasons. In one breadth, the defendant had said that he was reluctant to lend Wee Tiong the $40,000 because previous loans made by him to Wee Tiong still remained unsettled. Assuming this was true (the defendant was at the same time unable to say how much was lent in the past or what the outstanding sum was) it was the defendant`s evidence that he transmitted the money to the defendant who was in Taiwan on 29 February 1992. In the next breadth, he said the transfer form was signed by Wee Tiong only 
 after 
 the amount was sent to him. Having doubts about Wee Tiong`s integrity over repayment of past loans, he was unlikely, in my opinion, to have sent money to him as a loan in Taiwan, if it was sent to him, unless he had first got Wee Tiong to sign the transfer form, ie before 29 February 1992. The defendant`s reason that Wee Tiong needed the money urgently was not explained and did not wash in the circumstances. Again whilst the defendant had shown that a sum of $40,000 was sent to Taiwan on 29 February 1993, the relevant document showed that the sum was transmitted to one AVQ Tri-Union Financial Services Co Ltd. The defendant testified it was a company formed by Wee Tiong and he had been asked by Wee Tiong to transmit funds to this company. However, no document was adduced in evidence (when it could easily have been produced) to show that Wee Tiong had an interest in the company or was connected with it. Indeed the defendant did not even know what the company dealt with. The defendant, therefore, had made a bare allegation that the $40,000 had been remitted by him to Wee Tiong`s company as such. I drew an adverse interest over the non production of the relevant document and seriously doubted the defendant`s evidence in the circumstances that a sum of $40,0 00 was in fact paid to Wee Tiong although I find that it was sent to a Taiwanese company. The funds transmitted could be for extraneous reasons. The defendant could have called Wee Tiong to testify on his behalf to corroborate his evidence on the amount purportedly sent to him but failed to do so.
The most critical evidence surrounded 
 the time 
of the
 taking 
 of the transfer form from M/s Menon & Associates and the discussion that had taken place with him concerning the transfer. The defendant`s evidence lacked coherence. He said he had gone to M/s Menon & Associates and brought the transfer form and had it signed by Wee Tiong
 in March 
as he was in Singapore then and having got his signature on the form and without dating it, he had been delaying in returning the document to M/s Menon & Associates as he wanted to convene the company`s board meeting to pass a resolution for the transfer. Each time he gave different reasons for the long delay in convening the directors` meeting. These were that the directors` meeting is usually convened at the end of each year, it was a family business or he was in poor health and his memory was impaired because of the medication he took. Hence all the delay in the transfer until about 7 or 8 December 1992. The defendant`s further evidence was that when he met Menon, he had told him to transfer the
 720 shares 
from Wee Tiong`s name to his but did not tell Menon about the price of the transfer. When it was drawn to his attention that the consideration as shown on the transfer form for the 
 720 shares 
was $10 and to explain why the amount of $10 was stated, his explanation was that 
 he did not read the document before he signed it 
and later:
 I told Menon to transfer the shares and I leave it to him. 
He denied he had told Menon to insert the figure of $10 adding: 
 
I leave it to him. Menon & Associates has been my auditors for over 30 years.
 
 
 
At the same time, although the shares were worth at least 
 $8,000 
or so the defendant said he was not surprised to see the consideration being put at 
 $10. 
 However, the defendant also denied he had seen the value of 
 $10 
as shown in the director`s resolution when the same was drawn to his attention. The defendant had surprisingly also testified that he had not seen the interim injunction even until the date of his testimony. This to me was plainly incredulous as he must know the nature of the action against him and the injunction was an important aspect of the suit. The presence of knowledge of it or its absence was amongst other things a determining factor in the outcome of the plaintiffs] case.
Nancy Zehnder in attempting to corroborate the defendant]s version of events, stated in her 
 affidavit of evidence in chief 
dated 
 21 September 1994 
 that the defendant had come to Menon & Associates and had seen Menon (who had since passed away) 
 `sometime in early 1992` 
. She was thereafter called and given instructions by Menon to prepare the necessary documents to transfer the shares from Wee Tiong to the defendant. In her cross-examination at the hearing (some seven months later) when asked as to when the discussion had taken place, she stated for the first time
 , `instruction was given by Quah Kay Tee in April 
 1992` 
. She said she remembered the month because she saw a 
 yellow sticker 
(
 the yellow sticker 
 ) stuck on the director`s resolution (
 exh D6 
) in the defendant`s file with the aforesaid words mentioned. She had stuck the yellow sticker there herself. She had, as I observed, mentioned 
 the yellow sticker 
for the first time as showing that the discussion took place in 
 April 
. She explained that she had not mentioned the 
 yellow sticker 
previously in her affidavit because she thought that the plaintiffs had seen her file. This was to my mind an incredible reason. There was no reason for her to believe that the plaintiffs or their solicitors had seen her office file. She would have in my opinion mentioned the month of April 1992 in her affidavit in the first place if she had the 
 yellow sticker 
stuck on the director`s resolution and would not just have said in her affidavit that the date was 
 `sometime in early 1992` 
. The defendant`s solicitors would have referred to the file in question and seen the 
 yellow sticker 
 if it was there and the month of April would have been mentioned. If the defendants] solicitors were only relying on her, she no doubt would have checked the file and would be speaking from the file in which case she would not have missed out the month as well. There were other elements to the evidence of Nancy Zehnder which showed her story was unworthy of credit and that was the reason for posting the 
 yellow sticker 
 on the director`s resolution. This she said was because the transfer form had to be stamped within 14 days. This could not have been so because the transfer form had not been dated when Wee Tiong signed it when given to him. Further, as a reminder, the 
 yellow sticker 
was strangely the only one in the file. Yet Nancy Zehnder admitted that other notes serving as reminders like `KIV` were merely pencilled on the other documents in the file. Furthermore, the 
 yellow sticker 
was found attached to a
 signed 
 copy of the director`s resolution. She certainly could not have given a copy of the director`s resolution with a 
 yellow sticker 
on it to the defendant. She said she had attached the 
 yellow sticker 
to an 
 unsigned 
 of the director`s resolution.
I did not believe her that when the 
 signed 
 director`s resolution was returned to her in December 1992 she would had taken the trouble to remove the 
 yellow sticker 
from the unsigned copy of the director`s resolution and attach it on the signed copy and then throw away the unsigned copy of the director`s resolution as she said she did. If her account was true that she stuck the yellow sticker to an unsigned copy of the director`s resolution initially she would have in all probability simply left the 
 yellow sticker 
on the unsigned copy of the director`s resolution in the file as whatever purpose the yellow sticker sought to achieve had been achieved. She simply had additionally to just file in the signed copy of the director`s resolution. 
 Alternatively, 
 if she had discarded the unsigned copy she would have discarded it 
 with 
the 
 yellow sticker 
 on it. There was no purpose keeping it since as a reminder the 
 yellow sticker 
 had served its purpose. Nancy Zehnder also contradicted herself as to when she had written the note on the 
 yellow sticker 
. In one breath, she said she did so on the day she prepared the director`s resolution and the transfer form and in the next that she did not write the said note on the same day.
Nancy Zehnder`s evidence in her 
 affidavit in examination-in-chief 
contrasted with that given in court. It was further inconsistent as to the receiving of instructions by Menon to prepare the necessary documentation for the transfer. In her affidavit she said that the defendant had visited her office 
 `in early 1992` 
 with instructions to prepare the documents and that `soon thereafter, sometime in early 1992` she prepared the documents and passed them to the defendant for him to get the necessary signatures. This clearly suggested that the documents were given on another date and not within about ten minutes after preparing them the same day as she said when testifying. Her memory for details had suddenly, it seemed, became much sharper selectively many many months after she had prepared her affidavit for examination-in-chief. Most importantly, Nancy Zehnder contradicted the evidence of the defendant when he said that he had left it to Menon to put the consideration of the transfer of the 
 720 shares 
and more specifically when he denied giving instructions that the consideration was to be $10. Thus, when Nancy Zehnder was asked as to who agreed the shares be transferred for $10 her evidence was that 
 the consideration was agreed between the defendant and Menon. 
I was satisfied from her testimony that Nancy Zehnder was aligning herself to the defendant`s case and attempting as best as she could to bolster the defendant`s case whenever she could. Admittedly, the defendant had been a long standing client of Menon & Associates. To employ her words, the defendant was 
 `like a family 
 
 friend`. 
I agreed and accepted the plaintiffs` submission that having regard to her evidence and `using that connection and without Mr Menon around, the defendant had managed to persuade Nancy Zehnder to fabricate evidence on his behalf`.
As for the evidence of Wee Tong the main purpose of which was to show the court that he did not tell the defendant of the interim injunction obtained against Wee Tiong, I found that he was evasive and prone to making sweeping or speculative statements and was not the disinterested, detached and frank witness he attempted to make himself out to be by his affidavit in examination in chief. More specifically, in the affidavit he had stated:
 
 
(i) When his brother Wee Tiong sold his property 8A Duchess Park, he merely introduced him to his law firm and did not handle the conveyancing. 
 
(ii) He did not tell the defendant his father about the interim injunction which was obtained against Wee Tiong right up to the end of 1992 as `Wee Tiong`s business dealings` were his own affairs. 
 
(iii) It was beyond belief for the plaintiffs to allege that the defendant knew about the injunction having been obtained and had conspired to defraud or injure the plaintiffs` interest.
  
 
 
In his cross-examination, it was shown that the firm`s correspondence in the conveyancing file in respect of No 8A Duchess Park which Wee Tiong had just sold included his initials QWT in the reference: DL/QWT/92-00360-8/km; alongside the initials of David Lim, the senior partner. I was satisfied that unless Wee Tiong was doing the conveyancing under the supervision of David Lim his initials would not have been there. At first he explained that the solicitor handling the conveyance was Michelle Lim or a legal assistant Anne Loke. When pressed for specific answer, he said that the conveyance was done by Michelle Lim. He was not able to explain as to why, if, Michelle Lim was doing the conveyance, her initials were not there in the reference number. In fact Michelle Lim`s initials only started to appear when the conveyance was completed on 18 September 1992. I accepted the plaintiffs` submission as probably true that Wee Tong tried to distance himself from the conveyancing file by bringing Michelle Lim to carry out further correspondence as Wee Tong by then knew about the interim injunction on which the plaintiffs` solicitors wrote to David Lim on 15 September 1992. My opinion is fortified by the fact that Wee Tong had admitted in cross-examination that he brought the document in respect of the transfer of the Duchess Road property home for Wee Tiong to sign. This action could not be reconciled with his earlier evidence in his affidavit that he took no part in the conveyance. If he had taken no part, Wee Tiong could have gone to the firm and attended before Michelle Lim or David Lim to sign the transfer form. As for Wee Tong stating that it was beyond belief that his father knew the plaintiffs had obtained an interim injunction against Wee Tiong and would have conspired to defraud the plaintiffs or injure their interest and whilst still claiming that his father did not know about the interim injunction, he nevertheless agreed in cross-examination that it was possible that Wee Tiong him self could have told his father about the injunction. Wee Tong again strained his credibility by testifying that on the occasional times he met his father, they would only talk about his ailments and did not talk about business or about Wee Tiong. Having regard to Wee Tong`s testimony on all the above matters, I did not believe that (and additionally as a lawyer in the family) he would not have been asked or did not discuss family business with the defendant or Wee Tiong. He overemphasized his father`s poor health to disclaim the absence of knowledge on the part of the defendant of the interim injunction obtained against Wee Tiong. I was satisfied that he would have told the defendant of the interim injunction if not immediately, soon afterwards.
I rejected both the defendant`s and Nancy Zehnder`s version of the story that the defendant had seen Menon and briefed him on the transfer in 
 early 1992, ie in either February, March or April 1992 
; that the defendant had been given on that occasion a transfer form prepared by Nancy Zehnder for Wee Tiong`s signature as transferor (and that of the defendant as transferee) together with a Director`s Resolution all to be signed and returned to Menon; that he and Wee Tiong accordingly had signed the form in early 1992 but that he only completed the execution of the transfer on 
 8 December 1992 
 and submitted the transfer and director`s resolution as well to Menon & Associates at about that time as director`s resolutions relating to Soon Aik were normally passed only towards the end of the year. In fact, Nancy Zehnder had clearly contradicted the defendant by saying that instructions to Menon were received on the passing of director`s resolutions `throughout the year`. I have already made my detailed findings on the various details of the evidence of Nancy Zehnder and in particular as to the presence of the 
 yellow sticker 
as tending to show that the defendant saw Menon in April 1992 about the agreement to transfer the shares as unworthy of credit and I did not believe the same.
I was satisfied at the close of the defendant`s case that the plaintiffs had discharged both the evidential (or persuasive) and legal burden cast on them to prove their case and that this was done on a higher degree of probability bearing in mind the averments of the plaintiffs. I drew from the evidence the only compelling inferences - that the defendant knew of the order for interim injunction which restrained the defendant amongst other things from disposing off his assets having learnt of the same from both Wee Tiong and Wee Tong; that the defendant and Wee Tiong had discussed and agreed and thereby conspired to transfer Wee Tiong`s 
 720 shares 
in Soon Aik to the defendant to put them out of reach of the plaintiffs fearing judgment in the suit brought by the plaintiffs; that the conspiracy to transfer took place
 after 
 the interim injunction was obtained on 15 September 1992 resulting in the execution of the transfer by Wee Tiong in 
 December 1992 
when he was in Singapore as I have stated in the evidence. This explained why the transfer form was dated 8 December 1992. In drawing the above compelling inferences, I had also considered and rejected the defendant`s story of having extended a loan of $40,000 to Wee Tiong on 
 29 February 1992 
and that the transfer of shares was the `part consideration` for the said loan. The `part consideration` was never clearly explained by the defendant. The defendant had failed to prove as I stated earlier that the loan was sent to AVQ Tri-Union Financial Services Co Ltd as a company owned or even part owned by Wee Tiong. In any case, on the defendant`s own evidence there was no reason for the defendant to risk his money by remitting it to Wee Tiong before he transferred his shares to him as he knew Wee Tiong to be a person who did not repay his debts. The nine-month delay thereafter in convening a directors` meeting and completing the transfer fu rther went against the defendant`s credibility. The defendant`s story of the loan was also a transparent lie in view of the fact that the transfer showed a nominal consideration of $10 for the transfer. The defendant`s attempt to put blame on Menon - that he had left the consideration for him to insert in the transfer form and the ensuing implication that Menon put in 
 $10 
 the transfer was contradicted by Nancy Zehnder. She had said that the defendant had agreed to the sum of 
 $10 
 as consideration of the transfer and this nipped away the last foundation upon which his house of lies had been constructed on. On the facts, I found the consideration for the transfer to be nominally 
 $10 
in respect of all the 
 720 shares 
 transferred to the defendant whether its value (book) was $7,200 or more. It was not a 
 bona fide 
consideration.
As such, I agreed with and accepted the plaintiffs` submission that the defendant concocted the story of the transfer of shares as part payment of a loan of $40,000 - from him to Wee Tiong in February 1992 and about the $40,000 being remitted in 
 February 1992 
and the transfer form being signed in 
 March 1992 
and returned to the auditors in December and resulting in the whole exercise being formalized or completed on
 8 December 1992 
.
I was satisfied in fact and law that the plaintiffs had proved their claim both in conspiracy under common law and under the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA 
. Conspiracy - an agreement of two or more persons for an unlawful purpose - under common law takes two forms. The first form connotes the use of unlawful means whilst the second connotes a `conspiracy to injure`. In the latter case, the requirement is that the predominant purpose be to injure as contrasted against the absence of such a requirement in the former case.
I found that the defendant and Wee Tiong committed a conspiracy to injure the plaintiffs.
In so far as the agreement was concerned, it was a matter of drawing the compelling inferences which I drew showing there was such an agreement between the defendant and Wee Tiong. The purpose of the agreement was to intentionally and predominantly to injure the plaintiffs and cause economic loss to them in putting 
 720 shares 
 in Soon Aik completely out of reach of the plaintiffs and to render useless any judgment the plaintiffs may obtain in the proceedings they had begun against Wee Tiong. In so far as the acts and actions were concerned, based on my findings, the legal transfer of the shares by Wee Tiong to his father the defendant for a nominal consideration, (of $10), in December 1992 was with his knowledge and that of Wee Tiong and by their contrivance. The transfer was triggered by and was in contravention of the interim injunction dated 15 September 1992 restraining Wee Tiong from disposing of his assets. I may point out that the nominal consideration in respect of conveyance of property is not in itself a factor sufficient by itself to indicate an intention to injure but having regard to all the circumstances and the facts, the nominal consideration in respect of the transaction, which was not at arms length, went towards my finding of the conspiracy.
I was satisfied that substantially the same findings supported the defendant`s and Wee Tiong`s intention to defraud the plaintiffs under the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA 
. The fact that I found that the shares had been disposed of at a nominal value added increased weight to my findings of an intention to defraud under the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA. 
The adequacy of consideration unlike that in the tort of conspiracy is always important under the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA 
because it determines whether the transferee comes within the exception to that law, ie of a person who made good consideration.
In the circumstances, the defendant`s transaction therefore also fell within the 
 Elizabethan Statute/s 73B, CLPA 
in that the conveyance of the shares in question was made with intent to defraud the plaintiffs and injure them and I held the same void resulting in the final orders that I made accordingly.

 The facts 
 
(a) Prior to 9 September 1992, the debtor, one Quah Wee Tiong (Wee Tiong), a stockbroker once employed by the respondents, owed the latter money amounting to $1,552,027.99 for share transactions. On 9 September 1992 in Suit No 1842/92 the respondents commenced an action against Wee Tiong for the recovery of the said sum. 
(b) On 11 September 1992, the respondents obtained an order to arrest Wee Tiong in the action. The next day, the respondents unsuccessfully attempted to execute the arrest order and to serve the writ of summons on Wee Tiong at 8 Jubilee Road where he ordinarily resided with the appellant, his father. Wee Tiong was outside Singapore at that time. 
(c) On 15 September 1992, the respondents obtained an interim injunction in the said action to restrain Wee Tiong from disposing or otherwise dealing with his assets. But the order remained at the time unserved personally on Wee Tiong. On the same day, the respondents` solicitors then, M/s Allen and Gledhill, wrote to M/s David Lim and Partners, who were then Wee Tiong`s solicitors in the sale of a property at 8A Duchess Park, Duchess Road, informing them of the order of interim injunction. M/s David Lim and Partners acknowledged M/s Allen and Gledhill`s letter the same day. 
(d) Some time in September 1992, Wee Tiong was notified about the injunction by either his solicitors or his brother, Quah Wee Tong (`Wee Tong`) who was then working in M/s David Lim and Partners. Wee Tong admitted that, in September 1992, he gave advice to Wee Tiong about the injunction. 
(e) Some time in December 1992, Wee Tiong returned to Singapore but the respondents were unaware of it. On 8 December 1992, Wee Tiong transferred 720 shares of Soon Aik (Pte) Ltd (Soon Aik) for a purported consideration of $10 to the appellant who is the patriarch of the family`s company. 
(f) On 24 April 1993, the Sheriff, accompanied by the respondents` representative and their present solicitors` representative, went to 8 Jubilee Road and arrested Wee Tiong who was brought before the learned judicial commissioner to show cause. The arrest order was discharged after solicitors for both sides were heard. Wee Tiong, through his solicitors, then entered an appearance to the said action. 
(g) On 26 July 1993, the respondents obtained judgment against Wee Tiong for the said sum of $1,552,027.99 and interest thereon at 6% pa from 9 September 1992 to 26 July 1993 and costs fixed at $1,500 against Wee Tiong in the said action. 
(h) On 13 August 1993, the respondents` solicitor, together with the Sheriff proceeded to the registered office of Soon Aik to inspect the company`s Register of Members. But they were referred instead to Soon Aik`s auditors, Menon and Associates, because Soon Aik`s representative was unable to furnish the records. As it turned out, the respondents` attempt to seize Wee Tiong`s 720 shares in Soon Aik failed because they had already been transferred to the appellant. 
(i) On 9 September 1993, the present action was commenced in the court below against the appellant for damages; or alternatively, for an order that the share transfer on 8 December 1992 be avoided and the 720 shares be registered in the respondents` name.
This appeal therefore arose out of the decision by the learned judicial commissioner below to grant the respondents interlocutory judgment against the appellant, with damages to be assessed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
 The decision below
The appellant`s defence in the court below was that the 720 Soon Aik shares were transferred to him in consideration of a $40,000 loan which he had previously extended to his son, Wee Tiong. This loan was given some time in early 1992, well before the respondents commenced their action for the recovery of debts owed by Wee Tiong. However, the share transfer was only formalised on 8 December 1992.
The learned judicial commissioner found that, on the evidence, the appellant and Wee Tiong had committed a conspiracy to injure the respondents by putting the 720 shares of Soon Aik out of the latter`s reach. He also found that there was an intention to defraud the respondents under s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, thereby rendering the share transfer void. He therefore ordered that the appellant do pay the respondents damages for the conspiracy, in such amount as may be determined by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
 Issues in the appeal
The appellant raised the following issues in this appeal: 
(a) whether on the evidence adduced, the respondents had proved that the appellant had conspired with Wee Tiong to injure their interests; 
(b) whether the respondents had proved that the transfer of the 720 shares from Wee Tiong to the appellant was made with intent to defraud them and was accordingly void; 
(c) whether the learned judicial commissioner had made the correct findings and inferences concerning the two main issues above.
(1) On the face of it this appeal turned only on questions of fact and on whether the respondents had discharged their burden of proof in the court below. But we took the view that there emerged in this case two other important issues which had to be considered. The first related to the question whether constructive fraud had any role to play in avoiding the share transfer. And the second concerned the question whether the tort of conspiracy was proved. We will revert to these matters later.
 The appeal
 The Elizabethan Statute
 Applicability
The respondents contended that the share transfer was void because it was caught by the Statute of 13 Elizabethan (1571) c 5 intituled An Act Against Fraudulent Deeds, Gifts, Alienations, Etc (the Elizabethan Statute), a statute that was clearly made for the protection of creditors.
However, the learned judicial commissioner stated that the correct provision to apply was s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61) (CLPA). His reasoning was as follows: 
At this juncture, I wish to clarify that the Elizabethan Statute was replaced in the United Kingdom in a much `shortened` form as s 172(1), (2) and (3) of the Law of Property Act 1925. In Singapore, the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A), amended the CLPA by identically replacing in a shortened form the Elizabethan Statute by adding s[para ]73B(1)-(3) to that Act which reads:
 
(1) Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of property made whether before or after 12th November 1993, with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced. 
(2) ... 
(3) ...
 
The plaintiffs had pleaded the Elizabethan Statute as governed by s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) as they had commenced action on 9 November 1993. Counsel for the defence had made no issue on the lack of any amendment to the pleadings by the plaintiff to substitute the above s 73B for the Elizabethan Statute as the law is in pari materia and as s 73B refers in any case to the conveyance of property both before or after 12 November 1993, the operational date of the law.
The question was whether the Elizabethan Statute or s 73B CLPA were the governing statutory provisions. The wording of s 73B is derived from s 172 of the English Law of Property Act 1925. That section is similar in material respects to s 73B.
Section 172 was itself re-enacted from para 31 of Part II of Sch 3 to the Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1924, which did not independently come into operation. It was this 1924 Act which had substantially altered the prolix sections 2 and 6 of the Elizabethan Statute: see 
 Lloyds Bank v Marcan 
 [1973] 2 All ER 360, 367. Subsequently, the English Law of Property Act 1925 consolidated the said paragraph in the 1924 Act and reproduced it in s 172. Section 3 of the 1924 Act states that `[t]he amendments and provisions, for facilitating the consolidation of the statute law relating to conveyancing and property, contained in the Third Schedule to this Act, shall have effect.` Section 3 made it clear that the said paragraph in the 1924 Act was a consolidation with amendments. In the absence of any express words to the contrary the 1924 Act and the 1925 Act were intended to operate with prospective effect.
Accordingly, if the cause of action accrued before the commencement date of s 73B it would follow that the Elizabethan Statute would apply. By the same token, if the cause of action accrued after the commencement date of s 73B then s 73B would be the governing statutory provisions. Usually in such cases a debt had been incurred and it was followed subsequently by a conveyance made by a debtor with intent to defraud his creditor. However, there were cases before the consolidation and amendments in the 1924 Act which dealt with the unusual situation where a voluntary conveyance had taken place first followed by the incurring of a debt at a later date. For example, in 
 Mackay v Douglas 
 (1880-81) LR 16 Eq 106, the court held that a voluntary settlement, by which the settlor took the bulk of his property out of the reach of his creditors, shortly before engaging in trade of a hazardous character, was set aside in a suit on behalf of subsequent creditors whose debts only arose after the voluntary settlement. The draftsman of the 1924 Act had to cater for the scenario where there could be a conveyance followed by a debt arising say nine months later as in 
 Mackay 
`s case. In our view, it was for this reason that the clause `every conveyance of property made whether before or after the commencement of this Act` was inserted in the 1924 Act. Accordingly, the respondents were right in pleading and relying on the Elizabethan Statute.
 Fraudulent conveyances
In so far as relevant, the Elizabethan Statute, in its archaic language, states as follows: 
For the avoiding and abolishing of feigned, covinous and fraudulent feoffments, gifts, grants, alienations, conveyances ... which feoffments, gifts, grants, alienations, conveyances ... have been and are devised and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile, to the end, purpose and intent, 
 to delay, hinder or defraud
 creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts. 
II Be it therefore ... enacted ... that all and every feoffment, gift, grant, alienation, bargain and conveyance of lands ... had or made to or for any intent or purpose before declared and expressed, shall be from henceforth deemed and taken ... to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate, and none effect. 
VI Provided also ... that this Act ... shall not extend to any estate or interest in lands, tenements, hereditaments, leases, rents, commons, profits, goods or chattels, had, made, conveyed or assured ... which Estate or Interest is 
 or shall be upon good consideration and bona fide 
 lawfully conveyed or assured to any person or persons ... not having at the time of such conveyance or assurance to them made, any manner of notice or knowledge or such covin, fraud or collusion as is aforesaid ... [,mphasis added.]
Thus, the Elizabethan Statute provides, in effect, that all conveyances and dispositions of property, real or personal, made with the intent to 
 `delay, hinder or defraud creditors` 
, shall be null and void as against them, their heirs etc, and assigns. However, this is subject to the proviso that nothing therein contained shall extend to any estate or interest made by a 
 bona fide 
 purchaser for value and without notice of such fraud.
In this appeal it was strenuously argued that the respondents had failed to adduce sufficient evidence for the court to infer an actual fraudulent intention to defraud them. The appellant contended that the evidence adduced were merely inferences and suppositions which fell short of the standard of proof required in a fraud action.
But we were of the view that the respondents did not have to go so far to prove such an intent. In this regard, it was crucial from the outset to distinguish between two classes of cases: (1) conveyances which are voluntary; and (2) conveyances for value. For both classes, actual fraud will avoid the transaction. But in conveyances which are voluntary, and this was relevant in the present appeal, constructive fraud can also be raised in addition to actual fraud. And in the case of constructive fraud, the courts will, under certain circumstances, presume or deem a fraudulent intent.
In our judgment, the facts in this case triggered the presumption of fraudulent intent. The presumption was based both on the size of Wee Tiong`s indebtedness of $1,552,027.99 and the fact that the share transfer was a gift.
 (a) Was the share transfer a gift?
The first question to consider was whether the share transfer was a gift. It was indisputably executed for a purported consideration of $10. It was the appellant`s case that this transfer was in fact for repayment of a $40,000 loan from him to Wee Tiong. Although the loan was effected on 28 February 1992, and the actual share transfer form was signed some time in March 1992, the formal documentation relating to the transfer of the said shares was effected only on 8 December 1992.
The essence of the defence below was this - that the share transfer on 8 December 1993 was but the last step to complete an agreement entered some time in March 1992 between the appellant and Wee Tiong, whereby the 720 shares were to be transferred in part payment of the loan.
The learned judicial commissioner, in his careful consideration as regards the true consideration in the share transfer, found the appellant`s claim unconvincing and incapable of belief. In his grounds of judgment (reported in 
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 553
  ), he concluded as follows: 
I found the claim of the defendant that the transfer of the 720 shares was in consideration of the loan in the sum of $40,000 as unconvincing and incapable of belief for a number of compelling reasons. In one breadth [sic], the dDefendant had said that he was reluctant to lend Wee Tiong the $40,000 because previous loans made by him to Wee Tiong still remained unsettled. Assuming this was true (the defendant was at the same time unable to say how much was lent in the past or what the outstanding sum was) it was the defendant`s evidence that he transmitted the money to the defendant who was in Taiwan on 29 February 1992. In the next breadth [sic], he said the transfer form was signed by Wee Tiong only after the amount was sent to him. Having doubts about Wee Tiong`s integrity over repayment of past loans, he was unlikely, in my opinion, to have sent money to him as a loan in Taiwan, if it was sent to him, unless he had first got Wee Tiong to sign the transfer form, ie before 29 February 1992 ... Again whilst the defendant had shown that a sum of $40,000 was sent to Taiwan on 29 February 1993 the relevant document showed that the sum was transmitted to one AVQ Tri-Union Financial Services Co Ltd. The defendant testified it was a company formed by Wee Tiong and he had been asked by Wee Tiong to transmit the funds to this company. However, no document was adduced in evidence (when it could easily have been produced) to show that Wee Tiong had an interest in the company or was connected with it. Indeed the defendant did not even know what the company dealt with. The Defendant therefore had made a bare allegation that the $40,000 had been remitted by him to Wee Tiong`s company as such. I drew an adverse inference over the non production of the relevant document and seriously doubted the defendant`s evidence in the circumstances that a sum of $40,000 was in fact paid to Wee Tiong although I find that it was sent to a Taiwanese company. The funds transmitted could be for extraneous reason. The defendant could have called Wee Tiong to testify on his behalf to corroborate his evidence on the amount purportedly sent to him but failed to do so ...
 
... The nine month delay thereafter in convening a directors` meeting and completing the transfer further went against the defendant`s credibility. The defendant`s story of the loan was also a transparent lie in view of the fact that the transfer showed a nominal consideration of $10 for the transfer. The defendant`s attempt to put the blame on Menon [his accountant who has since died] - that he had left the consideration for him to insert in the transfer was contradicted by Nancy Zehnder [Menon`s secretary]. She had said that the defendant had agreed to the sum of $10 as consideration of the transfer and this nipped away the last foundation upon which his house of lies had been constructed on. On the facts, I found the consideration for the transfer to be nominally $10 in respect of all the 720 shares transferred to the defendant whether its value (book) was $7,200 or more. It was not a 
 bona fide
 consideration.
We agreed with the trial judge that on the evidence the appellant did not give the purported $40,000 loan to Wee Tiong. This was a crucial finding of fact. The inevitable consequence was that no consideration at all had been given by the appellant for the 720 shares. Since there was no such loan, the 720 shares could neither be for full nor part repayment of it. There was accordingly no need for us to consider the further question whether the share transfer at $10 was entirely inadequate and whether this consideration was 
 bona fide 
.
In our view, the transfer was obviously a sham to defeat the respondents` rightful recovery of their debts. And there being no consideration, this court was perfectly justified to look upon the transaction as merely voluntary; for in effect, the transaction was a gift by Wee Tiong to the appellant: see 
 Doe d Watson v Routledge 
 2 Cowp 705; 98 ER 1318, 
 Mathews v Feaver 
 1 Cox 278; 29 ER 1165, 
 Strong v Strong 
 18 Beav 408; 52 ER 161.
 (b) Constructive fraud
Since the share transfer was a gift, the question of whether such a transfer was void under the Elizabethan Statute accordingly hinged only on the intent and purpose of the donor, Wee Tiong, in making the gift. Assuming that there was an actual fraudulent intent on Wee Tiong`s part, then it mattered not what the intent of the donee (the appellant) was, since the latter would not fall within the exception of a 
 bona fide 
 purchaser for value without notice. The appellant, being a volunteer, could not claim to be prejudiced by the gift to him being defeated.
Likewise, constructive fraud can also suffice to invalidate the transfer under certain circumstances in such cases, rather than actual fraud, precisely because no loss is inflicted on the volunteer; he is merely deprived of a gain to which another had a better right.
When then can constructive fraud be invoked? A series of authorities has long since established that the Elizabethan Statute is not only directed against transfers of property which are made with the express intention of defrauding creditors; it also covers situations of constructive fraud. And the ordinary form of this constructive fraud under the Elizabethan Statute is a 
 voluntary 
 conveyance made by a man 
 deeply indebted 
, which accordingly is void, under the statute, as against the grantor`s creditors. The mere fact of a man, thus indebted, giving part of his estate is, by presumption and construction of law, a fraudulent act. And this principle is better understood when one appreciates that the Elizabethan Statute proceeds on the basis `that persons must be just before they are generous, and that debts must be paid before gifts can be made`: see 
 Freeman v Pope 
 (1870) 5 Ch 538 at p 540.
Many of the authorities dealing with the Elizabethan Statute involved conveyances of land. The principles stated in those cases are equally applicable, in our view, to a share transfer. Accordingly, the two conditions to be satisfied before constructive fraud can be raised are: (1) the conveyance or transfer must be a gift; and (2) the donor must be `indebted` at the time of the gift. We have already dealt with the first requirement and we set out below the law on the second requirement.
It is apparent from a trilogy of cases decided by Lord Hardwicke LC that `indebtedness` at the time of the voluntary conveyance is the all important criterion in invoking constructive fraud and thereby holding a transaction void. In 
 Townshend v Windham 
 2 Ves Sen 1 at p 10; 28 ER 1, his Lordship stated, `[T]he testator being indebted at the time of the appointment, it is void as against his creditors`; and in 
 Russell v Hammond 
 1 Atk 13 at p 15; 26 ER 9, he observed that the only voluntary settlements which are not fraudulent are those `where the person making, is not indebted at the time`; and in 
 Walker v Burrows 
 1 Atk 93 at 94; 26 ER 61, he spoke of indebtedness at the time, or soon after, as a circumstance from which a fraudulent intention might be collected.
These decisions lay down the one great object of the Elizabethan Statute, which is to prevent debtors from dealing with their property in any way to the prejudice of their creditors. It in fact considers a man deeply indebted as no longer the true owner of his property but rather, a trustee of it for the benefit of his creditors. Therefore, the statute gives priority to debts over voluntary and fraudulent conveyances and attempts to prevent a man in his lifetime from delaying, hindering or defrauding his just creditors.
However, Lord Harwicke LC never gave a precise definition of `indebtedness`. Was actual insolvency required: see 
 Lush v Wilkinson 
 5 Ves Jun 384; 31 ER 642? Or would the existence of any debt which, at the time of the transaction, remain unsatisfied suffice: see 
 Spirett v Willows 
 3 De GJ & S 293; 46 ER 649?
The rule as to what is meant by `indebtedness` was put on its true principle by Lord Langdale in 
 Townsend v Westacott 
 2 Beav 340; 48 ER 1212, and has been approved and followed repeatedly. His Lordship stated, at 2 Beav 340 p 344, as follows: 
I cannot think the real and just construction of the statute warrants that proposition [that the existence of any debt, at the time of the voluntary transaction, was sufficient to induce the court to set it aside] because there is scarcely any man who can avoid being indebted to some amount: he may intend to pay every debt as soon as it is contracted, and constantly use his best endeavours, and have ample means to do so, and yet may be frequently, if not always indebted in some small amount: there may be a withholding of claims, contrary to his intention, by which he is kept indebted in spite of himself; it would be idle to allege this as the least foundation for assuming fraud or any bad intention. On the other hand, it is said that something amounting to insolvency must be proved to set aside a voluntary conveyance: this too, is inconsistent with the principle of the Act, and with the judgments of the most eminent judges.
Thus, actual insolvency is not always necessary. Neither is the mere existence of some indebtedness, at the time of the gift, sufficient to invalidate the voluntary transaction. But if it can be proved that the donor, at the time he made the gift, was indebted to the extent of insolvency, or that he became so by the abstraction of the property comprised in the gift, then that is enough to invalidate the transfer: see 
 Smith v Cherrill 
 (1867) LR 4 Eq 390, per Malins V-C at pp 395-396, 
 and The Sun Life Assurance Co v Elliott 
 31 SCR 91 (Can).
In 
 Holmes v Penney 
 3 K & J 90 at 99; 69 ER 1035, Wood V-C settled the law on the extent of `indebtedness` required to raise constructive fraud in order to find the voluntary transaction void. He stated that `the mere fact of a settlement being voluntary is not enough to render it void as against creditors; but there must be unpaid debts, which were existing at the time of making the settlement, and the settlor must have been at the time not necessarily insolvent, but so largely indebted as to induce the court to believe that the intention of the settlement ... was to defraud persons who, at the time of the settlement, were creditors of the settlor.`
In 
 Freeman v Pope 
 (supra at p 541), Lord Hatherley LC also stated as follows: 
[I]t is established by the authorities that, in the absence of any such direct proof of intention, if a person owing debts makes a settlement which subtracts from the property, which is the proper fund for the payment of those debts, an amount without which the debts cannot be paid, then, since it is the necessary consequence of the settlement (supposing it effectual) that some creditors must remain unpaid, it would be the duty of the judge to direct the jury that 
 they must infer the intent of the settlor to have been to defeat or delay his creditors
, and that the case is within the Statute. [Emphasis added.]
A further observation was made by Giffard LJ in the same case. He stated, at p 545, that `if at the date of the settlement, the person making the settlement was not in a position actually to pay his creditors, the 
 law would infer 
 that he intended, by making the voluntary settlement, to defeat and delay them.` And it was the duty of the judge to tell the jury that they must presume such an intent.
Therefore, in such circumstances, no actual proof is required to show that the debtor had a fraudulent intention to delay, hinder or defraud his creditors. The fraudulent intention will be attributed to the settlor: see 
 Cornish v Clark 
 (1872) LR 14 Eq 184; 
 Re Ridler, Ridler v Ridler 
 (1883) 22 Ch D 74 at p 82; 
 Re Maddever 
 (1884) 27 Ch D 523 at p 526; 
 Green v Paterson 
 (1886) 32 Ch D 95 at p 105. And the fraudulent intent may be imputed because, on such facts, a man must be presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own act - or what we would call constructive fraud - as distinct from a situation whereby a man`s intention is proved by direct evidence or inferred from the surrounding circumstances: see 
 Lloyds Bank Ltd v Marcan 
, supra, per Pennycuick V-C at pp 367-368.
This abovesaid difference is crucial. And, in our view, the speeches in 
 Freeman v Pope 
 made it clear that, in voluntary conveyances where the debtor is considerably indebted, there is no need to find that a debtor subjectively intended to defraud his creditors in the sense of finding moral turpitude. An objective approach will suffice. Even if a debtor had no deliberate intention in the subjective sense of depriving his creditors of a fund to which they were entitled, but he did an act which, in point of fact, withdrew that fund from them, and dealt with it by way of bounty, then that is sufficient to invalidate the settlement since that will be constructive fraud: see 
 Freeman v Pope 
, supra, pp 543-544.
The rationale for this, as was so aptly put by Malins V-C in 
 Smith v Cherrill 
 (supra at p 396), is that `[such a] settlement ... is not for value, but purely voluntary; and what does justice require but that those who are bound to pay should not be sheltered? Nor can any other construction be put upon it, but that the debt should be paid, and that volunteers should not take property which ought to have paid the debt, without discharging the obligation.`
It also seemed to us that the earlier cases which stated that actual insolvency was required at the time of the gift may be reconciled with later authorities which ascribed a broader meaning to the term `insolvency` for the purposes of this statute. `Insolvency` in this wider sense simply means that `[i]f by the act of assignment the party makes himself insolvent, that is, if the property left after the conveyance is not enough to pay his debts, that is insolvency sufficient for the purposes [of the statute]`: see 
 Jackson v Bowley 
 Car & M 97, per Erskine J at p 102; 174 ER 426 at p 429; 
 Shears v Rogers 
 3 B & Ad 362 at p 369, 110 ER 137 at p 139 and 
 Barrack v M`Culloch 
 3 K & J 110; 69 ER 1043.
Where the settlor is shown to be `insolvent` in the sense just mentioned, he must be taken to know the state of his circumstances, whether he in fact did or did not. Even evidence that he did not will not rebut the presumption of fraud: see 
 Christy v Courtenay 
 13 Beav 96, per Vaughan Williams J at p 101; 51 ER 38. Therefore, to uphold the gift, the donor must, at the time of making the gift, have sufficient property left out of the gift to meet all existing liabilities and debts: see 
 Freeman v Pope 
 (supra); 
 Kent v Riley 
 (1872) LR 14 Eq 190; 
 Taylor v Coenen 
 (1875-76) 1 Ch D 636; 
 Ex p Huxtable, re Conibeer 
 (1875-76) 2 Ch D 54. And such assets must be then actually available assets for that purpose at the time of the gift; for the statute speaks of not only defrauding, but also of delaying and hindering creditors: see 
 Re Ridler 
 (supra); 
 Freeman v Pope 
 (supra); 
 French v French 
 6 De GM & G 95; 43 ER 1166 and 
 Ex p Russell, re Butterworth 
 (1881-82) 19 Ch D 588.
In the case at hand, Wee Tiong (the debtor) himself had said as follows on 24 April 1993 when he was brought before the court, following his arrest by the Sheriff: 
Mr Woo: Defendant is to show cause why he should not furnish security for his appearance. Order of arrest was made on 11 September 1992.
 
Defendant: 
 I can`t afford a lawyer ...
 
...
 
 I have no house or assets in Singapore except my CPF
. Crucial issue I am tying up business in China. I am supposed to be in Shanghai on 10 May 1993. It is a $10,000,000 deal. I am being paid 3% if it is successful. I need to go to Taiwan on way to Shanghai - to get documents. 
 I can`t furnish security
. I am contesting claim in full. There is no question of my settling the claim as I see it. [Emphasis added.]
From the extract, it was evident that Wee Tiong, by his own admission, was in effect insolvent as at 23 April 1993. But the share transfer took place on 8 December 1992. So, in the absence of positive evidence, was Wee Tiong also insolvent within the meaning of the Act as at 8 December 1992?
On the facts, we were satisfied that Wee Tiong was insolvent as at 8 December 1992. But in any event, even where there is no positive proof of insolvency as at the date of the settlement, but the settlor is then in debt to a large amount, and soon afterwards becomes absolutely insolvent, then unless contrary evidence is adduced by the debtor to prove his solvency as at the date of the settlement, the debtor will be presumed to be insolvent at the date of the settlement: see 
 Townsend v Westacott 
 (supra).
Thus, the burden of proving solvency at the date of the transfer is on the settlor - `it is clear that, though the mere fact of a man being indebted is not fatal to a settlement, it is not necessary to prove actual insolvency, but if insolvency takes place shortly after the execution of the settlement that is enough`: see 
 Crossley v Elworthy 
 (1871) LR 12 Eq 158, per Malins V-C at p 167. No such evidence of solvency was forthcoming in the instant case. Wee Tiong never testified. There was therefore ample justification to presume that Wee Tiong was `insolvent`, as used in the sense of this statute, at the date of the share transfer. As a consequence of this presumption of `insolvency`, Wee Tiong could thereby also be presumed to possess a fraudulent intention at the time of the transfer, since the natural consequence of the share transfer would be to defeat any recovery of the debt by the respondents.
On the facts here, Wee Tiong was indebted in the amount of $1,552,027.99. The appellant`s counsel, however, had attempted to show that Wee Tiong was actually solvent at the time of the share transfer. Our attention was drawn to an alleged $10m deal which, if successful, would enable Wee Tiong to earn a 3% commission. But this alleged deal, which at best could have earned him $300,000, had no certainty. In the absence of other evidence to prove the solvency of Wee Tiong at the time of the share transfer, it was patently clear to us that after the share transfer, he would also be unable to pay the respondents. In fact, counsel for the respondents suggested that, even if the share transfer had not been carried out, it appeared that Wee Tiong would still not be able to discharge his debts.
Hence, in the circumstances, the presumption of fraudulent intent could be properly triggered against him. Once such a legal presumption is triggered, it will be conclusive. The voluntary share transfer was accordingly caught by the Elizabethan Statute and rendered void because of constructive fraud. Having reached this conclusion, we did not think it was necessary for us to delve further into actual fraud which the parties had. The appellant`s appeal on the ground that the share transfer was not caught by the Elizabethan Statute must therefore fail.
 Tort of conspiracy
The respondents, in the court below, had strenuously argued that there was a tort of conspiracy to injure them. Their statement of claim stated: 
14 On or about 8 December 1992, Quah Wee Tiong, in conspiracy with the defendant, transferred 720 shares in the capital of a company known as Soon Aik (Private) Limited for a purported consideration of $10 in order to injure the plaintiffs, who as creditors of Quah Wee Tiong would eventually be entitled to seize the shares to meet their claim.
 
... 
17 In the circumstances, the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage from the said conspiracy between Quah Wee Tiong and the defendant.
The learned judicial commissioner found in the respondents` favour, with damages to be assessed by the registrar. And the quantum of damages, we suspected, would have been up to the amount of the debt or what the 720 shares are worth, whichever is the lower. But that was a separate matter.
The tort of conspiracy comprises two types: conspiracy by unlawful means and conspiracy by lawful means. A conspiracy by unlawful means is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of injuring or damaging the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the intention achieved. In a conspiracy by lawful means, there need not be an unlawful act committed by the conspirators. But there is the additional requirement of proving a `predominant purpose` by all the conspirators to cause injury or damage to the plaintiff, and the act is carried out and the purpose achieved.
It was unclear whether the court below had decided that there was a tort of conspiracy by lawful or unlawful means. This difference was important because, as stated earlier, the former required a `predominant purpose` to injure the respondents: see 
 Lonrho plc v Fayed 
 
[1992] 1 AC 448
, whereas the latter had no such requirement. In this appeal, the appellant contended that there was no allegation of an unlawful act here. This was not disputed by the respondents. We, however, proceeded to consider the two types of conspiracy: ie conspiracy by lawful means and conspiracy by unlawful means.
Quite apart from the question as to whether a fraudulent preference constitutes unlawful means, we thought that even if there were a tort of conspiracy by unlawful means here, then presumably, this was unlawful precisely because the transfer was caught by the Elizabethan Statute. This being the case, the transfer would be avoided under the Elizabethan Statute. And this would have a direct impact on the proof of damages because, if the Elizabethan Statute was contravened, the shares would have to be returned to the debtor. What then is the basis for a claim in damages where the respondents would have suffered no loss? Unless the respondents could prove other losses such as those arising out of delay, they could not argue that the Elizabethan Statute was breached and claim damages at the same time.
In any event, if the present scenario could fall into the tort of conspiracy, then every case of fraudulent preference will also come under the tort, giving it an unnecessarily wide ambit. The tort of conspiracy to injure would encroach into the scope of the Bankruptcy Act, the Elizabethan Statute and s 73B CLPA which have provisions designed specifically to deal with such instances.
In any case, we were of the view that the respondents could not succeed in the tort of conspiracy to injure by lawful means. First, if the alleged fraud was indeed found, then conceptually the tort of conspiracy could not have been by lawful means. Second, there was the `predominant purpose` requirement. To use an analogy, if a thief breaks a window to enter a room, the 
 predominant purpose 
, which is also synonymous with the 
 motive 
 or 
 object 
, is to steal. His predominant purpose, however, is not to break the window, although he must have 
 intended 
 to break it so as to achieve his main purpose. Thus, a predominant purpose is not the same as intention: see also 
 Mckernan v Fraser 
 (1931) 46 CLR 343 at pp 399-400.
In the instant case, the purpose of the share transfer was really to preserve the integrity of the family company, or to protect Wee Tiong`s assets, rather than to injure the respondents financially. It has to be admitted at once that one of the ramifications was to deprive the respondents of their recovery of the debt, and the appellant and Wee Tiong must have intended that. But such an intention was not the same as a predominant purpose to injure the respondents. Hence, it has been said that, where lawful means are used, the purpose of the combination must be `spiteful and malicious`: see 
 Sorrell v Smith 
 
[1925] AC 700
 at p 748 or actuated by `disinterested malevolence`: see 
 Nann v Raimist 
 (1931) 255 NY 307, per Cardozo CJ at p 319; 
 McKernan v Fraser 
 (supra at p 398). The conspirators` actions must therefore serve none of their own commercial purpose. It followed that the claim for a tort of conspiracy by lawful means could not succeed. Accordingly, no damages were payable.
 Conclusion
For the reasons cited, this appeal was allowed in part. The judgment based on the tort of conspiracy was set aside. And to that extent it was ordered that there shall be no damages payable by the appellant and in relation to this cause of action we ordered there would be no order as to costs. Turning to the claim under the Elizabethan Statute, we ordered that the judgment below would stand. Accordingly, the share transfer was declared void and costs were awarded to the respondents for this part of their case.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was convicted in a district court on 3 November 1994 on five charges which were as follows: 
 
(1) DAC 11132/93
 
 
 
You, Ramanathan Yogendran, male 41 years, NRIC No 1031349Z, are charged that you, on 30 March 1992 at Central Police Division Headquarters, Eu Tong Sen Street, Singapore, did fabricate false evidence by making a police report numbered A/920330/122D containing a statement, to wit:
 
 
 
`On 27 March 1992, my client Kunjambu Arumugam came to my office and demanded that I gave him a cheque for $38,000. When I refused, as he was not entitled to it, he used a letter opener which was on my table and pointed it at me and told me that he will stab me with it if I did not give him the cheque. I became frightened and prepared him a cheque. Whilst I was preparing the cheque, he told me to hurry up. I gave him the cheque and he went and encashed it,`
 
 
 
which was false, intending that the said statement might appear as evidence in a judicial proceeding and knowing it likely that you would thereby cause one Kunjambu Arumugam to be convicted of an offence under s 392 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not more than ten years and with caning, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 195 punishable under ss 392 and 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(2) DAC 11133/93
 
 
 
You, Ramanathan Yogendran, male 41 years, NRIC No 1031349Z, are charged that you, on 27 March 1992 at 171 Chin Swee Road #05-06 San Centre, committed breach of trust as an agent in that you, being at that material time an advocate and solicitor and practising under your firm`s name of Yogen & Partners and in such capacity as being entrusted with dominion over property, to wit, a sum of $38,000 released by the Keppel Bank of Singapore Ltd pursuant to a housing loan granted to one Nemah bte Hamid which you held as stakeholder in your firm`s clients` account in connection with the sale and purchase of an apartment at Blk 371, Clemenceau Avenue #11-376, dishonestly misappropriated the said property and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(3) DAC 2868/94
 
 
 
You, Ramanathan Yogendran, male 41 years, NRIC No 1031349Z, are charged that you, on 28 March 1992, sometime between 9am and 9.20am did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Arumugam Kujambu with injury to his person, to wit, by threatening to kill him, intending to cause alarm to the said Arumugam Kujambu, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(4) DAC 2869/94 (as amended at the end of the trial)
 
 
 
You, Ramanathan Yogendran, male 41 years, NRIC No 1031349Z, are charged that you, on 31 March 1992 at United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd, Katong Branch, Singapore, did fabricate false evidence by causing the following circumstances to exist, to wit, by banking in five Malayan Banking Bhd cheques issued by one Arumugam Kujambu as follows:
 
 
 
(i) Cheque No 087233 for $ 4,500
(ii) Cheque No 087237 for $ 5,730 
(iii) Cheque No 087240 for $ 3,400 
(iv) Cheque No 087242 for $ 500 
(v) Cheque No 087243 for $14,382
 
 
 
which you knew would be dishonoured and which were subsequently dishonoured by the said Malayan Banking Bhd, intending that such circumstance may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(5) DAC 4022/94
 
 
 
You, Ramanathan Yogendran, male 41 years, NRIC No 1031349Z, are charged that you, on 30 March 1992 at Central Police Division Headquarters, did give to a public servant, namely, one Insp Patrick Rajagopal certain information in your police statement, to wit:
 
 
 
`... On 27 March 1992 at about 1440 hours, the said Arumugam came to my office at Chin Swee Road without any prior appointments. I met him and he asked me whether the said cheque had come in. I told him that the cheque has already been deposited into my firm`s clients` account. On hearing this, he asked me to hand over the said cheque to him. I told him that he is not entitled to the said cheque. He became angry and demanded for the cheque. I insisted to him that he had no right over the cheque. At this juncture, he took one letter opener which was on my table and pointed the letter opener to me in a threatening manner. He told me that he will stab me with the letter opener if I refuse to hand over the cheque to him. He even told me to hurry up. I became frightened and prepared the cheque amounting to $38,000 made payable in his name and handed the cheque to him. I handed one Overseas Union Bank cheque, No 097428, to him ...`
 
 
 
which you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely that you would thereby cause such public servant to use his lawful powers to the injury of one Arumugam Kujambu, which charge is for an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
He was sentenced on these charges as follows: 
 
(1) DAC 11132/93 - three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane
(2) DAC 11133/93 - three years` imprisonment 
(3) DAC 2868/94 - one year`s imprisonment 
(4) DAC 2869/94 - one year`s imprisonment 
(5) DAC 4022/94 - six months` imprisonment
 
 
 
The district judge ordered the sentences of imprisonment in respect of DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94 to run concurrently but consecutively to the imprisonment terms in DAC 2868/94 and DAC 2869/94. In total, the appellant would serve five years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. This appeal was brought against his convictions and the sentences.
 Evidence adduced on DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94
The appellant was an advocate and solicitor of some ten years` standing, practising as the sole proprietor of Yogen & Partners. Sometime in January 1992, one Mdm Nemah bte Hamid engaged him to represent her in her purchase of an apartment, unit #11-376 at the Skyscraper, 372 Clemenceau Avenue, at the price of $380,000. The appellant also acted for the vendors, Arumugam Kujambu (Colin) and his wife, Rita Kurup, in the same transaction. Colin and his wife jointly owned another apartment at the Skyscraper, #09-378. Sometime before November 1991, the appellant had agreed to buy #09-378 from Colin. To this end, the appellant had obtained a housing loan from Keppel Bank and an undated option form was drafted and given to him.
In respect of #11-376, Mdm Nemah obtained a housing loan of $232,000 and a bridging loan of $38,000 from Keppel Bank. The bridging loan, representing 10% of the purchase price, was to enable her to exercise the option to purchase #11-376 and was to be subsequently repaid to Keppel Bank from her CPF savings. The deadline for exercising the option to purchase was 25 March 1992. The appellant had called the solicitors for Keppel Bank, Drew & Napier, as early as 31 January 1992 to request the release of the bridging loan. In a letter dated 16 March 1992, the appellant confirmed that his firm would hold the $38,000 as stakeholder until the completion date which was to be on 20 April 1992. On 25 March 1992, Drew & Napier forwarded a cashier`s order for the sum of $38,000 made out to Yogen & Partners. This cashier`s order was deposited into Yogen & Partners` clients` account on 26 March 1992.
It transpired that #11-376 had been repossessed by the mortgagee bank, Bank of Singapore, and was scheduled to be auctioned off on 26 March 1992. The appellant attended the auction and made a bid at $390,000 but the apartment was sold to the highest bidder at $400,000.
Colin gave evidence that on 27 March 1992, the appellant telephoned him to say that he had some good news for him. The appellant told him that the 10% downpayment for #09-378 which he was buying from Colin was already in. The appellant requested to borrow this sum to settle some financial problems. He proposed that he would prepare a cheque in Colin`s name, whereupon Colin could encash it and lend the money to him. Colin was uncertain whether this was legitimate. The appellant assured him that he would be `personally responsible` for the money and nothing would go wrong. He assured Colin that he had gold credit cards and one card could be used in case he had to replace the money. Colin eventually agreed to the arrangement, assuaged by the appellant`s assurances and also on account of the appellants` previous assistance in settling some of his debts.
The appellant told Colin to go to his office at about 2.30pm that very day and to wait downstairs to collect the cheque. Colin went to the appellant`s office at San Centre, Chin Swee Road, accompanied by one Chung Voon Cheng, in Chung`s car. Colin told Chung that he was going to the appellant`s office to collect the 10% downpayment for the apartment. On arriving at San Centre, he was told to go up to the appellant`s office as the cheque was not ready yet and the appellant was engaged on the phone.
Colin met the appellant in his office. The appellant pointed at his watch to indicate that Colin was late. He asked for Colin`s identity card and wrote out a cheque in Colin`s name. Unfortunately, the appellant made a mistake. He thus tore up the first cheque and made out another cheque to `Arumugam A/L Kujambu`, which was Colin`s name as stated in his identity card. He handed the uncrossed cheque to Colin. Colin collected the cheque and walked out. All this took place between 2.30pm to 2.45pm.
Chung was waiting for Colin all this while in his car. Chung and Colin then drove to a bank at Liang Court. The journey took about five minutes. Colin encashed the cheque and went back to his office at about 3.15pm. At about 4pm, the appellant called Colin and asked him if the cheque had been encashed. Colin replied in the affirmative and told the appellant that he could go to his office anytime. Apparently, Colin did not intend to lend the appellant the entire sum of $38,000. He intended to use $3,250 to pay the rental due to a friend for the use of the office space and another $5,000 to repay a loan which he had obtained from one Sadasivan Premkumar.
The appellant arrived at Colin`s office between 4.30pm to 4.45pm. Colin asked him to sit down and then explained to him that he could not give all the money to him as he needed some money to survive. He said he wanted to pay his office rental arrears and to repay his debt to Premkumar. The appellant immediately became abusive and grabbed a chair. While he was holding on to the chair, Premkumar restrained him and in the process tore out two buttons from the appellant`s shirt. Colin`s other friends, Wahab (Nemah`s brother), Chung and Hani Suradi (Nemah`s husband) also entered his office. Colin was hit on the elbow by the appellant. Colin threatened to call the police if the appellant did not behave himself. The appellant instead grabbed the telephone and called the police.
The police arrived and interviewed both Colin and the appellant. They were advised to lodge separate police reports. Colin lodged a police report alleging that the appellant had turned violent after trying to get a loan from him. The appellant eventually lodged two police reports (`P68` and `P69`) on 30 March 1992 alleging that he was robbed by Colin. Prior to this, on 28 March 1992, the appellant went to see Acting Superintendent Ng Chee Kok at Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters. He told Ng that he had been assaulted by Colin but his real complaint was that Colin had gone into his office and taken an uncrossed cheque of $38,000 from his table without his authorization or knowledge. He also claimed that Colin had cheated him. On the same day, the appellant also told Peter Lim Kwang Meng, Head of Investigations, Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters that Colin had gone into his office and taken away a cheque. Peter Lim told the appellant that the matter would be referred to `A` Division, Central Police Station since it was not within his jurisdiction.
On 30 March 1992, the appellant called Insp Patrick Rajagopal at about 8.50am. Insp Rajagopal was the duty investigating officer at Central Police Station. The appellant informed him that he was a lawyer and that his client had cheated him. Insp Rajagopal told him to come back at 1pm that day. The appellant met Insp Rajagopal at about 12.45pm. After interviewing the appellant, Insp Rajagopal proceeded to record the statement P68 at about 1pm. Thereafter the police report P69 was lodged by the appellant at about 2pm. The appellant himself wrote this report. On 31 March 1992, the appellant called up Yaw Yan Chong, a reporter with 
 The New Paper 
, to inform him that he had been robbed by his client.
The substance of P68 and P69 are set out in the charges DAC 4022/94 and DAC 11132/93 respectively. Colin was subsequently arrested and charged for armed robbery (s 392 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224)). He was remanded for nine days and subsequently granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal by the court on the charge.
Rose Mary, one of the appellant`s secretaries, gave evidence for the prosecution. Rose Mary said that she did not hear Colin utter any threat in order to obtain the cheque. She also did not see Colin threaten the appellant with the letter opener. The gist of her testimony was that if Colin had threatened the appellant, she would have heard or seen it. She said she had heard the words `hurry up` in the course of the conversation between Colin and the appellant. Nothing had happened to make her feel alarmed or frightened.
 Evidence adduced on DAC 2868/94
Colin testified that on 28 March 1992, between 9am and 9.20am, the appellant had called him at home. The appellant was very abusive and had threatened to kill him. Colin said that he was angry and also frightened. He went to a neighbourhood police post later that morning to make a police report. The report stated: 
 
He has been calling my home and threatening myself and talking all sorts of nonsense - that he will kill me and soon. He called me this morning between 9 and 9.20am and made such remarks. He also said he would come to my home and assault me.
 
 
 
Colin was of the view that the appellant had threatened him because he did not lend him the $38,000. He testified that there could have been two calls but he could not recall if he was threatened on both occasions. He reiterated that there was a threat.
Premkumar and Rita Kurup both testified that Colin had spoken to them on 28 March 1992 to tell them that he had been threatened by the appellant. Premkumar elaborated that Colin had said that his wife, Rita Kurup, was very frightened and that he believed that Colin was also frightened. He said that Colin did mention that he had been threatened but he could not recall exactly what the threats were. Rita Kurup also testified that, on 28 March 1992, Colin had told her about the appellant`s threat. He took the threat seriously and was frightened enough to make a police report. Rita Kurup said that after Colin`s release from remand, he had requested to stay at her mother`s house for a few days `in case anything happened to him`. Samydorai Jeyapal further testified that on 27 March 1992, the day when the alleged robbery occurred, at about 5.45pm, he went over to the appellant`s office to console the appellant. He suggested that the appellant should make a police report to settle his dispute with Colin. In reply, the appellant told him that it was useless, because: 
 
The police would classify this case as a civil matter and it will take a long time. Anyway, if they want to play me out this way, I will kill them.
 
 
 
 
 Evidence adduced on DAC 2869/94
 
This charge arose from the appellant`s statement to Insp Rajagopal on 1 April 1992 in the following terms: 
 
I wish to state that on 1 April 1992, I was informed by Malayan Banking Bhd that five cheques that were issued to me by Arumugam were dishonoured, ie account closed. The five cheques are as follows:
 
 
 
(a) Cheque No 087233: $ 4,500
(b) Cheque No 087237: $ 5,730 
(c) Cheque No 087240: $ 3,400 
(d) Cheque No 087242: $ 500 
(e) Cheque No 087243: $14,382
 
 
 
I banked the said five cheques on 31 March 1992 at UMBC Katong and was informed on the 1 April 1992 that the accounts were closed.
 
 
 
Colin testified that these were all postdated cheques. Cheque No 087233 was postdated to 15 December 1991. He said that he had given this cheque in trust to the appellant prior to the latter agreeing to buy his apartment #09-378. He had expressly informed the appellant that he had a few debts to settle. He testified that his account with Malayan Banking Bhd (MBB) was closed on 17 December 1991 and that he had informed the appellant about this. There was an understanding that the appellant would not present the cheque for payment on 15 December 1991. The second, third and fourth cheques, Nos 087237, 087240 and 087242, were postdated to 11 January 1992, 10 February 1992 and 24 February 1992 respectively. The appellant was also not supposed to present these cheques for payment on their stated dates. The last cheque, No 087243, was postdated to 31 March 1992 on the appellant`s suggestion. This cheque was issued because the appellant had agreed to settle Colin`s credit card debts with Overseas Union Bank Visa.
Colin maintained that the appellant was aware all along that his MBB account was closed when all the five cheques were issued. They had an arrangement whereby the appellant was supposed to deduct the amounts owed from the proceeds of the sale of the two apartments owned by Colin. The proceeds of the sale would be banked into Yogen & Partners` clients` account and that at the end of the sale, the appellant was supposed to deduct what Colin owed and forward the balance remaining to Colin and Rita Kurup. Colin added that the five postdated cheques were to be held by the appellant as security. Colin also admitted that he was in financial difficulties and that between January 1992 and March 1992, the appellant had lent him various sums of money to settle his more pressing debts. He further testified that the appellant knew that his debts were holding up the sale of his two properties.
The appellant`s statement came about after the interview on 31 March 1992 with Insp Rajagopal. The latter had asked the appellant if he had any other things to inform him about Colin. The appellant told him that Colin owed him a lot of money and had given him a few cheques for payment. The appellant suspected that these were bad cheques. In accordance with his normal practice, Insp Rajagopal advised the appellant to encash the cheques in order to make a police report. The appellant did so and subsequently gave a statement to Insp Rajagopal (set out above). On behalf of the appellant, Insp Rajagopal lodged a police report in relation to these five cheques. The case was subsequently classified as an offence under s 27(a) of the Debtors Act (Cap 73). Insp Rajagopal conducted further investigations by writing in to MBB and was informed that the appellant`s account had been closed.
 The close of the prosecution`s case
A submission of no case to answer was made on the appellant`s behalf only in relation to DAC 2868/94 (the criminal intimidation charge) and DAC 2869/94 (the fabrication of evidence charge). In relation to the former, the contention was that the defence should not be called as there was no evidence that Colin had been affected by the call. The learned district judge saw no merit in this submission, relying on authorities cited by the prosecution which indicated that the real focus was on the intention of the accused and not the effect of the threat.
As for DAC 2869/94, it was submitted that the defence should not be called as the appellant was entitled as of right to present the five cheques for payment. Upon their dishonour, the appellant had the right to commence a civil action for recovery of the amounts due. Moreover, Colin was never charged for any offence in respect of the five cheques. Finally, it was emphasized that the appellant had merely acted upon the instructions of Insp Rajagopal, who had advised him to present the cheques for payment before proceeding further.
The learned district judge accepted that the appellant unquestionably had the right to present the cheques for payment. However, the circumstances showed more than a mere intent in recovering the moneys from Colin; the appellant`s real intent was to cause a miscarriage of justice by misleading the court. It was irrelevant that Colin was never charged for any offence in respect of the five cheques. While Insp Rajagopal did advise the appellant to present the cheques for payment, the information in relation to the cheques had been volunteered by the appellant. It was open to the appellant, in spite of Insp Rajagopal`s `insistence`, not to make the statement but to lodge a civil claim against Colin. As an advocate and solicitor of several years` standing, the appellant must have been fully aware of the consequences which would follow from banking in the cheques when Colin`s account had been closed.
The learned district judge examined the evidence adduced in relation to the other three charges as well and was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case on all five charges. He thus proceeded to call upon the appellant to enter upon his defence.
 The defence
The material aspects of the appellant`s defence were as follows. He was first introduced to Colin sometime in 1988. Colin was having trouble keeping up his mortgage payments on his two apartments at the Skyscraper. Colin managed to persuade the appellant to buy one of these apartments, #09-378. The understanding was that Colin would subsequently repurchase the apartment and return the appellant all the moneys paid for its purchase. The appellant proceeded to obtain a loan for $400,000 from Keppel Bank but he subsequently decided not to purchase the apartment.
The appellant knew that Colin was also trying to find a buyer for his other apartment at the Skyscraper, #11-376. Sometime in January 1992, Colin gave the appellant an option to purchase duly signed by Mdm Nemah in respect of her intending purchase of #11-376. The appellant said that Mdm Nemah`s husband, Hani Suradi, was doing everything on her behalf and he was to deal with Hani and not Nemah, although Nemah was his client. He said that he had told Hani clearly that the property they were buying was being repossessed but he did not know how far the repossession proceedings had gone.
The final date for Mdm Nemah to exercise the option was 25 March 1992. The appellant testified that sometime in March 1992, Colin had showed him a leaflet and told him that #11-376 was up for auction on 26 March 1992. The appellant told Colin that he would look into the matter. Hani had also asked him about the auction and he had informed Hani that he would get the auction withdrawn. The appellant said that both Hani and Colin knew from the letters forwarded to them that the $38,000 bridging loan in respect of #11-376 would be forwarded to his firm on or before 25 March 1992.
The appellant said he spoke to Augustine Soh, the solicitor for the mortgagee bank in respect of #11-376, to request that the auction be stopped. Augustine Soh told him that if he could produce $38,000 in cash, he was prepared to hold back the auction. The appellant told Augustine Soh that $38,000 was coming in on 25 March 1992 and it was then that the latter suggested that the appellant could go and bid on behalf of Mdm Nemah during the auction itself.
Having received the cashier`s order for $38,000 from Drew & Napier on 25 March 1992, the appellant attended the auction and made two bids, at $380,000 and $390,000. He said that if the higher bid had been accepted, he would have been personally responsible for the difference of $10,000.
The appellant denied that he had asked Colin to see him to collect a cheque. In particular, he denied that there was any discussion about the 10% having come in for #09-378. Rather, Colin came into his office without any appointment on 27 March 1992 and demanded the $38,000 which had come in for #11-376. The appellant told him that he was not entitled to the money. Colin then took a letter opener from his table and demanded that he write out the cheque for $38,000. He was frightened when he wrote the first cheque and thus made a mistake. Colin saw this and asked him to make out a second cheque and to hurry up. Colin took the cheque and walked off.
The appellant said that he was taken aback by what had happened and he sat on his chair for hardly five minutes before telling one of his secretaries, Diana Lethijia, to call the bank to stop payment. He himself called the bank and spoke to a bank officer. By then, Colin had already encashed the cheque and left the bank. The appellant went to Colin`s house and, as Colin was not at home, he proceeded to look for him at his office at Royal Hotel. The appellant said that he went there with the sole intention of recovering the $38,000. When he confronted Colin about the money, Colin told him that he was not going to return it. He said that he immediately hit Colin and there was a fight. Colin retaliated. The appellant then took a chair but he was pulled back by someone, who he later realized to be Premkumar. He had the impression that Premkumar, Hani and Chung, who were all present, had ganged up together with Colin. He called the police. He wanted to leave Colin`s office premises but he could not as Chung had locked the door. When the police came, he told one of the police officers, Suresh Kumar, to seize the money. Suresh Kumar said that he needed to take down their particulars first, whereupon the appellant scolded him `stupid` and walked off after giving him his name card.
Later that evening, the appellant contacted Samydorai Jeyapal. As soon as Samydorai arrived, Edward Job came and there was a conversation between the appellant and Edward Job. The appellant said that he did mention to Edward Job that he had been robbed. On 28 March 1992, while the appellant was in court 14 of the subordinate courts, he spoke to Veno Gopal, an advocate and solicitor, in a rather hushed tone and told him that Colin had extracted a cheque from him.
The appellant agreed that he saw Acting Superintendent Ng Chee Kok on 28 March 1992. He said this was because he thought the latter could help him recover the $38,000. He said that he did tell Ng Chee Kok that Colin had taken the cheque of $38,000 without his knowledge. He did not mention about the letter opener because he did not want the matter to be `blown open`. He also did not want the incident to affect his firm`s reputation. He agreed that he did tell DSP Peter Lim that Colin had come into his office and taken away a cheque. He was told that Central Police Station would have jurisdiction to deal with his complaint and that he should go there on 30 March 1992. Later on 28 March 1992, the appellant flew to Kuala Lumpur with his family on a prearranged trip. On 30 March 1992, the appellant lodged the two police reports, P68 and P69. He also notified Yaw Yan Chong, a reporter with 
 The New Paper 
, that he had been robbed by his client in his office. He did this as he wanted to `expose what was happening`.
Diana Lethijia, one of the appellant`s two secretaries, testified on the appellant`s behalf with regard to having witnessed the alleged robbery on 27 March 1992. She said she saw Colin threaten the appellant with the letter opener and this led to the appellant issuing a cheque from his clients` account to Colin. She also said that the appellant had told her to call the bank to stop payment on the cheque.
In respect of DAC 2868/94 (the criminal intimidation charge), the appellant made the threatening telephone call to Colin on 28 March 1992 between 9am to 9.20am. He said that he was in the subordinate courts at that time and this would support his assertion that he did not make any threatening call.
As for DAC 2869/94 (the fabrication of evidence charge), the appellant`s defence was essentially that the five cheques were presented for payment without any knowledge that Colin`s MBB account was closed. In any case, he had only acted in accordance with Insp Rajagopal`s advice. He said that these cheques were given to him by Colin because he had helped Colin tide over his financial difficulties. The cheques were postdated so that payment would be spread over a period of time. He did not know that Colin`s MBB account was closed; if he did, he would not have accepted the cheques. He said that he had given loans to various people before and there was nothing sinister in this. Colin had given him the assurance that the cheques would be honoured because he was expecting commissions to arrive in the course of his work as a housing agent.
In the case of the five cheques, the appellant said that Colin would call him on the due dates of each of the cheques and ask him to withhold presenting the cheques for payment, as his commissions had not yet come in. The appellant said that he had brought up the issue of the five cheques only after Insp Rajagopal asked if he had anything else to disclose with respect to Colin. It was only at Insp Rajagopal`s insistence and suggestion that he banked in the cheques. When the cheques were dishonoured, he then decided to commence a civil action but he delayed it and he was trying the obtain the five cheques from Insp Lopez, the investigating officer. In summary, the appellant`s defence was that when he made the statement to Insp Rajagopal on 30 March 1992, it was not done with the intention of initiating police investigation in relation to the five cheques under the Debtors Act or any other Act.
 The district judge`s findings
The main question of fact was whether there was a robbery committed by Colin in the appellant`s office on 27 March 1992. The learned district judge gave detailed reasons in his grounds of decision why he believed Colin`s evidence and rejected the appellant`s defence. He found it difficult to accept the appellant`s story on the alleged robbery. It was hard to believe that Colin would have the audacity to rob the appellant in broad daylight in the appellant`s own office, using a plastic letter opener. It was even harder to believe that the appellant had meekly acceded to Colin`s demands without any protest. The district judge noted that the appellant had somehow managed to spell Colin`s name correctly despite his claims of having acted under duress and fear, despite having spelt Colin`s name incorrectly on previous occasions. This supported Colin`s evidence that the appellant did ask for his identity card to ascertain his name before preparing the cheque.
The district judge found it incredible that Colin could have intended to rob the appellant and yet ask for a specific amount of $38,000, and by way of a cheque and not cash. The district judge accepted the prosecution`s submission that the entire scheme was concocted to accord some legitimacy to the whole affair. Colin as the seller of the property would be used to withdraw the money first, and thereafter the appellant would obtain it from Colin.
In addition, the district judge accepted that Rose Mary, the appellant`s other secretary, was a credible witness whose evidence again supported Colin`s version of the events. The gist of Rose Mary`s evidence was that she had not seen or heard anything unusual in the office. If there had been any threats uttered by Colin, she would have heard them, but nothing had occurred to cause her to feel alarmed.
The conduct of both Colin and the appellant after the alleged robbery was also relevant. Colin behaved normally and not like someone who had just robbed his lawyer. Chung said that, when the appellant first arrived at Colin`s office, he spoke in a friendly manner, instead of confronting Colin. Samydorai gave evidence that, when the appellant spoke to him on the evening of 27 March 1992, the appellant mentioned that he was disappointed because Colin had reneged on his agreement to do him a favour by returning the $38,000 to him.
The fact that the appellant had spoken to various persons after the alleged robbery but had never mentioned that he had been robbed was particularly telling. Samydorai was not told of any robbery. There were allegations made by the appellant to ASP Ng Chee Kok that Colin had cheated him. DSP Peter Lim was told that Colin had gone into the appellant`s office and taken away a cheque. Both ASP Ng and DSP Lim testified that they were surprised to find out subsequently from 
 The New Paper 
 article that the appellant had been robbed. Similarly, Veno Gopal expressed surprise when he read the article.
The district judge found that Edward Job`s evidence was of no assistance to the appellant. Edward Job was not sure whether the appellant had said that he was robbed or cheated. In any event, Edward Job`s credit had been impeached during the trial and the district judge decided to accord no weight to his evidence. The inconsistency in Edward Job`s evidence related to Samydorai having told him that the appellant had given a cheque of over $30,000 to someone to encash and this person had failed to return with the money. This was recorded in Edward Job`s two statements but at the trial he denied that Samydorai had told him this.
The appellant first complained that he had been robbed three days after the alleged robbery. He said that his main objective was to recover the money and return it to Drew & Napier. He did not want to make a police report alleging robbery as he did not want to blow the entire matter out of proportion. He attributed his hesitation to his concern for Colin`s family and for the reputation of his own firm. The district judge found it difficult to accept these reasons. Colin had already made it clear that he would not give the $38,000 to the appellant. There was also no apparent concern, either for Colin`s family or for his own firm, when the appellant not only lodged a police report, but also volunteered information about the alleged robbery to Yaw Yan Chong of 
 The New Paper 
.
Finally, the district judge found Diana Lethijia`s evidence unreliable. She said that, despite her knowledge of what had taken place, she was not curious why it had happened, nor did she attempt to find out from the appellant. It was only after she had left the office that she called Rose Mary to make some enquiries. Despite her claims of fear and alarm, her nonchalant conduct after Colin had left was entirely inconsistent with that of someone who had just witnessed a robbery. There were also contradictions in her evidence relating to the phone calls made to the bank. In the light of Diana`s unsatisfactory testimony, the district judge concluded that she was not a witness of truth.
In the result, the district judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no robbery had taken place. He accepted that Colin had given a true account of what had transpired. He thus found that the appellant was guilty of the offences under DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94.
Turning to DAC 2868/94 (the criminal intimidation charge), the district judge opined that the mere fact that the appellant may have been in the subordinate courts during the specific time did not mean that he could not have made the threatening telephone call. He noted that the effect of the threat on the victim is not relevant for the purpose of any offence of criminal intimidation as defined in s 503 of the Penal Code, relying on the Malaysian case of . In 
 Lee Yoke Choong 
, it was argued in mitigation of sentence that the victim was not alarmed by a threat to throw acid on his face and the accused had not threatened to carry out the attack personally. Ong J held that the offence of criminal intimidation lies in the intent behind the threat and not its effect. The district judge agreed with this reasoning and was satisfied that the charge of criminal intimidation had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. He accordingly convicted the appellant.
As for DAC 2869/94 (the fabrication of evidence charge), the district judge accepted Colin`s explanation that the five cheques had been given over a period of time during which Colin was trying to sell his properties. They were not given on a single occasion, thus they were postdated to various dates, on the appellant`s suggestions, to take into account the projected completion dates for the sale of the apartments. The district judge categorically rejected the appellant`s defence that he did not know of the closure of Colin`s MBB account. The appellant knew that Colin was in dire financial difficulties, and had deliberately refrained from presenting the cheques for payment even when they became due. If the appellant genuinely believed that Colin`s MBB account was still viable, he would surely have presented the cheques for payment when they became due. He would then have acquired an immediate right to sue Colin if the cheques were dishonoured. The district judge drew the irresistible inference that the appellant`s conscious decision not to present the first four cheques for payment was actuated by his knowledge that Colin`s account with MBB was closed at the material time. Alternatively, in view of Colin`s desperate financial situation, the appellant knew that the cheques would be dishonoured upon presentation.
The district judge was thus satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the charge of fabricating false evidence. The relevant false evidence related to an offence under s 27(a) of the Debtors` Act, which is punishable with imprisonment of up to one year or with fine or both. The prosecution had framed the charge as one under s 195 of the Penal Code, but s 195 would apply only when the false evidence relates to an offence punishable with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term of seven years or upwards. The appropriate section was therefore s 193 of the Penal Code. Exercising his powers under ss 163 and 175 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), the district judge convicted the appellant of an offence punishable under s 193 of the Penal Code.
 The appeal
Numerous grounds of appeal were raised by counsel for the appellant in the petition of appeal, not all of which were actively pursued in counsel`s oral arguments. Counsel informed this court during the appeal that his primary focus was on the question whether the district court had jurisdiction to try the offences under DAC 11132/93 and DAC 2869/94. In addition, counsel said that he would submit that the district judge had erred in drawing the wrong inferences and concluding that Colin was a credible witness whose evidence was to be preferred over the appellant`s. Counsel made it clear that the appellant`s purpose of appealing was to obtain a direction for a fresh trial and not an outright acquittal.
In these grounds of judgment, I shall deal primarily with the oral arguments canvassed.
 Whether the district court has jurisdiction (DAC 11132/93 and DAC 2869/94)
As a starting point, it should be noted that DAC 11132/93 related to the appellant`s allegation of armed robbery (s 392 read with s 397 Penal Code) which is punishable with a mandatory minimum of two years` imprisonment and a maximum of ten years, and mandatory minimum caning of 12 strokes (by virtue of s 397). As noted earlier, DAC 2869/94 was in fact amended at the end of the trial to a charge under s 193 and not s 195.
It was common ground in the present appeal that, in respect of Penal Code offences, there are three tiers of jurisdiction conferred on the district courts by the CPC:
 
 
(a) s 7(1) CPC specifies the district court`s general jurisdiction; 
 
(b) s 7(2) CPC specifies a special `application and consent` jurisdiction. This is not relevant to this appeal; 
 
(c) s 9(a) CPC, with reference to col 8 of Sch A, provides specific references to the court by which a Penal Code offence is shown to be `triable`.
  
 
 
Section 9(a) CPC states: 
 
[Subject to the other provisions of this Code] any offence under the Penal Code may be tried by the High Court or by any other court by which the offence is shown to be triable in the 8th column of Schedule A.
 
 
 
On appeal, counsel for the appellant founded his submissions on the fact that, on a plain reading, col 8 of Sch A of the CPC does not expressly specify that the district court may try the offences under s 195 or s 397 of the Penal Code. Counsel therefore contended that only the High Court has jurisdiction to try these offences, notwithstanding that s 7(1) CPC states: 
 
Subject to this Code, every district court shall have jurisdiction to try all offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment provided by law does not exceed 10 years or which are punishable with fine only.
 
 
 
Counsel`s submission was buttressed by pointing out that a strict approach to interpretation should be adopted in relation to penal statutes. If the district court had no jurisdiction to try these two offences, there would have been a misjoinder of charges, the prejudicial effect of which would vitiate the entire trial proceedings.
Section 7(1) CPC was last amended by Act 5 of 1986, when the `hearing` jurisdiction of the district courts was increased to encompass offences which were punishable with imprisonment of up to ten years. By this amendment, the previous jurisdictional limit, where the district court could only hear cases punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years, was replaced. The `sentencing` jurisdiction of the district courts in s 11(3) CPC was left intact. There was, however, no corresponding amendment to Sch A, which remained in substantially the same form given by the 1960 amendments to the CPC (Ordinance 18 of 1960). To date, the most recent amendment to Sch A was effected by Act 24 of 1984. These amendments included the insertion of the newly-enacted s 354A and s 379A of the Penal Code into Sch A.
Counsel for the appellant suggested that there was no apparent ambiguity in the present case. He reasoned that Sch A clearly does not specify that a district court has jurisdiction to try the two s 195 charges, notwithstanding that s 7(1) suggests otherwise. By adopting what he termed a plain and literal approach to interpretation, counsel in effect contended that s 9(a) would exhaustively specify precisely when the district courts have jurisdiction. Section 7(1) was thus a mere statement of the general `prima facie` jurisdiction of the district courts, and effect would therefore have to be given to its qualifying opening words, `subject to this Code`. In other words, by requiring reference to Sch A which specifically sets out the offences which are `triable` in the district courts, s 9(a) must qualify or override s 7(1), although counsel denied that this was necessarily so.
According to counsel`s reasoning, the introduction of s 8 (now s 7) by Ordinance 18 of 1960 did not affect s 10 (now s 9). Schedule A was correspondingly amended in 1960 to reflect the increased `hearing` jurisdiction of the district courts. In three instances (ss 386, 388, 394), the jurisdiction of the district courts was `enhanced` by Sch A in 1960 to enable the district courts to try offences for which the maximum punishment prescribed exceeded seven years (ie ten years or life imprisonment). Nevertheless, there was no similar corresponding amendment to Sch A after the 1986 amendments had increased the district courts` jurisdiction. Schedule A, having been left intact, would therefore have to be read as having expressed the intention of Parliament. In particular, there was no indication on the face of Sch A that a s 195 offence would be triable in the district courts.
The prosecution submitted that the 1986 amendments to the CPC introduced an important change in enlarging the district courts` `hearing` jurisdiction. Despite the enactment of s 7(1), Sch A was not correspondingly amended. With Sch A remaining in its existing form, the upshot was that 24 Penal Code offences, which are punishable with a maximum of ten years` imprisonment, would still not be triable in the district courts. Moreover, Sch A could not be considered `exhaustive` as there were various instances of errors or omissions. These included the omission of any reference to s 225C and the indication that a s 334 offence would only be triable in the High Court. There would be anomalous consequences if Sch A is read in isolation and without `qualification` (ie reference to s 7(1)).
The approach towards construction adopted by counsel may have been acceptable in the pre-1960 scheme of the CPC, before Ordinance 18 of 1960 was enacted. The district courts` jurisdiction then was ascertainable only according to offences of which it had cognizance. These offences were enumerated as the `triable` offences in Sch A. There was never any ambiguity then, as Sch A was perfectly consonant with the remainder of the CPC. All one had to do was to refer to Sch A to ascertain whether the district courts had jurisdiction.
On my reading of the relevant provisions, I agreed with the prosecution that there was a patent ambiguity in the present case. This lay in the fact that col 8 of Sch A of the CPC does not specify either that the district court may try offences of armed robbery within s 397, or that the district court may try offences under s 195, despite the subsequent amendment of s 7(1) CPC in 1986. The ambiguity was exacerbated by the use of the qualifying words `subject to this Code` in s 7(1) CPC, and `subject to the other provisions of this Code` in s 9 CPC. In , the Court of Criminal Appeal expressed the view that these two expressions have exactly the same meaning. They mean `no more than to draw the attention of everyone [to the fact] that the particular section in which either of these two expressions appears may be qualified by other provisions of the enactment.`
The court`s observations in 
 Richard Kwan 
 were apposite, albeit subject to two considerations. First, 
 Richard Kwan 
`s case2 was decided at a time when the district courts` `hearing` jurisdiction was limited to offences punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years, and not ten years. The new seven-year limit was reflected in corresponding amendments to Sch A by Ordinance 18 of 1960. These amendments to Sch A specified that all offences which are punishable with a maximum term of imprisonment of seven years may be tried in the district courts. There was never any apparent ambiguity in the then-existing provisions as s 8 CPC (now s 7) and Sch A were perfectly consonant with each other. The second consideration is that the word `qualified` which the court adopted does not connote the meaning of `restriction` or `curtailment`.
With respect, the approach adopted by counsel would have completely glossed over the ambiguity in the CPC provisions by isolating Sch A and disregarding the terms of s 7(1) CPC. The effect of adopting counsel`s submission would be that s 7(1) CPC has to be read `subject to` s 9. This would mean that s 9, and hence Sch A, would always take precedence over s 7. By doing so, it would ignore the words `subject to ...` which similarly appear in s 9.
In my opinion, it is important to have regard to the occurrence of the words `subject to ...` in both ss 7(1) and 9. This does not create any inconsistency or real difficulty in reconciliation. The common occurrence of the words `subject to` does not, and indeed cannot, connote that one section overrides the other. It means that in reading one section, one should take the other into account. `Subject to this Code` in s 7(1) CPC must therefore mean that there may be situations, provided within s 9(a) CPC (ie Sch A), in which the court may be empowered to try offences 
 exceeding 
 the s 7(1) general jurisdictional limit of ten years. It could also mean that the Code could contain provisions expressly denying the district courts jurisdiction, notwithstanding that there could otherwise have been jurisdiction under s 7(1). There are, however, no such provisions in the Code. Section 9(a) and Sch A clearly cannot be taken to have the effect of curtailing or denying the jurisdiction which s 7(1) confers, since s 9(a) itself must be read `subject to the other provisions of this Code`.
Counsel nonetheless suggested that there was no real question of interpretation involved since the words in Sch A are plain and clearly expressed. I did not concur. Schedule A may seem unambiguous, but only when it is read in isolation and without regard to the 1986 amendments to the CPC. The question raised in the present appeal was, essentially, one relating to the correct approach to statutory interpretation, bearing in mind the legislative history of the amendments to the CPC.
It was not disputed that the prosecution`s presentation of the legislative history of the CPC was accurate, and I was satisfied that it was so. The prosecution submitted that the 1960 amendments necessitated a very different approach towards ascertaining jurisdiction. The three tiers of jurisdiction were established and would operate in a complementary fashion. The additional jurisdictional tiers in s 8 (now s 7) were not intended to override or detract from the existing tier in s 10 (now s 9). Rather, in ascertaining jurisdiction under either s 8 or s 10, it was necessary to have regard to the other provisions. This did not require that one section would override the other. It also did not require that jurisdiction conferred under any one tier should be curtailed by reference to another. In my view, the approach suggested by the prosecution is correct. My reasons are as follows.
First, it is pertinent to note from the chronology of substantive amendments to the jurisdiction provisions in the CPC that there has been a progressive enlargement of the district courts` jurisdiction, rather than any movement towards curtailment. The amendments to the CPC since 1960 have been piecemeal in nature. The method of amendment since 1960 has involved grafting amendments onto the existing framework, rather than any radical restructuring similar to the 1960 amendments. This again fortifies the argument that the 1986 amendments were intended to complement the existing jurisdictional provisions, by a general scheme of enhancement rather than curtailment.
Secondly, the approach suggested by the prosecution accords with the accepted principles of statutory construction (see Craies, 
 Statute Law 
 (7th Ed, 1971)). A purposive approach to construction will be adopted where the meaning of the provision is not plain or is ambiguous. This approach embraces the maxim,
 ut res magis valeat quam pereat 
 - words should be construed so as to give a sensible meaning to them. The courts should desist from treating words as surplusage or void. In , Fry LJ opined at p 519: 
 
The only alternative construction offered to us would lead to this result - that the plain intention of the legislature has entirely failed by reason of a slight inexactitude in the language of the section. If we were to adopt this construction, we would be construing the Act in order to defeat its object rather than with a view to carry its object into effect.
 
 
 
Counsel contended that his arguments did not seek to render s 7(1) redundant or otiose. Nevertheless, the logical and inexorable conclusion from his submissions must be that s 9(a) always takes precedence over s 7(1), since s 7(1) only provides an indicator of some form of prima facie jurisdiction. By this reasoning, s 7(1) would then be rendered otiose. If so, the 1986 amendments to s 7(1) would not have achieved their purpose since Sch A was not correspondingly amended. The result was to isolate 24 offences which would have been triable in the district courts by virtue of s 7(1), but would still only be triable in the High Court if counsel`s interpretation is adopted.
It follows from counsel`s arguments that Parliament`s intention in enacting Act 5 of 1986 was self-defeating. There might just as well have been no amending legislation at all since the status quo was in fact never disturbed. This was contrary to the maxim of interpretation 
 ut res magis valeat quam pereat 
. It was also inconsistent with the purposive approach towards interpretation, since it failed to consider Parliament`s intention in enacting the amending legislation in 1986. Finally, despite acknowledging that while Parliament had intended to enlarge the district courts` jurisdiction in 1986, counsel in effect suggested that Parliament had also expressed an intention to the contrary by not amending Sch A in order to give effect to the amendment to s 7(1). This surely could not have been what Parliament intended in enacting Act 5 of 1986.
Thirdly, in 
 Richard Kwan 
`s case2, the court referred to another principle of statutory construction, which may be considered in the present case. This is the principle that, where there is inconsistency or conflict between two provisions, the one last enacted should prevail on the assumption that it is the last expression of the legislative will or intent that should prevail. While there was no real inconsistency in the present case, there was certainly some ambiguity. On this reasoning, primacy should thus be accorded, if at all, to s 7(1), being the most recent amendment to the CPC, rather than s 9(a). It is in fact unnecessary to accord s 7 primacy since the sections are meant to complement one another. Rather, by logical deduction, this principle of construction shows clearly that, contrary to counsel`s suggestion, s 9(a) cannot assume any primacy.
This argument is supported by the 1966 amendment to s 10 (now s 9) (Act 12 of 1966). Mr Yong Nyuk Lin, Minister for Health (speaking for the Minister for Law and National Development), explained in Parliament the reason for the amendment: 
 
There has been some doubt as to the extent of the jurisdiction of the criminal district court as set out in ss 8 and 10 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 8 gives the criminal district court power to hear offences other than those punishable with death or imprisonment for life, if the Public Prosecutor applies to such court to try such offence and the accused consent. Unfortunately, this power, which has been found to be very useful, appears to be cut down by s 10 which prevents a district court from trying any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years.
 It is proposed to make the provision clear by making the provisions of s 8 prevail over those of s 10 of the Code.
 [Emphasis added.] (Second Reading of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill, Parliamentary Debates, 21 April 1966.)
 
 
 
The mischief which the 1966 amendment sought to cure was the apparent impotency of s 8(2) CPC (now s 7(2)) on account of the word `notwithstanding` in s 10. If `notwithstanding` had remained as the opening word to s 10 (now s 9), the effect would be that s 10 would always take precedence, regardless of any application to invoke the `special` jurisdiction created by s 8(2) (now s 7(2)). Parliament went about this task by replacing the word `notwithstanding` in s 10 (now s 9) with the original words `subject to the provisions of this Code`.
With respect, the italicized portions of the Minister`s speech should be regarded with care. There was no actual intention to make s 8 (now s 7) `prevail` over s 10 (now s 9) in every sense. If that were the case, s 10 (now s 9) would be surplusage. Rather, Parliament clearly intended that s 10 would still continue to provide a basis for jurisdiction. This was why the only amendment required was to discard the word `notwithstanding` and revert to the original words, `subject to ...`. The sections would therefore complement each other; it was not as if s 8 would generally `override` s 10. The two tiers of jurisdiction conferred in s 8 would coexist alongside that in s 10. To maintain this harmonious construction, only the word `notwithstanding` had to replaced.
To my mind, it was clear that counsel had failed to consider the impact of the 1966 amendment to the CPC by Act 12 of 1966. If the word `notwithstanding` had remained in s 9(a), there would arguably have been some support for counsel`s arguments in this appeal. Indeed, counsel`s submissions appeared to have been premised on the assumption that `notwithstanding` remains as the opening words to s 9(a), when this is clearly no longer the case. It is not otherwise possible to justify s 9(a) having primacy in the sense suggested by counsel.
Finally, what may be significant as well is the choice of the word `shall` in s 7(1), as opposed to `may` in s 9(a). This is an indication of Parliament`s intention that the jurisdiction conferred by s 7(1) is mandatory; it is not meant to be curtailed by the other provisions of the Code. On the other hand, s 9(a) is an enabling or permissive section (see 
 Richard Kwan 
, where similar reasoning was adopted). Enabling or permissive sections should not generally be read in a manner as to curtail the effect of general sections which have been expressed in `mandatory` terms. In the circumstances, counsel`s submission that the specific provisions in Sch A should override the general provision in s 7(1) was not tenable, unless the word `notwithstanding` had remained as the opening word to s 9(a).
Counsel further submitted that the courts should not speculate on legislative intent. Schedule A clearly contains no indication that the 24 offences which are punishable with a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years should be triable in the district courts. Counsel argued that the nature of these offences which apparently should only be triable in the High Court has to be considered. They are all grave offences which should not be triable by a district court.
I considered the fact that four offences punishable with life imprisonment (ss 326, 388, 389 and 409 Penal Code) have all along been triable in the district courts. There are three other sections (ss 392, 394 and 457 Penal Code) for which the maximum punishment exceeds a term of ten years` imprisonment. Yet two of these three offences (ss 392 and 457) have similarly always been triable in the district courts. Section 394 was made triable in the district courts in 1984 by Act 24 of 1984, only after the original prescribed punishment of life imprisonment was amended to one with a maximum term of 20 years. It cannot be that these are not grave offences as well. Nevertheless, Parliament deemed it fit to make them triable in the district courts. Consequently, counsel`s suggestion that the offences `retained` for the High Court by Sch A were all somehow more `serious` or `grave` was not persuasive.
In the light of the foregoing, I was persuaded to adopt the approach towards interpretation suggested by the prosecution. It was logically sound and entirely consonant with the legislative intent of enacting the 1986 amendments to s 7. If s 9(a) takes precedence in any event, the 1986 amendments to s 7 would have been an exercise in futility, in the absence of any corresponding amendment to Sch A. Undoubtedly, a more comprehensive range of amendments to the CPC in 1986 would have easily resolved the present ambiguity. The fact that Sch A was not amended, however, does not mean that this was an expression of Parliament`s intention to maintain the jurisdictional status quo. With a view to giving effect to the 1986 amendments to the CPC, I ruled that the district court had jurisdiction to try the offences in DAC 11132/93 and DAC 2869/94.
Following from this ruling, there could not have been any misjoinder as all five charges were properly within the trial judge`s jurisdiction. Consequently, there was no bar to the trial judge exercising his power to amend the charge in respect of DAC 2869/94. The appellant originally contended that the amended charge was not read to him, contrary to what s 163 CPC requires, but this contention was abandoned on appeal. I noted that the district judge did state in his grounds of decision that the amended charge was read to the appellant. In any event, if indeed the amended charge had not been read to the appellant, there was no failure of justice occasioned as the appellant was clearly aware of the original charge against him. As stated in s 396 CPC, the omission should not vitiate the proceedings nor be a ground for reversing the judge`s decision.
 DAC 11132/93 - Whether s 195 specifies that the offence must be punishable with a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of seven years extending to life imprisonment
The appellant contended that only offences which carry punishment of imprisonment for life or a term of seven years or upwards can properly be framed under s 195 of the Penal Code, and thus armed robbery offences do not fall within this category. The appellant thus equated the words `punishable with ... imprisonment for a term of seven years or upwards` in s 195 with a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years.
With respect, the appellant`s stand misapprehends the effect of the words `punishable with ... imprisonment for a term of seven years or upwards`. These words do not impute that the offence must be one specifying a mandatory minimum punishment of seven years` imprisonment. What is envisaged is that the offence involved should be one carrying punishment for a term which may extend to seven years. The offence of armed robbery under s 392 carries a maximum term of ten years` imprisonment and clearly would fall within the category of cases covered under s 195.
I am conscious that the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in goes against this view, which was the view I had expressed in that selfsame criminal reference. Nevertheless, the matter has since been reconsidered by a specially-constituted court of five judges in Crim Ref 1/95 in (judgment reserved) [
 editor`s note 
: now reported in 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 505
 ]. I intimated to counsel during the appeal that no purpose would be served in relying on the majority decision in 
 Fo Son Hing 
`s case4, as I was not minded to depart from my view in that case.
In the present case, it was pertinent to examine the illustration to s 195, which cites the example of gang robbery as the offence in respect of which false evidence was given by the accused. The illustration clarifies that in such a case the accused may be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years or to life imprisonment. The reference to these terms of imprisonment reflect those set out in s 400 of the Penal Code (habitual gang robbers) instead of s 395 (committing gang robbery). Nevertheless, the illustration suggests that the accused may properly be charged under s 195 even though there is no mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment within s 400, but a choice between life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years (with mandatory caning). Even if the relevant punishment section for gang robbery is taken to be s 395, the mandatory minimum imprisonment term specified is five years and not seven years. As such, to adopt the appellant`s interpretation requiring a `mandatory minimum` of seven years would mean that the illustration to s 195 would be completely out of place. The ambiguity in the present case may be easily resolved as the illustration to s 195 provides clear guidance as to the scope and intent of the section.
 On the district judge`s findings
 
 
 
 (1) On the fabrication of evidence charge in DAC 11132/93; the criminal breach of trust charge in DAC 11133/93 and the false information charge in DAC 4022/94
 
The crux of the defence on these three charges rested on the appellant`s contention that he had been robbed at `knife-point` by Colin. This was purely a question of fact. If his allegation of armed robbery were true, all these charges could not stand. The learned district judge decided, however, that having considered all the evidence, the appellant`s version of the facts was not credible.
It cannot be gainsaid that an appellate court will be reluctant to interfere with findings of fact unless they are unsupportable on the weight of the evidence. Counsel for the appellant abided by this principle, but submitted that the district judge had erred in finding as `facts` certain matters which were really perceptions or inferences. Counsel argued that if the district judge had deigned to accept the appellant`s evidence, there could have been entirely rational and innocuous explanations for these matters.
The district judge stated in his grounds of decision that he rejected the appellant`s evidence that there had been a robbery. I saw no reason to disagree with his conclusions and I would adopt the district judge`s findings as set out above. Like the district judge, I found it difficult to believe that Colin would have had the audacity to rob the appellant in his own office in broad daylight in the presence of his two secretaries. It was even more difficult to believe that the appellant was reduced to a state of abject helplessness by Colin`s alleged threat with a plastic letter-opener. It was amazing that he managed to spell Colin`s name (Arumugam a/l Kujambu) correctly for the cheque in question even in his state of alleged duress. Yet in P69, his police report, as well as the cheque butt for the $38,000 cheque in question, the appellant spelt Colin`s name wrongly as `Kunjumbu` instead of `Kujambu`. Counsel for the appellant contended that the district judge had placed undue emphasis on this particular aspect of the evidence.
The fact that the appellant managed to spell Colin`s name correctly supported Colin`s story that the appellant did ask for his identity card. From my perusal of the exhibits tendered by the prosecution and the defence, it appeared that Colin`s name was often misspelt by the appellant in various ways. For instance, in exh D4, a writ of summons issued by the appellant against Colin in September 1993 (MC Suit 12003/1993), Colin`s name was spelt as `Kunjambu`. In exh D11, Yogen and Partners` letter to M/s William Lai & Alan Wong dated 10 March 1992, his name is spelt as `Kunjumbo`. The most likely inference was that the appellant was never quite sure how Colin`s name was actually spelt. It could not be purely coincidental that he somehow managed to get it right while he was preparing a cheque under duress.
The prosecution`s case was corroborated by Rose Mary`s evidence. Rose Mary was seated barely one metre away from the appellant when the robbery allegedly occurred. She testified that she would have been able to hear any communications between Colin and the appellant. She did not hear any verbal threats nor did she have any reason to feel frightened. She did not see Colin threaten the appellant with a letter-opener. She said that Colin walked out of the office and the appellant himself remained seated at his table after Colin`s visit for a good ten minutes before leaving the office.
Even allowing that her attentions were focused on her work at the computer and her view of the appellant was blocked, it was unlikely that she would have been completely oblivious to any conversation or anything unusual that might have taken place in the office. It was, after all, a very small office (sketch plan P74 drawn by Insp Rajagopal). She did hear Colin say `hurry up` and the district judge observed that, if she had wanted to be completely uncooperative to the defence, she could have denied hearing this.
Counsel for the appellant emphasized that there was a material inconsistency in Rose Mary`s evidence in relation to whether the appellant had asked Diana Lethijia to call up the bank to stop payment on the cheque. I did not think that there was any material inconsistency. The difference in testimony arose in the context of Rose Mary having been recalled to clarify her earlier evidence. It was not unforeseeable that her testimony might not have been consistent since the whole purpose of recalling her was to clarify her earlier testimony. The district judge found Rose Mary`s evidence reliable, being impressed that she was `an honest person who was not hiding the true facts.` I was not disposed to interfere with the district judge`s acceptance that she was a witness of truth.
The district judge also found that the behaviour of Colin and the appellant before, during and after the alleged robbery was quite inconsistent with the allegation that the appellant had been robbed at `knife-point`. In particular, I noted that the appellant`s own evidence was that he just sat in his chair for `hardly five minutes`. He did not call the police immediately. When he went to Colin`s office, according to Chung, he spoke in a friendly manner at first. Hani Suradi also testified that the atmosphere was not confrontational; the appellant and Colin `seemed to be pondering, thinking`.
A particularly important consideration was the fact that the appellant had never mentioned any robbery until he lodged his police report (P69) and statement (P68) on 30 March 1992. From the report recorded by Lee Kek Lan at the Police Radio Division on 27 March 1992, the appellant was reported as having complained: `one of my clients took my money and did not want to return me.`
Various persons whom the appellant spoke to after the scuffle in Colin`s office also testified that the appellant had simply mentioned that Colin had taken the $38,000 from him without alleging that he had been robbed. Cpl Suresh Kumar gave evidence that the appellant had told him a completely different story when they spoke outside Colin`s office - that Colin was the appellant`s housing agent who had refused to return him a sum of $38,000 which he had paid for a house. On this basis, Cpl Suresh was of the view that the appellant could take civil action against Colin. When Samydorai Jeyapal met the appellant later in the evening of 27 March 1992, the appellant told Samydorai that he had asked Colin to do him a favour by encashing a cheque for $38,000 but Colin `played him out` and did not return with the money. The appellant did not use the word `rob`. The appellant allegedly told Veno Gopal, a lawyer, that Colin had `extracted` money from him. Veno Gopal could not recall the appellant using the word `extracted` or that any weapon had been used. Similarly, the appellant made various allegations to ASP Ng Chee Kok and DSP Peter Lim of Tanglin Police Station but the issue of a robbery was never mentioned. Not unexpectedly, Samydorai, Veno Gopal, ASP Ng and DSP Lim all testified that they were surprised to find out from the article in 
 The New Paper 
 on 1 April 1992 that the appellant had been robbed by his client. All this cast grave doubts as to the bona fides of the appellant`s version of the facts and suggested strongly that no robbery had taken place at all.
If the appellant had indeed been robbed, it was difficult to comprehend why he should have chosen to camouflage this fact in various ways. The appellant explained that he did not want to say that there had been a robbery as he was concerned primarily with recovering the $38,000. He initially did not want to make a police report and he was concerned for Colin`s family and for his firm`s reputation. He did not mention the letter-opener as he did not want the matter to be `blown open`. The district judge did not accept these explanations, and rightly so. After all, it was the appellant who had called up Yaw Yan Chong of 
 The New Paper 
 on his own volition on 31 March 1992 to tell him about the robbery, even though he maintained that he was `not seeking publicity` in doing so. This assertion was completely unbelievable. In his evidence-in-chief, he said that he wanted to `expose what was happening`. He claimed that there was nothing personal in his act of informing Yaw Yan Chong about the incident. When asked to clarify by the court, he claimed that there was `no particular reason` why he did it. He claimed that once he had made up his mind to make a police report, he was prepared for anything, including publicity on the case.
It was evident that the appellant had in fact already made up his mind to involve the police in the case as early as 27 March 1992 itself, when he took the initiative to call the police while in Colin`s office. He must have realized, as evidenced by what he allegedly told Samydorai on 27 March 1992, that the police would not be taking any action and would in all probability classify the matter as a `civil case`. The appellant was clearly trying various means of getting the police to prevail on Colin to return the money. As the district judge observed, there was scarcely any concern for Colin`s family, or his firm`s reputation, when he eventually decided to allege that he had been robbed by Colin, not merely in his statement to Insp Rajagopal, but also by disclosure to Yaw Yan Chong of 
 The New Paper. 
Diana Lethijia claimed to be an eyewitness to the entire robbery, and gave evidence which was diametrically opposed to that given by Rose Mary. She also said that the appellant had asked her to call the bank to stop payment. After what she claimed was a traumatic experience of having witnessed the robbery, she carried on with her work as if nothing had happened. She did not see any necessity to call the police. She did not go over to the appellant to find out what had happened and she was not curious to find out what it was all about. Apparently she did not even speak to Rose Mary as well. Instead she called Rose Mary after she had left the office at 4pm to ask her what had happened, whereupon Rose Mary told her that the appellant had given her permission to go home. It was indeed difficult to reconcile Diana`s strangely unreal level of dissociation with her later enquiry with Rose Mary as to what had happened. The district judge found, quite justifiably, that Diana`s account of the incident and her response, or rather, the lack of it, seemed inconsistent with the conduct of a person who had just witnessed a robbery within her own office.
I should point out, however, that one of the aspects of Diana`s evidence which the district judge found `disturbing` may have been innocuous after all. Diana had claimed to be ignorant about which account the $38,000 cheque was issued from and whether it was a cashier`s cheque. There was also no evidence that the appellant had asked her to call any particular bank to stop payment on the cheque. From this, the district judge found it suspicious that she should have called up the River Valley Branch of UOB as if by coincidence. From my perusal of Diana`s evidence, she had in fact testified earlier in cross-examination that all the firm`s banking was done at OUB River Valley. The cheque was presented at OUB, and not UOB. There was a possibility that there was some confusion about the bank`s initials, but from the evidence, it was reasonably clear that Diana would know which bank and branch to call.
Nevertheless, Diana`s evidence contradicted the appellant`s evidence in some material areas. The district judge rightly noted that there was a discrepancy in the evidence about the appellant`s instructions to stop payment on the cheque. Furthermore, Diana claimed that the appellant and Colin had been speaking with their voices raised and what they were saying would be quite loud. The appellant, on the other hand, claimed that Colin`s tone of voice was not loud, but `deep ... enough to convey what he wanted.` In all the circumstances, the district judge was entitled to conclude that her evidence was unworthy of belief.
The appellant had always been willing to lend money to Colin and had even settled some of Colin`s debts. There was no compelling reason why Colin needed to resort to such desperate and drastic measures to procure $38,000. If Colin had robbed the appellant, it was implausible that he should have asked for a cheque and that he should have asked for a specific, and perhaps modest, amount of $38,000. No adequate explanation was given in relation to why the $38,000 had to be drawn from the firm`s client`s account. Furthermore, the cheque was prepared as an uncrossed `bearer` cheque, and it would have made no difference at all whether Colin`s name was written on the cheque.
The arrangement to encash the cheque, as explained by Colin, was conceived by the appellant to legitimize the latter`s scheme to obtain the $38,000. Colin, as seller of #11-376, would be used to withdraw the money first. The appellant would then borrow the money for his own purposes. As the district judge found, there had been no robbery and the appellant had dealt with the $38,000 which had been disbursed to him as stakeholder for Mdm Nemah`s intending purchase of #11-376. At the material time, the due date for exercising the option had expired and the money was no longer Mdm Nemah`s but was to be returned to Keppel Bank. The crucial point was that the appellant was supposed to have held on to the money and he was never legally entitled to it at any point in time.
From the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied with the finding that no robbery had taken place. The district judge had accepted Colin`s evidence of the arrangement for him to encash the cheque and `return` the money to the appellant. By this arrangement, the appellant had evinced a clear dishonest intention to treat the $38,000 as his own, when he was supposed to have retained it as stakeholder. In the premises, I upheld the appellant`s convictions on all three charges, DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94.
 (b) On the criminal intimidation charge in DAC 2868/94
On appeal, the only issue which arose related to whether the offence of criminal intimidation had been proved when the prosecution had not shown that the threat did cause alarm to Colin. The district judge accepted Colin`s testimony that the appellant had made the threatening telephone call. The district judge stated that in any case he accepted the evidence of Colin, supported by Premkumar and Rita Kurup, that at the material time Colin was put in fear of the appellant as a consequence of the threat.
Counsel contended, however, that the evidence indicated that Colin was not actually intimidated, and that this showed that, in all probability, the alleged telephone call had never been made. Counsel pointed out the undisputed fact that the appellant and Colin had had several meetings after the incident. Moreover, the district judge had erred in citing as corroborative evidence the testimony of persons such as Premkumar and Rita Kurup, whom the appellant had spoken to about the alleged threat.
Given the facts of the case, the prosecution would have acted in vain in attempting to find genuine corroborative evidence. The threat was allegedly made in the course of a telephone call to Colin. Apart from the appellant, or anyone who might have chanced to hear him when the threat was uttered, no one else would have been in a position to give direct evidence as to the fact that the threat was made. In such cases, the pivotal question was who the court believed was telling the truth.
The learned district judge ruled that the effect of the threat did not have to be considered in a charge of criminal intimidation, relying on the brief facts of which have been set out earlier. In Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s 
 Law of Crimes 
 (23rd Ed) Vol 2, at p 2026, the following observations on s 506 of the Penal Code are pertinent: 
 
The question whether the threat amounts to a criminal intimidation or not does not depend on the nerves of the individual threatened; if it is such a threat as may overcome the ordinary free will of a firm man, or whatever the nature of the threat, if it is made with the intention mentioned in the section, it is an offence.
 
 
 
Whether as a matter of fact one was actually frightened or not, cannot affect the question of the liability of the speaker under this section ... . It is the intention of the speaker that has to be considered in deciding as to whether what he stated comes within the mischief of this section.
And, at p 2027: 
 
This section says nothing about the capacity of the person making the threat to carry it into execution. Nor does the section say anything about the effect upon the person threatened ... ( (1923) 24 Cr LJ 396/27 CWN 479).
 
 
 
With respect, the statement of Ong J in which was approved by the trial judge may perhaps have been too sweeping in its terms and effect. Taken to its logical conclusion, a charge of criminal intimidation could succeed even if the person making the threat is obviously in no position to carry it out. Such was the scenario before the court in . The accused was an old and sick man aged 74 years. While talking to four or five persons in his house, he threatened to kill and bury the complainant. The evidence disclosed that none of the persons present actually got alarmed, and it was held that the accused had not committed criminal intimidation. Perhaps this case may be seen as an application of the de minimis principle to the offence of criminal intimidation.
Section 503 of Penal Code, which defines criminal intimidation, does not contain any reference to the actual effect of the threat on the victim, nor to the capacity of the maker to carry out the threat. The essential considerations are the intention of the maker and the nature of the threat. It suffices that the maker intends to cause alarm but it must also be relevant to consider the fact that an accused is clearly incapable of carrying out the threat. Where there is such evidence, the approach in 
 Jogendra Kumar 
 accords with good sense and reason. In line with this reasoning, the Indian case of suggests that the complainant must feel as a reasonable man that the accused was going to convert his words into action. In considering whether the offence of criminal intimidation has been established, it should be shown that the victim had some objective basis to apprehend alarm, even if he was never actually alarmed. The threat must be sufficient to overcome the ordinary free will of a firm man. It may be inappropriate to adopt Ong J`s dicta in 
 Lee Yoke Choong 
 without this qualification, as a purely literal approach might engender absurd conclusions.
In the present case, what the prosecution had to establish was that on 28 March 1992 the threats were uttered by the appellant with the intent to cause alarm. The prosecution went further to show that Colin was in fact alarmed by the threat. This was not a required element of the charge but such evidence did fortify it to a significant extent.
I found no reason to disturb the district judge`s findings. The appellant had threatened to kill Colin. There was some objectively reasonable basis for Colin to be alarmed; there was no indication that the appellant`s threat was merely empty talk. I found no merit in counsel`s submissions on appeal and accordingly I upheld the appellant`s conviction on this charge.
 (c) On the fabrication of evidence charge in DAC 2869/94
The main argument advanced by counsel for the appellant in respect of this charge was that the appellant had merely acted in accordance with Insp Rajagopal`s instructions. The appellant maintained that he did not know that Colin`s MBB account had been closed. Counsel contended that even if the appellant had known that the account was closed, he was still entitled to present the cheques for payment, and indeed he had to do so before he could commence any civil action on the cheques.
The district judge found that the appellant had known that Colin was in dire financial difficulties and thus he must have consciously refrained from presenting the first four cheques for payment. No plausible explanation was offered as to why the first four cheques had not been banked in on the dates they became due, or at any reasonable time thereafter. I noted that these cheques were dated 15 December 1991, 11 January 1992, 10 February 1992 and 24 February 1992. I was drawn to the irresistible conclusion that the appellant knew that Colin`s account with MBB was closed at the material time or alternatively, that the cheques would be dishonoured on account of Colin`s desperate financial situation.
The intention of the accused is paramount in s 195 cases ()
 . 
 In my view, the consideration that Insp Rajagopal had advised him to present the cheques for payment was immaterial. It was a non sequitur to assert that this absolved the appellant from any responsibility for his actions. It was always open to the appellant to take steps to prosecute a civil claim against Colin without bringing the matter to the attention of Insp Rajagopal. Instead, the appellant chose to inform Insp Rajagopal about the cheques. Having done so, he proceeded to present the cheques for payment, in spite of his knowledge that the MBB account was closed. By his conduct, the appellant had caused to come into existence the circumstance that Colin was a fraudulent debtor. This was the essence of the charge against him.
The appellant eventually did proceed to commence civil proceedings on the five cheques in MC 12003/93. The writ of summons was only filed, however, on 3 September 1993. The police report made by Insp Rajagopal on his behalf had been lodged on 5 May 1992, after the appellant had been advised to bank in the cheques, which he did on 31 March 1992. In my opinion, the course of action adopted by the appellant was clearly calculated and deliberate. He was obviously less interested in the money when he banked in the cheques than in causing Insp Rajagopal to take action against Colin as a fraudulent debtor. Otherwise, there would have been no necessity for him to wait one and a half years before commencing civil proceedings against Colin. It was also pertinent to note that the civil suit against Colin was filed on 3 September 1993, within a week of Colin being granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on the robbery charge on 10 September 1993.
In the circumstances, I had no difficulty concurring with the district judge. The appellant`s intentions were clear. He had informed Insp Rajagopal about the cheques and banked in the cheques in order that police investigations might commence and that Colin might eventually be convicted of an offence under s 27(a) of the Debtors Act. I upheld the appellant`s conviction on the charge as amended by the district judge.
 Sentence
Conviction under DAC 11132/93 carried the mandatory minimum sentence of 12 strokes of the cane. There was little doubt that the conviction would almost inevitably spell the end of the appellant`s career as an advocate and solicitor. In addressing the question of sentence, the district judge noted: 
 
What is aggravating in this case is the fact that the accused is an advocate and solicitor. It is not unreasonable for society to expect a high standard of impeccable conduct from those who practise law as a profession. The accused, instead of upholding the law, has flouted it and has tarnished the good name of the legal profession.
 
 
 
He ordered the imprisonments in DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94 to run concurrently, but consecutively to the imprisonment terms in DAC 2868/94 and DAC 2869/94. The appellant would thus have to serve five years` imprisonment as well as undergo the mandatory minimum punishment of 12 strokes of the cane.
On appeal, the main points raised in mitigation by the appellant were that he was a senior member of the bar and that he was in poor physical health, suffering from ailments such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as having recently undergone surgery on a knee for the replacement of the kneecap. As far as I was aware, there has been no known case in which an advocate and solicitor has been sentenced to undergo the punishment of caning. Counsel for the appellant argued that the sentences were manifestly excessive. In particular, he urged this court to consider setting aside the sentence of caning, in view of the appellant`s deteriorating health. Counsel was, however, unable to produce any authorities which stated that the court had the power to set aside a mandatory sentence of caning. On my understanding of the relevant statutory provisions (ss 232 and 233 CPC), no such power is conferred on the court. Section 232 CPC states: 
 
(1) The punishment of caning shall not be inflicted unless a medical officer is present and certifies that the offender is in a fit state of health to undergo such punishment.
(2) If during the execution of a sentence of caning a medical officer certifies that the offender is not in a fit state of health to undergo the remainder of the sentence the caning shall be finally stopped.
 
 
 
Only a medical officer may determine the fitness of an offender to undergo the punishment of caning. The courts are not empowered to dispense with a mandatory sentence of caning. Under s 233 CPC, if the sentence of caning cannot be carried out either wholly or partially; 
 
... the offender shall be kept in custody till the court which passed the sentence can revise it, and that court may at its discretion either remit the sentence, or sentence the offender instead of caning, or instead of so much of the sentence of caning as was not executed, to imprisonment for any term which may extend to 12 months, which may be in addition to any other punishment to which he has been sentenced for the same offence.
 
 
 
Counsel conceded that these provisions were clear, but nonetheless submitted that, in the event the medical officer certifies that the appellant is unfit to undergo caning, the court may consider imposing a sentence of imprisonment which runs concurrently to the existing term. I informed counsel during the appeal that such a submission was premature and inappropriate.
I should mention that I was not disposed to adopt the approach of Abdul Hamid J in . It is questionable why the court `cannot ignore the fact that (the accused) will face disciplinary proceedings and the high probability that he will be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors.` It is insufficient to say that the complainant or Mdm Nemah may be at liberty to institute civil proceedings to recover the sum misappropriated or damages suffered. Abdul Hamid J`s decision has in fact not been followed in Malaysia (see the decision of NH Chan J in 6).
The appellant was not a victim of circumstance as he had brought his predicament upon himself. I found some guidance in the following observations of Chan Sek KEONG J [as he then was] in (at p 325):
Lawyers trade on their honesty. They sell their trustworthiness. Accordingly, one of the gravest offences an advocate and solicitor can commit is to take his clients` money. Criminal breach of trust by a lawyer in the discharge of his professional duty must inevitably call for a custodial sentence of a deterrent nature, not so much as to deter the offender concerned but to deter other members of the profession from committing similar offences.
In the present case, criminal breach of trust was but one of five offences committed by the appellant, all of which were by no means trifling or inconsequential in nature. There was little basis for a lenient sentence to be passed. The public interest element in sentencing should prevail and a deterrent custodial sentence was clearly warranted.
I was minded only to consider that the sentence of one year`s imprisonment in respect of DAC 2868/94 (the criminal intimidation charge) was manifestly excessive, taking into account the fact that the threat was one which was uttered over the telephone. This consideration, coupled with the fact that the appellant evidently had time to take measures for his own protection, such as notifying the police, were factors which I considered to be relevant in diminishing the gravity of the offence. Nonetheless, a threat to kill someone which is made in all seriousness is not something to be taken lightly. In the premises, I considered that the appropriate sentence in respect of this charge would be a term of six months` imprisonment. I accordingly reduced the sentence.
I did not see any reason to interfere with the other sentences imposed by the district judge. The sentences of imprisonment in respect of DAC 11132/93, DAC 11133/93 and DAC 4022/94 will run concurrently but consecutively to the imprisonment terms in DAC 2868/94 and DAC 2869/94. The appellant was therefore ordered to serve a total of four and a half years` imprisonment and to undergo the mandatory minimum punishment of 12 strokes of the cane.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against a decision of the district judge consenting to the composition of an offence under s 199 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC).
The respondent was charged with one count of voluntarily causing hurt to one Leow Chwee Eng (the victim), contrary to s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (PC). This occurred at 8pm on 30 January 1994 at the void deck of Blk 304 Hougang Ave 5. The victim informed the court that he was prepared to compound the offence on certain terms. The respondent, through his counsel, offered a sum of $500 and an apology to him in court. This was accepted by the victim. The DPP, who was conducting the prosecution, objected to the composition. However, the district judge gave his consent to the composition and the respondent was accordingly acquitted under s 199 of the CPC. The Public Prosecutor appealed.
The crux of the Public Prosecutor`s argument was that under art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, only the Attorney General (who is also the Public Prosecutor by virtue of s 336 of the CPC) has the power to discontinue or terminate criminal proceedings. As s 199 of the CPC also provides that the criminal proceedings may be discontinued by an act of composition of the offence by the aggrieved party, which has the effect of an acquittal of the accused person, thereby resulting in a termination of the proceedings, s 199 is ultra vires the Constitution. It was contended that this will be so unless s 199 is construed in accordance with art 162 of the Constitution. The construction suggested by the Public Prosecutor was that s 199 only applies in cases where the prosecution is brought about by way of a private prosecution.
An alternative submission of the Public Prosecutor was that the district judge did not properly exercise his discretion. This is basically an appeal against the district judge`s exercise of his discretion.
I shall deal with each submission in turn.
 Article 35(8) of the Constitution
The relevant provisions of the Constitution are as follows. Article 4 of the Constitution states: 
 
This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.
 
 
 
Article 35(8) states: 
 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
Article 162 states: 
 
Subject to this Article, all existing laws shall continue in force on and after the commencement of this Constitution and all laws which have not been brought into force by the date of the commencement of this Constitution may, subject as aforesaid, be brought into force on or after its commencement, but all such laws shall, subject to this Article, be construed as from the commencement of this Constitution with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with this Constitution.
 
 
 
Reference should also be made to art 93 of the Constitution. This states: 
 
The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
The relevant provisions of the CPC are as follows. Section 199 provides that: 
 
(1) The offences punishable under the Penal Code shown in the sixth column of Schedule A as being compoundable may be compounded by the person mentioned in that column provided that when an arrest has been effected or an application has been made for the issue of a warrant of arrest or summons the consent of a Magistrate or, if the offence is not triable by a Magistrate`s Court, of a District Judge, shall first be obtained.
(2) ... 
(3) When the person who would otherwise be competent to compound an offence under this section is a minor, an idiot or a lunatic, any person competent to contract on his behalf may compound the offence. 
(4) The composition of an offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused.
 
 
 
An offence under s 323 of the PC is compoundable by the person hurt.
Section 336 of the CPC states: 
 
(1) The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
... 
(3) Subject to this section, the Attorney-General may appoint any officers or persons to assist him or to act as his deputies in the performance of any of the functions or duties of the Public Prosecutor under this Code or under any written law and may assign to them their functions and duties. 
... 
(7) Every prosecution for a seizable offence before a District Court and every inquiry before a Magistrate`s Court shall be conducted by the Public Prosecutor or by the Solicitor-General or by a deputy appointed under subsection (3), or by an advocate, officer or other person generally or specially authorised by the Public Prosecutor or by the Solicitor-General or by a deputy appointed under subsection (3) in that behalf. 
(8) Nothing in this section shall be held to preclude private persons or any officer of any Government department from appearing in person or by advocate to prosecute in summary cases before a Magistrate`s Court or in summary non-seizable cases before a District Court.
 
 
 
An offence under s 323 of the PC is a non-seizable offence, hence a private prosecution may be brought.
According to the appellant, to `discontinue` means also to `terminate`. Reliance was placed on the definition in 
 Longman`s Dictionary of English Usage 
. It should be noted that this actually states: 
 
 
 discontinue
...
 vt
...
 2
 to abandon or terminate by a legal discontinuance - 
 vi
 to come to an end ... .
 
 
 
The 
 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 
 however, defines the word as follows: 
 
 
 1
 
 trans
To cause to cease; to cease from (an action); to break off, put a stop to, give up 1479 ... 3
 Law
 a
To dismiss or abandon (a suit, etc) 1487 ... 
 4
To interrupt, disrupt, sunder - 1751. 
 5
 intr
To cease to continue; to stop 1555; to cease to reside - 1677. 
 6
To become disrupted 1626.
 
 
 
The Public Prosecutor submitted that the words and provisions of art 35(8) should be construed broadly and `with less rigidity and more generously than other Acts`. A number of authorities were cited for this proposition, but it is unnecessary to refer to them here.
In my view, no matter how broadly the word `discontinue` in art 35(8) is construed, it cannot possibly bear the meaning suggested by the Public Prosecutor. This is because, if art 35(8) is to be of any assistance to the appellant, it must mean that the Attorney General, and hence the Public Prosecutor, has the 
 sole 
 discretion to terminate proceedings. Otherwise, the mere fact that the Attorney General has `the power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence` does not get the appellant very far.
A termination of a criminal proceeding may result from a number of circumstances. It may result from the prosecution voluntarily withdrawing the prosecution. It may result from a conviction or an acquittal. In the case of a conviction, it may result from a guilty plea or from judgment after the end of a trial. In the case of an acquittal, it may result from the prosecution not offering a case, from the judge finding that a prima facie case had not been made out, from the judge deciding at the end of the case that the offence had not been proved, or from the judge consenting to a composition. It can hardly be argued that every such termination of a criminal proceeding falls within the ambit of art 35(8). If that is the case, the absurd result would be that only the Attorney General and Public Prosecutor can acquit or convict an accused.
It is not disputed that in certain circumstances an aggrieved person may commence a private prosecution for certain offences without the consent of the Attorney General. Thus, it is uncontroversial that the Attorney General does not have the sole discretion to institute or conduct criminal proceedings. So, the question is whether there is anything so special about discontinuing an action that only the Attorney General or Public Prosecutor may do so.
It is clear from s 336(1) of the CPC that, whether in a public or a private prosecution, the Public Prosecutor shall have control and direction of the criminal prosecution. There can be little doubt that even in the case of a private prosecution, if the Public Prosecutor is not satisfied with the conduct of the prosecution, he may intervene and take over the prosecution. This was so even before the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1900 and before the Constitution came into effect. It can be seen from the case of . There, an intervention by the Attorney General to enter a 
 nolle prosequi 
 in a private prosecution, against the wishes of the private prosecutor, was upheld. This was a decision from Penang, which was then part of the Straits Settlements. Thus, any distinction drawn on this ground between private prosecutions and prosecutions conducted by the Public Prosecutor is untenable and illusory.
I am of the view therefore that art 35(8) only applies to voluntary termination of criminal proceedings on the part of the Attorney General and Public Prosecutor. Hence, if the Public Prosecutor, for whatever reason, decides not to proceed with a case, nobody can complain about it. This is reflected in ss 184 and 193 of the CPC. It is also reflected in s 336 of the CPC. However, if the proceedings had been terminated under ss 180(f) or s 189 of the CPC as a result of the judge finding that a prima facie case has not been made out, then the Public Prosecutor cannot complain otherwise than by way of an appeal. It can hardly be said that such a termination of the action impinges on the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. Similarly, it cannot possibly be argued that a decision on the part of the examining magistrate in a preliminary inquiry to discharge an accused under s 142 or s 145 of the CPC, because he considers the charge to be groundless, impinges on the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. That would result in the manifest absurdity that preliminary inquiries are otiose. Whatever the scope of the Public Prosecutor`s discretion under art 35(8) is, it does not extend to the situation where criminal proceedings are terminated as a result of a judicial decision.
Article 93 of the Constitution must always be borne in mind. This unequivocally vests the judicial powers of the State in the courts. Thus, where a judicial decision is involved, there is simply no question of the Public Prosecutor`s discretion being fettered.
In , the magistrate discharged the accused at the end of the preliminary inquiry. The Public Prosecutor was dissatisfied and called for the proceedings to be transmitted to him under s 385 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Federated Malay States), which is in pari materia with s 348 of the CPC. The Public Prosecutor then in purported exercise of his power under s 386, which is in pari materia with s 349 of the CPC, ordered the magistrate to reopen the preliminary inquiry and to conclude it by committing the accused for trial before the High Court. The accused was arrested and brought before the magistrate. The proceedings were adjourned and the matter was brought before the High Court. The judge ordered the magistrate not to proceed in accordance with the Public Prosecutor`s order. On a criminal reference to the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya, the judge`s decision was upheld. The Court of Appeal held that, whatever the scope of s 386 was, it did not include ordering the magistrate to reopen the case. At p 178, Matthew CJ held: 
 
It is not for us to say what instructions may properly be given on a preliminary enquiry that has been concluded by the discharge of an accused person. Had it been the intention of the legislature to give the Public Prosecutor the power to direct a Magistrate to reverse his order of discharge and commit the accused for trial, this power would have been expressed in plain and clear language. Why, indeed, should the Public Prosecutor be given this unusual power, when he has the appropriate remedy in that he can order the holding of another preliminary enquiry before another Magistrate?
 
 
 
We have no doubt that the order made by the Public Prosecutor in this case was ultra vires the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appeal against the decision to discharge is dismissed.
This case shows that, whatever the ambit of his discretion is, the Public Prosecutor cannot use it to substitute a judicial decision made by the court with his own views on the matter.
I am therefore of the view that this appeal does not in fact raise a constitutional point. Article 35(8) of the Constitution is already reflected in s 336 of the CPC which merely reflects the old common law position. In any prosecution, be it private or otherwise, the Public Prosecutor (or the Attorney General) has supervisory powers over its conduct. The question in the present case therefore involves only the interpretation of s 199. In answering this, it is necessary to go back to first principles. Reference to a number of old cases is necessary.
 The nature of a composition
The first question that needs to be answered is: what is a composition? In , Crump J gave the following explanation at p 167: 
 
... A composition is an arrangement or settlement of differences between the injured party and the person against whom the complaint is made, and it may well happen that where there is more than one such person, a satisfactory settlement may be possible with one of them and may not be arrived at with another.
 
 
 
Thus, a composition is an arrangement between the person injured and the accused. Under the common law, such an arrangement was illegal in respect of a felony, and might be punishable as misprision. In some circumstances, such as in cases of theft, entering into such an arrangement might constitute the more serious offence of theftbote, which itself was a felony. The authorities for these propositions may be found in Coke`s , but it is unnecessary to refer to them here. In the case of misdemeanours, there appeared to be a distinction between public and private misdemeanours. A public misdemeanour was not compoundable. Thus, in , a contract to withdraw a prosecution for assault and riot was held to be void, notwithstanding the assent of the judge before whom the prosecution was brought. It appears that a private misdemeanour could be compounded, as was held in . However, it was suggested in that this could be done only in respect of the private rights, for example for damages, of the victim. Furthermore, it was suggested that there should be a conviction first, so that `the rights of the public are also preserved inviolate`, as was said by Tindal CJ at p 394. This, however, was not consistent with Leach VC`s decision in , because the conviction secured was only against one Bird, when the indictment was also against the servants of Bird as well. Tindal CJ was, however, prepared to concede that it would be permissible for the victim to undertake not to prosecute on behalf of the public in cases of assault.
In India and the Straits Settlements the position was different. Composition of certain offences between the accused and the party given the power to compound was allowed by the legislature. Invariably, the person given this power was the victim of the offence. The reason behind this legislation was stated in . At p 166, Crump J observed: 
 
The policy of the legislature is that, in the case of certain minor offences, where the interests of the public are not vitally affected, the complainant should be permitted to come to terms with the party against whom he complains ...
 
 
 
Closer to home, in , which was only reported in the journal section of the 
 Malayan Law Journal 
, Aitken J said in a case in the Federated Malay States: 
 
In this case I have, greatly daring, ventured to lay down a principle that magistrates should not withhold their consent to the compounding of an offence against s 498 of the Penal Code unless there is reason to suppose that the case in question is of an aggravated nature. According to an Enactment of the legislature the compounding of such offences is not contrary to public policy, and it is the duty of all judicial officers to give effect to the Enactments of the legislature so far as in them lies.
 
 
 
Hence, in the case of compoundable offences, there can be no question of such an arrangement or agreement being against public policy. In the recent Malaysian case of , Peh Swee Chin SCJ said at p 232: 
 
It is to be emphasized that for Malaysia and as in India it is only when the stifling of prosecution relates to non-compoundable offences as specified in our Penal Code [FMS, Cap 45], that our courts consider such agreements as void for being unlawful under s 24 of the Act. When they refer to compoundable offences or offences which are compoundable with the leave of the court, such contracts would not be void and would then be indeed encouraged by the courts as stated by the learned trial judge.
 
 
 
A perusal of the offences in the PC which are compoundable reveals that this is indeed the case. Apart from attempts and abetting, there are only 23 offences in the PC which are stated to be compoundable under the CPC. Almost all of them are minor and are largely private in nature.
Thus, in the case of compoundable offences, unless the offence is aggravated, composition is not only not against public policy, but is to be positively encouraged. However, it is clear that only the person stated to be vested with the power to compound may do so. Thus, only the victim of the offence may compound. Hence, in the case of causing hurt, only the person hurt may compound. A composition by the heir and widow of the victim is bad: . Where a man was cheated and the wife was the complainant, composition of the offence (as was allowed in India) by the wife was invalid, as only the person cheated may compound: . Where two persons were wrongfully confined, composition by only one was not good in so far as it affects the offence against the other:
 Re Khilawansingh Mansingh Dangi 
. In the case of mischief, only the owner of the property may compound, and this did not extend to the caretaker of the property in question: . Similarly, it was held in that where crops were stolen from the land of a woman, only she could compound (as provided for in India). In that case, the complainant was the son of the woman. It was held that he could not compound the offence.
It mattered not who the complainant was, as only the person who was stated to be able to compound may do so. This principle extends to the Public Prosecutor as well and, unless expressly provided, even the Public Prosecutor has no power to compound. This can be seen from the Malaysian case of 
 Re Chang Cheng Hoe & Ors 
. Such attempts at composition amount to plea bargaining and is frowned upon by the court. Ong Hock Sim J said at p 252: 
 
I was not a little surprised to find on the record words to the effect that the three defendants were agreeable to compounding the charge on certain terms as the person competent to compound the charge is not the offending party but the party injured. One of the terms was that the prosecution was not to press for a deterrent sentence. This seems to me beyond the competence of the prosecution and is an affront to the court and further displays a most unhealthy trend, if this bargaining process is being employed to determine the course of proceedings.
 
 
 
There, the terms of the composition were confirmed by the DPP, and consented to by the court. On criminal revision, the acquittal was set aside.
 Whether there is any distinction between private and public prosecutions
The cases consistently suggest that the principle that it is only the person aggrieved who may compound extends to cases which are not private prosecutions. In such cases, subject to the consent of the court, where this is required, the decision whether to compound or not lies with the person aggrieved.
In the early case of , a magistrate had refused a composition because the case was sent up by the police. He was of the view that the case may not be withdrawn (actually meaning compounded) by any private person. The accused was convicted. On a criminal reference, the conviction was quashed and an order of acquittal entered. Mitter J observed curtly in the context of composition, at p 553: 
 
... all that is necessary regarding the compounding of the offence that was under investigation is to be found in s 345 [of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code] and we do not understand the law to be that no magistrate under any circumstances had power to allow a case that is sent up by the police to be withdrawn.
 
 
 
In a more recent case, it was held in that in the case of criminal defamation of a public servant, the public servant may compound the offence notwithstanding that the complaint was made by the Public Prosecutor. It mattered not that the person aggrieved was neither a party to the proceedings nor a witness therein. At p 31, BR James J said: 
 
After all, the duty of the court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature and this intention is to be sought for primarily in the language used in the appropriate enactment; where the language expressed the intention reasonably intelligibly and plainly it has to be accepted without modification by resort to speculation or conjecture; it is not for the court to scan the wisdom or policy of the legislature.
 
 
 
Applying these principles of construction to the Code, I find nothing in the latter to suggest that the legislature ever intended that only that person would be entitled to compound an offence who was a party to the litigation or a witness therein. It is not for the court to question why the legislature chose to do so...
No doubt, the Indian Criminal Procedure Code did not appear to have a provision similar to our s 336, but this did not matter, for it was never controversial that the Attorney General had supervision over all prosecutions. The cases closer to home support this. In , a magistrate refused a composition when it was objected to by the prosecuting officer. The accused was convicted. Aitken J set aside the conviction on appeal as consent ought to have been given for the offence to be compounded. The Criminal Procedure Code of the Federated Malay States had a provision which was almost in pari materia to our s 336 in its s 376. This stated: 
 
(i) The Legal Adviser, Federated Malay States, shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 
 
 
In the early Singapore case of , a prosecution was brought by the acting superintendent of police for a charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the PC (which was the same charge as this case). The complainant (though the case referred to him as the prosecutor, it is clear that it was the acting superintendent who was prosecuting, and hence it was not a private prosecution) indicated that he was not willing to proceed as the accused had settled the matter with him. The acting superintendent pressed that the case should nevertheless go on, but the acting second magistrate discharged the accused. A second prosecution was then mounted by the acting chief inspector of police against the accused on the same facts. The accused objected on the ground that he had already been discharged for that offence, and that if the acting senior magistrate of police heard the charge, it would amount to entertaining an appeal from the decision of the acting second magistrate. The objection was upheld by the acting senior magistrate on two grounds. They were that it would be improper for him to reopen the case as the decision was made in the exercise of the acting second magistrate`s discretion and that the discharge was equivalent to an acquittal, so a subsequent prosecution could not be brought. He stated in this case: 
 
Under these circumstances, as it seemed to me a matter within the discretion of the Magistrate who hears the case to permit, or to refuse to allow the withdrawal of such a charge as the one in question, and as the acting second magistrate had in the exercise of such discretion permitted the charge against the defendant on that occasion to be withdrawn, and had discharged him, I consider that it would be improper for me to allow the same charge on the same facts to be reopened before me. It seemed also to me that the defendant having on that occasion been charged with the same offence as that with which he was charged before me and been discharged, that such discharge was equivalent to an acquittal ... .
 
 
 
The Attorney General then appealed by way of a case stated on the grounds that the proceedings in the first instance were not a trial for the purpose of s 69(1) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance 1873. This was the precursor to s 239 of the CPC. Wood ACJ dismissed the Attorney General`s appeal, saying: 
 
The proceedings before the magistrate in the first instance implied an acquittal; there could not be a second trial.
 
 
 
Thus, a composition was allowed by the court despite the prosecuting officer`s objection, and a challenge by the Attorney General was dismissed. The consent to the composition was given during a trial and the matter was res judicata.
Similarly, in , a magistrate allowed a composition despite the objections of the police prosecutor, who had been instructed by Crown Counsel to oppose the composition. However, the magistrate imposed a condition that the accused apologize to the victim in open court and that he agree to be bound over to keep the peace. On appeal, it was held by Aitken J that the accused could not be required to agree to the bond for keeping the peace on a composition. That condition was unlawful. Aitken J then remitted the case back to the magistrate so that the offence might be compounded by the accused offering the apology only. Hence, this case also shows that, even where it is not a private prosecution, the court may consent to composition despite the prosecuting officer`s objection.
It should also be noted that the authorities show that there is no difference between prosecutions conducted by police officers and prosecutions conducted by the Public Prosecutor. This is because the police officer is presumed to be acting on behalf of the Public Prosecutor. This is clearly shown in . There, a prosecution for an offence of causing grievous hurt under s 324 of the Penal Code was conducted by a police officer. On the application of the police officer, the charge was amended to one of simple hurt under s 323. The complainant then accepted an offer to compound. The Public Prosecutor applied for revision on the ground that the facts showed that grievous hurt was caused by the use of a weapon. The revision was dismissed. It was held that: 
 
... the Public Prosecutor could not be allowed to attack a charge and a procedure for which he was himself in law responsible, and that his application for revision must therefore be dismissed.
 
 
 
 
 Nature of the decision to allow composition
 
In my view, the decision whether to allow composition has always been and still is a judicial decision. shows that the decision made by a magistrate or district judge to allow a composition is a judicial one. The proceeding in which the decision was made was a trial. Hence, any such termination is termination by way of a legal process as a result of a judicial decision. In this respect, acquittal as a result of composition is no different from any other forms of acquittal. It is for this reason that an appeal lies from a decision to allow composition. This can be seen from , which decided that, as the discharge on composition had the effect of an acquittal, all the provisions relating to appeal were brought into operation.
Yet another line of authorities emphasises the judicial nature of a decision to allow composition. In , a magistrate`s action in referring the question whether to allow composition to the police was described as `particularly reprehensible`, as the magistrate had entirely surrendered his own judgment and discretion as a magistrate to the opinion of the police. This case was approved of in . In , a similar reference was described as something which was `greatly to be deprecated`. The principle extends even to cases where the magistrate referred the question to a superior court, as was the case in . The only way in which the authorities` view on the composition may be considered is through argument in court.
These cases demonstrate the judicial nature of the decision. It would be strange if the Public Prosecutor can in effect veto the court`s judicial decision. In my view, there is no such right on the part of the Public Prosecutor. The decision whether to discharge or to acquit an accused is a judicial decision which can only be made by the court. Section 199 has laid down one situation in which an accused may be acquitted. Once the criteria laid down in s 199 are fulfilled, the court has the power to acquit. The Public Prosecutor`s argument amounts to saying that the court has no authority to acquit an accused without the consent of the Public Prosecutor although the legislature has clearly said that it may. I am of the view that here, as in , if the legislative intention had been to give the Public Prosecutor this unusual power, then it would have done so in clear words.
With respect to the learned DPP, there is no authority at all to support his contention that a distinction must be drawn between private and public prosecutions. There is not the barest indication of such a distinction in s 199 of the CPC, and all the cases are against the drawing of such a distinction. There is also no rational reason for such a distinction, as in both cases the Public Prosecutor has supervisory powers over the conduct of the prosecution.
A further test of the Public Prosecutor`s argument can be seen from s 199 itself. It is only when an arrest has been effected or when a summons or a warrant for arrest has been applied for that the consent of the court is required. It is possible to compound an offence before any arrest or application for a summons or warrant of arrest is made. In that case, no consent of the court is required. The composition is complete once agreement is arrived at, as was held in . It would then be the duty of the magistrate to enter an acquittal, and there is no discretion in the matter at all. Nor may the victim withdraw consent to the composition. Of course, in the vast majority of cases where this happens, the matter is never brought to the attention of the courts and no prosecution is ever mounted. However, the point is, even if a prosecution is mounted by the Public Prosecutor, as he is entitled to do, it would be an exercise in futility, as the prosecution will necessarily result in an acquittal. It is as good as mounting a prosecution when the evidence clearly shows that no offence was committed or when the evidence clearly shows that a plea of 
 autrefois acquit 
 is available.
The point is, the Public Prosecutor`s discretion is never curtailed. Even where a prosecution is pre-empted by a composition, there is nothing to prevent the Public Prosecutor from prosecuting the case. Of course, the prosecution must necessarily fail, but that is an altogether different story.
Hence, I must hold that a compoundable offence may be compounded by the victim even if the prosecution was mounted by the Public Prosecutor and the Public Prosecutor objects to the composition. The contrary position would be against all the authorities.
 The discretion
I now turn to the question of the district judge`s exercise of his discretion. It is clear that the court in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant consent to composition is not acting as a rubber stamp. An argument that the court`s consent was a mere formality was rejected by Aitken J in . At p 245, he observed: 
 
... I am also of opinion that it is my duty to construe s 253(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code in accordance with the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words employed. It follows, then, that the words `with the consent of the Court before which the case is pending` must be construed as conferring on the judicial officer constituting the court a discretion to grant or withhold his consent because, if there was no such discretion, the voluntary act of the mind which is necessary to constitute a true consent would be entirely absent.
 
 
 
This brings me to the second point of law which I have to decide because, although I am clearly of opinion that the learned magistrate had a discretion to grant or withhold his consent to the composition at which the complainant and the accused arrived, that discretion is a judicial discretion and therefore one which must be exercised not only in accordance with the rules of reason and justice but also in accordance with the provisions of the law.
In 
 Re Chang Cheng Hoe & Ors 
, Ong Hock Sim J observed at p 253: 
 
I would however say that it should be left to the discretion and good sense of the courts to have regard to the interests of both the public and the parties, the circumstances and the nature of the offence in deciding whether to allow a case to be compounded.
 
 
 
This is in line with the Indian position. In , it was held that: 
 
In granting permission, the court has to exercise discretion vested in it judicially. The nature of the alleged offence, circumstances under which it is alleged to have been committed, relationship between the parties, possibility of parties living in peace and harmony if composition is allowed, stage at which composition is sought are some of the facts to be considered in deciding whether permission should be granted.
 
 
 
I agree. Thus, in a case where the public interest is involved, it is proper to withhold consent to composition. In , a clerk in the High Court was alleged to have induced the complainant to pay him Rs 2,000 with a representation that he would give the same to the judge as a bribe. The case was one of cheating. Even though this was compoundable under the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, and a composition was arrived at, the court refused to grant its consent. This is because if the allegation against the clerk was true, it imported matters of grave public interest. A thorough investigation and trial was therefore desirable.
Similarly, in , composition was not allowed in a case where the accused had cheated the complainant by professing to sell him crude oil. In that case, the accused had been convicted in the court below for cheating. On appeal, he agreed to compound the offence by paying back the complainant the Rs 120 concerned. Composition at this stage was allowed by the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. The court refused consent. There was no question of the parties living in peace and harmony as they had no previous relationship and lived in different villages. Furthermore, the accused had in his trial stated as his defence that he received the money as a loan from the complainant. If the conviction was correct, to allow composition would be to encourage such undesirable elements as the accused in society. If the conviction was wrong, it would amount to allowing the complainant to `screw out his dues`.
On the other hand, the cases also show that, in the absence of aggravating factors, the courts should lean towards the granting of consent in cases where the public interest does not figure strongly. It had already been observed above that Aitken J was of the view in that magistrates should not normally withhold consent to the compounding of an offence unless there is reason to suppose that the case in question was of an aggravated nature.
Thus, where it was just a private quarrel between two persons in which a hasty blow was struck, the Indian courts have observed that consent to composition should not normally be refused. This was the case in . There, the court made the following observation at p 162: 
 
I do not think that the case merits such attention as has been bestowed on it. It was a private quarrel between two railway guards and one hit the other, with the result that a tooth was knocked out. The case was important between them, but when they had compounded the case, no doubt, the court still had discretion to refuse permission to compound. Normally, it should not have refused permission, regard being had to the serious consequences which would ensue to the accused.
 
 
 
He had made amends to the complainant, and the complainant had been fully satisfied. It was just a chance quarrel in which a hasty and ill-advised blow was struck, which was not a planned offence in the sense in which offences are planned by other criminals. In my opinion, permission should not have been refused in this case.
Similarly, where the parties are close to each other, courts lean towards the granting of consent, especially if it was a minor incident. In , the High Court at Calcutta expressed the view at p 191 that: 
 
It is a great pity when the parties who are apparently nearly related to one another succeed in patching up their quarrels, that the magistrate should not do what he can do to restore peace and goodwill.
 
 
 
It is, however, imperative to ensure that the offence was really one which could be compounded. Thus, in a case involving causing hurt, the medical evidence regarding the nature of the injury caused should be recorded. Similarly, the magistrate should consider the nature of the weapon and instrument used. This is because it is not open to a magistrate to compound a non-compoundable offence. Hence, a magistrate`s decision to compound an offence for hurt was criticized in when the evidence suggested that grievous hurt was caused with a weapon. However, the court refused an application for revision because the amendment to the charge was made on the application of the prosecuting officer.
On the other hand, shows that it is not open to the prosecution to amend the charge just to frustrate a composition. In that case, the accused was charged by the police with voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon, which was not compoundable. Based on the papers submitted before him by the prosecution, the magistrate amended the charge on 3 September 1965 to one of voluntarily causing hurt, which was compoundable. Afterwards, on 14 December 1965, permission was sought for a composition. The Police Prosecutor objected to the composition, saying that the magistrate had made a mistake in framing the charge. The objection was rejected by the magistrate as the charge was framed on 3 September 1965 and the prosecutor did not seek to set it aside then by filing for revision. The State appealed, but the appeal was dismissed. One of the grounds was that, if the charge framed was wrong, the proper course was to apply for revision when the charge was framed. However, nothing was done at that stage, and it was no longer open to the prosecution to request the court to revise the charge when an application for composition had been made. This appears to be on all fours with .
In my view, all these principles are applicable in Singapore. Applying them to the present case, I have no doubt that this is not a suitable case to refuse consent to compound the offence. There is no indication that the charge framed was not proper. This was but a minor tiff between neighbours. The parties may not have known each other before this incident, but the fact remains that they live near each other. Even the police statement showed that there was some element of provocation from the victim. The injury suffered was minor and the parties have patched up their differences. Compelling the parties to go through a criminal trial will only serve to open up old wounds. This is assuming that the victim would even show up in court. It cannot be in the public interest to make a mountain out of the proverbial molehill. It is hard to see how it would be conducive to the parties living in peace and harmony to force a criminal trial on the two parties.
In the circumstances, I am of the view that the district judge exercised his discretion impeccably. Both the public interest and the interests of the parties had been considered. There is therefore no basis for disturbing his decision.
The Public Prosecutor`s appeal must therefore be dismissed and I order accordingly.

Factors to be taken into account in awarding Damages
 
The plaintiffs in both suits claimed against the defendants damages for libel. At the end of the hearing I awarded the first and second plaintiffs in S 1488/94 the sum of $300,000 each and the plaintiff in S 1490/94 the sum of $350,000 with costs reserved for further argument. I now give my reasons.
 The parties
The first plaintiff in S 1488/94 (the first plaintiff) is currently the Senior Minister in the Prime Minister`s Office. Before that he was the Prime Minister of Singapore from May 1959 to 27 November 1990. He was elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly in 1955 and has been a Member of Parliament since 1959. Currently he is a Member of Parliament for the Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency. He is a member of the Central Executive Committee of the People`s Action Party (PAP). Between 1954 and December 1992, he was the Secretary-General.
The second plaintiff in S 1488/94 (the second plaintiff) is and has been the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore since 28 November 1990. He was appointed to this post by the plaintiff in S 1490/90 (to be referred to herein as `the third plaintiff`). Between 2 January 1985 and 31 December 1986, the second plaintiff was the Minister of State in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, having been appointed to these posts by the then Prime Minister, the first plaintiff. On 1 January 1987, he was promoted to Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence (Services). He held these posts until 27 November 1990. He has been a Member of Parliament since 23 December 1984 and is currently a Member of Parliament for the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency. He is and has been the First Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP since 2 December 1992. Before that he was the Second Assistant Secretary-General. He is the son of the first plaintiff.
The third plaintiff has been the Prime Minister of Singapore since 28 November 1990. From January 1985 to 27 November 1990 he was the First Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore. He has been a Member of Parliament since December 1976 and is currently a Member of Parliament for the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency. He is also the Secretary-General of the PAP, a position he has held since December 1992. Before that he was the First Assistant Secretary-General.
The first defendant is the executive editor of the 
 International Herald Tribune 
 (IHT). He has over 30 years of experience in the field of journalism in and outside the United States, mainly with the 
 Associated Press 
 and the 
 New York Times 
. He was the Paris bureau chief and Bonn bureau chief of the 
 New York Times 
 and then its metropolitan editor before becoming the executive editor of the IHT seven years ago. He was conferred the George Polk Award in 1986 for his reporting work in Paraguay.
The second defendant is a freelance journalist contributing articles on an ad hoc basis to the IHT since 1992. From 1988 to 1992 he was the editor of the 
 Far Eastern Economic Review 
 (the 
 Review 
).
The third defendant is and has been the chief executive and publisher of the IHT since July 1993. He was previously the deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of the 
 Financial Times 
.
The IHT is a reputable and influential daily newspaper with wide circulation internationally and in Singapore. It is based in Paris but is jointly owned by the 
 New York Times 
 and the 
 Washington Post 
. Its circulation in Singapore was around 4,000 copies daily at the material time.
 The facts
On 2 August 1994, the IHT carried in its opinion page an article entitled `
 The Claims About ""Asian"" Values Don`t Usually Bear Scrutiny 
`. It was written by the second defendant. The article contained the following passage (the passage): 
 
In the Chinese case, history almost seems to consist of a battle between the corporatist needs of the state and the interests of the families who operate it. Dynastic politics is evident in `Communist` China already, as in Singapore, despite official commitments to bureaucratic meritocracy. Similarly with the Kuomintang inheritance in Taiwan, which won out until 1987, when lack of candidates and the pressure of opinion ended the Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek era.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs took exception to the passage as meaning that the first plaintiff had caused the second plaintiff to be appointed to his various posts on the basis of nepotism and that both father and son were operating the state in a way that the corporatist needs of the state conflicted with the interests of the Lee family and that in all these they were aided and abetted by the third plaintiff.
On 5 August 1994, the plaintiffs through their respective solicitors, wrote to the defendants demanding a full retraction and apology, an undertaking not to repeat the allegations, a suitable offer of damages and an indemnity as to their legal costs.
On 10 August 1994 the defendants through their solicitors reverted substantively as follows: 
 
 
 Article on `Asian Values` in the issue of the International Herald Tribune dated 2 August 1994
 
 
 
 
1 We refer to the above matter. Our clients have considered the position, and as a responsible newspaper, accept that an apology is in order.
2 Our clients do, however, wish to highlight two facts which should be taken into account when considering ancillary matters. First, our clients would like to assure your [clients/client] that there was no malice or forethought. The article was written by a columnist. It appeared in the opinion page of the newspaper and does not necessarily represent the opinion of the publisher and editor. This of course does not negate ultimate legal responsibility - but nevertheless, your clients should be aware of it. 
3 Second, the writer of this article, Mr Philip Bowring, has assured our clients that he did not intend the imputations suggested in your letters. Nevertheless, it is accepted that the reading you have suggested 
 could 
 possibly be drawn. 
4 In the circumstances, our clients propose that an apology, by the writer, in the enclosed terms, be published in the IHT. 
...
 
 
 
The draft apology by the writer only, that is, the second defendant, read: 
 
I would like to clarify a paragraph in the article on Asian values which appeared on 2 August, and which read:
 
 
 
`... In the Chinese case, history almost seems to consist of a battle between the corporatist needs of the state and the interests of the families who operate it. Dynastic politics is evident in `Communist` China already, as in Singapore, despite official commitment to bureaucratic meritocracy ... .`
 
 
 
Unfortunately, this paragraph telescoped several themes into a few sentences and may have caused some readers to draw the conclusion that I was suggesting that nepotism was prevalent in Singapore: more specifically, that I was suggesting that the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, BG Lee Hsien Loong, had been appointed to his various Government positions by the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, by reason of the influence wielded by BG Lee`s father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who is currently the Senior Minister in Singapore and was formerly Singapore`s Prime Minister.
 
 
 
In using the phrase `dynastic politics` in the context of Singapore, I had no intention of implying nepotism or undemocratic behaviour. Western democracies have had their political dynasties, such as the Churchills in Britain and the Kennedys in the US. Indeed, both nations have been enriched by family traditions of public service, which happily coexist with democratic and meritocratic principles. I am sure that Singapore has been similarly enriched.
I wish to apologize to any reader or Singapore officials, notably, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee Hsien Loong, who may have drawn conclusions not intended in the article. I also apologize to all readers, and particularly Singaporeans, for failing in a journalist`s first duty: clarity of expression.
On 18 August 1994, the solicitors for the plaintiffs replied. They rejected the second defendant`s draft apology stating that it was patronizing and sarcastic, and intimated that it would be relied on as a circumstance justifying an award of aggravated damages. They also required the first and third defendants to join in the apology a draft of which was enclosed. This draft was eventually agreed to by the defendants with some amendments on 25 August 1994. But the plaintiffs` demand that the size of each apology should not be less than 20 cm by 20 cm boxed was not acceded to. The IHT then published a single apology by the three defendants in terms of the agreed draft in the opinion page of its 31 August 1994 issue. The apology read: 
 
Apology
 
 
 
The issue of IHT for 2 August contained an article by Philip Bowring on the subject of `Asian Values`. The article contained a reference to a `battle between the corporatist needs of the state and the interests of the families who operate it` and `dynastic politics` in Asia and in Singapore.
 
 
 
We recognize that this passage meant to readers that Mr Lee Hsien Loong (currently Deputy Prime Minister and a Cabinet member for ten years) had been appointed to his present post of Deputy Prime Minister by Mr Goh Chok Tong (the Prime Minister), and earlier posts of Minister of State and subsequently Minister for Trade and Industry by Mr Lee Kuan Yew (currently Senior Minister and until November 1990 Prime Minister) 
 not 
 on his own merits but purely because he was Mr Lee Kuan Yew`s son; and that there was a battle between the corporatist needs of the state of Singapore and the interests of the Lee family (father and son) who operated it.
We admit that these allegations are completely without foundation. We apologize for them without reservation to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. We undertake not to make further allegations to the same or similar effect.

The apology was followed by an assurance given by the first and third defendants through their solicitors` letter of 2 September 1994 that they `have taken steps to ensure that, in future, all articles which refer to Singapore will be vetted carefully so that such mistakes do not recur.`
 The proceedings
On 10 September 1994, S 1488/94 was filed, followed by S 1490/94 on 12 September 1994. In substance the statements of claim alleged that:
 
 
(1) the passage meant and was understood to mean that the second plaintiff was appointed to his various posts in the Singapore Government not on the basis of merit but because he is the son of the first plaintiff; 
 
(2) the first plaintiff had directly or indirectly caused the second plaintiff to be appointed to these posts on the basis of nepotism; 
 
(3) the first and second plaintiffs were advancing the interests of the Lee family at the expense of the corporatist needs of Singapore; 
 
(4) the third plaintiff aided or abetted the practice of nepotism and allowed the first and second plaintiffs to advance the interests of the Lee family at the expense of the corporatist needs of Singapore.
  
 
 
By orders of court of 28 October 1994, the plaintiffs obtained interlocutory judgments under O 14 r 3 of the Rules of Supreme Court 1990 (RSC) `for such sum by way of damages (including aggravated damages) for libel to be assessed` with costs on an indemnity basis. By the interlocutory judgments, the passage meant and was understood to mean what the plaintiffs claimed it meant and was understood to mean in the statements of claim. By order 4 of the orders of court of 28 October 1994, the following directions were given: 
 
(i) The affidavits of evidence on damages of all witnesses be limited to one affidavit for each witness to be filed and exchanged within three weeks and objections to the contents of the affidavit evidence be taken within two weeks after the exchange of the affidavit evidence;
(ii) The matter be set down within one week thereafter for one day`s hearing; 
(iii) The witnesses whom the plaintiffs intend if necessary to call be limited to the following: 
(a) Mr Lee Kuan Yew 
(b) Mr Lee Hsien Loong 
(c) Mr Goh Chok Tong
 
 
 
(iv) The witnesses whom the defendants intend if necessary to call be limited to the following: 
(a) Mr John Vinocur 
(b) Mr Philip Bowring 
(c) Mr Richard Arthur Francis McClean
 
 
 
(v) There be liberty for cross-examination of the witnesses, if necessary.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the directions, affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed by the parties.
On 16 March 1995, the defendants applied under O 41 r 6 of the RSC to expunge those parts of the plaintiffs` affidavits, touching on damages for injury to feelings and malice on the part of the Second defendant in the publication of the passage. The ground for the defendants` applications was that injury to feelings and malice, that is, express malice, had not been pleaded and therefore those parts of the affidavits relating thereto were irrelevant and accordingly should be expunged. For convenient reference I set out hereunder the provisions of O 41 r 6: 
 
The Court may order to be struck out of any affidavit any matter which is scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive.
 
 
 
On 24 March 1994, the third plaintiff applied for leave to file a further affidavit of evidence on facts from which malice on the part of the second defendant could be inferred.
All the applications came before me for hearing on 18 May 1995. I allowed the third plaintiff`s application to file a further affidavit with leave to the defendants to each file an affidavit-in-reply. I dismissed the defendants` application but they were not to be precluded from raising the same contention at the assessment proceedings.
When the claims came before me for assessment, counsel for the plaintiffs proposed to call their clients to give oral evidence. They relied on order 4 of the orders of court of 28 October 1994. Counsel for the defendants thereupon objected. They submitted that although order 4 of the orders of court of 28 October 1994 permitted the parties to call specific witnesses, namely, the plaintiffs and the defendants, the order must be read subject to O 38 r 2(3) of the RSC under which no deponent to an affidavit admitted under r 2(1) may give evidence-in-chief of matters not contained in his affidavit except on matters which have arisen after the filing of the affidavit. For convenient reference, the provisions of O 38 rr 1 and 2 are set out hereunder: 
 
1 Subject to these Rules and of the Evidence Act, and any other written law relating to evidence, any fact required to be proved at the trial of any action begun by writ by the evidence of witnesses shall be proved by the examination of the witnesses in open court.
2(1) Without prejudice to the generality of Rule 1, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ, evidence in chief of a witness shall be given by way of affidavit and, unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree, such a witness shall attend trial for cross-examination and, in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court. 
 (2) In any cause or matter begun by originating summons, originating motion or petition, and on any application made by summons or motion, evidence shall be given by affidavit unless in the case of any such cause, matter or application any provision of these Rules otherwise provides or the Court otherwise directs, but the Court may, on the application of any party, order the attendance for cross-examination of the person making any such affidavit, and where, after such an order has been made, the person in question does not attend, his affidavit shall not be used as evidence without the leave of the Court. 
 (3) Unless the Court otherwise orders, no deponent to an affidavit may at the trial or hearing of any cause or matter give evidence in chief, the substance of which is not contained in his affidavit except in relation to matters which have arisen after the filing of the affidavit. 
 (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), (2) or (3), the Court may, if it thinks just, order that evidence of a party or any witness or any part of such evidence be given orally at the trial or hearing of any cause or matter. 
 (5) Nothing in this Rule shall make admissible evidence which if given orally would be inadmissible.
 
 
 
It is clear that the purpose of O 38 is to achieve a fair and expeditious disposal of proceedings, the saving of costs and the elimination of any element of surprise as to the witnesses each party intends to call at the trial or as to the substance of their evidence. It was obvious that the oral evidence to be given by the plaintiffs would be an amplification of the evidence given on affidavits on the issue of malice and the hurt to the plaintiffs` feelings caused by publication of the passage. The defendants therefore would not be taken by surprise. Accordingly I ruled that if order 4 of the orders of court of 28 October 1994 did not allow further evidence of the plaintiffs to be given orally, then under O 38 r 2(4) or in the exercise of my inherent powers vide O 92 r 4 of the RSC, in the interest of justice, I would allow the plaintiffs to give oral evidence. Copies of documents to be tendered in the course of such oral evidence were ordered to be made available to counsel for the defendants immediately. It was also to be without prejudice to the issue as to whether the claims for aggravated damages for malice and hurt to the feelings of the plaintiffs ought to have been pleaded and, if so, had they been adequately pleaded. Order 92 r 4 reads: 
 
For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.
 
 
 
 
 Damages
 
Damages for defamation, except for exemplary damages, are assessed on a compensatory basis: see 
 Duncan & Neill on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed) para 18.02. Such an award `is to restore the plaintiff, as far as money can do so, to the position he would have been in if the tort had not been committed`: Duncan & Neill para 18.04.
In assessing the amount of such an award, the courts are: 
 
entitled to take into their consideration the conduct of the plaintiff, his position and standing, the nature of the libel, the mode and extent of publication, the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology, and the whole conduct of the defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the very moment of their verdict. They may take into consideration the conduct of the defendant before action, after action, and in court at the trial of the action ... ... They should allow for the sad truth that no apology, retraction or withdrawal can ever be guaranteed completely to undo the harm it has done or the hurt it has caused. They should also take into account the evidence led in aggravation or mitigation of the damages. [See Gatley on 
 Libel and Slander
 (8th Ed) para 1451.]
 
 
 
In appropriate cases, the court may award aggravated damages: 
 
Moreover, it is very well established that in cases where the damages are at large the jury (or the judge if the award is left to him) can take into account the motives and conduct of the defendant where they aggravate the injury done to the plaintiff. There may be malevolence or spite or the manner of committing the wrong may be such as to injure the plaintiff`s proper feelings of dignity and pride. These are matters which the jury can take into account in assessing the appropriate compensation. [Per Lord Devlin in at p 1221.]
 
 
 
On aggravating factors that may be taken into account, Keith Evan`s (2nd Ed) at pp 104-105 states: 
 
In considering the award in any given case, a number of factors may be taken into account as aggravating, or increasing, the amount to be awarded. These factors include, amongst others, the standing in the community of both the plaintiff and the defendant at the time the statements were made, whether the defendant was actuated by express malice, or was reckless as to the truth of his statements, and the conduct of the defendant throughout the entire proceeding.
 
 
 
It would seem that the greater the reputation of the person defamed, the greater the damage award that will be made - on the basis that these persons are more vulnerable in so far as they are well known, often hold public positions of great responsibility and trust, and have a wider circle of social and business contacts. If the person who speaks the defamatory words is also a person of prominence, with considerable standing in the public eye, damages may be greater due to the fact that the words would carry more weight than if they were spoken by a lesser individual. The same is true if the publication in which the words appear is a reputable and influential publication with worldwide circulation. Likewise, the damages awarded will be higher the more enormous, outrageous, scandalous or scurrilous the charge.
Thus, express malice and injury to feelings could be taken into account in awarding aggravated damages. It would be appropriate at this point to deal with the defendants` contention that evidence of express malice and injury to feelings should not be admitted or taken into account because they had not been pleaded.
On the necessity to plead injury to feelings, counsel for the defendants relied on Bullen & Leake & Jacob`s 
 Precedents of Pleadings 
 (13th Ed) at p 626, where it is stated: 
 
Compensatory damages in libel and slander in the case of an individual plaintiff consist of injury to reputation and injury to feelings. Both elements should be pleaded.
 
 
 
It is axiomatic that all claims for whatever causes of action have to be pleaded. The issue is whether aggravated damages on grounds of malice and for injury to feelings were encompassed within the plaintiffs` pleadings. Both statements of claim alleged that the plaintiffs had `been gravely injured in [their/his] character, credit and reputation` and had been brought `into public scandal, odium and contempt.`
Similar words like `hatred, ridicule and contempt` were referred to as an `ancient formula` by Scrutton LJ in at p 477. In the fairly ancient case of at p 108, Parke B said: 
 
A publication, without justification or lawful excuse, which is calculated to injure the reputation of another, by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, is a libel.
 
 
 
In at p 1071 Lord Hailsham LC said: 
 
In actions of defamation and in any other actions where damages for loss of reputation are involved, the principle of restitutio in integrum has necessarily an even more highly subjective element. Such actions involve a money award which may put the plaintiff in a purely financial sense in a much stronger position than he was before the wrong. Not merely can he recover the estimated sum of his past and future losses, but, in case the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, he must be able to point to a sum awarded by a jury sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge. As Windeyer J well said in 117 CLR 115, at p 150:
 
 
 
`It seems to me that, properly speaking, a man defamed does not get compensation for his damaged reputation. He gets damages because he was injured in his reputation, that is simply because he was publicly defamed. For this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done. Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary recompense for harm measurable in money.`
 
 
 
This is why it is not necessarily fair to compare awards of damages in this field with damages for personal injuries. , the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology, or the reaffirmation of the truth of the matters complained of, or the of the defendant. The bad conduct of the plaintiff himself may also enter into the matter, where he has provoked the libel, or where perhaps he has libelled the defendant in reply. What is awarded is thus a figure which cannot be arrived at by any purely objective computation. This is what is meant when the damages in defamation are described as being `at large`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
More pertinent to the necessity or otherwise to plead specifically claims for injury to feelings is the dicta of Lord Reid in at p 1085: 
 
Damages for any tort are or ought to be fixed at a sum which will compensate the plaintiff, so far as money can do it, for all the injury which he has suffered. Where the injury is material and has been ascertained it is generally possible to assess damages with some precision. But that is not so where he has been caused or when his reputation has been attacked - where, . Not only is it impossible to ascertain how far other people`s minds have been affected, it is almost impossible to equate the damage to a sum of money. Any one person trying to fix a sum as compensation will probably find in his mind a wide bracket within which any sum could be regarded by him as not unreasonable - and different people will come to different conclusions. So in the end there will probably be a wide gap between the sum which on an objective view could be regarded as the least and the sum which could be regarded as the most to which the plaintiff is entitled as compensation. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
On the more general issue of whether aggravated damages have to be specifically pleaded the following authorities would be instructive.
 Halsbury`s Laws of England
(4th Ed) Vol 28 para 182 states: 
 
Where the injury to the plaintiff has been aggravated by the conduct of the defendant, the plaintiff may claim aggravated damages. 
 Such damages are part of, or included in, the sum awarded as general damage and are, therefore, at large. As such, they need not be specifically pleaded or included in the prayer for relief
. However, where the plaintiff relies on any facts or matters to support his claim for aggravated damages, it is probably desirable that he should plead them. If pleaded, they will not be struck out. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
 
 
 McGregor on Damages 
 
 (15th Ed) para 1762 states: 
 
... while as a matter of practice it is proper to allow the plaintiff to include the items of aggravation if he wishes, a failure to do so will not constitute a defective statement of claim.
 
 
 
 
 
 Atkin`s Court Forms 
 
 (2nd Ed) Vol 25 p 69 para 12 also states to similar effect: 
 
 
 General damage.
 Where the damages [for libel and slander] are at large, the object of the award is to compensate the plaintiff for:
 
 
 
(1) the injury to his reputation; this is to be inferred and need not be pleaded or proved; and
(2) the natural hurt to his feelings.
 
 
 
 
 Aggravated damages.
 When the defendant has been motivated by spite or malevolence, or his conduct has been `high-handed` or contumelious so as to increase the plaintiff`s mental pain and suffering and to aggravate the injury to his dignity, pride and self-confidence, the court may take that motivation and conduct into account when assessing the award of damages. It is, apparently, not essential to plead the facts relied on in aggravation of damages, but if they are pleaded they will not be struck out as superfluous: indeed, it is clearly desirable to plead the facts supporting a claim for aggravated damages not only to avoid taking the other party by surprise but also to obtain the advantage of any discovery.
 
 
 
Thus a plea using the traditional phrase of being held up to `hatred, ridicule and contempt` would include a claim for mental distress which is injury to feelings. Moreover on the basis of these authorities, a claim for aggravated damages need not be specifically pleaded but in any event, the claim for aggravated damages for injury to feelings would also fall within the parameters of the plaintiffs` claims of having been `gravely injured in [their/his] character, credit and reputation` and having been `brought into public scandal, odium and contempt.`
Counsel for the defendants further contended that the facts supporting a claim for aggravated damages should also be pleaded. The relevant rule is O 18 r 7(1) of the RSC which reads: 
 
Subject to this Rule and Rules 10, 11 and 12, every pleading must contain and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved, and the statement must be as brief as the nature of the case admits.
 
 
 
The rationale for this rule is best explained by Cotton LJ in at pp 138-139: 
 
The statement of claim, of necessity, must set out all the facts material to prevent the defendant being taken by surprise because it is the first pleading, and that which ought to be referred to for the purpose of seeing whether there is a cause of action.
 
 
 
... But in my opinion it is absolutely essential that the pleading, not to be embarrassing to the defendants, should state those facts which will put the defendants on their guard and tell them what they have to meet when the case comes on for trial.
In support of his argument, counsel for the defendants referred to the Canadian case of and the unreported English Court of Appeal decision in .
In the plaintiff made an application for a new trial on the ground that the jury`s verdict was perverse, namely, that although the slander was proved and admitted, the plaintiff had suffered no damage and was not entitled to any damages, not even nominal damages. In delivering the judgment of the Division Court, Meredith CJ said at p 652: 
 
It was incumbent on the plaintiff, we think, if he intended to adduce jevidence of acts of the respondent on which he relied for aggravating the damages, to have set forth the acts relied on in his pleadings and this was not done.
 
 
 
According to our system of pleading, the material facts upon which the pleader relies must be set forth in his pleadings.
It would be a highly inconvenient practice to require a defendant to go to trial at the risk of being met with a number of circumstances which the other side was permitted to give evidence of without setting them forth in his pleading, and which might, if unanswered, seriously affect the damages.
In so far as it is sought to rely on as an authority that `it was incumbent on the plaintiff ... if he intended to adduce evidence of acts of the respondent on which he relied for aggravating the damages to have set forth the acts relied on for aggravating the damages,` this is against the line of authorities including the dicta of Lord Reid in that such damages are at large and need not be specifically pleaded though it is desirable to do so. The latter is more consistent with the entitlement of the courts in awarding aggravated damages to take into account acts of the defendant during the trial and down to the time of the verdict. Such acts could not be pleaded in the statement of claim. In any case, the rationale for the dicta of Meredith CJ is that the defendant should not be taken by surprise.
In the 
 Ruspoli 
 case7, the plaintiff there applied for leave to appeal against the trial judge`s refusal of an application for leave to amend the statement of claim in an action for damages for libel. In delivering his judgment Neill LJ said: 
 
I do not think it is necessary or desirable to attempt to give guidance which will apply to all claims for aggravated damages in all cases. I will confine myself to the facts of the present case ... .
 
 
 
Neill LJ then referred to O 18 r 7 of the English RSC saying: 
 
The basic rule which is enshrined in r 7 is that a party must plead the material facts on which he relies for his claim or defence.
 
 
 
Still confining himself to the facts of that case, he said: 
 
What amounts to a sufficient pleading will depend on the facts of the particular case. But where, as here, the plaintiff seeks to rely on the conduct of the defendant on another occasion as a factor to be taken into account in the assessment of damages, some warning must be given. ... Ordinarily that warning will be given in the pleadings. It is said, however, that in this case, a sufficient warning or signal was given by the letter of complaint of June 1990 and by the list of documents. 
 In the circumstances of this case
 I do not agree that this was a sufficient warning. Indeed there was no hint in the letter of 15 June 1990 that the plaintiff was treating this matter so seriously that he wanted aggravated damages. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Neill LJ there was just restating the principle underlying O 18 r 7 which is that a party should be given the opportunity to know what his opponent`s case is and should not be caught by surprise at the trial.
Counsel for the defendants also relied on the case of in which Donovan LJ at p 579 said: 
 
Order 18 r 7 requires that every pleading shall contain a summary of the material facts and by r 12 `every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim ... .` By r 15 `a statement of claim must state specifically the relief or remedy claimed.` It follows that the necessity of pleading `damage` (meaning injury) or `damages` (meaning the amount claimed to be recoverable), if it arises at all, does so as an example of the general requirement of any statement of claim that it shall `put the defendants on their guard and tell them what they have to meet when the case comes on for trial`: per Cotton LJ in 
(1878) 4 QBD 127
 at p 139. Accordingly, if a plaintiff has suffered , he must warn the defendant in the pleadings that compensation claimed will extend to this damage, thus showing the defendant the case he has to meet and assisting him in computing a payment into court. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The case , however, concerned a contractual claim for loss of profits. Such loss is not the necessary and immediate consequence of a breach of contract and there was no mention of any claim for loss of profits in the statement of claim.
In the present proceedings, injury to the feelings of the plaintiffs [being individuals as opposed to corporate entities] must be the necessary and immediate consequence of the injury to their character, credit and reputation and their being brought into public scandal, odium and contempt. Further, in the plaintiffs` O 14 applications, judgments applied for were for damages including aggravated damages. The defendants therefore could not have been surprised or embarrassed by the claims for aggravated damages arising from injury to feelings.
I will now turn to the issue of malice. Counsel for the defendants contended that malice where it is to be relied on in aggravation of damages, must be pleaded. They relied mainly on O 18 r 12(1) which reads: 
 
... every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words:
 
 
 
...
(b) where a party pleading alleges any condition of the mind of any person, whether any disorder or disability of mind or any 
 malice 
, fraudulent intention or other condition of mind except knowledge, particulars of the facts on which the party relies. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It is necessary to distinguish between malice in law or presumed malice and malice in fact or express malice. 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) Vol 28 para 16 states: 
 
In an action for libel or slander it is the practice to allege in the statement of claim that the words were published falsely and maliciously. However, the plaintiff does not have to prove falsity or malice to establish his cause of action. If the words are defamatory, the law presumes that they are false, and it is for the defendant to plead and prove that the words are true. In other words, the onus of proving justification is on the defendant.
 
 
 
The malice signified by the phrase `falsely and maliciously` is malice in law, that is to say a wrongful act done intentionally, without just cause or excuse. Malice in that sense is presumed from the fact of publication of defamatory words, so that the plaintiff need not prove it. This is to be distinguished from express malice, which is actual malice or malice in fact. Express malice will rebut a defence of qualified privilege or of fair comment, and may be relevant on the issue of damages. It is for the plaintiff to plead and prove the existence of express malice.
Thus, it is only when a defendant pleads a defence of fair comment or qualified privilege that the plaintiff is then required to plead in reply express malice on the part of the defendant and the facts from which such malice is to be inferred to rebut such a defence. But `if express malice is relied upon in aggravation of damages, it is desirable to plead it in the statement of claim`. See 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) Vol 28 para 238 n 1.
The position was stated succinctly by Barry LJ in at p 75 as follows: 
 
If a defamatory writing is published without lawful excuse the law conclusively presumes that the publisher is actuated by that malice, which gives the injured party a cause of action. This is called `malice in law`, but would be more accurately defined as malice conclusively established by inference of law from the defamatory character of the publication, on the principle that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his wilful act. But if there be a lawful excuse for the publication, as, for example, in the ordinary cases of privileged communication, by which the inference of law is prima facie prevented or rebutted, the onus is thrown upon the plaintiff of establishing by legal modes of proof the existence as a fact of the malice necessary for the maintenance of the action. This is called `malice in fact`, which simply means malice proved as a fact, irrespective of the mere inference arising from the libellous character of the publication.
 
 
 
This dicta of Barry LJ accords with O 78 r 3(3) of the RSC which reads: 
 
Where in an action for libel or slander the plaintiff alleges that the defendant maliciously published the words or matters complained of, he need not in his statement of claim give particulars of the facts on which he relies in support of the allegation of malice, but if the defendant pleads that any of those words or matters are fair comment on a matter of public interest or were published upon a privileged occasion and the plaintiff intends to allege that the defendant was actuated by express malice, he must serve a reply giving particulars of the facts and matters from which the malice is to be inferred.
 
 
 
Thus, it is only when a defendant pleads a defence of fair comment or unqualified privilege that the plaintiff is then required to file and serve a reply pleading malice and the facts and matters from which the malice is to be inferred to rebut such a defence. It is anomalous to require malice to be specifically pleaded in the statement of claim when other aggravating factors need not be, the damages for defamation being at large. In the present proceedings, no defence had been filed. Hence there was no need for a reply to be filed on the facts supporting a claim of malice. The defendants had also not been prejudiced or embarrassed in any way as they must have known of the claims for aggravated damages because they were applied for in the O 14 applications and, following the order 14 interlocutory judgments, affidavits of the plaintiffs were filed, deposing to facts on malice in support of their claims for aggravated damages. The objections raised on behalf of the defendants on the pleadings were therefore without merit.
 Quantum of damages
Having dealt with the lengthy procedural objections, I now turn to the substantive issue of quantum of damages.
Standing of the parties
The three plaintiffs are the top three ministers of the government. To accuse the first and second plaintiffs of nepotism and corruption and in the case of the third plaintiff of aiding or abetting such practice of nepotism and corruption at the behest of the first plaintiff, was an attack that would cause grievous harm to them in the discharge of the functions of their office and indignation on their part as it was an attack on the very core of their political credo. It would undermine their ability to govern. In at p 176, Chua J said: 
 
Allegations of corrupt and criminal conduct are very grave charges, especially if they are made against the Prime Minister of a country. Such charges unless challenged head on would destroy the plaintiff, as moral authority is the cornerstone of effective government. If this moral authority is eroded, the government cannot function.
 
 
 
Culpability of second defendant
He was the editor of the 
 Review 
 from 1988 to 1992. During his editorship, the 
 Review 
 often made snide attacks on Singapore and its leaders as it did during the editorship of his predecessor Mr Derek Davis. After he stepped down as editor of the 
 Review 
 in 1992 the second defendant continued his snide attacks on Singapore and its leaders through his articles published in various newspapers. To illustrate, I will refer to some of the articles.
In the 15 November 1990 issue of the 
 Review 
 there was an article by one N Balakrishnan headed `
 Goh could face isolation as Prime Minister. The Lost Generation. 
` It went on to state: 
 
Goh Chok Tong, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew`s designated successor, was recruited into politics in 1976 as one of the so-called `second generation` leaders groomed by Lee to take over Singapore`s helm. However, the eclipse of most of the second generation by the `third generation` led by the Prime Minister`s son Lee Hsien Loong, does not augur well for Goh`s future.
 
 
 
Further, Lee - as the sole survivor of the `first generation` - could well be doing everything possible from his vantage point as a senior cabinet member to make sure the third generation leaps over the second to assume the leadership slot as soon as possible.
In the 16 November 1990 issue of the 
 Review 
 under the heading `
 Traveller`s Tales 
`, this was what the second defendant wrote: 
 
I was sorry to miss Lee Kuan Yew`s recent visit to Hong Kong, where he spoke at the Foreign Correspondents Club. By all accounts he enjoyed himself fielding the mostly predictable and unfocused questions about press freedom, etc, and seems to have regarded his questioners as being far too deferential. `Blunt knives` is a phrase he is reported to have used.
 
 
 
The reason for my absence was, under the circumstances, an ironical comment on the ways of the world. I was en route to Hanoi for the official opening of the 
 Review 
`s bureau there. The 
 Review 
 has been denied an accredited correspondent in open market, capitalist Singapore for the past three and a half years. But it has become the first publication from the non-communist world to open a bureau in Hanoi.
A more humiliating and derisive piece is also to be found in the 16 November 1990 issue of the 
 Review 
. That was the caricature of the third plaintiff crawling on his hands and knees and carrying on his back what looked like a map of Singapore on top of which sat the first plaintiff. There was the caption `
 Yes Minister 
`. The enmity of the second defendant towards Singapore seems somewhat well known. In its despatch on 31 August 1994 on the apology, Reuters stated: 
 
The apology is for a 2 August article by Hong Kong based journalist Philip Bowring, an outspoken critic of Singapore who clashed with its government as former editor of the 
 Far Eastern Economic Review
.
 
 
 
The second defendant also showed a lack of sincerity in his draft letter of apology which was not a retraction but a clarification of a purported lack of clarity of expression. I therefore had no doubt that he was actuated by malice when he wrote and caused to be published the passage.
Culpability of the first and third defendants
In his affidavit, the first defendant stated that he did not see the article prior to its publication and it was submitted on his behalf that as executive editor he could not be expected to read every article before publication. He also stated he held no malice against the plaintiffs. But in an article appearing in the 
 Washington Post 
 it was stated that there was an internal rift in IHT. It was said to be over the issue on whether the IHT should tamper and judiciously frame its future criticisms of Singaporean officials or get out of the market. The first defendant was therein reported to have said: 
 
To hell with it. We`ll not trim our sails for that crowd. If they don`t like it, they can lump it and we`ll pull out.
 
 
 
As to whether the first defendant was accurately reported, it is unfortunate that he did not deny it even by way of an affidavit and neither did he appear at the hearing to be cross-examined on it. It is also to be noted that he joined in the apology only on the insistence of the plaintiffs. In so far as the third defendant was concerned I accepted that he had not seen the article before publication. But this did not absolve him of any culpability. He and the other defendants had undertaken `not to make further allegations to the same or similar effect` and he and the first defendant had given the assurance that articles referring to Singapore would be carefully vetted. Yet, on 7 October 1994, there appeared in the opinion page of the IHT an article by one Christopher Lingle entitled `
 The smoke over parts of Asia obscures some profound concern 
.` That article contained the following passage: 
 
Intolerant regimes in the region reveal considerable ingenuity in their methods of suppressing dissent. Some techniques lack finesse; crushing unarmed students with tanks or imprisoning dissidents. Others are more subtle; relying upon a compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians, or buying out enough of the opposition to take control `democratically`. Trade unionists in Europe seldom face such pressures.
 
 
 
That passage led to those responsible for its publication being fined for contempt of the Singapore judiciary. The publication of the Lingle article barely a month after the undertaking not to make further allegation to the same or similar effect and the assurance to vet all articles on Singapore (if they were sincerely given) showed that no adequate vetting system had been put in place to ensure that no further snide attacks would be made on Singapore or its leaders.
The first defendant as the executive editor and the third defendant as the publisher were responsible for the publication. In allowing the publication of the article without reading it and in the absence of an adequate vetting system to prevent such defamatory publication, they were indifferent to the truth. In that sense they acted recklessly. By so acting recklessly they were also actuated or affected by express malice. In , the printers who did not even have any control over the writing and editing of the defamatory publication were held to have acted recklessly and were thereby actuated or affected by express malice. At p 418, LP Thean J [as he then was] stated: 
 
I now come to consider the fourth defendants. They are the printers and were not involved in writing or editing the article. Mr Previte, however, submitted, and I agree with him, that the fourth defendants printed the article without verifying whether the contents thereof were true or false. This is evident from the letter which their solicitors wrote to the plaintiff`s solicitors on 30 December 1987. In that letter they said, amongst other things:
 
 
 
`As you know our clients are printers for the 
 Far Eastern Economic Review Ltd
 (FEERL) and have no control over the contents of the magazine printed by them. Our clients are also not in a position to verify the contents of any article in the magazine, including the article complained of in your letter of 26 December 1987.
 
 
 
Our clients are therefore seeking clarification from FEERL on the matter.
As you will appreciate, it is not possible for us or our clients to take a definitive view of the matter without obtaining the necessary information from FEERL. Further, we should inform you that under the terms of our agreement with FEERL, our clients are obliged to seek the consent of FEERL should they decide to settle any claim, demand or cause of action brought by any party arising out of any copy of the magazine printed by them.` 
 
As can be seen from the letter, there was an agreement subsisting between the third and fourth defendants whereby, presumably, amongst other things, the former would indemnify the latter against all liabilities arising from printing the 
 Review
. It is obvious that the fourth defendants as printers rely wholly on the agreement made with the third defendants and are bound by the agreement they have made. In effect, they have by agreement abandoned any attempt to exercise control on what they print. Wholly for commercial reasons, they have tied themselves to the publishers, and that is the way they choose to conduct their business. In that situation, they have put themselves in the shoes of the publishers and must stand or fall with the publishers. Further, in consequence of their agreement with the third defendants, they had no control over the contents of the magazine printed by them and were not in a position to verify the contents of any article in the magazine. In that sense, they printed the article, without considering or caring whether it was true or false; they were indifferent to the truth. They are equated with a publisher who publishes materials or articles without considering or caring whether they are true or false. In that sense, they acted recklessly. In my judgment, for the reasons I have given, the fourth defendants were also actuated or affected by express malice.
 
 
 
There is one other aggravating factor. The passage appeared in a newspaper with the standing of IHT which has world wide circulation and a local circulation of 4,000 copies daily. Because of the standing of IHT the allegations were therefore more likely to be believed by its readers.
 Awards
Thus taking into account inter alia the standing and position of the plaintiffs, the gravity of the libellous allegations which were unprovoked and actuated by malice and the standing of IHT, I awarded the first and second plaintiffs $300,000 each and the third plaintiff $350,000.
In arriving at these awards, I had also taken into account the closing remarks of counsel for the defendants when he read out their apology in open court and reiterated that there was no truth in their allegations.
On costs, counsel for the defendants contended that the O 14 interlocutory judgments in awarding the plaintiffs costs on indemnity basis meant costs on indemnity basis up to the O 14 stage only as that was what he had agreed to before the registrar. This was disputed by counsel for the plaintiffs who also applied for certificates for two counsel. Accordingly, I reserved the order on costs and adjourned plaintiffs` applications for certificates for two counsel for hearing in chambers at a later date to enable counsel for all parties to inspect the court files on the proceedings before the registrar. A separate order on costs will be made.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The three appellants, Foong Seow Ngiu (Foong), Tan Aik Heng (Tan) and Lim Ping Hwa (Lim), were convicted by the High Court on a charge that, in furtherance of a common intention, they had in their possession on 8 April 1994 at Blk 62, Circuit Road, #08-307, Singapore 32 packets of substance containing not less than 26.37g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of ss 5(2) and 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) they committed the offence of trafficking in that quantity of diamorphine under s 5(1) of the Act. Against their convictions, all of them have now appealed.
 The prosecution case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case has been set out in detail in an earlier judgment of this court on appeal by the prosecution against the acquittal of Tan, which was reported in 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 244
  [
 PP v Tan Aik Heng 
]. We need only to recapitulate briefly such evidence. On 8 April 1994 at about 12pm, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) kept watch on the flat, #08-307, Blk 62 Circuit Road (the flat), which belonged jointly to Foong and his wife. At about 3pm Foong was seen leaving the flat, and on reaching the ground floor he was arrested by three narcotics officers after a brief struggle. At that time he had with him a brown envelope which contained ten sachets of yellow granular substance, later ascertained to be heroin. After his arrest, Foong was questioned by Acting Staff Sergeant Lim Hang Meng (Ag S/Sgt Lim), and certain answers were given which we shall deal with shortly. The narcotics officers then brought Foong to his flat and they opened the door with the key seized from Foong. On entering the flat they saw Foong`s wife, Ng Soi Muay, seated in the hall watching television. Lim was seen sitting at the entrance of the kitchen facing a large number of drug exhibits which were laid out before him and holding a plastic spoon in his right hand and a small plastic sachet in his left. Tan was seen sitting and leaning against the kitchen archway, facing Lim; Tan appeared to be only talking to Lim and was doing nothing else. All of them, including Foong`s wife, were placed under arrest.
The drug exhibits laid out before Lim and Tan were:
 
 
(a) one big packet of granular substance, later discovered to be heroin; 
 
(b) 31 sachets of granular substance, later also discovered to be heroin; 
 
(c) a stack of new empty plastic sachets; 
 
(d) a smaller loose sachet of heroin; 
 
(e) an improvised weighing scale which has a metal rod with hooks at each end, a string tied in the centre and which was taped to a chair in front of Lim and at one end of which was a plastic sachet with a one cent, five cents and 20 cents coin in it serving as counterweight. 
 
(f) three disposable lighters; 
 
(g) a pair of scissors; 
 
(h) a pair of tweezers; 
 
(i) two packets of Marlboro cigarettes; 
 
(j) a plastic container; and 
 
(k) a light brown envelope.
  
 
 
Senior Staff Sergeant Cheong Wah Chow (Sn S/Sgt Cheong), the investigating officer, arrived at the flat at about 4.20pm. He was briefed on the events that had transpired and took possession of all the exhibits. He seized from Lim a handphone and a wallet containing, amongst other things, four horse betting slips dated 3 April 1994 and one 4-digit slip dated 2 April 1994. A handphone and a wallet containing a shipyard certificate issued to Foong was seized from Foong. He seized from Tan a handphone, a pager and a sum of $3,600 from his pocket, $1,100 from his wallet and $15,500 from the glove compartment of his car.
The big packet and the 31 sachets had 389.97g of granular substance with a net diamorphine content of 26.37g. The big packet contained 150.30g and the 31 sachets contained 239.67g. The purity level was 6.76%. The ten sachets (seized from Foong on his arrest) contained 73.27g of granular substance with a net weight of 4.76g of diamorphine. The purity level was 6.46%. The difference in purity levels in relative terms was not significant. They were both of the same low grade of heroin.
Urine specimens from the three appellants were taken and on analysis were found to contain the following amounts of morphine:
 
 
(i) in Foong`s specimens, 49.29 micro grams per 5ml, 
 
(ii) in Tan`s specimens, 425.4 micro grams per 5ml, and 
 
(iii) in Lim`s specimens, 359.7 micro grams per 5ml.
  
 
 
There was thus evidence that they had taken drugs.
A statement was recorded from Tan under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC) and was admitted in evidence at the request of his counsel. The statement read as follows: 
 
I met `Ah Hwa` at the ground floor of Block 62 Circuit Road. `Ah Hwa` brought me to a flat on the 8th storey to chit-chat with his friend. I do not know the name of his friend. About five minutes later, CNB officers came and arrested all of us inside the flat.
 
 
 
The name `Ah Hwa` referred to Lim.
Lim`s statement taken under s 122(6) of the CPC was also admitted. It read as follows: 
 
When I went to the flat #08-307 at Block 62 Circuit Road, the heroin was already on the floor at the kitchen. The heroin does not belong to me and I do not know its ownership.
 
 
 
However, the admissibility of the statements made by Foong under ss 122(6) and 121 of the CPC was objected to. These, together with the oral answers given by him to Ag S/Sgt Lim at the time of arrest, formed the subject matter of a 
 voir dire 
. At the conclusion, the learned trial judge held that these statements were made by Foong voluntarily.
 Foong`s statements
The oral answers given by Foong to Ag S/Sgt Lim were to the effect that the brown envelope contained ten sachets of `peh hoon`. His s 122(6) statement was brief and read as follows: 
 
Ah Heng brought the heroin to my flat for packing. The heroin does not belong to me or my wife Ng Soi Muay.
 
 
 
Foong had clarified that Ah Heng was Tan.
His s 121 statement was recorded in two parts which, in so far as material, have been set out verbatim in the earlier judgment of this court: see 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 244
  at pp 249-250. Suffice it here to set out a summary thereof. In brief, it stated as follows. On 6 April 1994, Foong asked Lim to order 1lb of heroin from Tan and to ensure that Tan would not short-change him on the weight. Lim assured Foong that that would not happen and said that he would bring Tan to Foong`s flat to pack the pound of heroin into 60 packets. Lim quoted the price of $3,600 per pound which would have to be paid to Tan on delivery of the heroin. Foong explained that he ordered the heroin because he had an order for ten packets from one George at the price of $850 and that he also needed the balance for his own consumption and for future sale to George. On the evening of 7 April 1994 George telephoned Foong and wanted ten packets of heroin to which Foong replied that he did not have the stock at that time but could supply them on the following day. Foong said that on 8 April 1994 Lim and Tan came to his flat and Tan was introduced to him; Tan was carrying a plastic bag. They went to the kitchen where Tan took out the plastic packet of heroin and Foong handed to Lim $3,600, who in turn handed it to Tan. The three of them then took some heroin out for smoking. Foong then asked Lim to assist him to pack ten packets of heroin as he had a customer waiting. Lim then used the plastic spoon to scoop the heroin from the big plastic bag into smaller plastic packets and Foong sealed the ten packets of heroin by using a disposable lighter and metal tweezers. Not long thereafter George telephoned and said that he would soon be arriving at the ground floor of the flat to collect the ten packets of heroin. Foong then put the ten packets of heroin in a brown envelope and went downstairs. Before he left he asked Lim and Tan to continue packing the heroin into smaller packets.
 Foong`s defence
Foong gave evidence in his defence. He admitted that the drugs were his. His defence was that he was a moderate drug addict and that the drugs were mainly for his own consumption: the 31 packets and the large packet of heroin seized from his flat were for his own consumption. He knew a person named `George` and he admitted that he supplied George with heroin on request. However, he claimed that he did not sell the drugs to George. He did not make any profit and only charged George $5 per packet for transportation expenses. On 7 April 1994, George paged him three times, asking him for a supply of heroin. He told George that he did not have the drugs. On the morning of 8 April 1994, George paged him again. Foong told him that it was early and asked him to call again at 2pm. Foong eventually made an appointment to meet George in the vicinity of his block.
Foong said that Lim came to his flat at about 3pm after having telephoned to say that he would visit him to settle certain debts in connection with horse racing; Lim also requested to consume drugs at his flat. Lim brought along Tan who was then introduced to him. On entering the flat, Tan went to the toilet. In the meantime, he sat with Lim on the kitchen floor and smoked a cigarette spiked with heroin. After that he then left the apartment to go downstairs where he was arrested with the ten packets of heroin.
In the cross-examination by counsel for Tan, Foong said that the third call from George on 7 April 1994 was at about 5pm. At that time, he had only half a small packet of heroin. At 10pm that night, he received 1lb of heroin from one Ah Seng which cost $4,800. However, he paid Ah Seng $3,000 and owed him the balance of $1,800. Foong said that he did not know Ah Seng`s number; Ah Seng normally contacted him by pager.
On 8 April 1994, Foong woke up at 12pm. He consumed some heroin and prepared the improvised weighing scale. He packed ten packets for George. He then consumed some heroin and packed more heroin. In all, he packed a further 31 small sachets.
Foong said that he implicated Tan because he was frightened and also wanted to save his wife. He said that the contents of his s 122(6) statement were untrue. He was the owner of the drugs. Paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 of his s 121 statement implicating Tan were also untrue. He had already packed the 31 sachets, so the part implicating Tan and Lim were also not true.
On being cross-examined by counsel for Lim, Foong said that 1lb of heroin could not be bought for $3,600. He did not buy heroin from Ah Seng frequently. The drugs in the flat were packed by him, and there was no discussion between him and Lim or Tan as to what was to be done with the heroin. Neither Tan nor Lim took anything to his flat when they came on 8 April 1994. He did not speak to Lim about obtaining the drugs from Tan. He did not ask Lim to continue packing the heroin and he had not seen Lim packing any. He denied handing to Tan $3,600.
In the cross-examination by the learned deputy public prosecutor, Foong said that his only supplier was Ah Seng. He received his supplies from Ah Seng once every two or three months. However, he knew where to look for Ah Seng whenever he needed heroin. He sometimes bought 20 sachets of 8g each. They cost $80 per packet. Twenty sachets would last about a month. He spent about $1,600 a month on his consumption. He smoked about one packet of spiked cigarettes a day when working, and about two packets when not working. On the day of his arrest, he had already smoked five spiked cigarettes. Before he went to sleep at 3am, he had smoked ten spiked cigarettes. The reason why the doctors did not find any withdrawal symptoms was that by the time the doctors saw him the effect of heroin had worn off. Foong`s explanation for packing another 31 packets after packing ten for George was that he was free. He stopped at 31, notwithstanding that there were another 21 empty sachets lying nearby and another 280 empty sachets on the kitchen sideboard. He said that he supplied George with heroin, because George was his friend. He only charged George the cost of the drugs plus $5 per packet for transportation. He bought 1lb of heroin even though George wanted only ten packets, because he would consume about 20 packets a month. Furthermore, Ah Seng had persuaded him and said that he could owe him the money. Neither Tan nor Lim had anything to do with his obtaining the drugs. Foong reiterated that he had only implicated Tan in his s 122(6) statement to save himself and his wife. The investigating officer had said that implicating one boss was enough, so he did not implicate Lim. He implicated Lim in his s 121 statement because the CNB officers told him that if he did not accept the position as told to him then he would die. They told him to cooperate.
 Tan`s defence
Tan elected not to give evidence in his defence. Nor did he call any witness to give evidence on his behalf.
 Lim`s defence
Lim gave evidence in his defence. He said that he was a runner for a bookmaker. He was a drug addict and knew Foong as `Ah Tor` or `Ah Toh` sometime in 1974 or 1975 and Foong was a good friend of his. He (Lim) met Tan in the drug rehabilitation centre and knew Tan as `Ah Heng`. They had a good relationship. He knew Tan as a bookmaker and had placed bets with Tan even though he himself was a runner.
Lim said that he called Foong on 8 April 1994 to discuss horse racing bets with him. On learning that Foong was consuming drugs, he said that he would go over to consume drugs with him as well. Ten minutes later, Tan called him and asked him to settle his debts with Tan. The debts were for bets placed with Tan for `500 win` and `400 place` tickets. The total amount of bets placed were $3,600. He arranged to meet Tan on the ground floor of Block 62 at 3pm as he was going to Foong`s flat. They met at the appointed time. He paid Tan the sum of $3,600. Tan at that time had a stomach ache. He told Tan to accompany him to Foong`s flat. Tan did so and he introduced Tan to Foong, and immediately thereafter Tan went to the toilet. Foong then told Lim that he could consume drugs in the kitchen and pointed them out to him. They were under a chair. Foong said that he was going downstairs for a short while and left.
Lim said that he saw the various packets of heroin arranged in two neat rows under the chair as well as the drug related paraphernalia. He did not know what was the purpose for the improvised scale. He sat down in the kitchen, took out a small packet of heroin and smoked the heroin by using the method of `chasing the dragon`. Tan returned from the toilet and sat beside him. Tan smoked his own spiked cigarette. After smoking, Tan leaned against the wall with his eyes half-closed. At this stage, the CNB officers rushed in.
Lim`s explanation for having a spoon in his right hand and a small plastic sachet on his left was that he was trying to scoop half a spoon of heroin from the big packet into one of the small packets so that he could take it with him to the sauna, where he would be going with Tan. Lim said that he thought that Foong would not know if he scooped half a spoon from the big packet. He reiterated that the drug-related paraphernalia did not belong to him. He also identified several horse-racing and 4-D tickets which were seized from his wallet.
There was no cross-examination of Lim by counsel for Foong and Tan. In the cross-examination by the learned deputy public prosecutor, Lim said that Foong did not ask him to contact a drug supplier or contact Tan for heroin. He did not get in touch with Tan on 6 April 1994 to tell the latter that a friend called Ah Tor was looking for heroin. He did not ask Tan to meet him on the ground floor of Block 62 between 5pm to 6pm on 7 April 1994 and thereafter introduced Foong to Tan. He did not meet Tan there on 7 April 1994. Neither did he agree to be present on 8 April 1994 when Tan would meet Foong at Foong`s flat at about 12pm.
Lim denied that he went to Foong`s flat at 1pm. He did not get in touch with Tan through the pager; nor did Tan page him. Tan did not telephone him saying that he was on the ground floor and that he could not remember where the flat was. Lim denied that he then went downstairs to fetch Tan. Lim also denied that he saw Tan holding a plastic bag. Nor was it true that he saw Foong handing $3,600 to Tan and Foong opening the plastic bag to take out a bag of yellowish substance. Lim further denied that Foong asked him to repack the heroin. Nor did he see Foong repacking the heroin. Lastly, he also denied that Foong said that he was going downstairs to hand some drugs over to someone and asked him in the meanwhile to continue packing the drugs.
In view of these denials, the prosecution applied to cross-examine Lim on his s 121 statement with a view to contradicting him and also with a view to admitting the relevant portions of the statement under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) as evidence of facts stated therein of which direct oral evidence by Lim would be admissible. The underlined portions of Lim`s s 121 statements were shown to the learned trial judge and he held that there were serious discrepancies which would affect Lim`s credibility. An adjournment was granted over the weekend for Lim`s counsel to take instructions. On resumption of the hearing, Lim stated that the s 121 statement was not given voluntarily. A voir dire was then held to determine that issue and at the conclusion the learned trial judge held that the s 121 statement was given by him voluntarily, and the underlined portions were therefore admitted.
In those parts of the statement Lim said that Foong informed him that he was looking for heroin and enquired whether Lim had any contact. In consequence, he got in touch with Tan and informed the latter that his friend, Foong, was looking for heroin. He then arranged to meet Tan on the ground floor of Block 62, Circuit Road between 5pm and 6pm on the following day. Accordingly, on that day, 7 April 1994, they met sometime past 5pm at the appointed place and Lim brought Tan up to the flat and introduced him to Foong. Foong and Tan spoke to each other pertaining to heroin and its price. Tan then arranged to meet Foong the following day at about 12 noon and said that Lim should be present. On 8 April 1994 at about 1pm Lim went to Foong`s flat and was informed by the latter that Tan had not as yet arrived and he was requested to get in touch with Tan. He did so and Tan telephoned saying that he had been delayed and would be arriving sometime after 2pm. Shortly after that time, Tan got in touch with Lim informing him that Tan was on the ground floor of Block 62, Circuit Road but could not remember the particular flat. Lim thereupon went down to the ground floor and brought Tan to the flat. Foong and Tan then went to the kitchen where Tan handed the plastic bag to Foong and in return Foong handed the money to Tan saying that the amount was $3,600. Foong then opened the plastic bag and started to repack the heroin into smaller plastic packets and asked Lim to help him to do the repacking as he was in a hurry. Lim assisted Foong accordingly. After repacking a few packets Foong took them and said that he was going to hand them over to someone else on the ground floor.
 Further evidence of Lim
Lim was given an opportunity to explain the differences between the underlined portions of his s 121 statement and his testimony in court. However, his explanation was nothing more than a rehash of his evidence in the voir dire.
Further evidence was elicited from Lim relating to the $3,600, which he said he owed Tan. His evidence was that these were the bets of two punters, YP Heng and Ah Soon. They owed him $1,640 and $2,050 respectively. The odd amounts of $50 and $40 were Lim`s commission. Lim said that he had placed these bets with Tan. If they did not pay him, he would still be liable to Tan. When he was asked why he had not placed the bets at the Bukit Turf Club, as the exhibits seized included tickets from there, he explained that his friends were `broke` and they also wanted both `win` and `place` bets. However, the Bukit Turf Club tickets showed both `win` and `place` bets. Lim explained that these were last minute bets.
Counsel for Foong and Tan were offered a further opportunity to cross-examine Lim, especially in connection with the contents of the underlined portions of his s 121 statement. On cross-examination by counsel for Foong, he reiterated that neither he nor Tan visited Foong`s flat on 7 April 1994. Counsel for Tan declined the offer to cross-examine Lim.
 Decision below
 
 
 
 Foong
 
Foong did not deny that the heroin found in his flat was in his possession. His defence was that he was a drug addict and that he bought the heroin for both consumption and sale. His counsel submitted that he only had to show that 11.37g were for Foong`s consumption and he intended to traffic only in 15g or less. Foong`s evidence was that he was a moderate drug addict and he consumed half a packet or about 4g per day. This was rejected by the learned trial judge on the ground that there was no credible basis for this submission. The learned trial judge found that ten small packets had already been packed and were being carried away by Foong for delivery to George. Another 31 packets had already been packed and lay on the floor and 21 empty sachets were there awaiting to be used for packing. He inferred that a total of some 60 packets were to be packed and this figure was stated in Foong`s statement. The learned trial judge was unable to accept that 23 small packets would last Foong only over a month. If Foong had been a moderate addict, he would have been referred to the hospital for his withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, Foong said that all the drugs were for his own consumption, with the exception of the ten sachets to be delivered to George. In that case, it would be unnecessary to pack an additional 31 packets. The learned trial judge was of the view that the fact that Lim was caught with one hand on a spoon and another on a bag packet showed that the packing was continuing. He was therefore of the view that only the smallest packet was meant for Foong`s consumption. There was no need to deduct this from the total amount he was charged.
The learned trial judge also disbelieved Foong`s evidence that he was not making a profit from the ten sachets he sold to George. For one thing, he made $5 per packet for transportation even though the drugs were delivered on the ground floor of his block. He believed that Foong bought the heroin for $3,600, which would then be repacked into 60 packets and the cost per packet would only be $60.
 Lim
The learned trial judge held that by virtue of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act Lim`s s 121 statement could be used as evidence of the truth of its contents. In this respect, he believed that what was stated in the s 121 statement was the truth. It was an amazing coincidence that the amount owed to Tan was $3,600, which was what was found on Tan. Lim said that he bet between $8,000 and $10,000 the previous day, but he could only name two punters, who happened to bet $3,600. Lim said that in accepting bets from his friends and placing them with other bookies such as Tan he only stood to make a small commission of ten cents per bet; yet he assumed all the liability for the bets with Tan, as in case of default he would be personally liable to pay Tan if he was not paid by his punters such as YP Heng and Ah Soon. The risk he took was not commensurate with the rewards. The learned trial judge had no doubt that Lim was untruthful.
Lim`s explanation that he was pilfering some heroin was also disbelieved. It would have been easy enough to just secret away one of the small packets. From Lim`s proximity to the drugs and the drug related paraphernalia and his being caught with a spoon in one hand and a small packet in the other, the trial judge concluded that he was caught in the act of repacking the drugs.
The learned trial judge held that Lim`s s 121 statement was a confession. Bearing in mind the factors in s 147(5) of the Evidence Act, the learned trial judge was satisfied that its contents were true. There was no incentive to conceal material facts when making the statement as Lim had incriminated himself. The discrepancies between that statement and Foong`s statements were minor. The only contradiction was that Foong had said in his statement that Tan was at his flat for the first time on 8 April 1994. The learned trial judge was of the view that the version in Lim`s statement was true. Lim had said that Sn S/Sgt Cheong was referring to Foong`s statement when recording Lim`s statement. Yet, Foong`s statement made no mention of this visit. There must therefore have been such a meeting, as it was only mentioned in Lim`s statement. As for Lim`s s 122(6) statement, this was wholly self-exculpatory and was not accepted by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge therefore disbelieved Lim`s evidence in court, the salient facts in which were not even mentioned in his s 122(6) statement.
 Tan
The learned trial judge was of the view that the only evidence against Tan was Foong`s s 122(6) and s 121 statements, and the underlined portions of Lim`s s 121 statement. As for the contradiction between Foong`s s 122(6) and s 121 statements, the learned trial judge formed the view that the s 122(6) statement was self-serving.
Tan`s s 122(6) statement was of no assistance to him as it lacked any material content. He did not even mention anything about collecting a debt or having a stomach ache. The learned trial judge treated such failure to mention his defence as amounting to corroboration. Relying on 
 Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP, 
 he was of the view that Tan could be convicted if he was satisfied from the evidence in the confessions beyond a reasonable doubt of Tan`s guilt. He was satisfied that Tan had physical control and possession.
 Common intention
The learned trial judge relied on the Court of Appeal`s view in 
 PP v Tan Aik Heng 
 that the prosecution in proving trafficking only had to show that all the three appellants had possession of the drugs and this gave rise to the presumption that their joint possession was for the purpose of trafficking which in turn under s 5(2) constituted trafficking. He found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that all the three appellants had joint possession of the drugs as evidenced by their acts of complicity and unity of criminal behaviour and that consequently they had the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. The burden then shifted to the appellants to show on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were not for the purpose of trafficking and they had failed to discharge this burden.
 The appeal
 
 
 
 Foong`s appeal
 
At the time of Foong`s arrest he had in his possession ten sachets of granular substance which contained heroin. He admitted that he was then on his way to deliver the ten sachets to one George. Later, in his flat there were found further quantities of heroin: one big packet of granular substance and 31 sachets of similar substance, all containing heroin. He knew that the granular substance contained heroin. The quantities (found in his flat) on analysis were found to contain 26.37g of diamorphine. Foong therefore had possession of the drugs and under s 17 of the Act he is presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, and under s 5(2) of the Act, he committed the offence of trafficking in that quantity of drugs, unless he could successfully rebut the presumption under s 17.
That was what he sought to do. There was evidence that he was a drug addict and the specimens of his urine taken soon after his arrest were found on analysis to contain morphine. In his evidence he said that he was a moderate addict consuming half a packet of heroin or about 4g of heroin per day by spiking his cigarettes. On this evidence, his counsel submitted that out of the 26.37g of heroin, the subject matter of the charge, 11.37g or 43.1% thereof were for Foong`s consumption and that the balance being only 15g or less was intended for sale. This argument was rejected by the learned trial judge and, in our view, rightly, on the ground that there was `no credible basis` in support and there was evidence to the contrary. First, ten sachets had already been packed and Foong was on his way to deliver them to George. He had agreed to sell these ten packets to George, and whether they were sold at cost or at a small profit is immaterial. Secondly, in his flat there were 31 sachets which had been packed and were lying on the floor. There were further 21 empty sachets lying there to be used for packing the remaining granular substance from the big packet and Lim was engaged in the process of packing the drugs. Lying there also were all the drug related paraphernalia. The inference is that all these drugs would be packed into sachets of approximately 8g each and were intended for sale or distribution. The best that can be said for Foong is that the drugs were meant both for consumption and for sale. But in this case the fact that some of the drugs would be used for his own consumption is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in view of the evidence which we have just discussed.
For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to deal with the voluntariness in the making of the statements by Foong. In respect of the oral answers made by him after his arrest, Foong admitted at the trial that he was going to deliver ten sachets of heroin to George. Therefore, admissibility of this is of little materiality. As for the s 122(6) statement, Foong had since told the court that he was the owner of the drugs. Again, little turned on this statement. As for the s 121 statement, the learned trial judge did not believe Foong and accepted the evidence of Sn S/Sgt Cheong and the CNB interpreter. In our view, there is nothing to show that this decision was clearly wrong, and we agree with the reasons given by him. Even if this statement was excluded, there was ample evidence against Foong. He was found in possession of the drugs and he had to rebut the presumption that he had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. That he has failed to do for the reasons we have given.
 Lim`s appeal
For convenience, we turn to Lim`s appeal first before we consider that of Tan. The most damning evidence against him is the uncontested evidence that Lim was caught with a spoon in one hand and a small empty sachet in the other and with all the relevant drug exhibits laid before him. In particular, there were in front of him (i) a big packet of granular substance, (ii) 31 sachets of similar substance already packed, and (iii) 21 empty sachets awaiting to be used for packing. The substance from the big packet and 31 sachets had a total diamorphine content of 26.37g. On this evidence the inference is that Lim was at the time engaged in repacking the heroin from the big packet into the sachets. Lim`s explanation was that he was trying to secret away a little heroin to take to the sauna for his own consumption. If that was only what he wanted, there was no need for all the 31 sachets and the big packet and also all the drug related paraphernalia to be laid out before him. This explanation was not mentioned at all in his s 122(6) statement. The learned trial judge rejected his explanation and he was perfectly justified in so doing. The evidence against Lim is overwhelming and there is no justification for disturbing the learned trial judge`s findings. He was also in possession of the drugs and under s 17 he is presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and he has not rebutted the presumption.
It is also necessary to deal with the issue of the voluntariness in his making of the statement. The first complaint is that a Hokkien interpreter was not used during the recording of the statement. This complaint centred on the fact that Sn S/Sgt Cheong is a Cantonese and Lim is a Hokkien, and it was suggested that on that basis, an interpreter was indispensable. We are unable to accept this contention. The mere fact that Sn S/Sgt Cheong is a Cantonese does not mean that he cannot understand Hokkien. We agree with the learned trial judge that the only issue, so far as this question is concerned, is the competence of Sn S/Sgt Cheong in the Hokkien dialect. On this, there was evidence from Sn S/Sgt Cheong that he had passed a test in Hokkien in the seventies and had been using it frequently in the course of his work. The learned trial judge accepted his evidence and found that he was competent in Hokkien. We have no reason to differ from the learned trial judge.
The second objection raised by counsel was that Sn S/Sgt Cheong did not state at the end of the statement that the statement had been read over to Lim and that he had been offered the opportunity to make corrections. According to counsel, this omission is a serious irregularity. We are unable to agree. In our view, what is important is not whether that clause was included at the end of the statement, but whether the statement was read over to the maker and, after correction, if any, signed by him. This is a requirement stated in s 121(3) of the CPC. The mere absence of such a clause does not make the statement inadmissible if the requirements of that subsection have been fulfilled. In the present case, the learned trial judge had directed his mind to this question and had adequately dealt with it.
So far as the allegations of inducements, threats and promises are concerned, these were rejected by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge had the benefit of hearing and seeing both Sn S/Sgt Cheong and Lim giving evidence and he disbelieved Lim. We can find no basis for disturbing his finding.
We now turn to the evidential value of Lim`s s 121 statement. In our view, it is clear from the terms of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act that the underlined parts of the statement may be used as evidence of the facts stated therein. Section 147(3) states: 
 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 
 
 
And s 147(5) further states: 
 
In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
It was argued by counsel for Lim that notwithstanding s 147(3) Lim`s s 121 statement is not admissible in evidence by reason of s 122(1) of the CPC which provides: 
 
Except as provided in this section, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement admissible under section 141.
 
 
 
The short answer to this is that Sn S/Sgt Cheong who recorded the statement is a narcotics officer, and it is settled law that a narcotics officer is not a police officer and therefore the admissibility of that statement is not subject to s 122(1) of the CPC; it is governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act: 
 Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP 
pp 26-28. It was also urged on us on behalf of the prosecution that the statement is admissible in evidence under s 122(5) of the CPC, and that there is no inconsistency between s 147(3) of the Evidence Act and s 122 of the CPC. No contrary argument was advanced on behalf of Lim. We are disposed to agree with the prosecution.
 Tan`s appeal
We now turn to Tan`s appeal. Tan did not give evidence in his defence. The main evidence against him consisted of the following. First, there was the circumstantial evidence that $3,600 was found in his pocket, $1,100 in his wallet and $15,500 was found in the glove compartment of his car. He was also in possession of the pager and handphone. There was also the evidence that he was found in close proximity to and facing the drug exhibits while Lim was engaged in packing the drugs. Secondly, there were Foong`s s 122(6) and s 121 statements and the underlined portions of Lim`s s 121 statement.
The learned trial judge had previously held that Foong`s confessions implicating Tan were not even prima facie reliable. However, after the case had been remitted back to him and he had heard Foong`s and Tan`s evidence he held that the charge against Tan had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. This, of course, was a marked reversal of his earlier findings of fact. Counsel for Tan submitted that such reversal of findings was unwarranted. We therefore turn to examine the basis of these findings and the evidence adduced before the learned trial judge.
First, the trial judge drew an adverse inference against Tan for not disclosing in his s 122(6) statement the defence that he was at Foong`s flat to settle gambling debts and to use the toilet. Instead, he elected to say that he met Lim downstairs and that Lim brought him up to the flat to `chit-chat` with Lim`s friend and that there he was arrested. The learned trial judge held that he was entitled to treat this failure as amounting to a corroboration of the evidence against him as contained in Foong`s and Lim`s statements. In our view, such an inference, with respect, is not justified. It was not Tan`s defence that he went to Foong`s flat to settle the gambling debts and to use the toilet. That was what Lim said. Tan therefore could not be said to have failed to disclose in his s 122(6) statement this defence.
We now turn to Foong`s and Lim`s statements which implicated Tan. Counsel for Tan had drawn the court`s attention to a number of discrepancies between the version of the events described in Foong`s s 121 statement and that in Lim`s s 121 statement. First, Foong in his statement said that on 6 April 1994 he called Lim and told him to order one pound of heroin from Tan. He asked Lim to tell Tan not to short-change him as to the weight of the heroin. He also said that Lim quoted the price of $3,600. Lim in his s 121 statement, on the other hand, made no mention of such instructions from Foong, and the amount and price of the heroin were not discussed. Secondly, Lim said that on 7 April 1994, he brought Tan to Foong`s flat sometime past 5pm and introduced Tan to Foong. Thereafter, Tan spoke to Foong about the heroin and the price. An arrangement was then made to meet again the next day. Foong`s s 121 statement, on the other hand, made no mention of such a meeting. Indeed, Foong said in his s 121 statement that he met Tan the first time on 8 April 1994 when the latter was introduced to him by Lim on that day. Thirdly, Lim stated that he went to Foong`s flat at 1.00 pm on 8 April 1994 and Foong asked Lim why Tan had not as yet arrived. This was never mentioned in Foong`s s 121 statement. Instead, all that was said was that Lim brought Tan to Foong`s flat at about 3pm and introduced Tan to Foong and Tan sold the drugs to Foong. Lastly, Foong said in his s 121 statement that he handed the $3,600 to Lim, who in turn handed it to Tan. Lim`s statement, however, said that Foong handed the money to Tan in the kitchen, and that Lim heard Foong saying that the amount was $3,600.
These are indeed discrepancies; but we do not think that they are truly material. The two statements were consistent on the core transaction, which was that Tan sold the heroin to Foong for $3,600 at Foong`s flat and that the sale was arranged or procured by Lim and was consummated in Foong`s flat. It is often the case that when the same event is narrated by two different persons, some parts of the details do not match. What is important is that the material parts do, and in this case, they do. We are therefore of the view that the learned trial judge was correct in holding that there were no material discrepancies between the two statements.
The learned trial judge also drew an adverse inference against Tan from his failure to give evidence in his defence. The evidence adduced before him clearly called for an explanation from Tan. He therefore held that the absence of such explanation was a further factor in the findings he made against Tan. In our judgment, in this case the learned trial judge was entitled to draw such inference against Tan.
 Common intention
We turn finally to the issue of common intention. It was contended on behalf of all the appellants that there was not in existence the common intention entertained by all the three of them, in furtherance of which the offence they were jointly charged was committed, and accordingly an essential ingredient of the charge has not been proved. This argument was advanced principally by counsel for Foong, with whom the counsel for the other appellants associated themselves. His submission was briefly this. Assuming that the evidence adduced by the prosecution was accepted, each of the three appellants had different intention at all material times. Before the drugs were brought to the flat, the intention of Foong was to buy the drugs, that of Tan was to sell them and that of Lim was to introduce and procure Tan to come to the flat and sell the drugs to Foong. After the drugs had been sold, Tan had no further interest in the drugs he sold and he merely remained in the flat to have a chat with Lim and was not engaged in repacking the drugs. Lim was engaged in repacking the drugs at the request of Foong. His intention was merely to assist Foong. Foong having bought the drugs became the owner thereof. His intention was to keep them for his own consumption and to sell a part thereof to George. Hence, at all material times, the intention of each of the three parties was manifestly different. They were not acting in concert at any material time and there was thus no pre-arranged plan. Counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of this court in 
 PP v Ho So Mui 
 at p 66: 
 
On a charge involving common intention, the prosecution had to show that there was a pre-arranged plan to commit a criminal act and that the crime forming subject was done in concert pursuant to that arranged plan.
 
 
 
Reverting to the facts, counsel submitted that clearly there was an absence of any pre-arranged plan which was a requisite in establishing the presence of a common intention. Further, assuming that all three of them had joint possession of the drugs, such joint possession does not amount to common intention to traffic in the drugs in question. Accordingly, there was no criminal act committed in furtherance of a common intention and the charge founded on s 34 was erroneous and all the three appellants had been wrongly convicted on the present charge.
We think that this argument ignores the relevant provisions of the Act under which the three appellants were charged. As we have said in 
 PP v Tan Aik Heng, 
 the prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code to establish liability of all the accused for the criminal act, ie the offence, committed by one or more of them in furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was not the sale and purchase of the one pound of heroin that took place between Tan and Foong at the latter`s flat through the instrumentality of Lim. The criminal act was the trafficking in the quantity of diamorphine in question at the material time, and the act of trafficking was not any of the acts as defined in s 2 of the Act. The offence here was founded on possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The basis for this is s 5(2) of the Act, which provides: 
 
For the purpose of this Act, a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.
 
 
 
Now, the question is who had possession of the drugs at the material time. The drugs were found in Foong`s flat and he admitted that he was in possession of the drugs, and had repacked the drugs into smaller sachets. As for Lim, he was caught in the act of repacking the very same drugs in Foong`s flat. Lim also had possession. Thus Foong and Lim were in joint possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in them. Both of them committed the criminal act, ie the offence of trafficking.
The next question relates to Tan`s involvement. On this question, we assume for the moment that Tan was not in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. On that assumption, Tan would only be liable for the criminal act, if there was a common intention among the three of them, in furtherance of which Foong and Lim committed the criminal act. What then was the common intention? The common intention was to put Foong or Lim or both of them in possession of the drugs. All three of them had acted in concert and there was a pre-arranged plan to bring the drugs to Foong. Prior to delivery of the drugs to Foong, each of them was engaged in carrying out a different act: Tan was engaged in obtaining the drugs for sale and delivery to Foong; Lim was engaged in procuring Tan to come to the flat to deliver the drugs to Foong; and Foong was engaged in asking Lim to obtain the drugs for him. The drugs were eventually brought to the flat and were sold and delivered to Foong. Thus all their separate acts resulted in Foong having possession of the drugs at the material time. As he had possession of the drugs, s 17 of the Act operates and he is presumed to have had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of s 5(2) he committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs. The resulting criminal act, i e the offence, was committed by Foong. In 
 Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor 
 the Privy Council said: 
 
Section 34 deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for `that act` and `the act` in the latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by `a criminal act` in the first part, because they refer to it:
 
 
 
...
In other words, `a criminal act` means that unity of criminal behaviour, which results in something for which an individual would be punishable if it were done by himself alone, that is a criminal offence.
We find this passage wholly apposite in the context of this case. What the parties did here fell squarely within this pronouncement. As we have said, all the three appellants did separate acts, and these acts were done in furtherance of a common intention and the common intention was to put Foong in possession of the drugs; and the acts did result in Foong having possession of the drugs and by virtue of s 17 of the Act, he is presumed to have the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and further by virtue of s 5(2) he committed the offence of trafficking in those drugs.
In 
 Mimi Wong v PP 
this court approved that passage of the judgment of the Privy Council. Wee Chong Jin CJ in delivering the judgment of the court, after quoting the passage said, at p 79: 
 
It is clear from the Privy Council`s interpretation of the words `criminal act` that it is the result of a criminal act which is a criminal offence. It then remains, in any particular case, to find out the actual offence constituted by the `criminal act`. If the nature of the offence depends on a particular intention, the intention of the actual doer of the criminal act has to be considered. What this intention is will decide the offence committed by him and then s 34 applies to make the others vicariously or collectively liable for the same offence. The intention that is an ingredient of the offence constituted by the criminal act is the intention of the actual doer and must be distinguished from the common intention of the doer and his confederates. It may be identical with the common intention or it may not. Where it is not identical with the common intention, it must nevertheless be consistent with the carrying out of the common intention, otherwise the criminal act done by the actual doer would not be in furtherance of the common intention. ...
 
 
 
Again, applying this passage of the judgment to this case, the actual offence constituted by the criminal act was possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and the persons who committed the criminal act were Foong and Lim and the intention of these two was to have the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and s 34 was invoked to render Tan liable for that criminal act. If s 34 applies in this case, as we think that it does, it does not matter whether Tan had possession of the drugs at the material time.
Section 34 is an enabling provision, and it was invoked to render all three of them liable for the criminal act committed by one or more of them. If, however, the criminal act was committed by all of them then it is unnecessary to invoke s 34. In this case, even without invoking s 34, the prosecution has proved the charge against all the three appellants, ie that they trafficked in the quantity of drugs in question. The basis for this is s 18(4) which states: 
 
Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
 
 
 
Tan brought the drugs to the flat, sold them to Foong through Lim. Having sold them he remained there and saw the drugs being repacked. Soon after delivery he saw Foong leaving the flat with ten sachets to be delivered to George and he remained there whilst Lim was re-packing the drugs. In these circumstances, he had knowledge of and consented to Foong and Lim having possession of the drugs. By virtue of s 18(4) the drugs were `deemed` to be in the possession of each and all of them.
The next question is whether the presumption under s 17 arises, since possession of the drugs by Tan is established only by virtue of s 18(4). It has been decided in 
 Low Kok Wai v PP 
 that the presumption under s 17 would only arise if possession of the drugs has been proved, and it may be said that possession under s 18(4) is not possession that has been proved. In our opinion, the answer to this is twofold. First, it has been proved that Tan had brought the drugs to the flat and sold them to Foong pursuant to an arrangement made by or through Lim. There is no question that Tan knew that what he had sold to Foong were drugs. His knowledge and handling of the drugs had been proved. It is true that at common law as he had sold and delivered the drugs to Foong, he no longer had possession of the drugs. But by virtue of s 18(4) and on the facts of the case he was deemed to be in possession of the drugs: he had knowledge of and consented to Foong and also Lim having possession of the drugs. In that sense, possession has been proved. Secondly, even without the presumption under s 17, there was sufficient evidence to show that the drugs were in the possession of all three of them for the purpose of trafficking. After the sale and delivery, ten sachets of drugs were packed from the quantity sold by Tan, and Foong went out to deliver them to George. There were 31 similar sachets also packed by Foong or Lim or both of them from the same source. The inference is that these were intended for trafficking. Tan was present throughout and could hardly say that he did not know the intended purpose of the drugs. It is true that as Foong was the only one who had bought the drugs and therefore he was the only one who was capable of trafficking in the drugs. Neither Tan nor Lim could do so, as the drugs did not belong to them. That however is immaterial. All three of them had possession of the drugs and the intended purpose of the drugs was for trafficking. It does not matter if only one of them would or could traffic in those drugs.
 Conclusion
In the result, all the three appeals fail and are dismissed.

This was an appeal against the decision of a district judge acquitting and discharging the respondent on the first of three charges for want of a prima facie case. I allowed the appeal and now give my reasons for my decision.
The first charge read: 
 
You, Sng Siew Ngoh, f/35 years, NRIC No 1367230Z, are charged that you, sometime in December 1992, at No 111-A Koon Seng Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Lea Credo, to wit, by poking her eyes with your fingers which resulted in the permanent privation of the sight in the said Lea Credo`s right eye, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The respondent was also charged with voluntarily causing hurt by biting and kicking the victim, as well as by spraying insecticide into her eyes. The judge found that a prima facie case was made out in respect of these two charges.
 The prosecution`s case
The relevant facts may be stated briefly. The complainant, the sister-in-law of the respondent, received on 8 December 1992 a request from her brother, the respondent`s husband, to examine the victim, who was the respondent`s maid. The victim was found to have a number of injuries, particularly swollen eyes. The next day, 9 December, the complainant took the victim to a specialist, Dr Ang, who found that there was swelling, visual impairment and abrasion of the cornea. On 14 December, Dr Ang again examined the victim, and it appeared that her condition was improving. Unfortunately, two weeks later, on 28 December, a retinal tear was found in the victim`s right eye. After an operation, the tear appeared to have been mended, but scarring of the retina occurred, leading eventually to blindness of the right eye. The left eye had by then been cured of a cataract. In March 1994, the complainant once again found that the victim had been bitten. When the victim declined to make a report to the police, the complainant made one herself.
 The victim
The victim was called as a prosecution witness. She testified that she had stayed with the complainant`s mother for a couple of months after she was first brought to the complainant. Subsequently, she returned to the respondent but was brought back to the complainant`s mother after the operation. Then she returned to the respondent on her own. After the police report was made, the victim was offered alternative accommodation by the Philippine embassy but declined to accept it. In the meantime, she had also renewed her contract with the respondent and her husband.
The victim gave evidence in court that the swelling was caused accidentally when some insecticide got into her eyes while she was attempting to get rid of insects. The respondent had attempted to show the victim, who was holding a can of insecticide, the proper method of spraying. However, in doing so, some insecticide got sprayed into the victim`s eyes. The victim denied that she was assaulted by the respondent in any other way. She gave a statutory declaration to the effect that she did not wish to proceed against the respondent.
In view of the evidence given by the victim, who was ostensibly a prosecution witness, the prosecution applied to impeach her credit on the basis of a statement made by her to the investigating officer on 27 March 1994 at the complainant`s mother`s home. That statement revealed that the respondent had assaulted her several times, with the most serious being an incident in December 1992 in which the respondent had intentionally inserted her finger into both the victim`s eyes.
 The decision
The trial judge accepted that the victim`s credit should be impeached. However, he held, after reviewing the authorities and the legislative materials, that he was precluded from applying s 147(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). This would have allowed the impeaching statement to be relied upon for the truth of the facts stated: 
 PP v Sagar s/o Suppiah Retnam 
(CC 6 /94) (unreported), in which it was held that s 147(3) could not apply to a statement governed by s 122 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
As the statement by the victim was the only evidence of voluntarily causing hurt, it was held that the elements of voluntariness and the causing of hurt required under s 325 were not met. The trial judge was also of the opinion that the prosecution`s evidence did not disclose that the poking of the respondent`s eye had caused the blindness. In his view, the evidence of the eye specialist was that the injury to the eye was more likely to have been caused by a blunt object, rather than a jab by a finger. Hence, the conclusion reached was that, even if the statement was admitted for the truth of the facts stated, the prosecution would still not have been able to establish causation; no prima facie case had been made out.
An application was then made by the prosecution for a stay of the proceedings, under s 198(1) CPC, on the other charges while this appeal was brought. The trial judge granted it on the basis that the outcome of this appeal on the question of law, namely, the application of s 147(3), would be relevant as well to the other charges.
 The appeal
The prosecution`s appeal was on the basis that the trial judge erred in not admitting the statement for the truth of the facts stated, once the credit of the victim had been impeached. He had also failed, the contention went, to consider that the evidence of the eye specialist did not rule out the jabbing of the eye, or that the complainant had testified that she had been told by the victim that she was so hit, or that a reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence that it was the respondent who had caused the blindness. The prosecution argued that there was a failure to apply the proper test to determine whether there was a prima facie case.
 The respondent`s case
The respondent argued that s 122(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code prohibited the use of statements made to the police unless they fell within the exceptions in s 122(3). That being so, there was no evidence that the respondent had poked the eyes of the victim. Neither was there sufficient evidence that the poking of the eyes could cause the loss of sight suffered by the victim; there was no case to answer.
 The issues
The issues which arose were as follows:
 
 
(1) whether the operation of s 147(3) Evidence Act is precluded by s 122 CPC; and 
 
(2) whether the appropriate test for determining a prima facie case was applied by the judge.
  
 
 
 
 The operation of s 147(3)
 
Section 147(3) states: 
 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 
 
 
There was no controversy as to the effect of s 147(3). Rather the issue was how it was to operate alongside s 122 of the CPC. Section 122(1) reads: 
 
Except as provided in this section, no statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation made under this Chapter shall be used in evidence other than a statement that is a written statement admissible under section 141.
 
 
 
Section 141, which deals with conditioned statements adduced in preliminary inquiries, is not relevant here. Section 122(2) continues: 
 
When any witness is called for the prosecution or for the defence, other than the accused, the court shall, on the request of the accused or the prosecutor, refer to any statement made by that witness to a police officer in the course of a police investigation under this Chapter and may then, if the court thinks it expedient in the interests of justice, direct the accused to be furnished with a copy of it; and the statement may be used to impeach the credit of the witness in the manner provided by the Evidence Act.
 
 
 
In 
 Tan Khee Koon v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 724
  and also as argued by the prosecution below, the reference by s 122(2) to impeachment proceedings under the Evidence Act must be read as one to s 157, which states: 
 
The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:
 
 
 
(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted;
 
 
 
While no explicit reference is made, para (c) must point to s 147 which deals with cross-examination on previous statements made by a witness. The whole of that section reads: 
 
(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined, without such writing being shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.
(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such statement. 
(3) Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence would be admissible. 
(4) Where a person called as a witness in any proceedings is cross-examined on a document used by him to refresh his memory, that document may be made evidence in those proceedings; and where a document or any part of a document is received in evidence by virtue of this subsection, any statement made in that document or part by the person using the document to refresh his memory shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible. 
(5) In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts. 
(6) Notwithstanding any other written law or rule of practice requiring evidence to be corroborated or regulating the manner in which uncorroborated evidence is to be treated, a statement which is admissible in evidence by virtue of this section shall not be capable of corroborating evidence given by the maker of the statement.
 
 
 
Section 147(1) governs the cross-examination as to previous statements. Subsection (2) deals with the proof of the making of the statement. Subsection (3) then makes it clear that such statements may be relied upon for the truth of the facts stated. The next subsection, sub-s (4), confers a similar quality on statements contained in documents used to refresh memory. Subsection (5) then stipulates the factors governing the weight to be attached to the statement as evidence. Finally, sub-s (6) states that a statement admissible in evidence under this section does not constitute corroboration of evidence by the maker of the statement.
It is clear then that there is a general scheme governing cross-examination on previous statements. Section 157 of the Evidence Act cannot be said to only bring in sub-s (1). The other subsections also govern the cross-examination of previous statements. They cannot be separated from sub-s (1). Through this reference to s 147, the whole of that section is brought in, including s 147(3). It also has to be noted that s 147(3) explicitly states that it applies `in any proceedings`, and does not purport to be restricted to specific circumstances, which would have to be the case had it been intended that s 147(1) were to operate independently of s 147(3). There is therefore no conflict between s 147 and s 122 as the latter makes reference to it. The statement could thus be relied on for the truth of the facts contained in it.
Although the prosecution put forward this argument below, the trial judge expressed no opinion on it. The trial judge`s reasoning was that he was bound by prior case authority, namely, the High Court decision of 
 PP v Sagar s/o Suppiah Retnam 
. The judge in that case, Kan Ting Chiu J, after examining the Parliamentary materials was of the opinion that, considering the purpose of s 122 and the expressed legislative intention in introducing the amendment leading to s 147(3), the latter could not override the former. On appeal [
 Sagar v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 660
 ], in addition to the reasoning adopted in 
 Sagar 
, a number of other points were raised against the application of s 147(3).
 Arguments against applicability
The arguments against the application of s 147(3) in the case of a statement made under s 122 may be grouped as follows, namely, that:
 
 
(a) it would be contrary to the purpose of s 122; 
 
(b) s 147 is not within the list of exceptions to s 122(1); and 
 
(c) no rationale supports its application.
  
 
 
These will be examined in turn.
 Purpose of s 122
It was considered in 
 Sagar 
that it would be contrary to the purpose of s 122 if s 147(3) were to enable the inconsistent statement of a witness to be used as evidence of the facts stated. That purpose was identified by Kan Ting Chiu J as the regulation of the use of police statements (at p 23 of his grounds of decision) In this instant appeal, it was argued that the prohibition in s 122(1) against the use of statements made in the course of police investigations was intended to protect the accused against overzealous police officers and untruthful witnesses and the danger of relying on records made by police officers unfamiliar with the law of evidence. 
 Yohannan v R 
 
 
[1963] MLJ 57
  was cited in support of part of this proposition. In that case, it was said by Chua J at p 58 that: 
 
The object of s 121(2) [the equivalent section then] is to protect the accused against untruthful witnesses.
 
 
 
 
 
 Sarkar on the Code of Criminal Procedure 
 
 and the cases cited there were relied upon for the other portions of the proposition, that is, that protection is to provided against overzealous or unreliable police officers.
The recording of statements in criminal proceedings ought to be closely regulated, yet it is doubtful that the deprecatory attitude towards police officers should be condoned in these times. There is every reason for the courts to accept the professionalism of police officers and the efficiency of their training. In any event, any perceived shortcomings in the qualifications or abilities of the recorders of the statement ought to be a matter of weight only. Similarly with any possible overzealousness in the recorders.
Rather, s 122(1) ensures that evidence given out of court to police officers are only adduced as evidence if there is either a good foundation for the reliability of these out of court statements either as being exceptions to the hearsay rule or exceptions governed by policy considerations that is, being within one of the exceptions listed in ss 122(2), (3) and (5). This is reflected imperfectly in the contention expressed in 
 Yohannan 
that a basis for the prohibition contained in s 122(1) is that witnesses may be untruthful.
It must next be considered whether s 122(1) and cases interpreting it would rule out the application of s 147(3).
 Section 122(1)
It was contended by the respondent that s 122(1) operates in all cases in the absence of clear exemptions as contained in s 122(3). Section 122(3) reads: 
 
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any statement made in the course of an identification parade or falling within section 27 or 32(a) of the Evidence Act.
 
 
 
Section 27, Evidence Act, deals with the use of information from an accused leading to the discovery of a fact. Section 32(a) covers statements made by a person as to the cause of his death.
Section 122(1), under this reasoning, is regarded as overriding other provisions unless its operation is explicitly excluded. Support for this reasoning is derived from the approach taken by the courts in the past as disclosed in a number of cases. Among these was 
 Wee Boo Soh v R 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 93
 , where it was said by Murray-Aynsley CJ at p 93: 
 
In the first place, in the course of the hearing, an officer of the police gave evidence of statements made by the witness apparently to corroborate the evidence within the meaning of s 157 of the Evidence Ordinance [equivalent to s 159 of the Act]. But I think that in criminal matters the use of this section is subject to the restrictions of s 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code [equivalent to s 122 of the CPC]. To be admissible such statements must be made either at or about the time when the fact took place or before any authority legally competent to investigate. Here the statements were not made at or about the time when the events took place. They must, to be admissible, have been made in the course of an investigation. They were not admissible under s 117 [ s 115] Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore they fall within the prohibition of s 124 [s 122] Criminal Procedure Code. If authority is needed for this it is to be found in 
 Emperor v Akbar Badoo
ILR 34 Bom 599.
 
 
 
Additional authority was found in the cases dealing with the admissibility of statements made at identification parades. This was before such statements were exempted from the operation of s 122 in 1965. In 
 Lee Lian & Ors v PP 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 191
 , Thomson J sitting in the High Court reviewed a number of Indian cases and said at p 193: 
 
To my mind, it is not an unfair summary of the position in India to say that although there is controversy as to the admissibility of the fact of identification at a police identification parade there is considerable unanimity to the effect that statements made in the course of such a parade are inadmissible by s 162 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code [equivalent to s 122] and that in this connection statements must be construed as including actions such pointing out a person in response to questions.
 
 
 
In the present case I do not think it is necessary for me to express any opinion as to the admissibility of the fact of identification for the evidence in question here is clearly evidence of statements and on this I would not merely follow but would express my agreement with the Indian decisions which have been quoted to the effect that such statements are inadmissible.
In 
 Nagalingam & Ors v PP 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 196
 , the position was reiterated by Thomson CJ in the Court of Appeal of the Federation, a decision that is not binding on this court. However, in Singapore, the point was apparently left open: 
 Ho Yew Cheng v R 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 437
 .
Without having to go through a discussion of the admissibility of statements made during identification parades, it is possible to identify the basis of the reasoning adopted by Thomson CJ as that the principle embodied in s 122 is so paramount that its application can only be avoided by express legislative provision.
This may be so, but, in any event, s 122(2) specifically provides for the use of prior inconsistent statements and therefore counts as an exception to the operation of s 122(1) as well. Against this, however, it is contended that s 122(2) does not operate as a sufficient exception as it deals solely with the use of prior inconsistent statements to impeach the credit of the witness and does not explicitly state that such statements may be adduced as evidence of the facts stated.
In my view, such an approach is altogether too narrow. It is premised upon the assumption that the concept of impeachment contained in s 122(2) is the same as that at common law in Singapore before the introduction of s 147(3) in 1976. For the reasons given below, it must be considered that, after the introduction of s 147(3), the notion of impeachment has been altered, such that it has acquired a different meaning from that at common law.
The impetus for the introduction of s 147 was noted by the prosecution, and the basis of it was addressed in the report of the 11th Criminal Law Revision Committee (Cmnd 4991). In dealing with exceptions to the hearsay rule, it was mentioned at p 136 that: 
 
Difficulty is also caused when evidence is given that a witness made a previous statement inconsistent with his evidence given in court. Evidence that the witness did so is admissible under s 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865 (c 18); but it is admissible not to prove the truth of what was said in the previous statement (this would have been an exception to the rule against hearsay) but only in order to neutralize the effect of the evidence given in court by the maker of the statement. Many regard this as too subtle a distinction and we agree.
 
 
 
The view that such inconsistent statements could only be used to neutralize evidence given in court prevailed before the 1976 amendments. This can be seen in the case of 
 Jones v R 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 182
 , where Murray-Aynsley CJ said at p 182: 
 
These statements can only be used to impeach the credit of the witnesses. That is to say, when these statements have been proved, they do not become independent evidence of facts contained in them.
 
 
 
This position was recognized by the legislature. The minister said: 
 
Clause 9 proposes that a previous statement made by a witness should be admissible not only to support or impugn his credibility as a witness but as evidence of the fact stated in it. The present law has caused difficulty when evidence is given that a witness made a previous statement inconsistent with his evidence given in court. Evidence that the witness did so is admissible but it is admissible not in order to prove the truth of what was said in the previous statement but only in order to neutralize the effect of the evidence given in court by the maker of the statement. Many regard this as too subtle a distinction. [At col 1246-1247, Parliamentary Debates Vol 34.]
 
 
 
In the Bills Supplement, the explanatory statement noted that: 
 
Clause 9 [bringing in s 147(3)] provides that where a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in the proceedings in question is proved or where a document used by a witness to refresh his memory is proved, then the previous statement or any statement made in that document used to refresh the witness`s memory shall be admissible in evidence of any facts stated in it of which direct oral evidence of the witness would be admissible.
 
 
 
In a comparative table attached to the bill, it was disclosed that cl 9 was based on cll 33(1)(a), 33(2) and 36(4) of the draft Criminal Evidence Bill prepared by the UK Criminal Law Revision Committee discussed in its 11th report, cl 33 being the equivalent in England of s 147(3).
On a plain reading of the materials , it would seem clear what the intention of the legislature was and its effect on the notion of impeachment. That intention must be given effect to. However, in 
 Sagar 
 it was said at pp 22-23 that: 
 
If the explanatory statement or the minister had referred to s 122 of the CPC, it would have helped to resolve the issue. Had the minister said that cl 9 [containing s 147(3)] was intended to prevail that restriction in s 122, the provision can be construed purposively to that effect. However he did not refer to that provision at all. He was referring to the common law when he said that `The present law has caused difficulty when evidence is given that a witness made a previous statement inconsistent with his evidence in court.` It is not at all clear whether the minister or the legislature had considered s 122(1) and (2) of the CPC when the amendment was proposed and enacted.
 
 
 
In 
 Unkhunthod v PP 
 
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 225
 , the Court of Criminal Appeal raised, but did not make a definitive pronouncement on this question. Two propositions can be taken. The first is that the legislature intended to modify the common law in respect of all statements and s 122 should not be allowed to stand in the way of that. The second is that s 122 was enacted to regulate the use of police statements, and the protection it gives to an accused person should only be removed by clear and unequivocal amending legislation and not through a sidewind.
I was inclined towards the latter position, and did not regard the investigation statements admitted as substantive evidence. I should add that even if I had taken the other position, I would not have placed any weight on the statements ... .
The point made here is that, on one view, though it is clear that s 147(3) is intended to allow previous inconsistent statements to be admissible for the facts stated, no consideration was made of its relation to s 122, and therefore it could not be said that s 147(3) overrides s 122(1). The reluctance of Kan Ting Chiu J to find that s 147(3) could do so was his view that s 122 was intended to regulate police statements.
Such an interpretation is, with due respect, contrary to the express wording of s 147(3), that it applies to any proceedings. And there is no conflict with the purpose of s 122, when, as pointed out above, the purpose of s 122 is not so much to regulate police behaviour, but to ensure that reliable evidence is given. Any other evidence would have been hearsay, and subject to all the dangers of such evidence. The exceptions listed correspond closely to common law exceptions to the rule against hearsay, though the legislature has, as in s 122(2), gone further.
It is only s 122(5) in its proviso that can be regarded as a regulatory provision per se. That section reads: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:
 
 
 
Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
Subsections (6), (7) and (8) follow: 
 
(6) Where any person is charged with any offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect:
 
 
 
`You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for -
 
 
 
(set out the charge)
 
 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now and you would like it written down, this will be done.`
 
 
 
(7) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to subsection (5), if it is otherwise voluntary.
(8) In subsection (6), `officially informed` means informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders.
 
 
 
These subsections serve to clarify the operation of sub-s (5).
It is clear then that sub-s (5) is intended to regulate the activities of the police. The basis of the proviso to sub-s (5) is not rooted in the reliability or otherwise of the statement made to the police, but is intended clearly to prevent any impropriety on the part of the interrogators. Subsection (7) reinforces this by making it clear that the administration of the warning would not amount to an inducement, threat or promise within the meaning of sub-s (5).
The position of a mere witness is in any event quite different from that of the accused. The accused may be expected to be exposed to the danger of pressure or harassment, but the mere witness would not be. That is clearly reflected in the absence of any overt safeguards against impropriety acting on witnesses. There is none simply because there is generally no need for any. In any event, such impropriety would be dealt with by the residual discretion recognized in 
 Cheng Swee Tiang v PP 
 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 291
 . Therefore, with great respect, the concerns of Kan Ting Chiu J were in my view a misapprehension.
Thus, provided that it could be demonstrated that there is some inherent reliability or something akin to that in the facts stated in inconsistent statements, there is no reason not to read s 122(2) as providing an exception to the rule in s 122(1).
It must be emphasized once more that it could not be argued that there is a distinction between using as evidence and using to impeach. As noted above, this is too subtle a distinction. Whatever the position at common law, given the clear expression of purpose of the legislature, any argument against the application of s 147(3) on the basis that there is a difference between use as evidence and use to impeach cannot stand.
The interpretation adopted here of s 122(2) and s 147(3) is a natural development of recent case law. Indeed, it must be asked whether the reasoning of Kan Ting Chiu J would survive 
 Foong Seow Ngui & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 785
 , a decision handed down after the trial of the case in the present appeal. In that case, which involved drug trafficking, LP Thean JA said: 
 
We now turn to the evidential value of Lim`s s 121 statement. In our view, it is clear from the terms of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act that the underlined parts of the statement may be used as evidence of the facts stated therein. Section 147(3) states:
 
 
 
...
It was argued by counsel for Lim that, notwithstanding s 147(3), Lim`s s 121 statement is not admissible in evidence by reason of s 122(1) of the CPC ... .
The short answer to this is that Sn S/Sgt Cheong who recorded the statement is a narcotics officer, and it is settled law that a narcotics officer is not a police officer and therefore the admissibility of that statement is not subject to s 122(1) of the CPC; it is governed by s 24 of the Evidence Act: 
 Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 , at pp 26-28. It was also urged on us on behalf of the prosecution that the statement is admissible in evidence under s 122(5) of the CPC, and that there is no inconsistency between s 147(3) of the Evidence Act and s 122 of the CPC. No contrary argument was advanced on behalf of Lim. We are disposed to agree with the prosecution. [At pp 25-26.]
This decision did not conclusively dispose of the issue, although the Court of Appeal indicated its inclination to find that there is no conflict between s 147(3) and s 122 in the context of a statement by an accused person. The possibility of conflict was avoided by the fact that the admissibility provision was not s 122(1) but s 24 of the Evidence Act.
No such consideration of the protection accorded the accused as was thought crucial in 
 Sagar 
was made in 
 Foong Seow Ngui 
. The Court of Appeal clearly did not see any difficulties in applying s 147(3) to s 122 statements. Additionally, the fact of the reference to s 147 contained in s 122 itself was apparently not raised in 
 Sagar 
, and therefore was not considered by the judge. Whatever concerns the judge in 
 Sagar 
 may have had about having adequate protection for accused persons, these are irrelevant in the present circumstances as the statement sought to be brought in is that of a witness only. 
 Sagar 
 went up on appeal (
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 660
 ), but the Court of Appeal did not deal with the applicability of s 147(3).
The judge below believed that he was bound by 
 Sagar 
. That was a decision of the High Court in its original criminal jurisdiction. The present appeal is of course before the High Court in its appellate criminal jurisdiction. The present court is not bound by 
 Sagar 
, and, in view of the above, it should not be followed.
In the other case cited by the respondent below, 
 Syed Abdul Aziz v PP 
 
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 534
 , the Court of Appeal left the point open. The respondent`s contention below appeared to be that the tenor of the judgment in 
 Syed Abdul Aziz 
in the Court of Appeal implied that the trial judges there had rejected the use of s 147(3) in respect of statements made under s 122. Whether that is in fact the case is immaterial. The Court of Appeal did not go into the issue, and the sole authority on the issue is 
 Foong Seow Ngui 
.
Following 
 Foong Seow Ngui 
, the indication is that the Court of Appeal is inclined to give full effect to s 147(3). So is this court. The conclusion reached here is buttressed by the reasons behind the operation of s 147(3).
 Justification
There are several justifications for the exceptions to s 122(1). Section 122(5) and following are concerned with statements to the police. These would include confessions, which are regarded as exceptions to the hearsay principle because of their reliability in being statements against the interest of the maker. However, s 122(5) is not restricted to confessions only. It includes all statements made to police officers - there has been a conscious policy decision to include statements akin to confessions in the exception to s 122(1).
Of the three exceptions listed in s 122(3), two, namely, s 27 and s 32(a) of the Evidence Act are again explicitly based on notions of reliability - the former from the discovery of a fact arising from such a statement, and the latter because it amounts to a dying declaration. The third, that is, a statement made during an identification parade, has something akin to a spontaneous declaration, and may be considered reliable for that reason.
However, reliability is not itself the sole justification for constituting an exception to s 122(1). Various policy reasons may come in as well. An example has been noted in the case of s 122(5). A similar reason must apply to s 147. When a prior statement is used to impeach the credit of a witness giving testimony in court, there are two possible sources of evidence: the prior statement or the testimony. The testimony has been given in court - it may still be considered as evidence. But as a result of the impeachment process, that evidence may be considered unreliable. For the court to close its eyes to the evidence in the inconsistent statement may be to deny itself a possible source of evidence. The very fact of its inconsistency would indicate that either the testimony in court or the inconsistent statement should contain the truth. What is more, the inconsistent statement would have been given closer in time to the events related than the testimony at trial. While the inconsistent statement would not have that inherent reliability which confessions or dying declarations would have for example, it would be altogether too artificial to exclude it as well. In any event, s 147(5) provides that the court, in assessing the weight to be accorded to the inconsistent statement, shall have regard to: 
 
... all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question of whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.
 
 
 
The dangers of falsification and inaccuracy, to which all out of court evidence is prone, are recognized and highlighted. So long as these are borne in mind, there is nothing inherently wrong in admitting inconsistent statements for the truth of the facts contained in them.
The prosecution on appeal put forward a number of possible justifications for the operation of s 147(3). These were that a statement admitted under it does not amount to hearsay, that cross-examination would be available with respect to the maker and that, although such a statement would not have been made under oath, this does not affect its reliability.
The first of these, that a s 147(3) statement does not amount to hearsay is incorrect. Such a statement remains hearsay, although the legislature has thought fit, for reasons of practicality, to make it an exception to the rule. As an exception to the hearsay rule, it is inherent that even if cross-examination was not available, or that the statement, by definition, was not made under oath, its admissibility is not affected.
It must next be considered whether cases decided in Australia on provisions in pari materia would be of assistance here.
 Australian cases
Queensland has enacted a provision similar to s 147, and several cases both at state and Commonwealth levels were cited to the court. None of these were of assistance in this appeal. Of these, 
 Driscoll v The Queen 
(1977) 137 CLR 517 is authority for the proposition that at common law, though the credit of a witness may be impeached, there is no rule that the sworn evidence has to be disregarded by the jury. That is irrelevant locally. Similarly for 
 R v Siedofsky 
[1989] 1 Qd R 655, though that case was decided in the context of the Queensland provisions. In 
 R v Son Hoang Nguyen 
 [1989] 3 Qd R 72 there was dicta that the position in Queensland ought to be reconsidered. That may be so, but it does not concern this court.
A majority of the High Court of Australia in 
 Morris v The Queen 
(1987) 163 CLR 454 thought that there may be instances where the prejudicial effect of a prior inconsistent statement may outweigh its probative value, and therefore it ought to be excluded. There has been no suggestion in this instant appeal of any such prejudicial effect.
 R v Parkinson 
[1990] 1 Qd R 382 was concerned with whether there had to be corroborative evidence of a prior inconsistent statement to warrant a conviction safe. In the context of local law, particularly given that a conviction may be made even when the sole evidence is the retracted confession of a co-accused (
 Panya Martmontree & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 341
 ), it is doubtful that there is any such rule. Though a statement admissible as evidence under s 147(3) cannot corroborate the evidence of the maker, there is no reason why such a statement itself would require corroboration. Provided the trial judge is satisfied that sufficient weight, in accordance with the factors listed in s 147(5), may be accorded to the evidence disclosed in a prior inconsistent statement, there does not appear to be any reason why a conviction could not be determined on such evidence alone.
 The establishment of a prima facie case
In determining whether a prima facie case has been made out, regard must be had to s 189(1) of the CPC: 
 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 
 
 
This section was interpreted in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  by the Privy Council, on appeal from Singapore: 
 
Section 188(1) [as s 189 was numbered then] states the conditions precedent to the right and duty of the judge of trial to call on the accused to enter on his defence. It takes the form of a double negative: if the court does 
 not
 find that 
 no
 case against the accused has been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. For reasons that are inherent in the adversarial character of criminal trials under the common law system, it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so.
 
 
 
The crucial words in s 188(1) are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s 188(1) the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. Whoever has the function of deciding facts on the trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of recollection of any individual witness, whether called for the prosecution or the defence, until after all the evidence to be tendered in the case on behalf of either side has been heard and it is possible to assess to what extent (if any) that witness`s evidence has been confirmed, explained or contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses.
This test has been reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Ng Theng Shuang v PP 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 36
 .
It is necessary then to consider whether the evidence adduced of the primary facts at the end of the prosecution`s case was so inherently incredible that no reasonable person could believe it.
Section 325, Penal Code, reads: 
 
Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.
 
 
 
`Voluntarily causing grievous hurt` is defined in s 322: 
 
Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said `voluntarily to cause grievous hurt`.
 
 
 
Section 320 lists kinds of hurt that are grievous. Subsection (b) reads that this includes `permanent privation of the sight of either eye.`
It was therefore necessary to show that:
 
 
(a) the hurt was caused voluntarily; 
 
(b) the accused intended to cause or knew that he was likely to cause grievous hurt; 
 
(c) the hurt so caused is grievous hurt.
  
 
 
Element (a) is disclosed in the statement. The victim said: 
 
The most serious incident was in sometime in December 1992 whereby she purposely insert her finger into my both eyes, sprayed `Bayong` on me when I was around the toilet [sic].
 
 
 
Element (b) may be reasonably inferred from the intentional insertion of the finger into the eye - there must have been knowledge that she knew that she was likely to cause grievous hurt. It is not necessary at this stage to prove that; it need only not be incredible that there was such knowledge.
The prosecution contended that sufficient evidence, besides the statement of the victim, to establish elements (a) and (b) was disclosed in the testimony of the complainant that the victim had told her the respondent had caused the injury. This was clearly hearsay and inadmissible. No attempt was made to show that it fell within one of the exceptions to the rule against hearsay.
Element (c) depends on the testimony of the eye specialist. In evidence in chief, he had testified: 
 
In my report, I stated that the patient`s injury is consistent with that following blunt eye trauma. Apart from punch, one can also get blunt eye trauma from falling and hitting the eye on the door knob. I am saying it has to be caused by a protruding object and it has to hit the eye.
 
 
 
It is less likely that it is caused by pushing the fingers into the eyes. It is more likely to be a blunt object. The injuries caused by the putting in of fingers will cause abrasions, swelling and haemorrhaging. Because the finger is small, it will go between the base and eyeball. Pushing the fingers into the eye is less likely to cause such blunt traumas though not impossible.
The evidence is thus that, while the injury suffered was less likely to have been caused by the jabbing of a finger rather than a punch, it was not impossible.
The trial judge found: 
 
... that Dr Ang was clear in his medical report (exh P6) and reiterated it in court that the injuries to the right eye which eventually led to the loss of sight were consistent with that caused by a blunt trauma such as a hard punch though he did not rule out the poking of the eye with a finger as a possible cause.
 
 
 
The trial judge did not apply the 
 Haw Tua Tau 
test properly to the evidence of the eye specialist. What the specialist had testified was that it was not likely for the blindness to have been caused by jabbing by a finger. He did not say that it was highly improbable, extremely unlikely or that it was impossible of the injury to be caused so. That lack of likelihood is a question of probability and it cannot then be said that the injury being caused by jabbing was inherently incredible. Element (c) was thus established on the facts as they stood at the close of the prosecution`s case. That being the case, the elements of the offence have been made out, and the evidence of the prosecution is such that, if it was unrebutted, a conviction would be justified.
In this instance, it was irrelevant that the injury could have been caused by falling and hitting a door knob. Neither was, contrary to what was argued by the respondent, the history of the formulation of the charge relevant - it is only if it can be shown that in the course of the formulation of the charge or of the investigation itself that evidence was concocted could such a history be relevant. There was no suggestion of such concoction in this case. At the very most, that would be an issue of weight.
 Conclusion
The defence ought to have been called as a prima facie case had been established. The appeal was accordingly allowed.

The appellant in this case pleaded guilty in the district court to five separate charges. For the sake of clarity, these are set out hereunder.
 
 
(1) DAC 09171/95
  
 
 
You, Maideen Pillai bin PN Mohamad Shah, male/35 years, NRIC 1314645-A, are charged that you, on or about 14 March 1995, at about 3.30pm. at Apt Blk 2, Holland Ave, #14-104, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking six plastic sachets, one plastic straw and one paper wrapping of diamorphine all weighing not less than 5.48g (net), at Apt Blk 2, Holland Ave, #14-104, Singapore, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and by virtue of s 17 and s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
(2) DAC 5310/95
 
 
 
You, Maideen Pillai bin PN Mohamad Shah, male/35 years, NRIC 1314645-A, are charged that you, on or about 14 March 1995, at about 3.30pm. at Apt Blk 2, Holland Ave, #14-104, Singapore, did have in your possession a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, a plastic packet of cannabis weighing 1.65g (net), without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185); and further, that you, before the committing of the said offence, that is to say, on 4 July 1984, had been convicted by Court No 26 of the subordinate court at Singapore, of an offence under s 6(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1963, which conviction had not been set aside, and that you are thereby liable to enhanced punishment under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
(3) DAC 09079/95
 
 
 
You, Maideen Pillai bin PN Mohamad Shah, male/35 years, NRIC 1314645-A, are charged that you, on or about 14 March 1995 in Singapore, did consume a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, morphine, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
(4) DAC 07537/95
 
 
 
You, Maideen Pillai bin PN Mohamad Shah, male/35 years, NRIC 1314645-A, are charged that you, on or about 13 February 1995, a Monday, at 9am, at Clementi Police Division, Singapore, being a person subject to police supervision made under ss 32 and 33 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and directed by the Police Supervision Order MHA (CL) 00257/87D, to report to the head, investigation at Clementi Police Division HQ at 9am on every Monday, did contravene the said order by failing to report to the head, investigation at Clementi Police Division HQ and you have thereby committed an offence under s 33(1)(e) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and punishable under s 33(3) of the aforesaid Act.
(5) DAC 02516/95
 
 
 
You, Maideen Pillai bin PN Mohamad Shah, male/35 years, NRIC 1314645-A, are charged that you, on or about 9 December 1994, at about 7.55pm, at Apt Blk 2, Holland Ave, #14-104, Singapore, being a person subject to police supervision by order of the Minister for Home Affairs made under ss 32 and 33 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and required by the said order to remain indoors at your residence at Blk 2, Holland Ave, #14-104, Singapore, between the hours of 7pm and 6am, did fail to comply with the aforesaid restriction and you have thereby committed an offence under s 33(1)(f) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and punishable under s 33(3) of the aforesaid Act.
 
 
 
The appellant had nothing to say in mitigation, although he asked that a lenient sentence be imposed. Having considered, inter alia, the appellant`s antecedents, the district judge imposed the following sentences: ten years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in respect of the charge of trafficking in DAC 09171/95; two years` imprisonment in respect of the charge of possessing cannabis in DAC 5310/95; three years` imprisonment in respect of the charge of consuming morphine in DAC 09079/95; and one year`s imprisonment each on the charges in DAC 07537/95 and DAC 02516/95 respectively. The district judge further ordered that all five sentences were to run consecutively, such that the aggregate of the sentences imposed on the appellant amounted to 17 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
The appellant appealed against the above sentences as being manifestly excessive. As he acted in person, no written submissions were filed on his behalf. He did, however, write a letter in which he admitted to being a heavy drug user and asked for leniency. He repeated this request before me in court and asked for the sentences to run concurrently. Having considered the facts of the case and the appellant`s previous record, I was of the view that the sentences imposed were not manifestly excessive (whether individually or in aggregate) and, accordingly, dismissed the appeal. In so doing, I considered also the district judge`s decision to order all five sentences to run consecutively and was satisfied that there had been no error in principle. In view of the somewhat unusual nature of the decision, however, I thought it best to set down my reasoning in writing.
 Section 18, Criminal Procedure Code
The necessity for consecutive sentences in cases involving multiple convictions arises from s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), which directs that: 
 
Where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted 
 shall
 order that the sentences for 
 at least two
 of those offences shall run consecutively. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Of the five charges levelled against the appellant in the present case, three concerned offences committed on the same day (14 March 1995) and at the same place (the appellant`s Holland Ave flat). These were: the offence of trafficking in diamorphine; the offence of being in possession of cannabis; and the offence of consuming morphine. Apart from the coincidence of time and location, however, it is plain that all three were distinct offences with different elements and that proof of each offence required proof of a set of entirely different particulars. The same may be said of the two charges under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67); and indeed the offences in these two charges were committed on different dates some two months apart. In short, therefore, the appellant`s case was one to which s 18 of the CPC applied.
As the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in 
 Kanagasuntharam v PP 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 81
 , however, the direction contained in s 18 is limited, in that it 
 `only requires that at least two of the sentences imposed must run consecutively` 
. The sentencing court is invested with the direction as to which, and for that matter, how many of the sentences ought to run consecutively; and there is no absolute rule precluding the court from making more than two sentences consecutive. In 
 R v Blake 
 
[1962] 2 QB 377
, for example, the accused pleaded guilty to an indictment containing five counts, each alleging a specific and separate offence under s 1(1) of the United Kingdom`s Official Secrets Act 1911. He received a sentence of 14 years` imprisonment on each count and the sentences on the first three counts were ordered to run consecutively, making a total sentence of 42 years` imprisonment.
Of course, a decision to go beyond the stated minimum of two consecutive sentences should be taken only in exceptional cases, after careful consideration of the facts of the case as well as the relevant guiding principles. As also pointed out in 
 Kanagasuntharam v PP 
, the sentencing court, in exercising its discretion to impose consecutive sentences, has regard to certain common law principles, namely, the one transaction rule and the totality principle.
 The one transaction rule
The one transaction rule states that where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive. The question of what constitutes `one transaction` is not susceptible to a single unequivocal answer, but depends instead on the particular circumstances of an individual case. The interpretation given to the phrase in certain English decisions has at times been a rather loose one, to the extent that separate offences committed on the same occasion have sometimes been said to fall within the one transaction rule: see for example 
 R v Jones 
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 152. With all due respect, however, the English position has not been entirely consistent: 
 R v Jones 
 may be contrasted, for example, with 
 R v Wheatley 
 (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 417. Certainly, in Singapore, there is no doubt that the operation of the one transaction rule is subject to the provisions of s 18 of the CPC. Thus in the present case, as I noted earlier, although three of these offences were committed on the same occasion, the imposition of consecutive sentences was nevertheless mandated by s 18 since all five charges against the appellant concerned separate and distinct offences.
 The totality principle
As to the totality principle, this has been succinctly defined by DA Thomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing 
 (2nd Ed), which definition was adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Kanagasuntharam v PP 
 and runs as follows: 
 
(T)he principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.
 
 
 
Again, as with the one transaction rule, the first limb of the principle is subject to the terms of s 18 of the CPC. The example posed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Kanagasuntharam 
`s case (at p 85 of its judgment) illustrates how the imposition of consecutive sentences as mandated by the section may in some cases lead to an aggregate sentence which exceeds the statutory limit prescribed for the single most serious offence.
Of course, the sentencing court will bear in mind at all times the second limb of the totality principle, that is, the need to avoid an aggregate sentence so harsh as to be `crushing` in its effect on the offender. Where consecutive sentences are imposed on an offender, the overall punishment should be in proportion to the overall gravity of his criminal conduct, taking into account the circumstances in which he offended and also the pattern of his previous behaviour. In 
 Kanagasuntharam 
`s case, where particularly heinous acts of rape with hurt were concerned and where the accused had a previous conviction for rape, the court held that an aggregate sentence of 22 years` imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane could not be said to be a crushing one. In 
 R v Blake 
, where the accused had for nine years passed on top secret information to what was then a hostile foreign power, the court expressed the view that such conduct deserved 
 `the severest possible punishment` 
 and upheld a total sentence of 42 years` imprisonment.
 The present appeal
In the present case, the total sentence of 17 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane fell short of the statutory maximum of 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes prescribed for the most serious offence, that of trafficking in diamorphine under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). Indeed, leaving aside the offence of trafficking, the sentences imposed for the other four offences were the statutory minimum sentences, in spite of the appellant`s record of previous convictions for unlawful possession of controlled drugs and consumption of controlled drugs; and, from the district judge`s grounds of decision, it is clear that he was keenly aware of the need to avoid a crushingly heavy sentence.
As to the offence of trafficking in diamorphine, the district judge rightly noted that not only did the appellant have a previous conviction for trafficking, but also he committed the present offence in defiance of the police supervision ordered as a result of his previous offence. In the interests of society and also of the appellant himself, a sentence with some deterrent effect was plainly called for; and the sentence of ten years` imprisonment and 15 strokes imposed for this offence was, to my mind, neither excessive nor inappropriate
 Conclusion
For the reasons set out above, therefore, I was of the view, first, that the district judge did not err in principle in making all five sentences run consecutively; secondly, that none of the individual sentences was manifestly excessive; and finally, that in all the circumstances of the case, the aggregate sentence of 17 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes was not a `crushing` one.

The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court on 7 April 1995 to the following three charges: 
 
(1) DAC 4405A/94:
 
 
 
You, Tan Kiang Kwang, m/42 years, NRIC: 0240926G, are charged that you, on or about 28 May 1981, at Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd, 4 Battery Road, Singapore, did forge a BNP cheque No 586309 for the sum of $61,318.02, with intent to cause the aforementioned Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd to part with property amounting to $61,318.02, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(2) DAC 4406A/94:
 
 
 
You, Tan Kiang Kwang, m/42 years, NRIC: 0240926G, are charged that you, on or about 15 July 1982, at Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd, 4 Battery Road, Singapore, did forge a BNP cheque No 586499 for the sum of $69,920.70, with intent to cause the aforementioned Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd to part with property amounting to $69,920.70, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
(3) DAC 4406A/94:
 
 
 
You, Tan Kiang Kwang, m/42 years, NRIC: 0240926G, are charged that you, on or about 13 February 1984, at Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd, 4 Battery Road, Singapore, did forge a BNP cheque No 315841 for the sum of $107,176.00, with intent to cause the aforementioned Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd to part with property amounting to $107,176.00, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The appellant consented to have 15 other charges against him taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Fourteen of these other charges also involved forgery and the remaining one related to falsification of accounts (s 477A Penal Code). In respect of the 17 forgery charges, he had illegally withdrawn a total amount of $716,077.70 from Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd`s current account with Banque Nationale de Paris. He was convicted on his guilty pleas and sentenced to one year`s imprisonment on each of the three charges. Two of the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, while the third would run concurrently, adding to an aggregate sentence of two years` imprisonment.
The present appeal was brought against sentence. After hearing submissions from counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The district judge`s grounds of decision
In his grounds of decision, the district judge took careful note of the mitigating factors raised. The appellant had no previous convictions. The scheme involved the appellant forging the signature of the managing director of Eng Kheng (S) Pte Ltd (the company), one Chan Kung Git. In respect of the first two charges, the money withdrawn was credited into the account of a firm in which the appellant was the managing partner. As for the third charge, the cheque was made payable to a stockbroking company for shares purchased by the appellant. The share certificates in respect of these shares had been seized by the police and the value of the shares had risen by then to $1,037,753.70. Thus, the company would not suffer any financial losses due to the appellant`s misdeeds. With this in mind, the district judge took the view that sentence should be imposed on the basis that full restitution had been made.
It was submitted by counsel below that the `inordinate delay` in the investigation and prosecution of this case was a strong mitigating factor. He relied on three English cases: 
 R v Regan 
 [1979] Crim LR 261, 
 R v Bird 
 (1987) 9 Cr App R (S) 77, and 
 R v Tierney 
 [1982] Crim LR 53. The district judge was prepared to accept the proposition from the latter two cases that credit, in terms of a `discount` in sentence, could be given to an accused person who had changed for the better between the commission of the offence and the date of the sentence. However, the district judge considered that there was no evidence that the appellant had changed for the better, although he was noted the fact that the appellant had stayed out of trouble during the period when the investigations were pending. The appellant would have faced uncertainty about his future and his physical and mental well-being would have been affected.
The district judge also noted that the appellant had managed to obtain $716,077.70 through a consistent and systematic plan of deceit. The usual sentencing tariff where amounts in excess of $500,000 were obtained by unlawful means would be a sentence of at least five years` imprisonment. With full restitution, the accused could expect a one-third reduction in sentence. The prosecution did not press for a deterrent sentence. The district judge, therefore, concluded that an aggregate sentence of two years` imprisonment would be appropriate.
 The appeal
Counsel`s arguments on appeal revolved mainly around the district judge`s alleged failure to adequately consider the issue of the delay in prosecution. Counsel submitted that the appellant had cooperated with the police by surrendering the share certificates forthwith when first questioned by the police in 1988. The value of the shares purchased by the appellant had risen and the company would not suffer any loss. Finally, counsel argued that the offences were committed more than ten years ago and the appellant was a changed and reformed man. He had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and had no previous convictions. Accordingly, counsel submitted that the sentence of two years` imprisonment was harsh and manifestly excessive.
In the DPP`s skeletal arguments, it was pointed out that the appellant was originally charged for offences of criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts. It was only well into December 1994 that the scientific analyses on the cheques conducted by the Department of Scientific Services revealed that they were forgeries. Until such confirmation, it could be inferred that the appellant had every intention to hide the forgery committed by him. It was therefore incorrect for the appellant to say that he had cooperated fully with the police when he was first called up for questioning. Rather, he had concealed the forgery from the start and this had contributed to the delay in police investigations. The DPP also argued that the district judge had given due consideration to the fact of delay where appropriate. The appropriate sentencing discount had in fact been given, having regard to the gravity of the offence and the usual sentencing tariff for such offences.
Counsel`s arguments raised the following question: in what circumstances can a delay in prosecution can be considered a valid mitigating factor and thereby merit a discount in sentence? It appears that this question may not have been previously addressed in any reported local judgment. In one Brunei case, 
 Yau Kong Kui v PP 
 
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 139
 , Roberts CJ did consider the question to a certain extent. On 14 November 1988, a magistrate convicted the appellant after trial and imposed a deterrent sentence of six months` imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving. The offence took place on 2 February 1987. On appeal against sentence, Roberts CJ found it relevant (at p 141) that the charge had been hanging over the appellant`s head for some 21 months (ie since 2 February 1987). There was a lapse of 16 months between his first appearance in court and the date of sentence. Roberts CJ considered the delay to be `difficult to excuse for an offence of this nature` and that a deterrent sentence was unwarranted. Accordingly, he felt obliged to give considerable weight to the delay in deciding whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Roberts CJ thus reduced the sentence to a two-month imprisonment term.
For the purposes of the present appeal, it is unfortunate that 
 Yau Kong Kui`s 
 case does not really indicate to what extent delay can be considered a mitigating factor. In any event, Roberts CJ was influenced by the fact that a deterrent sentence was not called for. The decision does suggest, however, that it will be necessary to consider the nature of the offence involved in determining whether delay should be considered as relevant.
Turning to consider the English authorities relied on by counsel, I noted that 
 R v Regan 
 and 
 R v Tierney 
 have not found their way into DA Thomas`s 
 Current Sentencing Practice 
 (2nd Ed, 1982). In any event, these two decisions are of limited persuasiveness, owing to the unavailability of any detailed grounds of decision or reasons. 
 R v Bird 
 is, however, cited in para C6-2E as authority for this principle: 
 
Where an offender avoids apprehension for a substantial period of time, the sentencer may make such allowance in mitigation as may be appropriate in the circumstances.
 
 
 
With due respect to 
 Thomas 
, the principle of sentencing which he has extrapolated from 
 Bird 
 is somewhat startling. The underlying logic appears to run like this: if the prosecution is unable to do its job efficiently and expeditiously, the courts should champion the cause of the offender and `reward` him with a reduced sentence for successfully avoiding apprehension. I have serious reservations as to whether such a proposition (if I have correctly perceived it) can be supported. The principal consideration cannot be that the offender has succeeded in avoiding apprehension for a substantial period of time. Indeed, I cannot conceive how this can be a mitigating factor at all. In 
 Bird 
 itself, Lloyd LJ acknowledged (at p 80): 
 
Of course there should be no encouragement to defendants to abscond in the hope that their sentences will thereby be reduced. On the contrary, absconding will normally add to the overall sentence.
 
 
 
I am in entire agreement with this observation. Lloyd LJ, however, went on to consider that: 
 
there may be exceptional cases, of which this is one, where the sentencing court ought not to shut its eyes to subsequent events ... The offence had not changed by the passage of time, but the man had.
 
 
 
Drawing from this passage, counsel for the appellant sought to argue that, like 
 Bird 
, the appellant`s was an `exceptional case` since he had managed to steer clear of wrongdoing and had been leading a law-abiding way of life. Accordingly, he deserved to be given credit for this.
It may be useful to look more closely at the facts in 
 Bird 
. Carl Victor Bird had pleaded guilty to armed robbery, committed in early January 1976 together with two others. He was arrested on 5 or 6 January 1976. In this connection, there appears to be some discrepancy in the dates as set out in the law report. On 19 January 1976, he was bailed out but he absconded to Ireland. His two accomplices were convicted after trial and each was sentenced to five years` imprisonment. More than ten years later, Bird returned to England in July 1986 when he was arrested on another unconnected matter. He had three `spent convictions` and 11 previous court appearances, all taking place before 1976. In 1970, he was sentenced to three years` imprisonment on three counts of burglary with ten offences taken into consideration. In 1973, he was sentenced to a further three years` imprisonment on another count of burglary, taking without authority and assaulting a police constable, with four offences taken into consideration.
It was apparent to the judge below (Wild J) that Bird might have returned to England voluntarily but he did not return with the intention of giving himself up. Indeed, when he was arrested, Bird gave a false name to the police. Wild J was not impressed by Bird`s argument that he had kept out of trouble for ten years prior to 1986. As such, Wild J concluded that Bird should be sentenced to serve a five-year imprisonment term, like his two accomplices. The Court of Appeal, however, felt bound to adopt the approach taken in 
 R v Shingles 
 12 July 1982 unreported), wherein the court observed that credit should be given, in terms of a sentencing discount, to an accused who had changed his way of life from a criminal to a law-abiding one. Noting that Bird had not re-offended for the past ten years, the court reduced Bird`s five-year jail sentence to a total of three years. This comprised two years for the armed robbery offence, and one year for failing to surrender to his bail. The Court of Appeal was content to observe that `the law cannot always be strictly logical` and that Bird`s was an `exceptional case`.
With great respect, I am unable to agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Bird 
. The Court in 
 Bird 
 appeared to have ignored the important consideration that Bird had not surrendered himself after ten years, but was fortuitously arrested upon his return to England, in connection with another unrelated offence. No consideration was given to the fact that he had furnished a false name to the police when arrested. While he may not have been convicted of any other offence in the preceding ten years, these facts clearly demonstrated that he had not changed to a law-abiding way of life. The court also did not consider the fact that Bird had committed a serious offence of armed robbery, in the process of which hurt was caused as well. In the circumstances, I could not see how 
 Bird 
 could have amounted to an `exceptional case`. I was conscious that counsel for the appellant relied on 
 Bird 
 primarily as authority for the proposition that where an accused person has led a blameless life during the period between the commission of the offence and his conviction and sentence, the court should give credit to him for changing to a law-abiding way of life. The court in 
 Tierney 
 expressed similar views. I have no real quarrel with the proposition, although the weight to be attached to this consideration will necessarily vary from case to case. To this limited extent, counsel`s reliance on 
 Bird 
 was not wholly misplaced. Against this, however, the nature and gravity of the offence must be considered, as well as the public interest.
There are, of course, strong policy arguments for advocating efficiency and dispatch in investigation and prosecution. Nonetheless, the fact that an offence may have been committed some time ago does not compel the prosecution to desist from initiating proceedings. Unlike the Scots (Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, s 101), for instance, stringent time-limits for the commencement of trials do not exist in our system of criminal procedure. It appears that the concept of `stale` offences receives little attention in local prosecutorial policy. What is critical is that the relevant evidence can still be obtained in the course of investigation. I should also add that the concept of `spent` convictions has no application in Singapore.
In my view, it is clear that delay in prosecution cannot affect the question of liability. Delay in prosecution simpliciter may not even be a mitigating factor. Nonetheless, in appropriate cases, the court may exercise its discretion to order a `discount` in sentence, if there has been a significant delay in prosecution which has not been contributed to in any way by an accused person, if it would otherwise result in real injustice or prejudice to the accused. There are two main considerations in this regard. First, the accused may have to suffer the stress and uncertainty of having the matter hanging over his head for an unduly long or indefinite period. The argument may carry more force if the delay sets in after an accused has been charged, since it is only then that the charge can be said to `hang over his head`. This was evidently considered important by Roberts CJ in 
 Yau Kong Kui`s 
 case. The argument may be wholly negated, however, if the offence in question is serious, or where the accused has numerous antecedents, or has taken steps to avoid detection. A fortiori, where the accused has actively misled the police in the course of the investigations, he cannot complain of the delay in prosecution, much less seek to extract some mitigating force from it. Secondly, if there is evidence that the accused has changed for the better between the commission of the offence and the date of sentence, the court may also properly take this into account in appropriate circumstances. The question of the weight to be attached to either consideration depends very much on the circumstances of each case.
Counsel for the appellant sought to draw support from both the above considerations to fortify the present appeal. I was not persuaded by counsel`s arguments. It was erroneous to contend that the district judge had failed to give sufficient weight to the factor of delay in prosecution. He stated clearly in his grounds of decision (at p 7): 
 
I however did not ignore and did give due consideration to the fact that (the) accused had stayed out of trouble during the period when the investigations were pending. His future then would have been very uncertain and his physical and mental well-being would have been affected.
 
 
 
The first of the series of offences was committed more than ten years ago. The appellant had not committed any other offences while investigations were pending. As was apparent from the passage which I have quoted above, the district judge had noted this, but he found that there was no real evidence that the appellant had changed for the better. I found myself in agreement with this observation. At best, it could be said in mitigation that the appellant had managed to stay out of trouble with the law.
The district judge also noted correctly that the increase in the value of the shares purchased was not a mitigating factor. The fact that the value had increased was purely fortuitous. I concurred with the district judge that this was only relevant towards establishing that full restitution had been made.
It was also not accurate to say that the appellant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and had fully cooperated with the police. He was first charged in court on 29 March 1994. He did not plead guilty until after numerous pre-trial conferences and negotiations between the prosecution and the defence as to which charges should be proceeded with. In the result, he eventually pleaded guilty on 7 April 1995. Had the appellant fully cooperated with the police, the forgeries which formed the substance of the present charges would certainly have come to light much sooner.
The appellant was first investigated and arrested in connection with the offences in 1988. He was not charged until March 1994. By any standards, it is quite unacceptable that the police should have taken six years to prefer charges against the appellant. Apparently, three different investigating officers were assigned in succession to handle the case over the six-year span. The prosecution subsequently complained of difficulties in examining what were described as `complex documents`. In my view, the offences in question did not involve what might be termed complex or sophisticated fraud. The forged cheques were all drawn on the company`s Banque Nationale de Paris current account. All along, there was only one `victim` of the appellant`s misdeeds - the company itself. No attempt was made to explain why the cheques were not sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis much earlier. Even after the appellant was charged in 1994, it appears that investigations were not quite complete until another nine months had lapsed, when the Department of Scientific Services report was finally ready.
It is regrettable that the police investigations were not carried out more expeditiously. Considering the length of time taken to complete the investigations in a case like this, the irresistible inference must be that the prosecution was largely responsible for its own problems, including the delay occasioned. While I was drawn to conclude that the appellant himself had contributed in some way to the delay, I must express my misgivings over the undue protraction of the investigation process. I should make it clear, however, that I did not consider this aspect of the `delay` as a ground, by itself, for a reduction in sentence.
In my opinion, the district judge had taken into account all the relevant mitigating circumstances. The district judge`s decision as to sentence speaks for itself. The appellant was sentenced to an aggregate of two years` imprisonment, despite having succeeded in obtaining the sum of $716,077.70 between 1980 to 1986. This sentence was below what might have been ordinarily expected even considering that full restitution had been made. There was no basis for a more lenient sentence. In the premises, I saw no reason to interfere with the district judge`s decision. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

The appellant was convicted in the district court on a charge of consuming a cannabinol derivative without authorization on or about 25 October 1994, contrary to s 8(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). This was an appeal against conviction only.
In the early hours of 26 October 1994, Police Constable Shahril bin Belsa (PC Shahril) was on patrol duty with another police constable, covering Changi Beach. At about 3.30am, PC Shahril spotted Jervyn Henry (Jervyn) and a woman, Vigneshwary, seated on a bench. The appellant was standing beside them and a third man, Thiruselvam, was sleeping on another bench. PC Shahril decided to conduct a spot check on the four. Jervyn and Vigneshwary had bloodshot eyes. PC Shahril spoke to them and noticed that their speech was slurred and their gait unsteady.
PC Shahril searched the place and recovered a number of drug exhibits. In Jervyn`s briefcase were two sachets of greenish substance. He arrested the four on suspicion that they had consumed a controlled drug. At the Bedok Police Station, a more thorough search of Jervyn yielded more drugs. Nothing was found in Vigneshwary`s handbag. Neither was anything found on the appellant. Jervyn admitted that all the drug exhibits belonged to him.
Staff Sergeant Anthony Ong (SSG Ong) gave evidence that he accompanied the appellant to the toilet at the CNB office inside Bedok Police Station at about 11am the next day. There the appellant gave two urine samples in two bottles. SSG Ong was present when the appellant went into the toilet with the bottles. After the appellant had given his samples, he handed it to SSG Ong, who sealed each of the bottles with a label bearing the appellant`s name. This was done in the appellant`s presence. The appellant had checked his particulars and signed the labels. In the presence of the appellant, the bottles were dropped into a metal box to be sent to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS).
One Ho Hwee Chong, who was in the police force at the time, gave evidence that he took the metal box containing the urine samples to the DSS personally. There he handed the box to the DSS officer on duty. The officer opened the box and counterchecked the urine samples. Ho collected the results of the analyses on 16 November and handed them to the Bedok Police Station.
Dr Lui, a scientific officer, gave evidence that the urine sample of the appellant he tested contained 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, which is a cannabinol derivative and a Class A controlled drug. The content was 730 manogram per ml of urine. Ms Ong, another scientific officer, testified that the content of her sample of the appellant`s urine was 848.2 manogram per ml. Her evidence was that a variation of between 10% to 20% was an inherent characteristic of the analysis for such drugs. The variation was within the acceptable limits. Dr Lui also told the court that the drug would remain in the user`s system for about one to three days.
The defence objected to the admission of the appellant`s s 122(6) statement and a voir dire was held. The recording officer was Senior Staff Sergeant Jason Oo (SSS Oo). He gave evidence that the appellant was referred to him by the investigating officer Corporal James Chang (who has since been promoted to Sergeant and will be referred to below as `Sgt Chang`) for the recording of the statement. SSS Oo showed the appellant the DSS urine test results. He explained to the appellant the consequences if the appellant was convicted. He then read out the charge and the notice of warning to the appellant and served him with a copy of the charge. He asked the appellant if he wished to have an interpreter but was told by the appellant that he chose to speak in English. The recording of the statement took 20 minutes and there was no inducement, threat or promise. At the time, Sgt Chang was with him in the room but he took no part in the recording of the statement.
The appellant claimed that he was not competent in the English language, that he did not choose to have the statement recorded in the English language and that an interpreter was not offered to him. The appellant also alleged that he was threatened with assault and that he was punched some two or three times on his chest by SSS Oo when he told him that he did not admit to the charge. He said that SSS Oo wrote out the statement himself and did not read the contents to him. Neither did SSS Oo read the notice of warning to him. The appellant only signed the statement because SSS Oo had assaulted him. He was also shown the DSS urine test results. These confirmed that he had taken cannabis. That was why he signed the s 122(6) statement. Initially he had not wanted to admit to the charge, but did so after SSS Oo threatened to prefer more charges against him. At that time, only SSS Oo was in the room. Sgt Chang was called to rebut the appellant`s evidence that he was not in the room during the recording of the statement. Sgt Chang denied that the appellant was assaulted.
The district judge rejected the appellant`s allegation that he did not understand English well as the appellant had been educated in the English stream up to `N` levels. He was also employed as a sales assistant at St Michael`s at Raffles City. The district judge also disbelieved the appellant`s contention that he was assaulted. From the hesitant manner in which the appellant had attempted to demonstrate how he was assaulted and from the way he kept changing his reasons for signing the statement, the district judge concluded that the allegation was a fabrication. She accordingly admitted the statement. In the statement, the appellant admitted that he consumed cannabis.
The appellant did not deny that he consumed cannabis. His defence was that the cigarette he had smoked was, unknown to him, spiked with cannabis. His evidence was that he had met Jervyn, Vigneshwary and Thiruselvam at the Deepavali Trade Fair at Tekka. They then proceeded to Changi Hawker Centre to have supper. He rode his motorcycle while the other three went in a van driven by Thiruselvam. After supper, they went to Changi Beach to watch planes.
At the beach, he asked Vigneshwary for a cigarette. Vigneshwary told him that `it was in the bag`. The appellant saw a big bag there and took the cigarette packet from there. There was only one cigarette in it and he took it. He lit it and walked away from Vigneshwary and Jervyn, who were talking to each other. The appellant said that he did not feel any different after smoking the cigarette. It tasted like any other cigarette. They were arrested at about 4am and taken to the police station. Later the four were produced in court and the other three pleaded guilty to consumption of cannabis. Jervyn also pleaded guilty to possession of the drugs. After that, Jervyn retrieved his briefcase from the police and discovered a spiked cigarette missing. Jervyn phoned Vigneshwary who in turn called the appellant to ask if he had smoked it. It was only then that the appellant realized that he had smoked a spiked cigarette.
The appellant also claimed that there could have been a mix-up of the urine samples. His evidence was that he was asked to give the samples in another cell. He then placed the samples outside his cell. This was at about 5am. It was about 11am when he was told to take the samples to the CNB office for sealing and despatch to the DSS.
Vigneshwary gave evidence that after supper at Changi Hawker Centre, the four of them decided to go home. However, instead of returning home, she, Jervyn and Thiruselvam stopped at the beach to smoke a cigarette spiked with cannabis. They stopped there because Thiruselvam was feeling sleepy. The appellant left alone on his motorcycle. After the three of them had been at the beach for about 20 to 30 minutes, the appellant appeared. She surmised that he could have seen Thiruselvam`s van parked along the beach or that he had seen them walking towards the beach.
According to her, the appellant asked her for a cigarette and she replied, `It is in the bag.` She did not see the appellant take the cigarette from either her bag or Jervyn`s. She was confronted with her statement recorded on 26 October 1994. In it, she had said that she did not consume any drugs. This was in contrast to her evidence in court that she shared a cigarette spiked with cannabis with Jervyn and Thiruselvam in the van. The learned district judge held that Vigneshwary`s credit had been impeached.
Jervyn`s evidence was that the three of them stopped at the beach because Thiruselvam was feeling drowsy. He had earlier met Vigneshwary at the Deepavali Trade Fair and had told her that he wanted to talk to her about his personal problem. At the beach, Thiruselvam went to sleep on a bench while he sat with Vigneshwary. The appellant appeared while they were talking. He did not speak to the appellant and did not hear what the appellant and Vigneshwary said to each other. He did not see what the appellant did as he was crying.
According to Jervyn, he had a spiked cigarette in the briefcase. He had bought three spiked cigarettes earlier. He smoked one immediately after the purchase. The second was shared with Vigneshwary and Thiruselvam in the van. The prosecution tendered his prior statement to impeach his credit. He denied telling the recording officer that they had gone to the beach `for a picnic`. He also claimed the part exculpating his three friends was put in by the recording officer. He did not say to the recording officer that none of his three friends had consumed ganja. Furthermore, he was assaulted and the statement was not read back to him. He claimed that the recording officer was not Inspector Ho as stated in the statement but some other officer.
Jervyn and Thiruselvam also supported the appellant in his allegation that there could have been a mix-up of the urine samples. Their evidence was that they gave the samples in the cells and that the samples were then left outside their cells.
The district judge did not view the appellant`s allegation that there was a mix-up of the urine samples favourably. She was of the view that, as the appellant`s defence was that he had unknowingly consumed the cannabis, it was inconsistent for him to claim that there was a mix-up of the urine samples. This allegation implied that there was no cannibol derivative in his urine sample. In fact, the urine samples of all three men tested positive for cannabolic derivatives. She took the view that the claim of a mix-up was spurious and that the appellant was quick to avail himself of all grounds of defence he could think of even though they were not genuine.
She also found the appellant, Jervyn, Vigneshwary and Thiruselvam to be very untruthful witnesses. In her view, their evidence were inconsistent and were tailored to support the appellant`s claim that he had unknowingly smoked a spiked cigarette. They had given varied and contradictory answers as to why they were together at the beach. These ranged from Jervyn wanting to talk to Vigneshwary about his personal problems at the beach, to them stopping at the beach because Thiruselvam wanted to sleep. The appellant was supposed to have gone home after supper, yet he turned up at the beach, supposedly after seeing their van. The appellant himself said that he was there to watch aeroplanes landing. In the district judge`s view, they had actually gone there to smoke cannabis. The appellant had knowingly smoked cannabis.
Before me, counsel argued that it was improper to show the appellant the DSS test results before the statement was recorded from him. He relied on 
 Lim Kim Tjok v PP 
 
 
 
[1978] 2 MLJ 94
 , a decision of Wee Chong Jin CJ. However, in that case, the facts were very different. There, the accused had been interrogated at two morning sessions. In both sessions, he denied being at a certain place. He was then confronted with photographic evidence that he was at that place. He asked for lenient treatment if he told the officers everything and was told, `You had better tell the truth.` The accused there said that he would tell everything provided he was not charged in court. It was only then that he made the statement.
It seems clear to me that Wee CJ based his decision on the entire conduct of the recording, and not on the mere fact that the accused there had been shown photographic evidence before his statement was recorded. In my view, there is no reason why the appellant could not have been shown the DSS results before the statement was recorded, provided that nothing more was done which could be construed as an inducement, threat or promise. In fact, the DSS results would have allowed the appellant to better make his decision as to what to say. The mere fact that the appellant had been shown the DSS results is not a sufficient basis to exclude the s 122(6) statement.
Apart from this, the district judge`s decision was plainly based on her assessment of the witnesses` evidence in court, including their demeanour. There was nothing to show that she was not entitled to come to the decision that the allegations made by the appellant were untrue. Hence, I could not say that the s 122(6) statement was wrongly admitted.
As for the substantive issue, it is pertinent to note that, contrary to what defence counsel submitted, it is not sufficient for the defence to raise a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not know that he had consumed cannabis. Section 22 of the Act provides: 
 
If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31, he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).
 
 
 
The notable feature of s 22 is that the presumption is that the accused had consumed that drug 
 in contravention of s 8(b) 
. It seems to me that this presumption is twofold, as it presumes the commission of the offence. This means that it presumes both the actus reus of consumption, as well as the mens rea required for the offence. It has never been contentious that, when the burden of proof is on the accused, he had to discharge it on a balance of probabilities. However, there does appear to be an anomaly in that if the accused admits that he committed the actus reus of the offence, but the prosecution was unable to prove, for any reason, that both his urine samples contained the controlled drug, then the mens rea element of the offence must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. It may be that it can be shown that a cannabinol derivative would necessarily be found in the urine samples of someone who had recently consumed cannabis. In that case, an admission of consuming cannabis might be sufficient proof, by way of logical reasoning, that both his urine samples contained cannabis, and hence, he must rebut the presumption in s 22. There is, however, no need to decide this here.
In the present case, the appellant had admitted that he consumed cannabis. What was disputed was whether he had the requisite mens rea. The district judge was of the view that the claim of a mix-up was completely spurious. This was because none of the witnesses could suggest any basis for the allegation that there had been a mix-up, to the extent that the appellant`s urine sample was mixed up with the urine samples of someone apart from the defence witnesses. Certainly all the urine samples contained cannabis. That being the case, I see no reason to disagree with her finding that the appellant`s allegation of a mix-up was spurious. It had therefore been proven beyond reasonable doubt that both the appellant`s urine samples contained the drug.
Counsel invited the court to draw an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) against the prosecution for failing to call the lockup officers to rebut the defence witnesses. I am unable to agree. The principle behind when to draw an adverse inference in such cases has already been laid down by the Court of Appeal in 
 Tan Ah Lay v PP 
 (CC 14/93) (unreported) and 
 Lim Young Sien v PP 
 
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
 . The principle is well-established and it is unnecessary to recite the relevant passages from those cases. It suffices to say that, if the prosecution does not call a particular witness, the test is whether it is open to the defence to do so. An example of when it would be appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution may be found in 
 Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 767
 , which was a decision of mine. Needless to say, the circumstances in that case were completely different from those here.
I also agree with the district judge that the allegation was inconsistent with the appellant`s defence. Had it been the case that the appellant was raising this defence only as a technical defence to lower the burden of proof on his part, I might be persuaded (I am not saying that I would be) to take a different view. However, it is clear that the alleged mix-up was relied on as a substantive defence. In such a case, the appellant was implicitly saying that there was no cannabis in his urine samples. The inference that the appellant was seeking to rely on any ground of defence he could think of, regardless of whether they were true, was justified.
It could be said that the district judge technically erred when she held, based on Vigneshwary`s statement that she did not consume cannabis, that her credit was impeached. This is because it is not disputed that Vigneshwary did consume cannabis. Hence her testimony that she had consumed cannabis cannot be anything but the truth. At most, the statement only showed that she lied in the statement when she said that she did not consume cannabis. This is understandable as it was an exculpatory statement.
However, a reading of the district judge`s grounds reveals that she based her finding that the defence witnesses were not truthful on their demeanour in court and on the whole of their evidence. Jervyn had gone so far as to allege that the recording officer would fabricate evidence by concocting exculpatory statements in his police statement. The same is true of Vigneshwary`s evidence that she did tell the recording officer that she consumed drugs when what was recorded was that she had said that she did not consume drugs. Jervyn had, in the same breath, alleged that he was coerced into signing the document. This was quite remarkable as the recording officer was allegedly keen to include exculpatory passages in Jervyn`s police statement. In the circumstances, there were more than sufficient grounds for her to hold that the defence witnesses were untruthful. There is thus no reason to disturb her finding.
In conclusion, although his counsel did all that could be done for the appellant, I was satisfied that the appeal was without any merit. Accordingly, I dismissed it.

This was a petition for criminal revision of a decision of a subordinate court. That petition was denied and reasons are now given.
 Brief facts
The petitioner for revision is the employer of one Ong Ah Kian (Ong), who was convicted and fined for an offence under s 20(1) of the Environment Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed), namely, dumping waste in a public place. Ong had on 3 May 1994 been caught dumping refuse on vacant land opposite another piece of land, identified as No 226N Buangkok South Farmway 4, which was rented by the petitioner as housing for foreign workers hired by him.
Consequent to that conviction, the vehicle which was used by Ong, and subject to a higher purchase contract between the petitioner and a finance company, was forfeited pursuant to s 20(4) of the Act. No appeal was made by Ong. The finance company tried to obtain a disposal inquiry, but this was correctly denied by the judge below. Subsequently, the vehicle was auctioned off and the proceeds realized. No grounds were given by the judge for her decision.
 The petition
The petition prayed that the forfeiture order be set aside, and the vehicle returned, or if it had been auctioned off, for the proceeds to be paid to the petitioner to enable him to pay over to the finance company, which had already obtained judgment against him. In fact, the auction had taken place on 23 June 1995 and about $40,000 was realized.
The reasons put forward for the petition were that the petitioner suffered hardship because of the forfeiture. Such hardship appeared primarily to be his having to pay off the judgment debt, amounting to about $142,000, obtained by the finance company for breach of the hire-purchase agreement on the vehicle. Additional factors which were apparently relied upon were that the petitioner was not the person charged, though he did testify for Ong, his employee; and that the ministry concerned ought not benefit financially from an illegal forfeiture. It was alleged that no appeal was made by the petitioner because he thought that he could not succeed, and it was only after the decision of 
 Toh Teong Seng v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 273
  was reported in the newspapers that his counsel was approached for possible remedies. This court was further urged to consider the substantive issues to redress the injustice alleged to have been caused to the petitioner. The petitioner had in his petition admitted that he was not without fault.
Judgment below was given in February 1995, but the petition was only made in October because of delays in obtaining the records of proceedings from the subordinate courts, and in trying to persuade, fruitlessly, the finance company to make a joint petition.
 The respondent`s case
The respondent made several contentions. The first was that only the finance company informed the court below of its interest, while the petitioner neither made any claim nor voiced his objections. Secondly, inexcusable delay had been displayed, for the petitioner had been informed several months before the trial that an application would be made for the forfeiture of the vehicle but he failed to do anything; nor did the petitioner take any action once judgment was obtained by the finance company against him. Additionally, the evidence of the petitioner was rejected by the judge; he should then not be allowed to appeal against the decision through a back way. More damagingly, the petitioner had shown nelsonian knowledge, or wilful disregard, of the dumping.
The respondent thought fit to argue that the petitioner had the option of applying to the ministry concerned for the funds. No further comment will be necessary on this last argument.
 Consideration of the petition
The issues which arose were as follows:
 
 
(i) the principles of the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction; and 
 
(ii) whether that jurisdiction ought to be exercised on the facts of the case.
  
 
 
 
 Principles of revision
 
Section 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, hereafter the SCJA (Cap 322), provides: 
 
The High Court may exercise powers of revision in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts in accordance with the provisions of any written law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure.
 
 
 
Reference is made to the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC), the relevant provision of which is s 268(1): 
 
The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
 
 
 
Section 251 deals with stays of execution, s 255 with the arrest of an accused, s 256 with general powers on appeal and s 257 with the calling of further evidence.
The governing principle of revision was stated by Hepworth J in 
 Re Radha Krishna Naidu 
 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 130
 . 
 
[The court] should only exercise revisional powers in exceptional cases when there has been a denial of the right of a fair trial or it is urgently demanded in the interest of public justice [at p 131].
 
 
 
Though that was said in the context of an application by a party involved in a private prosecution, it applies generally in all situations. Similar sentiments were expressed in Indian cases. In 
 State of Orissa v Nakula Sahu 
AIR 1979 SC 663, Jaswant Singh J delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of India said: 
 
[It] is now well settled that normally the jurisdiction of the High Court under [the equivalent section] is to be exercised only in exceptional cases when there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error on a point of law which has consequently resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice. [666]
 
 
 
Earlier in 
 Akalu Ahir v Ramdeo Ram 
AIR 1973 A 2145, Dua J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, stated: 
 
Now adverting to the power of revision conferred on a High Court by [the equivalent sections] it is an extraordinary discretionary power vested in the superior court to be exercised in aid of justice; in other words, to set right grave injustice. The High Court has been invested with this power to see that justice is done in accordance with the recognized rules of criminal jurisprudence and that the subordinate courts do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse the power conferred on them by law. As a general rule, this power, in spite of the wide language of [the equivalent sections] Cr P C, does not contemplate interference with the conclusions of fact in the absence of serious legal infirmity and failure of justice [at p 2147].
 
 
 
In 
 Amar Chand Agarwala v Shanti Bose 
AIR 1973 SC 799, it was noted that: 
 
Even assuming that the High Court was exercising jurisdiction under [the equivalent section], in our opinion, the present was not a case for interference by the High Court. The jurisdiction of the High Court is to be exercised normally under [the equivalent section], Criminal Procedure Code, only in exceptional cases where there is a glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest error of point of law and consequently there has been a flagrant miscarriage of justice [at p 804].
 
 
 
Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
The petitioner quoted a statement from the case of 
 Emperor v Nasrullah & Ors 
 1928 A 287. 
 
[The] object of this revisional legislation was to confer upon superior criminal courts a kind of paternal or supervisory jurisdiction, in order to correct miscarriage of justice, arising from misconception of law, irregularity of procedure, neglect of proper precautions or apparent harshness of treatment, which has resulted on the one hand in some injury to the due maintenance of law and order, or on the other hand, in some undeserved hardship to individuals [at p 288].
 
 
 
Taken as a whole, there is nothing wanting in that statement. However, it is possible to misconstrue it as importing a requirement of something less than serious injustice, particularly in its last reference to undeserved hardship to individuals. A misconception of law may undoubtedly cause undeserved hardship. Be that as it may, revision cannot without more always be invoked to remedy that for, if it were otherwise, such jurisdiction would be little more than another form of appeal, and that is clearly not the intention of the statute, nor is it the conclusion that can be reached after considering all of the cases cited. This court was aware that the statement was cited with approval in 
 Heng Lee Handbags Co Pte Ltd & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 760
  by Rubin J, but that was in the context of whether a procedural defect in the petition would affect the jurisdiction.
Locally, the revisionary jurisdiction has been considered a number of times, including in 
 Heng Lee 
. But in all cases where applications for revision have been allowed, there is little doubt that there was injustice, for example, because a plea of guilty was taken when it should not have been or, as recently, when a judge exceeded his powers: 
 PP v Nyu Tiong Lam 
 
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 273
 . Indeed, 
 Heng Lee 
 itself is instructive, for in that case, though it would appear that there was irregularity in the exercise of a power by a magistrate, the reason the application was dismissed was that no serious injustice was caused to the petitioner.
 The instant application
The court noted that the petition was grounded on the hardship caused to the petitioner by the forfeiture, and, though not explicitly, the fact of the change in the law after 
 Toh Teong Seng 
. That change was used to justify the absence of an appeal, although strictly speaking, the petitioner could not have appealed; only Ong could have done so. The effect of the change in the law will be dealt with first.
 Change in the law
In 
 Thakur Das v State of Madhya Pradesh 
 AIR 1978 SC 1, the High Court in question exercised its revisionary jurisdiction because it felt that the Sessions Court, which was hearing an appeal, had taken a wrong view of the law. The Supreme Court of India noted: 
 
The appellate authority [the Sessions Court] had power and jurisdiction to decide the same. The High Court could not have lightly interfered with the order of the Sessions Judge seting [sic] aside confiscation especially in the exercise of the revisional jurisdiction under [the equivalent section] without making out any of the well-recognized grounds for interfering in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction and straightaway proceed to interfere with the order which would not be correct exercise of its revisional jurisdiction [at p 8].
 
 
 
Similarly, in 
 Ghafoor Bhai Nabbu Bhai Tawar v Motiram Keshaorao Bongirwar & Ors 
(1978) Cri LJ 405, the Bombay High Court stated: 
 
In this revision it will not be open for the applicant to urge that the order in question should be set aside simply because another view is possible. Ordinarily the revisional court would be slow to interfere with the order of the magistrate unless it is shown that the order is perverse or without evidence or not tenable according to law. No such case has been made out by the applicant and, as such, this revision is dismissed and the rule is discharged [at p 411].
 
 
 
Thus, revision ought not be granted where there is a mere difference in the view of the law, for that would lie very much in the province of the appellate process. Additionally, in the view of this court, the jurisdiction ought not be exercised where any grievance allegedly suffered by the applicant arises out of a change in the law. If it were otherwise, then, notwithstanding the expiry of the appeal period, it would be open to persons to challenge decisions by way of revision.
The prosecution made the point that the petitioner was trying to have 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 applied retrospectively. Jurisprudentially, the law has always been what was stated in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
. The notion of prospective overruling is narrowly applied. But though 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 has always been the law, the order made in the instant case remained valid until overturned. Contrary to what was argued by the petitioner, the forfeiture was not at any time illegal.
 Forfeiture and hardship
It is helpful to set out the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 20 provides: 
 
(1) Any person who drops, scatters, spills or throws any dirt, sand, earth, gravel, clay, loam, manure, refuse, sawdust, shavings, stone, straw or any other matter or thing in any public place, whether from a moving or stationary vehicle or in any other manner shall be guilty of an offence.
... 
(4) A court on convicting any person of an offence under subsection (1) shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order for the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence, notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence. 
(5) An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection (4) may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1) has been or will be held. 
...
 
 
 
In this revision, no argument was tendered, nor could any have succeeded, on the fulfilment of the elements of the offence. It was assumed that hardship would have been caused either because of the financial loss resulting from the forfeiture of the petitioner`s vehicle or because the petitioner was not a party to the proceedings. In respect of the forfeiture and loss, it was clearly evident that such hardship alone could not attract criminal revision. Every punishment causes hardship. That is the very reason for the existence of punishment; it is society`s retribution against the wrongdoer.
To have succeeded in the application, the petitioner had to point to some injustice caused to him. The main basis for such would have been that forfeiture ought manifestly and clearly not have been ordered. It was not sufficient to establish that this court would have come to a different conclusion. It had to be shown that the order was clearly wrong.
As the case against Ong was decided before 
 Toh Teong Seng 
, it was assumed that the judge did not consider that she had a discretion whether to order forfeiture. Nothing indicated that, on the prior understanding of the law, any injustice was caused. But the present position will be examined anyway for, as will be apparent, no difference in result would have occurred. The discretion was stated in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 as follows: 
 
I therefore conclude that notwithstanding the use of the word `shall` in s 20(4), the court nevertheless retains the discretion whether or not to make a forfeiture order [at p 281].
 
 
 
Without going in too deeply into the case, which would have turned the present proceedings into an appeal, the court considered the various factors which would have attracted the exercise of the discretion. In 
 Chandra Kumar v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
 , it was said that: 
 
Certainly the involvement of the owner in some way, whether by participation or through nelsonian knowledge, would be sufficient to attract forfeiture [at p 126].
 
 
 
However, at p 129 the position of the owner was considered: 
 
Even if the grounds for exercising the discretion exist, and some evidence of the owner`s involvement is adduced, the owner, if he has not been charged, would not be able to refute the allegations directly and have his case heard. ... Since it is their property which is liable to be forfeited, owners of vehicles should be charged to enable them to defend themselves.
 
 
 
The court would take this opportunity to clarify the operation of the discretion and the factors to be considered. Two points would then have to be discussed: first, whether the fact that the petitioner was not charged was material in the instant application, and, secondly, whether there was sufficient participation or nelsonian knowledge to attract forfeiture. For the purposes of this discussion, no regard will be paid to the fact that the vehicle was under hire purchase.
 The absence of a charge against the owner
While the owner, namely, the petitioner ought to have been charged, it was considered that in the present application no injustice was caused to the petitioner by the absence of a charge against him. He testified in court for Ong, and was able to give evidence concerning his version of the events. The petitioner was not affected in any way by the absence of a charge against him. Additionally, the court upon revision will consider the position broadly, and the other consideration of nelsonian knowledge was thought to outweigh the lack of a charge against the petitioner.
 Nelsonian knowledge
From the record, the evidence tended to lead to the conclusion that the petitioner had knowledge or ought to have had such knowledge of the dumping occurring. For that reason, no injustice was caused to him.
The basis for this conclusion was the serious discrepancies in his evidence, which led to the inference that he knew what Ong was going to do with the rubbish. Ong`s case, and the petitioner`s evidence was to support this, was that he had acted on the instructions of the petitioner to dispose of refuse accumulated at a construction site in Bishan, which the petitioner had contracted to remove. Ong was to transport it to the dumping ground at Lorong Halus. Instead, he had brought the rubbish to No 226N to get the petitioner`s workers to sort out the refuse, which consisted of mixed incinerable and non-incinerable waste, as the Lorong Halus Dumping Ground did not accept incinerable items. Ong denied dumping the refuse on the vacant land across from No 226N. The judge below obviously rejected, as she was entitled to, Ong`s evidence. A perusal of the record would tend to show that she must have also rejected the evidence of the petitioner.
First, when queried about his instructions to Ong, the petitioner`s answers varied in their content. In his examination-in-chief he said: 
 
A: On the morning of 3 May 1994, we were both not at No 226N Farmway 4. I contacted him by pager. He called back. I instructed him to collect the debris at Bishan construction site to dump at -
Q: Where? 
A: At Lorong Halus Dumping Ground.
 
 
 
Subsequently, in the midst of questioning by the prosecuting officer, the testimony was as follows: 
 
Court: You did not say that when I gave you the opportunity to tell the court you full instructions to the defendant. You did not mention Lorong Halus.
A: He should know. 
Q: So you did not tell him to dispose at Lorong Halus? 
A: I admit I did not mention Lorong Halus. I take for granted that the defendant knows where to dispose of the refuse - meaning at Lorong Halus.
 
 
 
It was also the petitioner`s evidence that the refuse was mixed, and at the material time could not be sent as it was to Lorong Halus as such refuse would not be accepted. The petitioner further said that he could not sort out rubbish at the worksite: 
 
Court: It will be one trip less if you sort it out at source.
A: You cannot do that at the worksite. There are many workers working. We cannot sort at the worksite.
 
 
 
That was an incredible answer. He gave evidence that he had in fact asked his workers to sort out things he wanted from those which he did not: 
 
Court: What did you tell the workers precisely about the rubbish you wanted? Think carefully now so that you would not change your answer later. What did you tell these workers regarding the rubbish you wanted?
A: I told my workers the rubbish I want, to put aside, the rubbish I do not want to pour it into the skip tank.
 
 
 
If he could do that, there was no reason why those same workers could not have sorted out the refuse into its different types as well.
There was also some question as to whether the petitioner knew that there was only one type of waste to be disposed of. 
 
Court: The fact that you expected the defendant to go straight to Lorong Halus means that you knew that the refuse needed no sorting between non-incinerable and incinerable waste?
... 
A: I thought that the defendant knew the type of refuse that can be accepted by Lorong Halus or not. Well, I thought he knows [sic] that. 
Q: To your knowledge, what was the kind of refuse that Lorong Halus would accept that day? 
A: Earth, stone. 
Q: Would Lorong Halus accept wood on that day? 
A: No.
 
 
 
Yet, earlier, he had testified that there was both incinerable and non-incinerable waste at his site in Bishan. Finally, it was also noted in the record that the petitioner was slow and not forthcoming with his answers.
There was an attempt to contend that sorting out in the vicinity of the dumping site was necessary as the petitioner kept a sorting machine there. The machine as described in the record would appear to be one that had an attachment that could grab hold of things, but the prosecution below contended that the machine was primarily for the breaking of materials. Unfortunately, as noted before, the judge gave no grounds, but this court was sceptical of the use of such machinery for sorting of rubbish, and would not have found fault with any finding below that that was all a fabrication or exaggeration on the petitioner`s part.
There was thus ample ground for a finding to have been possible that the petitioner had knowledge of the unlawful disposal of the refuse. Nothing in the circumstances indicated that even if the court below had exercised its discretion that it would have been in favour of the petitioner. No injustice occurred. Nothing attracted the exercise of the court`s revisionary jurisdiction.
 Delay
An additional reason why the discretion ought not be exercised was that there has been considerable delay in the application. The prosecution made much of the fact that the petitioner was informed that the Public Prosecutor would be requesting that the vehicle be forfeited some time before judgment was given, and additionally that the finance company had also obtained judgment against him some time before the decision was made. None of these were in the opinion of this court sufficient evidence of delay which would deny the exercise of the discretion to revise. What was material was that the petitioner had waited for about eight months before presenting the petition. The ostensible excuse was that there was a delay in obtaining the record. While it may be that there was such a delay, it was, in the opinion of this court, possible for the petitioner to have, after he had suffered his first delay, presented his petition and requested the court, after duly explaining the reasons for his request, to call for the record itself under s 266, CPC, which reads: 
 
(1) The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court.
(2) Orders made under section 105 and 106 and proceedings under Chapter XXX are not proceedings within the meaning of this section.
 
 
 
None of the provisions exempted in subsection (2) were applicable. And s 268 reads: 
 
(1) The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been
 called for by itself
 or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, exercise its discretion ... . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Thus, since the correspondence before the court showed there had been no response to the petitioner`s request for the records by mid-May, he ought then to have made his petition. Furthermore, he could have presented his petition without the involvement of the finance company. While, in a case of injustice generally, delay would not be material, it may indicate in some circumstances that there is in fact no injustice caused. On the instant facts, this court was of the view that the delay indicated that even if, contrary to what was discussed above, there was injustice, the force of that was seriously attenuated by the delay, such that no exercise of the discretion ought to be made in favour of the petitioner.
 The finance company
The finance company maintained a watching brief both here and below. As noted by the judge, whatever the position between the petitioner and the finance company may be, that was a matter between them only and could not affect the operation of the forfeiture order.
 Conclusion
For all of the above reasons, the petition was dismissed.

He was sentenced to three weeks` imprisonment on the first charge and to three months` imprisonment on the second charge. Both terms were ordered to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. I heard his appeal on both charges, on 15 April 1997. After listening to arguments by counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The agreed statement of facts
The prosecution and the defence agreed on a statement of facts at the trial below, as set out hereafter. On 15 June 1993, the appellant was appointed as the managing director (MD) of Vigers Singapore. Sloan Management Services (Sloan) was registered as a business on 26 May 1991 and was at all times a sole proprietorship in the appellant`s wife`s name. Sloan was in fact, managed by the appellant.
The appellant`s brother, one Georges Tan Choo Hock (Georges), was in 1993 the managing partner of Resource Pool Business Services (RPBS), which provided consultancy business services.
Georges sent an RPBS invoice dated 2 July 1993 to Vigers Singapore for $500, for `company secretarial services rendered for the period from April 1993 to June 1993`. On or about 7 July 1993, the appellant issued a cheque dated the same day for $500 drawn on Vigers Singapore`s account to RPBS.
Georges sent a second RPBS invoice dated 2 December 1993 to Vigers Singapore for $1,000 for `company secretarial services rendered for the period from 1 June 1993 to 31 December 1993`. On or about 9 December 1993, the appellant issued a cheque dated 9 December 1993 for $1,000 drawn on Vigers Singapore`s account, again to RPBS.
Subsequently, Sloan issued an invoice to RPBS dated 5 December 1993 for $1,350 for `consultancy services rendered for the three quarters ended 31 December 1993`. On 6 January 1994, Georges issued a cheque for $1,350 drawn on the account of RPBS to Sloan
 The background
In 1992, one Lee Zee Ming (Lee) and the appellant approached Tan Kim Lee (Tan), the former MD of Vigers Singapore to purchase all of his 62% shareholding in the company. The price offered for Tan`s shares was $170,000. After negotiations, Lee and the appellant entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 25 February 1993, with Tan, Vigers Asia (Holdings) Ltd of Hong Kong and Vigers Singapore, for the sale of shares, to be transferred on 15 April 1993.
 The arrangement
Subsequently, the appellant and Lee had a few meetings with Tan. According to the appellant and Tan, both the appellant and Lee had complained that the secretarial fees charged by Lim and Associates, a secretarial firm, were excessive. Lee, however, maintained that he did not look at the January or February 1993 management accounts of the company and therefore, he did not know that Vigers Singapore was paying Lim and Associates $4,000 for nine months` secretarial work and therefore denied ever complaining about the fees.
According to the appellant, Lee had wanted an arrangement for cheaper secretarial fees. The appellant had experience in company secretarial work. The appellant maintained that he told Lee that he would do the company secretarial work at around half the cost. However, at that time, the appellant was in employment elsewhere, as company secretary at Chemical Industries. As such, according to the appellant, he could not be the company secretary, since he could not be an employee of two different companies. It appeared however, that the appellant was involved in Sloan at the same time as he was secretary of Chemical Industries. The appellant explained this by saying that `Sloan was a $2 paid up company and was dormant`. In any event, the appellant maintained that he told Lee that he would get his brother`s firm RPSB to provide a named company secretary and then RPSB could bill Vigers Singapore. Lee however denied all of this.
The appellant`s brother, Georges, testified that in March 1993 the appellant approached him and proposed that RPBS be appointed the company secretary of Vigers Singapore; that `RPBS would not perform all the secretarial services`; that RPBS provide the registered address of Vigers Singapore and that RPBS provide a named company secretary. According to Georges, he would normally have given the secretarial services to the affiliate company of RPBS. However, at the appellant`s request, RPBS agreed to sub-contract the company secretarial services to Sloan. RPBS was to retain $200 as consideration for providing the office address and naming the company secretary.
Therefore, in fact, the appellant was being paid for his secretarial services through RPBS as a sub-contractor. The appellant maintained that the $500 paid for secretarial services for April and June 1993 was for the period when the appellant was not a shareholder of the company and was not receiving remuneration at all as employee or officer of Vigers Singapore. There was no agreement between the appellant and Lee that he was going to do the secretarial work for free.
As for the $1,000 for secretarial services from June to December 1993, the appellant maintained that he was not responsible `for the actual corporate secretarial work like preparing the resolutions, lodging of ROC forms and the updating of company records`. As he had done such work without being responsible for them, the appellant therefore felt that he just `received a percentage of what RPBS got`.
The appellant agreed however that, after he became Vigers Singapore`s director, no resolution was passed to approve the arrangement whereby he would do Vigers Singapore`s secretarial work which RPBS had contracted to Sloan and he would bill RPBS through Sloan.
According to Lee, the appellant and himself had a verbal agreement after signing the agreement of 25 February 1993 as to their defined areas of responsibilities and the demarcation of their roles and duties. Lee knew that the appellant was a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries and a Certified Public Accountant and he had been the group company secretary of two large publicly listed companies. Therefore, it was verbally agreed that, by the time they became directors of Vigers Singapore, the appellant would be given the responsibilities for company secretarial work, accounts matters, administration and estate agency.
Lee agreed that there was no discussion that the appellant would do secretarial work for free in April and June 1993. However, by 25 February 1993, it was already decided that the appellant would be shareholder and director of Vigers Singapore and therefore he had a vested interest in the company. There was no discussion that the appellant would be separately paid for his secretarial work. Lee maintained that the appellant`s high pay already included payment for secretarial work.
 The directors` resolution
There was a directors` resolution dated 1 April 1993. In this resolution, one Chin Yan Kee (Chin) was appointed as the new company secretary and the address of the registered office was changed from the address of Lim and Associates to that of RPBS, the appellant`s brother`s firm. Lee denied that this resolution was the result of discussions he and the appellant had with Tan in March 1993. Although Lee signed the resolution, he maintained that the appellant had given him a stack of documents and he had signed it without looking at its contents, because the appellant was then doing the secretarial work of Vigers Singapore and he trusted the appellant. It was undisputed that Lee did not know Chin. Therefore, Lee testified that he would not have approved Chin`s nomination, if he had been aware of it, since his post involved dealing with confidential matters of the company.
 `Concealment` of the secretarial fees
Francis Lee (Francis) kept and maintained Vigers Singapore`s accounting records and prepared its financial statements and management accounts. Francis did not discuss with or report to Lee on the accounts; he reported directly to the appellant. Lee always left the accounting matters to the appellant.
Francis had testified that in March 1994 he had seen the appellant with the draft management accounts, which included the profit and loss accounts for the period from 1 July 1993 to 28 February 1994. The appellant had instructed Francis to reclassify the sum for secretarial expenses under general expenses. He had also instructed Francis to separate the entertainment and refreshment accounts.
According to Francis, `General expenses actually is a dummy account usually including expenses paid out in small amounts or are not incurred frequently`. A person looking at the item would not know what the expenses included under general expenses were, unless he referred to the records or asked Francis about the details. Francis gave evidence that he would not normally classify secretarial fees under general expenses but that he had done so upon the appellant`s specific instructions. He however, did not consider the instruction as improper. The appellant testified that he did the reclassification because he wanted to make the profit and loss account less detailed
The invoices from RPBS to Vigers Singapore had accurately described the billing as being for `company secretarial work`. However, when the appellant billed RPBS, the invoice from Sloan described the work as `consultancy services`. There had also been an AGM of Vigers Singapore. Georges was meant to attend the meeting but arrived only after the meeting. Yet his name appeared as the recording secretary on the attendance sheet for the AGM.
Prosecution alleged that the reclassification ordered by the appellant as well as the different description on the invoice from Sloan were to conceal the fact that secretarial fees were being paid by Vigers Singapore and to dissociate Sloan and himself from the payments made to RPBS from Vigers Singapore. Further, the allegation pertaining to the AGM attendance sheet was that the appellant did it to give the impression that Georges was doing work for Vigers Singapore, thereby justifying the payment to RPBS.
 Refusal to sign the accounts
Frederick Lee (Frederick), Lee`s brother, joined Vigers Singapore on 23 February 1994. From July 1994, the relationship between the appellant, and Lee and Frederick was strained. There had been many disagreements between them concerning the management of the company. Another reason was the appellant`s questioning of Lee`s intention to increase Frederick`s salary. As a result of this `strain` in their relationship, it was decided that either the appellant should buy over all their shares or he sells his shares in Vigers Singapore to them. On 1 August 1994, the appellant decided to sell his shares to Lee and Frederick.
On 15 August 1994, the appellant tendered his resignation and he backdated this notice to 1 August 1994, the date when he sold all his shares and stated that the resignation was to take effect from 31 August 1994. A day after the appellant`s resignation, Lee called the appellant and suggested that Francis be asked to finalise the accounts and to call the auditors to audit the accounts. He requested the appellant to sign the audited accounts together with him as directors, since Frederick was new and would not know about the accounts for that period. The appellant refused to sign the accounts and this made Lee suspicious. Frederick initiated an internal audit and `discovered a lot of irregularities in the accounts `. According to Lee, through this internal audit, they discovered that the appellant made use of company funds to pay himself, using RPBS as a vehicle to receive payment.
 The trial judge`s findings
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no agreement by the directors of Vigers Singapore, particularly Lee and the director representing Vigers Asia, to contract out the company`s secretarial work to RPBS or to the appellant. He found that there was no documentary evidence of any agreement to pay the appellant for the secretarial work. He also felt that, even though Lee`s signature was on the director`s resolution, Lee had signed it `blindly` since he trusted the appellant with the secretarial matters especially as at the material time, he was `overwhelmed with work`.
The trial judge also found that undoubtedly, the appellant had done the secretarial work for Vigers Singapore but he admitted that this had benefited him as its shareholder and director. It was already agreed that he was responsible for company secretarial work before he joined Vigers Singapore as a full time director. His high remuneration was also for the secretarial work which he already did for Vigers Singapore prior to joining the company as a full-time director. He found that there was no document to evidence the defence case that the appellant should bill Vigers Singapore through RPBS.
The trial judge next found that, if the appellant did not want to be named as the secretary, but there was an agreement by the other directors that he would be paid for his secretarial work, he could have been paid through his firm Sloan by Vigers Singapore. There was no necessity to have RPBS in the scheme merely for the payment of the fees for his secretarial work. He thought that the use of RPBS `smacked of a deliberate device to conceal the wrongful payments of the appellant to himself`. He felt that there was no sense in using Vigers Singapore`s registered address merely to receive correspondence and to pass them to Vigers Singapore`s office, without any work being done by RPBS on the correspondence received. Therefore he felt that the introduction of RPBS`s address as Vigers Singapore`s registered address appeared to be another device to deceive Vigers Singapore. He believed Lee signed the documents without scrutiny because he was busy and he had trusted the appellant.
The trial judge felt that the reclassification exercise which the appellant instructed Francis on had the effect of concealing the payments from the attention of Lee, Frederick and also Vigers Asia. He felt that another questionable act of the appellant was to mis-state in his invoice from Sloan to RPBS, that the work which he had provided to them was `consultancy services` when RPBS had accurately described the same work as `company secretarial work` in their bills to Vigers Singapore. He found that no reasonable explanation was given and it could be reasonably inferred that the appellant did not want the billing by and payment to Sloan to be traced to the payments to RPBS from Vigers Singapore. He also inferred that, by allowing the AGM minutes to reflect that Georges was in attendance and was the recording secretary, the appellant wanted to create the impression that RPBS did carry out secretarial work for which payment was due.
The trial judge found the appellant to be evasive on several occasions and he felt that the various material inconsistencies in his own evidence and the contradictions between his evidence and the evidence of Tan, made the defence version highly suspect. On the other hand, he found Lee to be a truthful witness and ruled that his credit was not impeached.
 The motion to admit fresh evidence
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant filed a motion to admit fresh evidence before me. The fresh evidence was copies of two letters. The first, `TTC-1` was a copy of a letter from Lee writing for himself and on behalf of the appellant to Mr Gareth Williams dated 19 March 1993. Mr Williams was then a director of Vigers Asia Holdings. The second, `TTC-2` was a copy of a letter from Michael Mann to Vigers Singapore, dated 26 March 1993. Michael Mann was then also a director of Vigers Asia Holdings. The letter was a reply to the first letter, on behalf of Mr Williams.
In his first affidavit in support of the motion, the appellant (the applicant in the motion) submitted that the first letter showed that Lee knew about the company secretarial fees of $4,000 for nine months, at the material time and that he regarded it as `high by local standards`. It was alleged that the letter showed that Lee was a party to the suggestion that the secretarial fees be reduced to half the cost. As for the second letter, it was submitted that it showed that the directors of Vigers Asia had no objections. Therefore, the letters effectively were to attack Lee`s credibility.
 The applicable principles
The principles governing an application to adduce fresh evidence on appeal are set out in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 and 
 Carl Elias v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 501
, adopting 
 Ladd v Marshall 
[1954] 3 All ER 745. Briefly, first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
 The present motion
Applying the principles above to the present case, the correspondence here occurred in March 1993. Therefore, it definitely was in existence at the time of the trial. In the appellant`s affidavit, he did not give a good explanation as to why the letters could not have been made available during the trial below. The burden is on the appellant to show that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial. I was not satisfied that the burden here had been discharged.
Having said that, in 
 Juma`at bin Samad 
, I stated the following: 
 
It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle of s 257 CPC after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasised in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
 
 
 
I was not convinced that this was one of those limited instances where it was in the interests of justice to admit the evidence.
There was also doubt as to the credibility of the two letters, considering that the trial judge had found that Lee had signed the director`s resolution `blindly` as he trusted the appellant with the secretarial matters. In Lee`s affidavit in reply, in this motion, Lee had explained that he had similarly signed this letter without looking at the contents as he trusted the appellant. I saw no reason to disagree with the trial judge`s finding on this point. Therefore, the natural inference was that the appellant could have similarly signed `blindly` here.
On the whole, I was of the view that the application to allow the fresh evidence should not be allowed, and accordingly dismissed the motion.
 The appeal
Under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), the appellant had to be (a) entrusted with the property, and he had to have (b) dishonestly misappropriated the property. In this case, (a) was clearly satisfied. It was undisputed evidence that from 1 July 1993, the appellant was signing cheques on behalf of Vigers Singapore without consulting Lee. The appeal here was centered on the vital issue of whether (b) was satisfied.
 Misappropriation
To `misappropriate` means to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong use, and this must be done dishonestly. Setting aside property by one person for the use of another other than himself and the true owner can also constitute misappropriation; see 
 Tan Sri Tan Hian Tsin v PP 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 73
 where criminal breach of trust was committed by the MD of the company which paid money into the bank account of another company of which he and his wife were the sole shareholders. Therefore, in this case, setting aside property for the appellant as well as his brother`s firm could both constitute misappropriation.
Therefore, the first issue I had to consider was whether the $1,500 was assigned to the wrong person or for the wrong use. This would turn on whether the appellant was rightfully entitled to the money. This in turn would depend on whether all the directors of Vigers Singapore knew and approved of the arrangement, whereby the appellant would be paid, through RPBS, for secretarial services rendered and RPBS would be paid for nominating the company secretary, as well as providing its address to serve as Vigers Singapore`s registered address. If they did, then it would appear that he had earned the money and was paid with Vigers Singapore`s authority.
 Did the directors know about the arrangement?
At the material time, the directors were Lee, Tan and a representative from Vigers Asia. The evidence before me showed that there was a conflict of testimony between Lee on the one side, and on the other, the appellant and Tan. The trial judge accepted Lee`s evidence on this point. Even though Tan`s evidence corroborated the appellant`s evidence on this point, the trial judge felt that Tan was a biased witness as he appeared to have gone out of his way to assist in the appellant`s defence. Also, Tan had left Vigers Singapore under `unhappy circumstances` and there was also a pending suit by Vigers Singapore and Lee against Tan on matters involving the company. Therefore the trial judge felt that he was a biased witness who had an `axe to grind against Vigers Singapore and Lee`.
The trial judge also found that Tan`s evidence actually contradicted the appellant`s evidence that the discussion about the high secretarial fees took place in early March 1993, sometime after 25 February 1993, when the agreement was signed. This was since Tan said that he told William Garett, the alternate director for Michael Mann (the Hong Kong director of Vigers Asia), about the arrangement concerning RPBS before 25 February 1993. It would seem odd that Tan could have told William Garett about the arrangement then, in Singapore, when the discussion only took place in March 1993, especially since, by March 1993, William Garett had already departed for Hong Kong. The trial judge noted that the material contradiction made the defence version `highly suspect`.
I fully agreed with the trial judge`s findings. Counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judge failed to consider that Tan`s evidence corroborated the appellant`s, in that Lee knew about the arrangement with RPBS. In my opinion, the trial judge could not possibly have considered Tan`s evidence as corroboration, when, after assessing Tan`s evidence, he found that he lacked credibility. The trial judge also found that Tan prevaricated on various other matters. Based on this, it was no surprise that he chose to treat Tan`s evidence with caution, and did not rely on it.
In this case, there was also no documentary evidence of the arrangement, as there was no resolution on this matter. In an earlier incident, the appellant had drafted a resolution and obtained approval for an increase in his salary. This, in my view, showed that the appellant was generally a cautious man when it came to his remuneration. Therefore, I would think it odd that a man with his qualifications and vast experience, failed to officially document the arrangement, especially when it involved him receiving a monetary benefit from the company.
The only evidence that could possibly indicate that Lee and Michael Mann, the Hong Kong director of Vigers Asia, knew about the arrangement was the fact that they both signed the resolution to appoint Chin as the new secretary and also to change the registered address of the company to RPBS`s address. Lee`s explanation was that he was `overwhelmed with work` then and he just signed it, as he trusted the appellant. As for Michael Mann, there was no evidence as to why he signed it. From the evidence before me, it appeared that the Hong Kong office left the day to day running of the company to the directors in Singapore. Therefore, it could be reasonably inferred that Michael Mann would not have had many queries pertaining to a new appointment and a change of the registered address.
The next question then for me to consider was whether Lee really did sign the resolution `blindly`. Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was unlikely that Lee who was high in the hierarchy would just sign without scrutiny since Lee was a very cautious man. It was undisputed that Lee did not know who Chin was. The evidence was that Lee had not asked the appellant any questions concerning the resolution. I would think that, Lee would surely have asked about Chin and the change of address, if he was aware of the contents. This was since Lee had testified that he would surely have queried Chin`s appointment as his position involved dealing with the company`s confidential matters. As for the address, Lee had said that he felt that there was no need for it, since Vigers Singapore was a `viable working company`, which could use its own address.
If it were true that Lee was a very cautious man, as counsel for the appellant stressed, he would surely have queried the appellant on these matters, before signing the resolution. Also, it could be inferred that Lee generally left all the accounting and secretarial matters to the appellant, from the fact that the appellant could sign cheques without consulting Lee.
In addition, it was undisputed that Lee had known the appellant since the 1960s. They studied together in school and university, were colleagues at the Inland Revenue Department and then together they acquired their respective shareholdings in Vigers to work for a common objective. In my opinion, it was not inconceivable that, with such a background, Lee had placed so much trust in the appellant, that he had signed the resolution `blindly`. Therefore, in my view, the trial judge was right in finding that the directors had not agreed to contract out the company`s secretarial work to RPBS, as they had no knowledge of the `alleged` arrangement.
 Dishonesty
As the directors had not approved the arrangement, the appellant was not rightfully entitled to the money. However, a further issue I had to consider was whether the appellant had a dishonest intention in making the payments. This had to be determined with reference to s 24 of the Penal Code. Dishonesty may be established by showing that the appellant had done acts `with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person`. The concepts of `wrongful gain` or `wrongful loss` have to be examined with s 23 of the Penal Code in mind. Essentially, this is whether there was gain (or loss) by unlawful means, of property, to which the person gaining (losing) it is not legally entitled, or is legally entitled, as the case may be.
Further, in 
 Ang Teck Hwa v PP 
 [1988] 1 Mlj 279 at p 284, the court stated: 
 
to show dishonesty, it must be shown that the appellants 
 intended
 to cause such wrongful gain/loss. To intend a wrongful gain/loss requires that one knows the gain/loss is wrongful. Thus if the appellant made use of the $5,819.80 for his own purposes knowing that he was not entitled to do so, then he would be doing so with the intention of causing wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to SLF. Conversely if the appellant can show that he did so honestly believing that he was legally entitled to do, then he could not be said to have acted dishonestly.
 
 
 
I had to consider whether the appellant here showed that he made the payments on behalf of Vigers Singapore to RPBS, honestly believing he was legally entitled to do so, and also whether in receiving the payments, he honestly thought that he was legally entitled to payment for his services through RPBS, as a `sub-contractor`. If he did so, then there would have been no dishonesty on his part.
I felt that this had to be determined with reference to his actions and the surrounding circumstances. In this case, there were five prime areas which required consideration, as follows: 
(a) the `concealment` of the payment of the secretarial fees; 
(b) the disguise of the payments to Sloan; 
(c) the false entry in the AGM attendance sheet; 
(d) the need for RPBS`s services; and 
(e) the appellant`s right to be paid
 The `concealment` of the payment of the secretarial fees
It was undisputed that the appellant had instructed Francis to reclassify the secretarial fees under general expenses. The appellant had testified that he had done this because he did not want the profit and loss account to be so detailed. His explanation was that showing small items or small values would make the accounts confusing. It was also undisputed, however, that the appellant had also asked Francis to split up the item `refreshment` from `entertainment` although the amount under `refreshment` then was very much smaller than the amount under `secretarial fees`
I was of the opinion that his explanation was unbelievable, since he contradicted his reason for reclassifying the secretarial fees by his other instruction to Francis. By splitting `refreshment` from `entertainment`, which were `small items` and `small values`, he was making the profit and loss account more detailed. This totally contradicted his explanation for reclassifying the secretarial fees. The irresistible inference, which was the same inference the trial judge drew, was that the purpose of the reclassification exercise was to conceal the payments, as any person looking at the profit and loss account would not know that Vigers Singapore had to pay and was paying secretarial fees.
Counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent had not tendered any evidence that the payment of $500 in July 1993 was `concealed` in any manner. His argument was that, if the appellant intended to conceal the payments, why did he only reclassify the $1,000? Counsel further submitted that the appellant had no reason to `conceal` the payments in the profit and loss account, since it was undisputed that Lee left all the accounting matters to the appellant, and the appellant knew that Lee was only interested in the bottom line figure.
I rejected counsel`s argument, as being superficial. Looking at the facts purely on the surface, it would appear that counsel`s argument does start one wondering. However, on a close analysis of the facts, there is a valid explanation for the appellant`s actions. It must not be forgotten that there was actually a third person in the picture, namely, Frederick, Lee`s brother. It was interesting to note that the reclassification of the $1,000 was carried out at the time when Lee`s brother, Frederick was to join Vigers Singapore. As the trial judge said: 
 
It could not be mere coincidence that the [appellant`s] instruction to [Francis] to reclassify the secretarial fees transpired at the time when [Frederick] became a full-time director of Vigers Singapore in February 1994. [Lee], known to the [appellant] for 30 years as a former school mate and colleague, had not bothered to inquire about the invoices, payment vouchers and accounts relating to the secretarial fees, but [Frederick] was an unknown quantity to the [appellant] when he joined Vigers Singapore in February 1994.
 
 
 
I noted that the payment of the $500 was for secretarial services rendered for the period from April 1993 to June 1993, whereas the payment of $1,000 was for the period from 1 June 1993 to 31 December 1993. The profit and loss accounts which were modified were for the period from 1 July 1993 to 28 February 1994. This would mean that the payment of the $500 would have been reflected in the profit and loss account for the previous financial period. Frederick was not on the scene then, as he only joined Vigers on 23 February 1994. The payment of the $1,000 however had to be reflected in the relevant profit and loss account. The appellant instructed Francis to do the reclassification in March 1994. By then, Frederick was already a full-time director and it can be inferred that the appellant was unsure whether Frederick would similarly leave all the accounting matters to him.
 The disguise of the payments to Sloan
It was also undisputed that, even though the invoices from RPBS had accurately described the billing as being for `company secretarial work`, when the appellant had billed RPBS, the invoice from Sloan described the same work as `consultancy services`. The respondent`s contention was that the appellant was trying to hide the fact that he or Sloan was to receive payment for the secretarial work assigned to RPBS. The appellant had reiterated, by saying that if he wanted to hide anything, he could just have asked his brother to pay him in cash.
I did not think that the appellant could have done that, since his brother, Georges had testified that he would have deemed the arrangement improper if there was merely cash payment without any documentation. Counsel for the appellant submitted that even if the invoice from Sloan had described the work as `consultancy services`, the invoices billed to RPBS were properly reflected and transparent, as they were titled `secretarial services`. Therefore, his argument was that, if Lee looked at them, he would still know that the company was incurring secretarial fees, notwithstanding the fact that the item was not reflected in the profit and loss account.
I did not accept this argument. I did not think it unlikely that the appellant was a fairly capable man, who had thought about the plan very carefully. As mentioned earlier, I felt that the appellant tried to conceal the payments in the profit and loss statement to make it appear that no secretarial fees were being incurred. However, from the evidence, it can be seen that the appellant created some safeguards for himself. This was in the event that someone went through the invoices and discovered that payments were made to RPBS. Should this happen, the appellant did certain things, which I shall proceed to consider below, to give the impression that RPBS really did the secretarial work, and was therefore justified in receiving payment.
In my view, the appellant was trying to dissociate himself and Sloan from the payments which he had made on behalf of Vigers Singapore to RPBS. He did this by heading the invoice from Sloan to RPBS as `consultancy services`, so that it would not be obvious that the payment from RPBS to Sloan and, therefore, himself was the same payment from Vigers Singapore to RPBS. In my opinion, the fact that the invoices were properly reflected did not carry much weight.
 The false entry on the AGM attendance sheet
It was undisputed that Georges`s signature was on the AGM attendance sheet, as the recording secretary, even though he came only after the meeting was over. The trial judge inferred, that by allowing the minutes to reflect that his brother was in attendance and that he was the recording secretary, the appellant had wanted to create the impression that RPBS did carry out secretarial work, for which payment was due.
I was unsure as to the correctness of the trial judge`s finding on this point. I noted that Lee actually knew Georges. Since Lee was present at the meeting, surely he would have known that Georges was not present. In any event, I felt that the appellant did this to safeguard himself, in the event that someone else like Frederick looked at the minutes. If Frederick had looked at the invoices from RPBS to Vigers Singapore and realised that Vigers Singapore was paying RPBS for secretarial services, he would surely have queries as to what work RPBS did for Vigers Singapore. By looking at the AGM attendance sheet, he would think that RPBS really did secretarial work for Vigers and therefore payment to RPBS would seem justified. This was consistent with his plan.
 The need for RPBS`s services
I could not see a need for RPBS to nominate the company secretary, and be paid for it. The appellant had testified that he did not want to be named as Vigers Singapore`s secretary as he did not want his employers Chemical Industries to know about it. However, it was undisputed that, at the same time he was secretary at Chemical Industries, he was also secretary at Sloan. Even though the appellant had explained this by saying that Sloan was a $2 paid-up company and was dormant, the trial judge was not convinced, as he found that the appellant had prevaricated on his answers as to whether Sloan was really a dormant company. Hence, the trial judge felt that the appellant`s reason for not wanting to be named as Vigers Singapore`s secretary, `would not therefore hold water`. He further said that the fact that Sloan had only $2 paid-up capital should be irrelevant. In the circumstances, I saw no reason to fault the trial judge`s finding.
In any event, this arrangement continued even after he left Chemical Industries. I felt that the reason he gave, that he did not want to abandon his brother, despite the fact that he could act as secretary, was totally devoid of merit.
I could also see no need to use RPBS as the registered address, as Vigers Singapore could have used its own address, since in Lee`s words it was a `viable working company`. I agreed with the trial judge that there was no sense in using RPBS as Vigers Singapore`s registered address, merely to receive correspondence and to pass them to Vigers Singapore`s office, without any work being done by RPBS, on the correspondence received.
This again, was consistent with the appellant`s plan. Allowing RPBS to name the nominee secretary and provide a registered address was merely to justify payment to RPBS, should there be queries as to the work that RPBS did. In any event, if there was an agreement by the other directors that he would be paid for the secretarial work, he could have been paid through Sloan by Vigers Singapore directly. I could not see why there was a need to have RPBS in the scheme, merely for the payment of the fees for his secretarial work. In these circumstances, clearly the trial judge was entitled to find that the use of RPBS was a deliberate device to conceal the wrongful payments of the appellant to himself, from Vigers Singapore`s funds.
 The appellant`s right to be paid
Finally, I had to consider whether the appellant really believed that he should be paid, since, if he did, he would not have been dishonest. It was undisputed that the appellant did the secretarial work. However, as mentioned, there was a demarcation of duties, with the appellant being responsible for the company secretarial work. It was undisputed that there was no agreement that the appellant should do the work for free.
The $500 was allegedly paid for secretarial services for April and June 1993. At that time, the appellant had not joined the company yet. The appellant became a non-executive director on 15 April 1993 and managing director on 15 June 1993. The appellant only became a full-time managing director of Vigers Singapore on 1 July 1993. The appellant had initiated a resolution to increase his remuneration as director to $8,000 on 1 July 1993
A person who does work normally expects to be paid for it. Therefore, counsel for the appellant had submitted that since, at that time, the appellant was not yet in the employment of Vigers Singapore, he had a right to be paid for the services rendered. In this case, however, I felt that it was perfectly reasonable for the appellant to have done the work without expecting to be paid, as he was already a shareholder of Vigers Singapore and was going to be a director. Therefore, he had a vested interest in the company. Faced with the evidence, the trial judge drew a reasonable inference that the appellant was doing the work, which due to the verbal agreement on the demarcation of duties, was under his domain anyway, as this benefited him. There was after all no agreement that he was going to be paid. With the appellant`s vast experience, he would surely know that, as he was a non-executive director at the material time, if he was going to receive remuneration, there would need to be a company resolution to that effect.
If the appellant had genuinely thought he was entitled to be paid, why did he do everything surreptitiously? If he had felt that he was entitled to be paid for the work done, he should have made all the other directors aware of the payment to him. After all, any ordinary person is likely to make full disclosure of such matters, to avoid being swamped with allegations in the future. Even if a person thinks that he is entitled to something, it does not entitle him to take it, without obtaining the owner`s permission. Similarly, in this case, the appellant was not entitled to the $500, without the permission of Vigers Singapore, namely, the board of directors of Vigers.
As for the $1,000, the appellant seemed to make a distinction as to what sort of work came under corporate secretarial work. He appeared to say that although he had the overall charge of corporate secretarial work, he did not have to do the actual corporate secretarial work, like preparing resolutions and updating records. Since he did such work, he felt that he deserved to be paid for it. I thought that this argument was very weak and I saw no merit in it. The $1,000 was allegedly for secretarial work done from July to December 1993. During this time, the appellant was already managing director at Vigers Singapore. He was already receiving remuneration of $8,000. I entirely agreed with the trial judge`s finding that his high salary included the company secretarial work, which he was meant to do according to the demarcation of responsibilities anyway. There was no evidence that he was to be paid separately for the work he did and I saw no reason why he should have been.
From the evidence above, it was a natural inference that the appellant knew that the gain to himself and RPBS with the loss to Vigers Singapore was wrongful. The appellant was well acquainted and experienced with company matters and knew the regulations observed by companies. In my opinion, the appellant could only have acted the way he did, because he knew that his actions were wrongful and he was trying to conceal them. The appellant therefore, intended to cause the wrongful gain and loss and therefore, dishonesty was certainly present in this case. In fact, the appellant`s actions also amounted to putting the interest of himself and his brother over that of the company, and his actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duties. This alone was insufficient to be the basis of a conviction under s 409 of the Penal Code: see 
 Cheam Tat Pang v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 541
. However, in this case, it was evident that the appellant`s actions went beyond a mere breach of fiduciary duty.
 Conclusion
On the whole, I was satisfied that the charge under s 409 of the Penal Code had been proved against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not find any merit in the contentions raised on appeal. As for the sentence imposed, I did not find it manifestly excessive and I was not convinced by counsel`s submissions for a reduction of the sentence. For these reasons, I dismissed the appeal without finding it necessary to hear the deputy public prosecutor.

The present matter arose out of an application by a district judge for criminal revision of disqualifications imposed upon the two respondents. At the hearing considering revision, the DPP in fact opposed revision of the first respondent`s disqualification but not revision of the second respondent`s disqualification. At the end of the hearing, I took time for consideration.
 Brief facts
On 14 March 1997, the respondents who were 17 and 16 years old respectively were each convicted upon their pleas of guilt to three charges of theft of motor cycles under s 379A of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Several other charges under the same section as well as s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) were taken into consideration. The district judge called for reformative training and probation reports on the respondents. Having examined the reports, the district judge sentenced the first respondent to reformative training under s 13, Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) and placed the second respondent on two years` probation under the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252). In addition, both respondents were disqualified under s 379A(2) from holding or obtaining any driving licence for a period of five years.
Subsequently, the district judge was concerned with the legality of the disqualification orders imposed. He then raised the matter to this court and sought the court`s exercise of its powers of revision under s 268, CPC. He had formed the view that no disqualification can be made under s 379A where a probation order is made or a sentence of reformative training is passed. In respect of the probation order, disqualification cannot occur because of the operation of ss 5 and 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act. As for reformative training, s 13(1) CPC states that such training is to be in lieu of any other sentence, so it is not permissible to impose disqualification as well. Additionally, since the disqualification is to run from the date of the offender`s release from imprisonment, disqualification cannot accompany reformative training.
 DPP`s submissions for petitioner
At the hearing determining the exercise of the court`s powers to revise, the prosecution accepted that the effect of s 11 of the Probation of Offenders Act is that the probation order is not a conviction for the purposes of s 379A. The disqualification order against the second respondent was therefore wrong in law.
However, it was submitted that the disqualification order against the first respondent was correctly made. First, such a disqualification is not a sentence within the meaning of s 13, CPC: 
R v Surrey Quarter Sessions, ex p Commissioner of Metropolitan Police
 
[1963] 1 QB 990
[cited] . Cases in Singapore which have referred to disqualification as a sentence did not use the term `sentence` in its technical sense, but merely for the purposes of appeal: 
Joseph Roland v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
  ; 
Heng Jee Tai v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 426
 [distd] .
Secondly, though s 379A(2) requires disqualification to run from the release of the offender from imprisonment, the term `imprisonment` does not require the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment; it includes any form of incarceration imposed by law, including reformative training, corrective training or preventive detention: P St J Langan, 
 Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes 
 (12th Ed, 1976) referred to. Such an interpretation should be preferred because it gives effect to the purpose of the provision: s 9A Interpretation Act (Cap 1), Constitutional Reference No 1 of 1995 
[1995] 2 SLR 201
; 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  ; 
River Wear Commissioners v Adamson
 
[1874-1880] All ER Rep 1
 ; 
Tan Weng Chiang v PP
 
 
[1992] 2 MLJ 625
 [refd] . In any event, the term `imprisonment` is ambiguous, and reference can be made to extrinsic materials and the purpose of the provision: 
Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte Ltd
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 690
  .
That purpose was to provide for heavier penalties against theft of motor vehicles: 44 
 Parliamentary Debates 
 col 1862, 1869, 1878 (1984). Those who commit such offences invariably drive on the roads without adequate insurance coverage, endangering others. The disqualification would have to run after the period of incarceration to ensure that it is not rendered ineffective because it ceases before the offender is released from imprisonment.
Any other interpretation would result in an absurdity for a person subject to reformative or corrective training or preventive detention would not be liable to disqualification, even though the period of such training may be longer than the minimum mandatory term of imprisonment. In particular it must be noted that corrective training is a form of imprisonment: 
R v McCarthy
 
[1995] 1 WLR 856
 . In cases where some other form of incarceration is imposed, the disqualification order should commence from the date of release from such incarceration. This interpretation is supported by s 2, Prisons Act (Cap 247), which defines a prison as including a reformative training centre, and defines prisoner as including persons under detention in any prison or reformative training centre.
 Respondents` submission
The respondents were not represented and did not make any submission.
 The law
Section 379A of the Penal Code reads:
 
 
(1) Whoever commits theft of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than one year and not more than 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. 
 
(2) A person convicted of an offence under this section shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification, be disqualified for a period of not less than 3 years from the date of his release from imprisonment from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act. 
 
... 
  
 
 
In a normal situation, where a person has been convicted, a term of imprisonment is mandatory. In addition to such imprisonment, and any fine, the offender is also to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for at least three years, unless there are special reasons.
The respondents were however not sentenced to imprisonment. The first respondent had reformative training imposed, while the second respondent was ordered to be on probation. The issue then is whether disqualification could be ordered in respect of either of these two types of sanction.
 Probation
Probation is governed by the Probation of Offenders Act. Section 5 of that Act allows the court to impose a probation order instead of a sentence. Then s 11 reads:
 
 
(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, a conviction for an offence for which an order is made under this Act placing the offender on probation ... shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the foregoing provisions of this Act. ... 
 
(2) Without prejudice to subsection (1), the conviction of an offender who is placed on probation or discharged absolutely or conditionally as aforesaid shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability.
  
 
 
Subsection (2) is clear in its operation. The imposition of a probation order is not to be considered as a conviction for the purposes of disqualification under any written law. The second respondent was therefore not convicted for the purposes of s 379A and he should therefore not have been disqualified. This is a serious injustice going to the root of the court`s powers and the order made by the district judge is accordingly quashed.
 Reformative training
Reformative training is provided for by s 13, CPC which reads:
 
 
(1) Where a male person is convicted by the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment, then if on the day of his conviction he is not less than 16 years but under 21 years of age, and the Court is satisfied having regard to his character and previous conduct, and to the circumstances of the offence that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may in lieu of any other sentence, pass a sentence of reformative training.
  
 
 
As noted by the prosecution, reformative training is to be in lieu of any other sentence. This means that such training cannot be imposed concurrently with any prison sentence. The question then is whether an order for disqualification is also a sentence for the purposes of s 13.
In a broad sense, a sentence may be defined as the imposition of punishment. It may be argued that since a disqualification order is detrimental to the person against whom it is made, and is intended to be a form of punishment for the crime committed, it too is a sentence. Disqualification orders have, as noted by the DPP, been described as sentences: 
Joseph Roland v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
  ; 
Heng Jee Tai v PP
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 426
  . On this argument, a disqualification order would then be precluded by a sentence of reformative training.
The DPP argues against this, relying on the English Court of Appeal decision of 
R v Surrey Quarter Sessions, ex p Commissioner of Metropolitan Police
 
[1963] 1 QB 990
 . In that case, the defendants had been convicted by justices of taking and driving away motor vehicles without the consent of the owner, an offence under s 217, UK Road Traffic Act 1960, and of using that vehicle without having in force an insurance policy, contrary to s 201 of the same Act. One of the defendants pleaded guilty as well to a charge of driving while disqualified, contrary to s 110(b). The justices disqualified them from holding driving licences for four years, but committed them to the quarter sessions court for sentencing to a period of borstal training (after which reformative training in Singapore was modelled). However, the appeals committee of quarter sessions held that it had no jurisdiction to impose such a sentence as the defendants had already been sentenced by the justices. The chairman of the appeals committee felt bound by the Court of Appeal decision of 
R v Dangerfield
 
[1960] 1 WLR 268
 , in which an order of disqualification was referred to as a sentence.
The matter thus came up before the Court of Appeal. Lord Parker CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, noted that the reference in R v Dangerfield was made solely because a disqualification is a sentence for the purposes of appeal, as provided for by s 21 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907. Generally however, such an order was not a sentence. His Lordship referred to 
R v London Sessions Appeal Committee, ex p Beaumont
 
[1951] 1 KB 557
 , where Hilbery J, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, drew a distinction between sentences generally and other orders made by the court at the time judgment is given. Similarly in 
R v Arundel Justices, ex p Jackson
 
[1959] 2 QB 89
 , Lord Goddard CJ drew a distinction between a sentence and a disqualification order for the purposes of quashing the latter. On the basis of these authorities, Lord Parker came to the conclusion that a disqualification order, unless expressly stated to be so, was not a sentence.
Of these authorities relied upon by Lord Parker, 
 R v Arundel Justices 
, is of limited application, since in the statute under consideration in that case, a disqualification order was distinguished from a sentence: at 91) The use of the term `sentence` and its ambit were also considered in a number of other English cases, the more recent of which included 
R v Williams
 
[1982] 1 WLR 1398
 , 
R v Welch
 
[1982] 1 WLR 976
 and 
R v Menocal
 
[1980] AC 598
 . But these cases did so in respect of specific statutory contexts such as the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (c 19) and the Courts Act 1971 (c 23).
The more persuasive authority is 
 R v London Sessions, ex p Beaumont 
, where Hilbery J said, at p 561 :
 
... it must be remembered that, apart from the definition of sentence created by this statute, no order made by the court in addition to the sentence which it has passed has hitherto been any part of the sentence. After verdict or confession by the accused person on arraignment, the court gave judgment: that was the regular completion of the record. Any order made by the court at the time when judgment was given was not part of the sentence and judgment: it was an order of the court added to the record.
 
 
 
Hilbery J thus drew a distinction between the judgment of the court, which incorporated the sentence, and other orders made concurrently with the judgment, which were not either sentences or judgments.
With respect, however, this does not assist the court much. When faced with a question whether a particular order is a sentence, the court would have to ask itself whether it was part of the sentence or judgment, which is the very thing to be inquired. While the authorities cited by the prosecution would support the contention that there is a distinction between a sentence and another order made in the course of criminal proceedings, they do not provide any concrete assistance.
Another argument which could have been used in support of the prosecution`s contentions would have used the distinction drawn in the Criminal Procedure Code itself between sentences and orders: see ss 261, 266 and 396. It is noteworthy as well that in the conferral of jurisdiction upon the district court in s 11 CPC, the sentences specifically within that court`s jurisdiction are listed, and no orders are included. But the strength of this argument is weakened by the observation that the use of a word in a particular sense within a statute or a section, cannot control its meaning entirely when used in some other part of that statute or section. The assumption of that argument is that the words are used with the same purpose or intent; while this may often be the case, it is not invariably so.
In 
R v Warfield
 
[1994] 34 NSWLR 200
 , Hunt CJ considered the ordinary meaning of `sentence`. His Honour adopted the description used by Barwick CJ in 
Griffiths v R
 
[1977] 137 CLR 293
 , that a sentence was either an order which definitively disposed of the consequences of the conviction or a definitive decision by the judge on the punishment or absence of such punishment which was a consequence of the conviction. Again this does not take the court very far. A disqualification order is in reality a consequence of the conviction, for it generally follows a conviction. And a disqualification order is in reality a type of punishment, although, as in the case here, it removes a privilege and not a right.
A more fruitful approach would be to examine the purpose and intent of s 13. That section is triggered whenever an offender is convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment; in such a situation, reformative training may be imposed in lieu of another sentence. In such a context, while the section is not expressly limited to be in lieu of sentences of imprisonment, as is s 12 CPC (which deals with corrective training and preventive detention), it does indicate that the purpose of reformative training is to take the place of such imprisonment. In character, reformative training is a form of incarceration or deprivation of liberty. It corresponds to imprisonment. The substitution of reformative training for imprisonment is thus understandable for it would otherwise render the offender liable to double punishment of the same type. Whether a fine may be imposed together with reformative training is not in issue in the present case, but this court is, as presently advised, inclined to the view that that is permissible. Section 13 should therefore be read such that reformative training is to be in lieu of imprisonment only. On this purposive approach, the imposition of a disqualification order alongside a sentence of reformative training is correct at law.
It may be contended though that, if there is an ambiguity in s 13, the court should not interpret it in a way that is prejudicial to the offender. This contention could perhaps be made by relying on the principle against doubtful penalisation: see s 271, Francis Bennion, 
 Statutory Interpretation 
 (2nd Ed, 1992). On this argument, s 13 should be interpreted in such a way that it causes the least prejudice to the offender by precluding disqualification. This court is of the view that the principle is not an obstacle to the interpretation adopted here. There are two related bases for the principle against doubtful penalisation: the predictability of the law, and that, in the common law world, everything that is not forbidden is permitted. In essence, the hypothetical citizen who knows all the legal rules should be in a position to order his actions without fear that he is unwittingly breaking the law. Here, the purpose of s 13 is manifestly clear. In any event, this court is not convinced that the principle against doubtful penalisation has any application where the court is construing provisions of sanction; by the time such provisions have to be construed, the offence would already have been committed. The hypothetical citizen in ordering his affairs would have been concerned solely with determining whether his actions constitute an offence or not; the punishment that he would be liable for if he was committing an offence would have been irrelevant in his considerations. Those who order their affairs by a process of calculating the punishment that they would be liable for if they were to take a particular course of action do not deserve the sympathy of the courts.
For these reasons, I am of the view that a disqualification order is not a sentence for the purposes of s 13, and the court is not precluded from imposing both reformative training and disqualification orders by virtue of the wording of s 13 itself.
But that is not the end of the matter. Even if disqualification orders are not precluded by reformative training sentences imposed under s 13, the operation of s 379A(2) has to be considered. That subsection raises another possible bar against the imposition of a disqualification order concurrently with reformative training: it stipulates that the disqualification order is to commence at the point when the offender is released from his imprisonment. The district judge was concerned that this meant, firstly, that disqualification can only be ordered when a sentence of imprisonment is passed, and that otherwise there can be no ascertainment of the commencement of the period of disqualification.
At first glance, the use of the term `imprisonment` in both sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 379A would lead one to the conclusion that it must be used in the same sense. While this would be the normal approach to take, it cannot lead to an absurd interpretation. If the sense of `imprisonment` in sub-s (1) were allowed to control the meaning in sub-s (2), as the DPP points out, the court would be precluded from ordering disqualification except where the offender is sentenced to prison; those given reformative or corrective training, or preventive detention orders could not be disqualified. This is manifestly absurd, particularly as the period of preventive detention in particular could be far longer than that of imprisonment.
The DPP contends that the reference to `imprisonment` in sub-s (2) is only to ensure that disqualification is not rendered a nullity by overlapping with the period of imprisonment. Once that objective is recognised, nothing stands in the way of interpreting the reference to `imprisonment` as one to either any form of detention or of remand. I am in agreement with that submission.
This interpretation ignores the literal reading of the words used in the statutory provision. But any departure from such literal readings is justified where the result would otherwise be absurd. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) reads:
 
In the interpretation of a provision of written law, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object.
 
 
 
That section was used in 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 209
  . In that case, the Court of Appeal had to consider the meaning of the phrase `having reference to the charge` as used in s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). Faced with a choice between a strict, literal approach, and one that promoted the object of s 24, the court, utilising s 9A, opted for the latter. And so here. Where some other form of remand or detention is ordered, s 379A(2) should be read to require that the disqualification order should commence after that period of remand or detention.
 Conclusion
In conclusion therefore, the disqualification order against the first respondent was correctly made, and there is no basis for revision. However, the court had no power to order disqualification against the second respondent. That order is accordingly quashed.",1997-05-27 00:00:00,SG High Court
