Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the sentence passed on the respondent on his conviction of an offence under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`). The sentence under appeal is a fine of $1,000. The appellant argued that a custodial sentence should have been imposed.
The offence of which the respondent was convicted and sentenced is for driving whilst under disqualification. The charge against him reads: 
 
You, Akhtar Hussain Mann are charged that on 23 March 1989 at about 3pm along Commonwealth Avenue West Singapore, did ride motor cycle No FE 6809Y whilst you were being disqualified by the Magistrate Court No 23 from riding all class 2B, 2A and 2 vehicle for a period of one year wef 18 April 1988 to 17 April 1989 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
Section 43(3) of the Act reads: 
 
If any person who under the provisions of this Act is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence applies for or obtains a driving licence while he is so disqualified or if any such person while he is so disqualified drives a motor vehicle, or if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description a motor vehicle of that class or description, on a road, that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction -
 
 
 
(a) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months; 
(b) (if the court thinks that having regard to the special circumstances of the case it is not necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the offence) to a fine not exceeding $1,000; or 
(c) to both,
 
 
 
and a driving licence obtained by any person disqualified as aforesaid shall be of no effect.
 
 
 
The magistrate in his grounds of decision explained that: 
 
I did not impose any custodial sentence as I was then of the view that the mitigating circumstances pleaded by the accused amounted to special circumstances under the Act. The prosecution did not address the court on this issue of special circumstances. I took into account the fact that the accused was a first offender and in a month`s time he would be studying in the university. An imprisonment term may affect the accused`s university studies. The accused had also committed the offence towards the end of the disqualification period.
 
 
 
It should be noted that the magistrate was clearly mistaken in describing the respondent as a first offender.
The issues to be determined in this appeal are firstly, what `special circumstances of the case` encompasses and secondly, whether there are any such special circumstances on the facts.
There are no reported decisions from Singapore or Malaysia on the meaning of the phrase. There are decisions on the `special reasons` for not ordering disqualification for the offences of driving under the influence of drink and for driving without insurance cover (see s 67(2) of the Act and s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189)) which must be considered.
Rex v Lim Kian Soo
 
 
[1950] MLJ 181
  is the first reported decision. This was a special case before the High Court of Singapore (Murray-Aynsley CJ, Evans and Storr JJ). The question before the court was the meaning of the words `unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise` in s 48(2) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1941, relating to the offence of driving without insurance cover.
Murray-Aynsley CJ referred to 
Whittall v Kirby
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 a decision on s 15(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1930 bearing the same `special reasons` provisions. In 
Whittall
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 Lord Goddard adopted Andrews LCJ`s definition in 
Rex v Crossan
 
[1939] NI 106
 that: 
 
A `special reason` within the exception is one which is special to the facts of the particular case, that is, special to the facts which constitute the offence. It is, in other words, a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence, and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment. A circumstance peculiar to the offender as distinguished from the offence is not a `special reason` within the exception.
 
 
 
Murray-Aynsley CJ had reservations over this definition. He said: 
 
I personally think that the form in which that statement is made is open to objection. I think that it cuts down the discretion given to the courts when it limits `special circumstances` in this way. Mitigating circumstances in a case may be of either kind.
 
 
 
In my opinion courts, when approaching the question, should begin by remembering that if they find the circumstances sufficient in one case they must make a like finding in all like cases.
The word `special` is the antonym of the word `general` which would mean the circumstances that would be present in every case under the section. But, if they find circumstances `special` for the purpose of mitigation which are found in a large percentage of cases, they are creating exceptions of a general character and it must be assumed that if the legislature had intended that the particular provision should not apply to these common cases it would have said so. Most of the circumstances of a personal character that are usually relied upon are of this kind; eg that the accused had not offended in that way before, that he is a professional driver, etc.
When a discretion of this kind is given it means that certain uncommon cases may occur which could not be foreseen by the legislature in which that particular kind of punishment is unsuitable or manifestly excessive. Such circumstances will usually be found in the circumstances of the offence. It would be perhaps difficult in dealing with this section to think of circumstances of this kind of a personal character, but it will be seen from decided cases that this has happened.
Evans J accepted

 without reservation, but Storr J expressed his agreement with the Chief Justice. In the event, as far as Singapore is concerned, there appears to be some uncertainty whether `special reasons` extend to circumstances peculiar to an offender. In Malaya (and now in Malaysia), there is no uncertainty. The construction in

 has been accepted in a series of reported decisions, the most recent being 
PP v Teo Kok Keng
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 198
 
If the first question in this appeal is to be answered only by deciding whether I prefer the construction in 
Whittall
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 or that in 
Lim Kian Soo
 
 
[1950] MLJ 181
  I would accept the former. However, I am not so restricted.
The operative words in s 43(3) are `special circumstances 
 of the case 
` (emphasis added). This provision has its counterpart in s 7(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1930, which has received judicial consideration.
In 
Lines v Hersom
 
[1951] 2 KB 682
 Lord Goddard said (at pp 687-688): 
 
In the present case, the words of the section `having regard to the special circumstances of the case`, emphasize that for the purpose of s 7 the circumstances must be special to the case.
 
 
 
I will not say that the conditions relating to the offender are to be left out altogether, because that is almost impossible, but it is the circumstances which are special to the case which are to be the primary consideration.
We also pointed out in 
 Whittall v Kirby 
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
, and I desire to re-emphasize it, that, where Parliament says that the circumstances are to be `special`, it is obviously contrasting circumstances that are special with circumstances that are general.
and that (at pp 688-689): 
 
... the proper interpretation to be put upon s 7, sub-s 4, is that prima facie, for the very serious offence involved, the offender should be sent to prison. The offence of driving when disqualified is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit, because it follows that if he injures someone that person will be unable to recover any compensation if the motorist cannot pay, because no insurance company will be liable. Parliament has said that prison is the proper penalty for the offence. That may be hard, and we have often pointed out that questions of disqualification often involve great hardship, but the question whether there is great hardship or whether the penalty is a severe one is not a matter for the court if Parliament has ordained it. Our duty is to apply the law which Parliament has laid down, and if Parliament has said that prima facie the penalty for this particular offence is to be imprisonment it is the duty of the courts to impose imprisonment unless, as provided in s 7, sub-s 4, there are special circumstances of such a kind as would justify them in passing a lighter sentence, that is to say, a fine instead of imprisonment.
 
 
 
Hilberry J, in concurring with Lord Goddard, was of the view that: 
 
In s 7, sub-s 4, the words are not only `special circumstances` but `special circumstances of the case`, and, in addition, those words occur in a sentence where it is said `or if the court think that, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, a fine would be an adequate punishment for the offence`. I regard the last words of that sentence as being of some importance since they indicate that in s 7, sub-s 4, the statute is not contemplating the offender but essentially the offence, and the special circumstances which the court must find are to be circumstances of the case, disregarding any circumstances which are special to the offender.
 
 
 
In 
Aichroth v Cottee
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1124
[1954] 2 All ER 856
 Lord Goddard went on to say that there is no difference in substance between `special circumstances` and `special reasons` and that the two expressions are the same.
I am in full agreement with the views of the learned judges. Having come to this conclusion, I find that the fact that the respondent was due to go to university is not a special circumstance. In any event, even if this is a matter that can be taken into consideration, the mitigating factors considered by the magistrate do not constitute a sufficient reason not to impose a custodial sentence.
For these reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the fine of $1,000 imposed by the magistrate. As the respondent did not offer any explanation for having ridden his motor cycle whilst he was under disqualification, I sentenced him to serve two weeks` imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of $500.
