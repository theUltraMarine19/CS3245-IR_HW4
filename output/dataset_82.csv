       STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v JANE MOSS 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1    MASON P: In 1988 the respondent was a Year 10 student at a State high school. She suffered severe burns during a science experiment. Proceedings were commenced against the appellant in the Supreme Court and were then transferred to the District Court. The appellant admitted negligence. 
     
      
    2    The assessment of damages was undertaken in 1998 by jury in a trial presided over by Judge Sinclair QC. The jury awarded a verdict of $799,580. In the light of the way the case had gone to the jury, the parties were able to agree that the verdict should be treated as containing the following integers: 
     
      
      General damages $225,000 
       
      Past wage loss $ 20,000 
       
      Future wage loss $330,356 
       
      Past medical and hospital expenses $ 64,500 
       
      Future medical and hospital expenses $ 79,724 
       
      Past voluntary assistance $ 80,000 
       
       Total $799,580 
       
       
      
    3    It was necessary to work out what interest was payable on the verdict and to allow the appellant credit for payments already made. As to interest, it was held that the respondent was entitled to interest on $112,500 (half of general damages) for 10.15 years at the rate of 2%. This came to $22,837. It was further ordered that the respondent was entitled to interest totalling $89,100 with respect to the award for past voluntary assistance and to interest totalling $20,000 with respect to the award for past economic loss. When these sums were added to the jury's verdict and when the appellant was allowed credit in respect of payments already made by it, the resultant figure was $873,529. Judgment was entered in this sum. 
     
      
    4    At the time of the accident the respondent was an attractive young woman, aged 14. In response to a question whether she was a good student she replied ""not bad. I wouldn't say bad”. Her long-term ambition was to become a hairdresser. There was ample material before the jury capable of satisfying them that she would have achieved this goal had the cosmetic and physical injuries suffered in the accident not prevented it. She already had a part-time job. She had studied typing. Despite her horrific injuries, suffered in June 1988, her school certificate results at the end of that year were commendable. She had never returned to school after the accident, but had studied at home with the assistance of a tutor. Her post injury employment record and her capacity to get on with life after the accident demonstrated considerable drive and capacity. She was a competitive sportswoman, playing netball regularly and (for the two years prior to the trial in 1998) being involved in the administration of a netball competition. She was fortunate to have the support of caring parents and, latterly, of her husband. It would appear that she continued in paid employment right up to the birth of her two children in October 1995 and May 1998 and that she returned to paid employment fairly soon after each child's birth. 
     
      
    5    The accident in the science laboratory involved an experiment to extract fat from a sausage. The sausage was put into a beaker and heated over a tripod. Methylated spirits was poured into the beaker and there was an explosion. There was extensive burning to the whole of the respondent's face and most of her neck. The front and back of her hands were terribly burnt. There was also burning over much of the front of her body, including her right breast and over parts of her legs. 
     
      
    6    The respondent was in intensive care at Westmead hospital for two and half weeks and she spent a further three and half weeks in the burns unit at that hospital. She then returned to her parents’ home. As indicated above, she never went back to school. There were many return visits to hospital for skin grafts, operations on her hands, operations on her ears (which on the outside had been reduced to small cauliflowers). There was extensive physiotherapy. For two and half years the respondent wore a pressure suit, known as a Jobst suit. This was painful and unsightly and the respondent needed help to get it on and off each day. The scarring was not just physical: the respondent required psychotherapy to cope with the anger, distress and sense of loss experienced in her teenage years. 
     
      
    7    Considerable scarring remains. According to a 1997 report from her plastic surgeon Mr Thompson, there remains very extensive visible burn scarring involving all areas of the respondent’s face and the front of her neck and particular disfigurement of both external ears. The facial disfigurement is gross, visible and impossible to disguise adequately. No further surgical treatment is likely to ameliorate the overall impact of the facial scarring, which will be permanent and lifelong. There is also gross disfigurement of both hands which is impossible to disguise. The breast scarring caused difficulties in feeding the respondent's first daughter. The deformed ears remain very ugly. The respondent's hands are tight and cramped at times. The sensitivity of her skin means that she is restricted in exposing it to sunlight and needs special cosmetics. 
     
      
    8    In their final addresses to the jury, counsel for each party spoke to Schedules of Damages which they had prepared and which were given to the jury. The respondent's Schedule was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. 
          
        GENERAL DAMAGES 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The plaintiff has suffered horrific injuries. She has gross scarring of the face, neck, breast and hands. She has large graft patches on her thighs and burn marks on her legs. She has distorted buds where her ears were. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) She has undergone about 12 operations, mainly involving skin grafts with skin cut from her thighs. Her last admission to hospital was only 14 months ago. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) In the course of her treatment she has been subjected to exquisitely painful procedures such as the daily baths to scrape off skin in her first admission and the scouring of her ears by her mother at home. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) She wore an ugly, constricting and uncomfortable pressure suit for two years. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) She has suffered and will suffer for the rest of her life (57 years) the mental anguish associated with her disfigurement and the loss of her self worth. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) She has suffered acute depression and post traumatic stress disorder for years and continues to suffer those conditions to a lesser degree. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) She is vulnerable to life stresses with which other people could cope, with the result that for her these stresses would probably result in depressive illness, with the further disruption of her life and the further need for psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) She is restricted in where she can go (she must avoid sunlight) and what she can do (her hands, particularly, cannot stand exertion or trauma). 
        
       
       
        
        (i) She is constantly reminded by the thoughtlessness of others of the serious compromise of her former beauty. This will never change. 
        
       
       
        
        (j) She has the constant chore of having to protect her skin with creams and to apply special make-up which partially masks some of her scars. 
        
       
       
        
        (k) She suffers from constant obsessive thoughts of what might have been if she had not been burned. 
        
       
       
        
        2. PAST WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        It is difficult to be precise about the plaintiff’s loss to date. She lost the best part of a year in 1989 and is entitled to be paid for the holiday pay which she took when she had to have operations. 
        
       
       
        
        As well, there have been broken periods when the plaintiff has not worked, or not worked as much as she otherwise would have. 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to her relatively low earnings to date, it is submitted an appropriate allowance over the 10 years to date would be $20,000 
        
       
       
        
        3. FUTURE WAGE LOSS 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The present average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales is $500 per week. The plaintiff averages less than $300 per week, a difference of $200 per week. Over 40 years, to age 65, that throws up a loss of $244,840. Discounted by 10%, that is $220,356 
        
       
       
        
        (b) In addition, an amount ought to be allowed for the loss by the plaintiff of the opportunity to run her own business and to earn substantially above the average. No precise figures appear in the evidence, but it is submitted an appropriate sum would be $110,000 which represents a further $100 per week over 40 years discounted by 10%. Allow - $110,000 
        
       
       
        
        4. PAST MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        Agreed figure - $64,500 
        
       
       
        
        5. FUTURE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Cosmetics, sun screen, moisturiser $12 per week for 57 years (multiplier $143.90). Allow - $17,255 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Hospital and medical excluding psychological costs (see Dr Thompson, report 25 September 1997, estimate of $14,000). Allow - $10,000 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Psychological treatment - 
        
       
       
        
        • Dr Edwards - psychological consultation weekly for two years at $142 (multiplier $1-1.30): $14,389 
         
        • Then three-weekly for further eight years $16,595 
        
       
       
        
        (d) It is submitted that on the evidence of Drs Milton and Dyball as to the plaintiff’s vulnerability to life events, an amount should be allowed as a buffer for the years from year 11 to year 57. Allow - $25,000 
        
       
       
        
        6. PAST VOLUNTARY ASSISTANCE 
        
       
       
        
        (See separate schedule) 
         
        
       
      
    9    It can be seen that this document served at least four purposes: it showed the breakup of damages claimed by the respondent; secondly, it showed what items were agreed and what items were at issue; thirdly, it stated the maximum sums claimed for items of special damages; fourthly, it summarised the basis upon which the respondent advanced her claim under some of the heads of damage. 
     
      
    10    The two schedules went to the jury without objection on either side. They were referred to by counsel in addresses. It is not suggested that any assertion in the respondent's schedule was contrary to the evidence.  
     
      
    11    Judge Sinclair summed up to the jury on 13 August 1998. At the end of the summing up counsel for the appellant (the defendant in the court below) raised minor items of redirection that are not presently relevant. While developing his submission on one point, he contended that the trial judge had usurped the function of the jury and prejudiced the defendant's case. Asked whether he was asking for a discharge of the jury, counsel said that he did not have those instructions. Counsel then reverted to a rather confusing submission about future economic loss. It is hardly surprising that his Honour directed counsel to put in writing the redirection which he sought and to make it available to his opponent and to the judge by 9.15am the following morning. 
     
      
    12    No redirection was sought the following morning. Instead, counsel for the defendant applied for a discharge of the jury. The application was refused. The judge again invited counsel for the defendant to seek further directions, preferably in writing, if he had matters of complaint. No further direction was sought. 
     
      
    13    The appellant's failure to seek a redirection is not necessarily fatal, although it is a most material matter in determining whether there was a substantial wrong or miscarriage (Pt 51 r23, General Motors-Holden’s Pty Ltd v Moularas (1964) 111 CLR 234, Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 33 at 39). 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 to 3 (unbalanced summing up) 
       
      
    14    Taken together, these grounds assert that the trial judge was partisan and unduly favourable to the respondent in his summing up. Eleven passages are identified in the written submissions. It is unnecessary to set them out in this judgment, all the more so because the appellant accepts that they must be read in the context of the summing up as a whole. 
     
      
    15    The summing up contains the conventional information about the respective roles of judge and jury. The jury were cautioned against inferring that the judge held any view as to the facts and told that they were not bound by such view in any event. Of course, such remarks will not insulate an otherwise unbalanced summing up from appellate review.  
     
      
    16    I shall deal separately with the portions of the summing up relating to the income that would have been earned had the respondent been able to pursue the goal of owning her own hairdressing business. The remaining passages did not cause the trial to miscarry. Some of the impugned comments merely restate the arguments of the respondent at trial. None are unsupported by the evidence (with the possible exception of those concerning the hairdressing business). The references to ""the horrific happening"" and the ""ghastly outfit called a Jobst suit"" were statements of the obvious. 
     
      
    17    The challenge to the remark about the likelihood that the respondent would have made ""a good result of her life"" had she not been injured was clearly supportable on the evidence. Like the statement “everybody says this is a lady who has got bags of guts”, it was as relevant to the appellant's case as it was to the respondent's case. 
     
      
    18    A judge does not descend into the arena merely because he or she expresses a view about the facts favourable to one party. 
     
      
    19    In the light of the way the trial proceeded to verdict the appellant’s challenge based on partisanship clearly fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 (value of lost opportunity to be a hairdresser) 
       
      
    20    The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving to the jury the respondent's claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct her own hairdressing business, there being no evidence of the earnings of self-employed hairdressers. 
     
      
    21    As stated above, the appellant faces the hurdle of establishing a substantial wrong or miscarriage in the context of a summing up about which no relevant redirection was sought. 
     
      
    22    The amended Statement of Particulars filed on behalf of the respondent well prior to the trial foreshadowed a claim that the injuries caused her to lose the opportunity of working as a hairdresser as well as the opportunity of owning and working in her own hairdressing salon. Her ambition to have done so is not in issue. And the appellant does not dispute that the cosmetic injuries and the injuries to the respondent's hands combined to prevent her from pursuing such employment.  
     
      
    23    The Schedule of Damages upon which counsel for the respondent addressed shows that the claim for “future wage loss” over 40 years set off the respondent's pattern of actual earnings to reach a two-part figure: 
     
      
       
        
        - average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales $500 per week = $220, 356 
         
        - additional allowance for the respondent's loss of the opportunity to run her own hairdressing business, claimed at the rate of an additional $100 per week = $110, 000. 
        
       
      
    24    The jury awarded these sums in full. The appellant complains about the additional $110,000. 
     
      
    25    It should be said at the outset that the jury were entitled to conclude that the respondent's prospects were ""above-average"". They saw her give evidence. They were entitled to view her prospects favourably, given the drive and resourcefulness which she had demonstrated before and after the accident, together with the evidence as to parental support which she was fortunate to have. The evidence is summarised above. The jury were clearly entitled to conclude that the respondent would probably have achieved her goal of becoming a hairdresser and eventually owning her own hairdressing salon, although it ought to have been understood that this would not have occurred overnight. 
     
      
    26    The appellant’s submission as refined in argument accepts these matters. At the end of the day the nub of the complaint is the absence of evidence to support the proposition that a hairdressing business could or would have projected the respondent's earnings beyond those of the average weekly net wage for full-time adult female workers in New South Wales ($500 per week). Cf Hampton Court Ltd v Crooks (1957) 97 CLR 367. The real issue is whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the loss of that opportunity was productive of financial loss (Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347). 
     
      
    27    I had originally been troubled by this ground of appeal. However, the judgment of Heydon JA with which I respectfully agree has allayed my concerns. I agree with what his Honour has written and would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 (vicissitudes) 
       
      
    28    The appellant complains about the directions in relation to the conventional deduction for vicissitudes. It will be seen that this was an area where a specific objection was taken about the summing up. 
     
      
    29    In the respondent's Schedule of Damages (par 8 above) the respondent proposed a discount of 10 percent in the calculation of future economic loss. As will be seen below, the jury were invited to choose a factor between 10% and 15% and they chose 10%. The jury awarded the respondent everything that she claimed in regard to economic loss. 
     
      
    30    The relevant direction, the complaint made about it at trial, and the trial judge's response to that complaint were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Then you have got this question of diminution of earning capacity, and in relation to that you have got paragraph 3, “future wage loss”, and you see the basis of the submissions put to you by counsel for the plaintiff and what figures he takes.  
        I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you. 
          
        
       
       
        
        Because the law says that, for instance, when you are calculating a future wage loss, take a simple example of $10 a week for the next twenty years of a fellow’s life. He might have chopped a bit of his finger off, but not much otherwise. You do not say that is $10 a year for this and this, and $10 a week for this, so that is $500 a year and ten years is $5,000 and so forth, because you would arrive at a sum which is far too much. What you have to take into account in your verdict is the present lump sum value of so much a week. There may be cases when you cannot do it on that basis, but whatever approach you take, frankly, you have to take some approach to start with to get an idea of what it is really worth, and the law says you go to the tables produced by actuaries and that is why you were given that figure, the multiplier, by counsel for the plaintiff. And so you have got the multiplier there. A dollar a week for the next 40 years is $1,224. If you were going to give her $100 a week then you put two noughts on the end of that. 
        
       
       
        
        And then you might say “what is this discount by 10 per cent”. That is another thing. The law says that when assessing the value of the diminution of earning capacity in the future, you must take into account the “vicissitudes” is a word I have always used, but it now seems to be exigencies of life. In other words, if you had a simple fellow who had a simple job and a set wage and then he lost his leg or something, and you are looking at assessing his loss of wages in the future  
        you have got to take into account the facts of life.  
        
       
       
        
        How many people go through life working five days a week for 40 years without  
        having a bit of time off for something 
        .  
        Either they get an illness, or prang the car, or have an argument with the boss and they have to find a job somewhere else. That is some pretty rough examples of what vicissitudes of life is, and the court says then you come to your figure of diminution of earning capacity, you must then make a reasonable discount, again bearing in mind a particular plaintiff as to vicissitudes of life 
        . After all, if the plaintiff in another case with a broken leg had not been in another job for a couple of months, and had an unfortunate habit of spending too long in the pub of a Friday night, and might even have got knocked down on the way home, that is the vicissitudes of life and that is why the discount is there. It has been suggested at 10 per cent by counsel for the plaintiff and I do not think any other figure has been suggested by counsel for the defendant, am I right? 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: I haven’t your Honour, but your Honour would know that 10 per cent is not the normal vicissitude of life. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not concerned with normal I am concerned with the plaintiff, and I asked you to give me submissions. 
        
       
       
        
        STERNBERG: Well 15 per cent, if the jury gets that far, I would submit that it is 15 per cent. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:  
        Members of the jury, your range is 10 to 15 per cent 
        .  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    31    It was clear that the respondent was not going to earn $600 per week for an unbroken period of 40 years. For workers generally and for this plaintiff in particular there would be many contingencies or vicissitudes, positive and negative, properly to be taken into account. In this State 15% is a conventional starting point, as counsel reminded his Honour. 
     
      
    32    The appellant relies upon the following passage in the judgment of Beazley JA (with whom Powell JA and I agreed) in Nestle Australia v McDougall, Court of Appeal, unreported, 24 June 1998:  
     
      
       
        
        It is accepted that the “usual deduction” for contingencies is 15%. This percentage was accepted by the High Court as “the practice” in New South Wales, “subject to adjustment up or down to take account of the plaintiff’s particular circumstances”: see

          “A conventional discount of 15% … is allowed in many cases, although this Court has been at pains to say that there is no warrant for inflexibility in fixing the appropriate deduction. The eventualities which people, individually, are likely to face in their lives necessarily vary enormously. They are particular to each injured claimant.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A survey of the authorities reveals that discounts of up to 40% have been applied for vicissitudes.  
        Urban Transit Authority of New South Wales v Seitis 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 17 May 1995) was one such case, where this Court increased the discount for vicissitudes from 25% to 40% where the plaintiff had cerebral palsy. It should be noted, however, that a 40% discount has been described as “high”:  
        New South Wales Insurance Ministerial Corporation v Sprengnagel 
         (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 28 March 1995) per Priestley JA at 8. 
        
       
       
      
    33    The principal negative contingencies or “vicissitudes” that are normally taken into account are sickness, accident, unemployment and industrial disputes (Wynn v NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 485 at 497). The latter two considerations were unlikely to impact markedly upon the trade of female hairdressing, assuming (as was the case presented) that the respondent was effectively locked into this perspective. This left sickness or accident and they were covered by the trial judge’s directions.  
     
      
    34    Should the trial judge have told the jury that 15% was conventional in New South Wales? Failure to have done so was not, in my view, itself an error leading to a substantial miscarriage given the facts of this case and the appellant’s failure, through counsel, to press the trial judge for a more specific direction concerning vicissitudes in which reasons for not departing from the conventional figure were outlined. 
     
      
    35    The nub of the appellant’s complaint on this head is that the direction given by his Honour did not suggest any reasons why a lower than usual discount might be appropriate for this respondent. She was married with two young children, so the likelihood was that greater rather than less interruptions might be on the cards even for a modern working wife. Judicial statements about the relevance of individual circumstances are usually made in order to indicate that a greater than usual discount is called for, except for particular plaintiffs in occupations that enjoy high levels of security (see Luntz op cit pp285-6). To have left the jury with choosing between a 10-15% range was inadequate, notwithstanding the perfunctory submissions of the appellant’s counsel at trial. The respondent’s drive and capacity to work and to earn higher than average had been addressed (however adequately) in the jury’s consideration of a starting point for the respondents pre-injury earning capacity ie the figures of $500 or $600 per week as the case was advanced by the respondent. This was the universe of discourse in which progression through apprenticeship to full employment to proprietorship was addressed. Additional remuneration through promotion was hardly apposite to self-employment in a hairdressing business. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 (general damages excessive) 
       
      
    36    As indicated above, the parties agreed that $225,000 was awarded for general damages. The appellant submits that this was excessive when one takes into account the fact that the respondent was able to achieve a stable domestic situation, marrying and bearing two children, and obtaining steady employment. She had played netball regularly for six years at date of trial and had also, at times, played touch football and indoor cricket. 
     
      
    37    The appellant sought to compare the jury's award with the sums payable for a most extreme case under the Motor Accidents Act and the maximum allowable for a work injury under the Workers Compensation Act. This is not a proper basis for challenging an uncapped jury verdict. 
     
      
    38    I have briefly summarised the extent and the impact of the respondent's injuries and the disabilities stemming from them. There was extensive pain and suffering over a prolonged period, exacerbated by frequent return visits to hospital for further treatment and painful surgery. The accident occurred in the respondent's teenage years, scarring her physically and emotionally at a critical time in her life. The scars remain (to an extent) and they will remain throughout her life. The award for general damages was within an acceptable range. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 (use of written submissions in the form of the Schedule of Damages) 
       
      
    39    It is convenient to address ground 8 before ground 7. The Schedule of Damages is set out at par 8 above. 
     
      
    40    The blunt and largely undeveloped submission of the appellant that the trial judge ought not to have allowed counsel to provide written submissions to the jury deserves an equally blunt: “Why not?”. The particular Schedule is a helpful summary that must have been of assistance to the jury. Its use as an aide memoire went without protest and was matched by the appellant’s use of its own Schedule.  
     
      
    41    The Court was not referred to any case law on the broader issue. Even in the criminal law it may be appropriate for a summary to go to a jury, although the court retains a wide discretion, the practice is exceptional and demonstrated assistance to the jury (not just to a party) is critical (see Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 190, Tripodina and Morabito v R (1988) 35 A Crim R 183, Savvas (1989) 45 A Crim R 38). In Savvas Hunt J said (at 39):  
     
      
       
        
        In civil trials, juries are often assisted by documents based upon the evidence which are put before them during the course of the closing addresses. I have in mind, in particular, calculations of damages in personal injury cases. It goes without saying that such documents usually set out the contentions of one party only and that there is often a number of elements in the equations worked out in those documents which are the subject of strong dispute in the evidence. That circumstance does not affect the validity of the practice in civil trials. Counsel could have dictated the detail in the document to the jurors, who would then have written down their own record of the addresses. The document is permitted to be given to the jurors for the sake of convenience and expedition.  
        
       
       
        
        Jurors are correctly credited with sufficient commonsense to be able to appreciate the fact that some of the elements in the documents before them are in dispute. But, in no civil case would it be considered appropriate for such a document to go before the jury where it contains propositions of doubtful or spurious validity. The emphasis which a written document gives to such a proposition is not easily overcome by oral directions given by the trial judge in order to correct them. It would be quite unfair for such documents to go before a jury when they are considering their verdict. 
        
       
       
      
    42    In the light of these principles and the way the case was conducted at trial, no miscarriage occurred as the result of the reliance upon the respondent’s Schedule of Damages. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 (particular misdirection) 
       
      
    43    The following passage in the summing up is said to involve a misdirection: 
     
      
       
        
        All the other things really come under general damages and in relation to general damages, you may well come to the conclusion that the two big figures that you have to start thinking about are the diminution in her earning capacity as a result of these terms and also a round figure to compensate for loss of enjoyment and disfigurement. 
        
       
       
      
    44    This direction is said to have been likely to have contributed to double counting in the context of the Schedule of Damages and the trial judge's later suggestion: “I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you”. 
     
      
    45    The absence of complaint at trial is fatal to this ground of appeal. In my view, this is speculative. The passage does not strike me as carrying the risk of confusion or doubling up on damages that the appellant submits. It is to be read in the context of the summing up as a whole. The Schedule of Damages was quite clear as to what the respondent was seeking. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 (medical reports) 
       
      
    46    Certain medical reports went to the jury before they were tendered. The matter was drawn to the judge’s attention, the reports were then tendered and admitted without objection. The appellant’s concession that this ground would not justify appellate intervention was correctly made. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10 (particular misdirection) 
       
      
    47    This ground should be dismissed for the reasons given by Heydon JA. 
     
      
       
      Disposition 
       
      
    48    The parties invited the Court to reassess damages if error was found (cf Supreme Court Act, s107). Not surprisingly, the respondent invited us to keep our eyes on the separate items making up the jury’s verdict, only interfering with particular segments to the extent that error is found. Nevertheless, both parties recognised that our duty was to consider the total verdict as part of a reassessment if we felt able to do this. 
     
      
    49    Since there was no basis on the facts for departing from the conventional 15% discount for vicissitudes that component should be adjusted from 10% to 15%. I see no reason why the jury’s assessment on the remaining matters should not be accepted. 
     
      
    50    I propose that the appeal should be upheld in part by varying the verdict accordingly with the parties being directed to deliver Short Minutes to the Registrar within 7 days. 
     
      
    51    I also propose that the appellant should pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal. The appellant failed on most issues and the point on which the appellant achieved partial success was one on which the trial judge should have received greater assistance from the defendant at trial. 
     
      
    52    HANDLEY JA: I agree with Mason P. 
     
      
    53    HEYDON JA: I agree with Mason P in relation to Grounds 1-3, 6 and 7.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
      
    54    Ground 4 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in leaving to the jury the respondent’s claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct her own hairdressing business, there being no evidence at all of the earnings of self-employed hairdressers.” 
        
       
       
       
      Ground 4: The course of the trial 
       
      
    55    The Amended Notice of Appeal sought an order for a new trial, or, in the alternative, a reassessment of damages by the Court of Appeal. Either step would involve an exercise of discretion by the Court. It would be relevant to the exercise of that discretion to know what was said and what was not said to the trial judge and to the jury, and why. Apart from the two Schedules, the trial judge’s summary of argument in his summing up, a brief address by counsel for the defendant after the summing up, and the judge’s remarks in rejecting an application to discharge the jury, there are no materials before this Court indicating what was said to the trial judge and to the jury. The plaintiff’s Schedule conceded that there was no evidence of “precise figures” for the earnings of hairdressing businesses. The trial judge told the jury: “you do not really have the figures of what people earn in hairdressing salons”. If there was an available “no evidence” point to be taken at the trial by the defendant with a view to preventing jury consideration of the issue, it was quite explicitly flagged by both the plaintiff and the trial judge. And if as a matter of substantive reasoning there was a significant weakness which the jury should have taken into account in the plaintiff’s contention, both the plaintiff and the trial judge advised them of it, whatever the defendant did. 
     
      
    56    After the trial judge’s summing up to the jury concluded, counsel for the defendant made various complaints about the summing up. One related to future economic loss, and was put as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is my submission that your Honour has not put fairly the defendant’s argument in the way the defendant has run its case, that the jury has an option that it need not award the plaintiff damages for future economic loss because your Honour’s summing up to the jury was really that they must give her something and it was the matter of how that was to be calculated. Whether it was to be calculated by way of a precise mathematical calculation or a diminution, and to that extent your Honour it is my submission that your Honour has to that extent usurped the function of the jury and prejudiced the defendant’s case.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel was asked whether he wanted the jury discharged. He said he did not have those instructions, and continued: 
       
       
        
        “I would ask your Honour to at least tell the jury that it is entitled to consider the option put forward by the defendant, that is that it does not have to award the plaintiff for various reasons and in respect of damages for both past and future economic loss, whereas the jury, in my submission, was left with the distinct impression that they were going to have to make an award of damages under both heads. That does not follow on the evidence in my submission.” 
        
       
       
      The following day no redirection was sought. 
       
      
    57    In short, there was no specific complaint about a lack of evidence in relation to the component of damages for impairment of earning capacity so far as related to future economic loss of the type which is now advanced. Senior Counsel for the defendant (who did not appear at the trial) conceded that no submission that the claim should not have been put to the jury for want of evidence was made to the trial judge. 
     
      
    58    The defendant sought to characterise the conduct of its counsel at the trial in not seeking a direction or redirection conforming with Ground 4 as having been mistaken, and as being something which created an obstacle to its success on appeal. That is probably a mischaracterisation, because, as is suggested below, had counsel behaved as the defendant now suggests that he should have done, the direction which supposedly should have been sought would have been refused, rightly, by the trial judge. But if the defendant was right in criticising the conduct of its counsel, that conduct would call for some evidentiary explanation. The nature of the explanation would be relevant to the discretion which the defendant now asks this Court to exercise. No explanation appears from the appeal papers, and none was offered in affidavit form. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The course of the appeal 
      
    59    Ground 4 did not appear as one of the grounds in the Notice of Appeal filed on 18 March 1999. Apart from the question of the correct discount figure for vicissitudes (which is now Ground 5), the only grounds relating to damages for lost earning capacity were expressed in paragraph 3 of the Notice of Appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) his Honour gave undue emphasis to the respondent’s submissions on economic loss and failed to put the evidence, or for that matter the appellant’s submissions, that it was open for the jury to find that the respondent suffered no future economic loss and no past economic loss apart from a nine month period in 1989; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) his Honour confused the jury by directing them to assess loss of future economic loss [sic] on the balance of the [sic] probabilities and later by an evaluation of possibilities …”. 
        
       
       
      Sub-paragraph (c) is not a “no evidence” ground, and sub-paragraph (b) is not expressed as a no evidence ground but as a ground that invites recourse to the “evidence” which the trial judge allegedly “failed to put”. Neither of these grounds was taken in the Amended Notice of Appeal filed when the hearing of the appeal commenced.  
       
      
    60    Nothing corresponding with Ground 4 appears in the Pt 51 r 8 affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant. All it relevantly said was: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was no evidence called by the respondent from a hairdresser who owned his/her own business, nor were any earnings tendered. The claim is unsupported by evidence and should not have been awarded by the jury.” 
        
       
       
      That is an attack upon the validity of the jury’s reasoning processes, not on the conduct of the judge in leaving the matter to the jury.  
       
      
    61    Thus the defendant failed to take Ground 4 as a point in address to the jury before the summing up, after the summing up, in the Notice of Appeal, or in the Pt 51 r 8 affidavit. Each of these failures illustrates clearly the extent to which the defendant on appeal has departed from the manner in which it conducted the trial.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The structure of the argument 
      
    62    The structure of the argument in relation to Ground 4 so far as the defendant is concerned is curious. Had the plaintiff below not run a case based on a loss of an opportunity to own a hairdressing business, but rather aimed at the same ultimate figure for damages in relation to injury to earning capacity by reference to future economic loss through a contention that with her drive and ability the plaintiff would have earned $600 per week as an employee, the criticism that there was an absence of evidence could not have been put with any plausibility at all. The fact that the plaintiff’s case based on reduced capacity to earn was put as turning in part on the loss of an opportunity to run a hairdressing business was in a sense adventitious. What matters is how much the plaintiff’s capacity to earn was reduced. Loss of a chance to earn income as proprietor of a hairdressing business is only one way of viewing that reduction in capacity. Another way of viewing it is as the loss of a chance to earn income as an employee from hairdressing or from some other occupation. In Bullock v Miller (1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-128 at 68,990-68,991 Underwood J inferred from the family background and intellectual capacity of the plaintiff, who was five when rendered incapable of work, that he would have stayed at school until 17 or 18 and then become apprenticed in a trade which would have provided him with his livelihood either as an employee or as the proprietor of his own business. Underwood J took the average of awards in various distinct trades. He increased the capital sum derived from that average because “the family background, intelligence and personality of the plaintiff is such that it is highly probable he very quickly would have been earning in excess of the minimum prescribed by the award”. The jury were entitled to conclude that the present plaintiff could have earned more than the minimum wage, and indeed more than average weekly earnings. Her background, together with her intelligence, drive and personality, were established before the injury happened to her just before her fifteenth birthday, when she was much older than the plaintiff before Underwood J. Her circumstances were thus capable of supporting stronger conclusions than those reached by Underwood J. Yet the force of Underwood J’s reasoning does not depend on any distinction between a career as an employee or a career as a proprietor. Nor does it depend on the selection of any particular trade. The point is that the position of the plaintiff before Underwood J could be analysed by reference to any of those trades. While the position of the present plaintiff can be analysed by reference to hairdressing, the value of the lost chance to exploit her impaired capacity to earn does not depend on that analysis alone.  
     
      
    63    The characterisation of the issue in Ground 4 as relating to a “claim for damages for loss of opportunity to conduct [a] hairdressing business” follows the language of paragraph 3(b) of the plaintiff’s Schedule. This had the effect of drawing a false distinction between paragraph 3(b) and paragraph 3(a). In truth the assessment of damages for loss of earning capacity in relation to the future in every respect relates to the loss of an opportunity, or, as is now often said, the loss of a chance. The two parts of paragraph 3 wrongly suggest that one process of analysis is called for where the lost capacity is valued by reference to loss of wages, while another is called for where it is valued by reference to loss of profits. In each the process of analysis is the same: what is the monetary value of the lost chance to exploit the lost - or damaged or removed or amputated - capacity to earn income, by wages or otherwise, in future? The division of paragraph 3 into two parts was no doubt done merely to articulate one way of casting light on the value of the plaintiff’s lost capacity to earn.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The plaintiff’s entitlement to some damages for injury to earning capacity by reference to future economic loss 
       
      
    64    There is no doubt that the plaintiff was entitled to some damages corresponding to future economic loss in order to compensate her for her reduced capacity to earn. Leaving aside the fact that the defendant conceded on the appeal that there was no challenge to the $220,356 of the $330,356 which the parties identified as referable to future economic loss, there are two reasons for the plaintiff’s entitlement. First, the plaintiff had suffered some past economic loss. Since a reduced capacity to earn is reflected both before the trial and after it, evidence of past economic loss is some, though not conclusive, evidence of reduced earning capacity. It is not conclusive, because, for example, a banking executive might lose income by reason of a painful injury to the little finger of his left hand but, after returning to work, be capable of continuing to work without any impairment in earning capacity. Where there is impairment in earning capacity it will usually be reflected in financial loss before the trial. The second reason why the plaintiff was entitled to some damages in relation to reduced capacity to earn was that there was ample evidence of the effect of her injuries on her appearance, self-confidence and mental state, and in causing the need for absences from work over the years for medical purposes. These factors plainly point to a reduced earning capacity.  
     
      
    65    The case, then, is not one of which it can be said that there was no evidence of any impairment of capacity to earn. Since there was some evidence of impaired earning capacity, it would have been wrong, on the authorities, for the trier of fact to conclude that damages to compensate for it should only be nil or nominal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Some authorities 
      
    66    There are two uncontroversial themes running through the cases relating to the assessment of damages for injury to earning capacity. One is that in general it is desirable for precise evidence to be called as to what the plaintiff would have been likely to earn but for the injury and what the plaintiff is likely to earn after it. The second is that the failure to call such evidence does not necessarily result in selection of only a nil or nominal figure as damages for impaired earning capacity. 
     
      
    67    Thus, in relation to the first of these themes, in Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 559 Fullagar J said that the “usual method of proving damages under [this] head is by calling evidence to show what the plaintiff could probably have earned during the rest of his life if he had not been injured and what, if anything, he is now capable of earning”. The same is true where the defendant is seeking to demonstrate that the diminution of earning capacity is only partial. Barwick CJ in Arthur Robinson (Grafton) Pty Ltd v Carter (1968) 122 CLR 649 at 657 said of a plaintiff who had been rendered almost a quadriplegic:  
     
      
       
        
        “He has lost his earning capacity, so far as the evidence goes, all earning capacity. In this connexion, however, too little attention it seems to me is paid to the possibilities which have and will yet open up for paraplegics and quadriplegics: but this ought to be the subject of the evidence and not of mere suggestion on the part of judge or advocate.” 
        
       
      
    68    The first theme was stated with the qualification “in general”, because there is authority that in some circumstances over-elaborate evidence is unhelpful. In J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 734-5 Moffitt P said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sometimes, particularly in a jury trial, evidence of some claimed prospective earnings but for injury may distract rather than aid quantification of loss. A jury may well make a better assessment of the loss of a young law student debarred by injury from becoming a barrister by evidence such as in

        ’ case [(1975) 49 ALJR 349] uncluttered by evidence of earnings made by selected leading senior counsel, with or without the aid of statistics as to success and failure rates of students and barristers, where such evidence is led in supposed aid of quantifying the lost opportunity of becoming leading counsel in the foggy future.” 
        
       
       
      This approach may rest on a general recognition that “the task of assessing damages in personal injuries cases should be kept as simple as possible”:  
      Jongen v CSR Ltd 
       (1992) Aust Torts Reports 81-192 at 61,713 per Anderson J.  
       
      
    69    The second theme in the authorities was summed up by Reynolds JA in Yammine v Kalwy [1979] 2 NSWLR 151 at 155 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “in seeking to quantify his damages, a plaintiff could be well advised to offer [evidence of wage levels] in many cases; and likewise a defendant, in seeking to cut down the damage, might similarly be well advised to tender such evidence; neither, in the absence of such evidence, could complain, to the same effect, at any quantification arrived at. This, however, is far from asserting that in the absence of such evidence only nominal damages is appropriate. …[W]here a plaintiff has suffered a significantly disabling injury which obviously affects the range and nature of the work he can, therefore, perform, a tribunal of fact can, without specific evidence as to what other persons with that kind of disability can earn, make a judgment and assessment, on a percentage basis or otherwise, of the value of the lost capacity.” 
        
       
       
      Where the plaintiff calls incomplete evidence and there is only a low award for diminution of earning capacity, it is difficult for the plaintiff to complain:  
      Minchin v Public Curator of Queensland 
       [1965] ALR 91 at 93;  
      Giorginis v Kastrati  
      (1998) 49 SASR 371 at 375. But it does not follow that a substantial award in a case where the evidence is incomplete cannot survive appellate attack by the defendant:  
      Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death, 
       3rd ed, para [1.9.28] 
      .  
      This is so for several reasons.  
       
      
    70    First, damages to compensate for that part of reduced economic capacity which will be reflected in the future are sometimes analysed as being one type of “general damages”. Like other types of “general damages”, as Fullagar J said in Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 559, they are “of their very nature, incapable of mathematical calculation and (although the expression is apt to be misleading) commonly very much ‘at large’. They are also at large in the sense that a jury has, in serious cases, a wide discretion in assessing them.” In Russell v J Hargreaves & Sons Pty Ltd (1956) 30 ALJ 533 at 534 Taylor J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since … it is impossible to prescribe fixed or precise standards for the translation into terms of money of physical injuries and pain and suffering and varying degrees of physical incapacity, it is inevitable that individual opinions as to what amount may be said to constitute full compensation in any particular case will vary. Indeed within the bounds of reasonableness they may vary greatly.” 
        
       
       
      The field is an “uncertain” one:  
      Breska v Lysaghts Works Pty Ltd 
       (1956) 74 WN (NSW) 168 at 169 per Street CJ.  
       
      
    71    Secondly, strictly the issue does not turn on a comparison between what money the plaintiff would have earned apart from the injury and what money the plaintiff will earn after the injury. The compensable loss is not a loss of income but the loss of capacity to earn income in a manner productive of financial loss: Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340 at 347. The income earned before the injury is relevant, but only as an evidentiary aid in assessing damages for the loss of capacity to earn income: Paff v Speed (1961) 105 CLR 549 at 566 per Windeyer J. Evaluation of the worth of a loss of capacity to earn - of a lost chance to earn - is of its nature a more imprecise inquiry than calculation of a lost income. It rests on the hypothesis - that the plaintiff will have undiminished capacity - which has been rendered false by events. It does not depend on calculating the income from a particular career which is no longer possible, but in calculating the damage to a capacity to carry on various careers. It is an exercise in estimation of possibilities, not proof of probabilities. Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death, 3rd ed, para [1.9.18], said: 
     
      
       
        
        “it is not necessary for the plaintiff to establish the future loss with the same degree of precision as the present and past loss … The court is really being asked to estimate as best it can the future effect of the injuries from which the plaintiff has been proved to be suffering as a result of the defendant’s wrongful act.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd 
       (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 639 Brennan and Dawson JJ said: “the ascertainment of earning capacity involves an evaluation of possibilities, not establishing a fact as a matter of history.” They approved Lord Diplock’s statement in  
      Mallett v McMonagle 
       [1970] AC 166 at 176: “in assessing damages which depend upon its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing would or could have happened and reflect those chances, whether or not they are more or less than even, in the amount of damages …”. The majority (Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) in  
      Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd 
       said at 643 that when the law takes account of future or hypothetical events in assessing damages, it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring in a range from just above the speculative to just below the certain. The inquiry - the process of estimation of possibilities - is thus an imprecise and indeterminate one to be carried out within very broad parameters. The trier of fact may have to form conclusions on “slender materials”:  
      Callaghan v Wm C Lynch Pty Ltd 
       [1962] NSWR 871 at 877 per Evatt CJ, Herron and Sugerman JJ. That language, unlike the reference to permitting “guess work or speculation” elsewhere in that judgment, was not criticised in  
      Ivkovic v Australian Iron & Steel Ltd 
       [1963] SR (NSW) 598 at 607 per Manning J. However, Menzies J said that sometimes the assessment of damages involves “guess work rather than estimation”:  
      Jones v Schiffman 
       (1971) 124 CLR 303 at 308; see also  
      Linsell v Robson 
       [1976] 1 NSWLR 249 at 259 per Mahoney JA;  
      Chaplin v Hicks 
       [1911] 2 KB 786 at 792 per Vaughan Williams LJ. Lord Diplock described the factors underlying the assessment of damages for diminished earning capacity as “matters of prophecy or judicial guesses” in  
      Paul v Rendell 
       (1981) 34 ALR 569 at 578. The English position was summarised thus by Lloyd LJ in  
      Foster v Tyne and Wear County Council 
       [1986] 1 All ER 567 at 570: 
       
       
        
        “when it comes to estimating loss of earning capacity, there is no such thing as a conventional approach; there is no rule of thumb which can be applied. It would be so much easier if there were. But there is not. In each case the trial judge has to do his best to assess the plaintiff’s handicap, as an existing disability, by reference to what may happen in the future. As has been said so often, that is necessarily a matter of speculation; it is necessarily a matter of weighing up risks and chances in all the circumstances of a particular case. The very fact that the approach must necessarily be so speculative means, of course, that the occasions on which this court will feel justified in interfering with a judge’s assessment will be few and far between, for there is no established range or standard against which to measure the judge’s award.”  
         
        
       
      
    72    Thirdly, the mere fact that the quantum of damages is difficult to assess does not mean that the plaintiff is only entitled to a nominal sum. This principle applies as much to the assessment of damages for impaired earning capacity in injured plaintiffs as it does to pecuniary loss caused by negligent advice (Bowen v Blair [1933] VLR 398) or to loss in the form of the diminished value of damaged property (Wheeler v Riverside Coal Transport Co Pty Ltd [1964] Qd R 113), or equitable damages (Talbot v General Television Corporation Pty Ltd [1980] VR 224 at 250-1), or damages for breach of contract (Fink v Fink (1946) 74 CLR 127 at 143). In the last case, Dixon and McTiernan JJ put the following general proposition: “Where there has been an actual loss of some sort, the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money to defeat the only remedy it provided for breach of contract, an award of damages.” This was followed in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL (1994) 185 CLR 332 at 349 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The same is true in tort. In Naylor v Yorkshire Electricity Board [1968] AC 529 at 548 Lord Devlin said: “in the law of damages … difficulty in calculation is not ordinarily taken as a ground either for reducing or for increasing the award”. The court will be more ready to shoulder the burden of acting without specific evidence where that evidence is difficult to call. In Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 at 438, a sale of goods case involving a recovery in respect of damaged goods, Devlin J said: “It is only that where precise evidence is obtainable the Court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not the Court must do the best it can”. As McPherson J said in Nilon v Bezzina [1988] 2 Qd R 420 at 424: “The degree of precision with which damages are to be proved is proportionate to the proof reasonably available”. The courts on occasion cite in related contexts Bowen LJ’s related but stricter observation in Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 532-3, an injurious falsehood case: 
     
      
       
        
        “In all actions … on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on … in … proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done.” 
        
       
      
    73    The application of these principles is illustrated in a category of cases where the injury to a plaintiff who had the chance of a relatively high income if an appropriate tertiary training had been undertaken has prevented that training. In this category in particular the courts have not declined to make substantial awards to compensate for impaired economic capacity measured by valuing the lost chance to earn high income even though there was no evidence of the possible ranges of income. 
     
      
    74    In Ashford v Ashford (1970) 44 ALJR 195 at 196, a case where there was no evidence of particular income levels which would have been attained but for the injury and which could be attained after it, but where it was clear that there had been a diminution in earning capacity, Barwick CJ said for reasons including “the difficulty in determining what was the actual diminution of the appellant’s earning capacity, the margins within which a trial judge might properly exercise his discretion in arriving at a verdict in this case were necessarily fairly wide.” The High Court restored a verdict of the trial judge of $90,000 general damages, which evidently included $25,000 for impaired earning capacity. 
     
      
    75    In Graham v Fogarty (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 452 the plaintiff suffered serious brain damage at the age of 16. She was awarded $20,000 general damages. The report refers to no specific evidence of what her earnings would have been but for the injury and what they would have been after it. The Court of Appeal said at 453-4: 
     
      
       
        
        “If by reason of her injuries the appellant does not marry, then the economic significance of her seriously diminished capacity to work in a gainful occupation, on which she would have to depend, will be considerable. If, by reason of an unsatisfactory marriage, she has to resort to employment to support herself, again it will be significant.” 
        
       
       
      The Court of Appeal increased the general damages component to $30,000. It did so notwithstanding the want of specific evidence on earning prospects.  
       
      
    76    In National Instruments Pty Ltd v Gilles (1975) 49 ALJR 349 at 350 the High Court declined to interfere with a trial judge’s assessment of general damages (including damages for loss of earning capacity) in relation to injuries suffered by a law student. Barwick CJ said that the plaintiff’s disabilities affected the possibilities open to him for employment and promotion, and the extent of his success in private practice: 
     
      
       
        
        “No evidence was necessary, in my opinion, to enable the trial judge to place a figure upon the reasonable compensation to be awarded for this deprivation. It would not be necessary to have specific evidence as to the earnings of a solicitor conducting his own practice or of a solicitor in any or all of the employments to which I have referred. That a solicitor being in private practice or in employment is able to earn a considerable income is part of that knowledge which a juryman can be expected to have and to employ in arriving at a verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge was, in my opinion, quite at liberty to decide that there would be a considerable drop in the income which the respondent might derive from being a solicitor, whether employed or in private practice. He was entitled, in my opinion, to decide that the respondent would suffer a considerable loss in relation to income at a considerable level, whatever its particular amount might be. For this purpose, he had no need, in my opinion, to know or to have evidence of the specific earnings of a solicitor in private practice, or for that matter as to the precise level of those earnings.” 
        
       
       
      
    77    Thus the trier of fact is not constrained by narrow limitations even though it is not entitled, without evidence, to assume a specific figure for what could have been earned without the injury. Thus in Hayman v Forbes (1975) 13 SASR 225 the trial judge assumed that the plaintiff would lose “the difference between the income of a professional man and a man in a modest employment - probably, on average, not less than $20,000 gross per annum over his working life of 40 years or so.” Making various allowances for contingencies, he assessed $100,000 as damages in relation to future economic loss for a school boy who had wanted to become a veterinary scientist but after the injury could only work in a clerical capacity. The Full Court held that there was no evidence to support the $20,000 differential and it was not a matter of which judicial notice could be taken. They held that the course adopted by the trial judge was erroneous and substituted for the figure of $100,000 the figure of $75,000. For that figure they gave no reasons. Zelling J merely said at 236: 
     
      
       
        
        “the Court should do the best it can with the materials before it to assess the damages. In my opinion $75,000 is the greatest sum which could properly be regarded as appropriate in this case for damages for economic loss.” 
        
       
       
      The point is that despite the want of specific evidence, the Full Court awarded very substantial damages. The case is similar to  
      Kettley v Roulstone 
       (1961) 34 ALJR 495, where the High Court ordered a new trial because of a very high award of general damages. The award could only have been supported if evidence that the plaintiff would have earned £2,000 per annum as a carpenter in partnership with his brother could have been regarded as sufficient to justify a calculation of that degree of precision. But the High Court did not dispute that some sum for loss of earning capacity was recoverable, despite the “sketchy” nature of the evidence.  
       
      
    78    In Wade v Allsopp (1976) 10 ALR 363 the plaintiff suffered a brain injury at the age of 17. Before the injury he had been likely to matriculate into a science or economics faculty at a university. He gave evidence that he desired to study science or economics. He had a “strong and positive personality”, and a “rugged constitution combined with ambition”. Stephen J (Gibbs, Jacobs and Murphy JJ concurring) said at 359: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was considerations of this nature that called for evaluation so that the plaintiff might be compensated for the loss of the chance of attaining the relatively high economic status which might have been open to him but for his injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        The learned trial judge did not, I think, value, and reflect in his award of damages, this lost chance of attaining the financial rewards which might follow the completion of tertiary education …”. 
        
       
       
      The High Court held that the trial judge had erred in treating the plaintiff as having been likely to follow the path of his elder brother and an acquaintance through their Higher School Certificate examinations into the office of clerk in the Commonwealth public service. The High Court held that since the plaintiff was better equipped intellectually than the other two young men, there was no evidentiary basis for equating his pre-accident earning capacity with their capacity. Stephen J said at 359-360: 
       
       
        
         “To treat the plaintiff as if, despite all evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion, he would not have undertaken tertiary education and reaped the subsequent financial benefit of it is not, I think, properly to evaluate the chance of substantial earning capacity lost through the accident. No doubt there was a possibility that the plaintiff might have faired worse in life than had his brother but, while acknowledging the need to give way to this possibility, the task of assessment cannot be satisfied by what must appear to be a quite arbitrary selection of the brother’s earning capacity at the date of the trial as a measure of what would have been, but for the accident, the plaintiff’s likely earning capacity.” 
        
       
       
      The point is that no specific evidence was called as to what the income levels of university graduates in science or economics were, and no complaint was made of this by any of the justices. The result was that the Court of Appeal’s increase in the trial judge’s award of $73,978.88 (which was made up of $45,000 for impaired earning capacity, $20,000 for general damages and $8,978.88 for special damages) to $100,000 was upheld, in part because of the error as to impaired capacity and in part because of the disproportion of the low figure for general damages.  
       
      
    79    There is a related category of case where a person with a particular skill is compensated for a loss of the opportunity to develop it in a way which would have brought improved financial outcomes notwithstanding the absence of evidence as to what persons successfully exploiting those skills earn.  
     
      
    80    In Hall v Wheeler [1962] QWN 40 the court valued a chance lost by a plaintiff whose pre-accident capacity to work in his occupation as butcher was unimpaired but who was a skilful ballroom dancer. The lost chance was the chance to win ballroom championships and thereafter establish a part-time career as a dancing teacher. There was apparently no evidence of the earnings of part-time ballroom dancing teachers.  
     
      
    81    In Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 188-9 the Full Court upheld a verdict which included £1,000 for the loss of a chance that the plaintiff, a bricklayer by occupation but with a background of success as an amateur cyclist, would have been able to develop a career as a professional. It did so despite the rejection of inadmissible evidence, and the absence of admissible evidence, showing what the rewards of professional cyclists were. 
     
      
    82    A similar case was Mulvaine v Joseph (1968) 112 Sol Jo 927, where an American professional golfer injured in Europe was awarded £1,000. It was awarded for loss of opportunity to compete in tournaments, and hence a loss of experience and prestige which might have resulted in him becoming a tournament professional in America, and also for the loss of a chance of winning prize money. Thompson J said that that “figure was bound to be speculative”. There was apparently no evidence of what the earnings of a tournament professional might be, and what the prize monies might be.  
     
      
    83    Another category exists where the plaintiff, who has been carrying on a particular business, has been prevented from exploiting the opportunity of expanding it. In Szittner v Harriott [1967] 1 NSWR 233 at 237, an injury to one partner in a business caused one of the shops through which it was conducted to be sold and a planned expansion of the number of shops to be halted. The Court of Appeal, speaking through Jacobs JA, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The jury] were considering loss of future earning capacity and it does not seem to us that it is appropriate to look for precise evidence of how much profits would be lost or whether the business would make profits, or not. It would be proper for a jury to take account of the fact, or the chance, that the business would not make profits; that they might make profits for a while and then economic conditions might change. This would be all part of the chances which a jury has to take into account in estimating what is the value of the chances which have been lost. When it comes to a case of a business in this way, it is very much a question for the jury.  
        
       
       
        
        We have been referred to passages and authorities which would seem to suggest that a jury has to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that future events would occur, that a business would expand, that profits would be made. We do not think that this is a correct approach when dealing with losses of chances … [In] our view the test is that the plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for a loss of the chance and the extent of the compensation depends on the degree of the chance.” 
        
       
       
      
    84    An illustration of the court’s readiness to award damages for diminution of earning capacity arises when very young children are injured. Strictly speaking it would be impossible to prove that the child would have had an earning capacity as an adult or would have exploited it. But it is conventional to rely on the occupations, attitude to life and work histories of parents and other relatives: Kalo v Bristol Omnibus Co Ltd [1975] 1 WLR 1054; Gowling v Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co Ltd (1980) 24 SASR 321; Bullock v Miller (1987) Aust Torts Reports 80-128; Burford v Allan (1992) 60 SASR 428. See also the position in England described in McGregor on Damages, 16th ed., paras 1381-1382.  
     
      
    85    Further, the willingness of the courts to compensate plaintiffs for reduced earning capacity in the absence of specific evidence is highlighted by their willingness to compensate even where there was an increase in the post-injury but pre-trial earnings of the plaintiff which was prima facie contra-indicative of loss. In Russell v J Hargreaves & Sons Pty Ltd (1956) 30 ALJ 533 at 534 Dixon CJ and McTiernan J increased the trial judge’s award and said of the plaintiff in this position: 
     
      
       
        
        “His efficiency as a driver and his capacity to drive for any lengthy period have obviously been greatly impaired and even if an exact sum of special damages has not been proved the existence of this head of damage has been shown as a substantial element and ought to have been taken into account in assessing general damages.” 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    86    It is true that in some cases the courts have supplemented exiguous evidence by resort to judicial notice. The courts have inferred that rates in private employment are not lower than in public employment. Thus in Dessent v Commonwealth of Australia (1977) 13 ALR 437 Mason and Aickin JJ were prepared to assume that the earnings of a carpenter in civilian life would be not less than those of the plaintiff carpenter while in the Royal Australian Air Force, ie $100 per week net, and said: “it would be reasonable to assess the appellant’s loss of earning capacity at not less than 25 percent of his full capacity, that is $25 per week …”. In Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 187 Stable J thought it “notorious that an unskilled man does not overall get the same economic rewards as a skilled man. Were it otherwise, then why bother acquiring a skill at all?” He upheld a verdict of which one ingredient was $500 for loss resulting from incapacity to work as a bricklayer despite the lack of evidence of the difference in earnings. But in many instances substantial damages have been assessed for impaired earning capacity despite an absence of evidence about earnings and an inability to take judicial notice of them.  
     
      
    87    In short, where earning capacity has unquestionably been reduced but its extent is difficult to assess, even though no precise evidence of relevant earning rates is tendered, it is not open to the court to abandon the task and the want of evidence does not necessarily result in non-recovery of damages. Statements to the contrary such as those made in Allen v Loadsman [1975] 2 NSWLR 787 at 792 are not correct: Baird v Roberts [1977] 2 NSWLR 389 at 397-8 per Mahoney JA; J K Keally v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 732-735 per Moffitt P; Yammine v Kalwy [1979] 2 NSWLR 151 at 154-5 and 156-7 per Reynolds JA and Mahoney JA; Thiess Properties Pty Ltd v Page (1980) 31 ALR 430; see also Radakovic v R G Cram & Sons Pty Ltd [1975] 2 NSWLR 751 at 761 where Samuels JA criticised the “meagre facts” provided but did not say it was not open to the jury to find a substantial sum for diminished earning capacity by the “application of their own knowledge and experience”. The task of the trier of fact is to form a discretionary judgment by reference to not wholly determinate criteria within fairly wide parameters. Though the trier of fact in arriving at the discretionary judgment must achieve satisfaction that a fair award is being made, since what is involved is not the finding of historical facts on a balance of probabilities, but the assessment of the value of a chance, it is appropriate to take into account a range of possible outcomes even though the likelihood of any particular outcome being achieved may be no more than a real possibility. The trial judge in substance explained these aspects of the jury’s task satisfactorily.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 : The summing up 
      
    88    The trial judge correctly reminded the jury of the difficulties of their task. He spoke of the assessment of “what would have been her earning capacity during life but for the accident” as “a very vague exercise”. He said the jury had to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the sum claimed by the plaintiff was a fair and reasonable sum. He also said that if the jury found it not possible in relation to future earning capacity to arrive at “a sensible and fair and good decision simply on a mere balance of probabilities”, it was permissible “to look at the odds, look at the proportion, look at the possibilities”. He warned that though what he was saying might sound “a bit woolly”, “the whole task is rather woolly”. On the other hand, he warned that speculation was to be avoided. He said that the jury, like judges sitting alone, had to do their best and could not refuse to reach a conclusion. He also reminded them that the assessment of future economic loss involved a double exercise in prophesy: prophesying not only what the future held for the plaintiff, but also what it would have held for her had she not been injured. He stressed that the inquiry was into lost “capacity to earn”.  
     
      
    89    The judge made the following more specific remarks about the earning capacity which the particular plaintiff had lost. He said that because she had been injured before her full-time working life had started, “prophesying what the future would hold for her if she had not been injured and what would have been her earning capacity is very difficult”. He said: “Everybody says this is a lady who has got bags of guts, and who has gone back to work as quick as she could”. She came from a very hard working family. Before the accident she had a part-time job in Year 10. She was keen to be a hairdresser and “would have liked to have built it up and had her own business”. He said that the jury might think she was “obviously going to go all out to make a good result of her life”. He said: “so it may well be that you would have little doubt coming to the conclusion that more likely than not, if she did not have the accident, she would have done her apprenticeship and gone on to run a business”. He said: “you may well, having seen her and heard her, be left in no doubt that she was a lady who would have made the most of her earning capacity for the rest of her life, as you would expect, using your commonsense knowledge, of the girl’s upbringing”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately, and I am not being critical of this, because you never get a case of perfection, you do not really have the figures of what people earn in hairdressing salons, but you have got the agreed figure that the average weekly earnings nett for a lady these days is $500 a week and it is on that basis that counsel for the plaintiff, who has given you the figures of what she has been earning since 1990 and up to date, said ‘well compare that with what she would have earned had she been a hairdresser and take the example of the average female’. 
        
       
       
        
        That is the area where the commonsense and experience of a juror, and particularly four jurors, is terribly important, because you have the benefit of this written submission, the aide prepared by counsel for the plaintiff, as to what it is hoped the plaintiff will recover. You have also got the benefit of the final address from counsel for the defendant who picks on parts of it and says ‘dear dear dear no, it is not that much for these reasons’. 
        
       
       
        
        So in respect of loss of earning capacity, you have got to use your commonsense and that is the reason why I always enjoy having juries.” 
        
       
      
    90    He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you reach the situation where you find it is not really possible say in relation to her future earning capacity on the evidence you have got to make a sensible and fair and good decision simply on a mere balance of probabilities, it is permissible to start looking at the odds and say: ‘Well, on one view of it but for the accident we have no doubt she would have gone on to be a hairdresser and run a good business and probably would have earned a darn sight more than $500. 
        
       
       
        
        In another case with another plaintiff, you might say the plaintiff had Buckley’s chance of doing what she might have even had a genuine desire to do. You may come back in a case like this to looking at future economic loss if applying just a mere balance of probabilities does not seem real to you, to look at the odds, look at the proportion, look at the possibilities and reflect that in the final sum you arrive at for loss of earning capacity in the future.” 
        
       
      
    91    None of what the trial judge said in the respects described above would appear to have been erroneous either in fact or in law.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 considered 
      
    92    It was open to the jury to “recognise that those who assume the risks of private enterprise are apt to exact higher rewards” (quoting Glass JA in Gilles v National Instruments Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, unreported, 24 September 1974). It was open to them to conclude that those who undergo apprenticeships and training are apt to exact higher rewards, as Stable J suggested in Leis v Gardner [1965] Qd R 181 at 187. A jury could also infer that some hairdressing businesses earn for their proprietors much more than $500 per week, even if many may earn little more than that, and some may earn less than that. That there are expensive establishments which have been in existence for substantial periods is a matter of daily observation: those establishments run high risks through high rents, and must achieve high returns. The question is not what the average or mean earnings of hairdresser business proprietors are. The question is what fair compensation would be for a person whose character, appearance, experience and family background combine to make it extremely likely that she would have succeeded in running a hairdressing business and would have gone “all out to make a good result of her life” in the financial sense as well as in other senses. While many hairdressing businesses might not be particularly lucrative, the odds were good that a person with the plaintiff’s characteristics would have enjoyed success to the extent of at least $100 per week more than average weekly earnings. Even after the physical and mental scarring of the accident, the plaintiff retained much drive - ceasing work only just before the birth of her children, returning soon after, achieving good examination results despite not attending school, entering the work force, and participating, on and off the field, in sporting activities to the extent to which her injuries permitted.  
     
      
    93    So far as the defendant appears to characterise Ground 4 as a “no evidence” point it appears to be misconceived. While there was no evidence of the earnings of hairdressing business proprietors, there was evidence of average weekly earnings, which, the court was told, includes those earnings. The jury could conclude as a matter of common experience that there was a likelihood that some proprietors of hairdressing businesses would earn more than average weekly earnings. The task on which the jury was engaged was of its nature “foggy”, to use the expression of Moffitt P in J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 735, and “woolly”, to use the expression employed by the trial judge in his summing up. The task was to value a lost chance. It is relatively easy to value a chance where a plaintiff has been employed in an occupation at a particular rate of income and after the injury cannot continue in that occupation but can in a lower paid one. In those circumstances the courts commonly look for a measure of particularity both in the pre-injury income and in any increase in it which the plaintiff contends would have been likely but for the injury and in the post-injury income: Stauffer v Hanley (NSW Court of Appeal, 6 April 1978, unreported). Even there the courts may act on evidence which is less than satisfactory. Thus in Chelini v Northern Territory Port Authority (1976) 12 ALR 519 the High Court increased a verdict one element of which was $30,000 for general damages by a further $20,000. Though the case was “riddled with unpredictables” and the “material … as to economic loss was minimal”, being limited to wages which the defendant paid the plaintiff before the accident and would have paid the plaintiff after the accident if employed in another role, the High Court increased the verdict despite the “paucity of the material as to economic loss”. It is much harder to value a chance where, as here, the plaintiff was a school child and the source of income lost is a professional business, not income from labour which is governed by awards or capable of establishment by reference to market rates. But since the obligation to value it cannot be shirked, deficiencies in the materials advanced may be tolerated. In this appeal the defendant contended that the absence of evidence about the earnings of hairdressing business proprietors was significant, because it would have been easy to call such evidence. That may be questioned. Though there may be persons who commonly value such businesses, or officers of hairdressing trade associations, and though it may be that persons in either class could assemble the evidence of what the proprietors of hairdressing businesses earn, it has not in fact been demonstrated that any people in these categories exist, or that it would be easy or feasible to prepare appropriate evidence. Nor has it been demonstrated that that evidence would not have thrown up a similar pattern of complexity to that alluded to by Moffitt P in J K Kealley v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 723 at 734-5 so far as barristers are concerned, namely so great a variety of non-standard instances that it would be difficult for the jury to handle.  
     
      
    94    The defendant presented its argument on Ground 4 as facing an obstacle created by Pt 51 r 23 of the Supreme Court Rules, and as resting on a failure by its own counsel at the trial to seek an appropriate direction or re-direction. This misstates the problem. The only direction or re-direction which would have corresponded with Ground 4 would have been that entailed in a request by the defendant to the trial judge to forbid the plaintiff to address along the lines of paragraph 3(b) of the plaintiff’s Schedule. If that request had been made, it would not have been right to accede to it, because while the absence of evidence about the earnings of self-employed hairdressers may have weakened the plaintiff’s contention, it did not of itself preclude acceptance of the plaintiff’s contention. The only appropriate request would have been a request that the jury be warned about the danger of taking the precise figure of $100 per week without exercising caution. In substance the jury was given that warning. The defendant did not ask the trial judge to forbid the plaintiff to address along the lines of paragraph 3(b). The defendant cannot now place itself in a better position as a result of not having made that request than it would have been in if it had made that request.  
     
      
    95    If, on the other hand, the defendant’s characterisation on appeal of its counsel’s conduct at trial is correct, Ground 4 faces a different difficulty. Below the defendant contended for nil recovery in relation to future economic loss, but it apparently did not contend that there was no evidence in relation to that component of it which was represented by $100 per week more than average weekly earnings, and it did not ask for a direction in that respect. There was no evidence as to why it did not. The position is similar to that put by Hutley JA in Linsell v Robson [1976] 1 NSWLR 249 at 252: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the trial was conducted on the basis that there was sufficient material to enable the judge to give a substantial sum for diminution of earning capacity, in my opinion it is not appropriate for any issue of this nature to be raised in this Court in this case. …” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    96    In my judgment Ground 4 is not made out.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
      
    97    The defendant’s submission to this Court was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here  
        no 
         basis in the respondent’s particular circumstances was posited for departure from the usual deduction, particularly not downwards. 
        
       
       
        
        The respondent is married with two young children. She was employed at the date of trial in her father’s business doing part-time clerical work without set [hours] … This at least suggests that her working life would involve some interruption for child minding as is the modern norm. An upwards variation of the 15%  
        might 
         have been permissible, but certainly not any downwards one.” 
        
       
      
    98    The position of the defendant was thus that it was not seeking a discount higher than 15% (though one might have been permissible); it was contending only that a discount of 10% was wrong. At the hearing the position of the defendant was more qualified. It conceded that “the jury may have been entitled, on a proper direction, to return ten percent.”  
     
      
    99    I agree with Mason P that the trial judge’s summing up in relation to discounting for vicissitudes was too brief to make clear to the jury what matters had to be weighed.  
     
      
    100    To order a retrial on this ground would be a wrong course. The costs in time, money and otherwise would not produce any benefit in view of the relatively limited amount of money involved. In my judgment the jury, properly directed, would probably have selected the 10% figure. This Court, in arriving at the decision for itself, should adopt that figure. While 15% is the starting point, and, indeed, as the figure used in most cases, usually the finishing point as well, it can be departed from in an appropriate case. The drive, energy and determination of the plaintiff and her family are such that she is much likelier than most plaintiffs to overcome the vicissitudes of life and exploit what remained of her earning capacity to an extent reflected better by a 10% discount rate than a 15% discount rate. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8 
      
    101    The defendant contended that the trial judge ought not to have allowed the parties to give to the jury the Schedules they did. The plaintiff accepted that it would have been wrong for the trial judge to have allowed a schedule to go to the jury without consent, but that the course adopted was permissible with consent, and that there was a practice “that by consent both parties put their submissions to the jury”.  
     
      
    102    Both Schedules were useful in marking out the boundaries of each side’s contentions, which depended in some degree on specific quantities, periods, rates, service charges and multipliers. It would have been virtually impossible for the jurors to have retained these details in their heads, and not particularly easy for the jurors to have noted them down coherently. The plaintiff’s Schedule, unlike the defendant’s, had in addition a persuasive function. The plaintiff’s word “submissions” applied much more to her Schedule than to the defendant’s Schedule. In some cases particular difficulties may arise where a jury both hears oral submissions and reads written submissions, but no particular difficulty was suggested here.  
     
      
    103    The utility and innocuousness of the Schedules in this case point strongly against any error in what the trial Judge did. The question of what should be done where one side objects or where the documents are misleading may be left for a case that raises them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9 
       
      The circumstances relating to Ground 9 are set out by Mason P. Though in my understanding Ground 9 was pressed to the end of the argument, the defendant conceded that by itself this ground would not justify appellate intervention, while submitting that it was part of the totality of circumstances suggesting that the trial had miscarried. I agree with the concession and disagree with the submission.  
       
       
      Ground 10 
      
    104    By “Ground 10” is meant a sentence appearing after Ground 9 which is not numbered but is to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in directing the jury ‘I suggest that you do not worry about trying to calculate these things, but accept the figures given to you’.” 
        
       
      
    105    No oral argument was advanced in support of this ground, though the passage complained of was relied on in support of Grounds 1-3. The written argument was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “By suggesting to the jury that they ought to accept the figures given to them …, his Honour usurped the function of the jury, and also became an additional advocate for the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    106    Read literally and by themselves, the words complained of are open to criticism. But read in context, it is clear that the trial judge was making it plain that the figures referred to were the totals reflecting a particular weekly wage loss: “What you have to take into account in your verdict is the present lump sum value of so much a week.” He was not directing the jury that it must accept the wage loss totals submitted by the plaintiff. He was leaving it open to the jury to choose what particular weekly wage loss they thought appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
        
      
    107    I would dismiss the appeal. I would order the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal.

     Regina v Anthony Stuart MOFFATT 
      
    The appellant was convicted of the offence of murder, following trial by judge alone. Both he and the deceased had consumed significant quantities of alcohol before becoming engaged in an argument in the course of which the appellant struck the deceased with a hammer and strangled him. The deceased was in poor health due to advanced cardiac disease and alcoholism. The issue in the trial was whether the death was attributable to the appellant, or to cardiac failure or acute alcohol toxicity independent of any act of the appellant.The appellant appealed against the conviction on the grounds that; (1) the oral admissions alleged to have been made by him and admissions contained in his ERISP should not have been admitted into evidence; (2) the evidence did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased was caused by an act of the appellant.HELD (dismissing the appeal):Ground 1: admissions If evidence is led which suggests that the truth of an admission may be adversely affected, then the Crown must prove on the balance of probabilities that it is unlikely that this was the case. The evidence of the admissions had significant probative value and there was no unfairness to the appellant. Although the judge did not specifically refer to s85 and 90 of the Evidence Act, the argument as to admissibility having been pursued under SS 135 and 137 of the Act, his findings addressed the issues arising under those sections as well.. Having regard to the expert evidence, the judge was correct in receiving the evidence. The appellant’s observations of the deceased were not unreliable because he lacked medical expertise, since they were of the kind a lay person could make. Nor were they unreliable because of the effects of the alcohol he had consumed.Esposito CCA (NSW) 20 November 1998 applied.Ground 2: causationThe fact that a deceased has a constitutional defect which makes him more susceptible to death does not assist the defendant.It is incorrect to search for a principal cause of death. If contribution of the accused is present, it is irrelevant that there is more than one possible cause of death.Hayward (1908) 21 Cox CC 692, Murton (1862) 3F & F 492 (176 ER 221), Martyr (1962) Qd.R 398, Blaue (1975) 1 WLR 1441, Smithers (1977) 24 CCC (2d) 427, Mamote-Kulang (1964) 111 CLR 62, Butcher (1986) VR 43, McKinnon (1980) 2 NZLR 31, Pagett (1983) 76 CR App R 279 applied.Where the precise mechanism of death is “obscure”, the question is whether, approaching the matter in a common sense way, the appellant accelerated the death of the deceased, in that his actions provided a substantial contribution toward the death of the deceased. It was open to the judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant had attacked the deceased and that this attack was the substantial cause of his death. Although the autopsy results offered several possibilities, considering all the evidence, the only reasonable hypothesis open was that found by the judge. Royall (1990) 172 CLR 378 applied, Smith (1959) 2 QB 35, Evans and Gardiner (No 2) (1976) VR, Bingapam (1975) 11 SASR 469, Hallett (1969) SASR 141, Osland (1998) 159 ALR 170, Hennigan (1971) 3 All ER 133, Cato (1976) 1 WLR 110, Smithers (1977) 34 CCC (2d) 427, Puckeridge 1999 HCA 68 considered.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL No. 60193/99

     Regina v Anthony Stuart MOFFATT 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: Following trial, by judge alone, the appellant was convicted of the offence of murder. The single most important issue at the trial, and at the appeal, was whether upon the evidence, the death of the deceased was shown, beyond reasonable doubt to have been caused by an act of the appellant. 
    2   An allied issue, of considerable relevance to this issue, was the admissibility of certain oral admissions alleged to have been made by the appellant when first spoken to by police, and of other admissions contained in his electronically recorded interview (ERISP), conducted later that morning. 
     
      
     PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THIS APPEAL 
      
    3   The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court of error, and does not proceed by way of rehearing in a way that permits it to substitute its own findings of fact for those of the jury, or of the trial Judge where acting alone: Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50, and Kurtic CCA (NSW) 26 February 1996 unreported. 
    4   Where, as in the present case, the relevant ground is that the verdict, or more accurately the finding on the question of guilt by the trial Judge (S 17 Criminal Procedure Act 1986) should be set aside upon the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence (S 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912), then it can only intervene if, after making its own independent assessment of the evidence, it concludes that it was not open for the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant: M (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493, and Jones (1997) 149 ALR 598. In that event error permitting the substitution of a verdict of acquittal is established: Coombe CCA (NSW) 24 April 1997 at pp 11 and 12.  
    5   What is required in this respect is attention to the matters identified in Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379, Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 416, and Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106.  
     
      
     THE FACTS 
      
    6   The deceased Richard James Fyfe, died during the early hours of 26 April 1996 in the home unit the appellant shared with Ronald Godfrey. During the afternoon of 25 April the appellant, Godfrey and a friend William Williams, had been drinking moselle mixed with water, and methylated spirits. They were joined by the deceased who contributed a cask of wine to the occasion. 
    7   At some stage during the drinking session, the deceased, upon the Crown case, became involved in an altercation with the appellant, in the course of which he was struck several times about the chest with a hammer and manually strangled. Whether or not the prosecution was able to prove these matters depended upon the admissibility of the appellant’s ‘admissions’, to which I will return. 
    8   The others present at the unit claimed to have little awareness of what had occurred. Godfrey recalled the appellant becoming upset about something and smashing a mirror with his fist. Subsequently he fell asleep. When he awoke he saw the deceased lying on the floor. Williams claimed even less knowledge about the death of the deceased, it being his assertion that he had not even seen him arrive. He had gone to sleep drunk and was unaware of any argument. 
    9   Evidence was called from the occupants of an adjoining unit. Jodi Keane said that she heard yelling and thumping coming from the appellant’s unit followed later by the sound of glass smashing. She said that subsequently the appellant came to her door and said “You have to help me, I’ve killed someone” - although in cross examination she agreed that he may have said “they’ve killed someone”. When she went into the flat, the appellant said “I’m really sorry. I didn’t want yous (sic) to see this side of me. It shouldn’t have happened”. He added that the deceased had called him “a dog”. He indicated an intention to go out to buy some cigarettes after which he would hand himself in to police. Godfrey and Williams she said were drunk and laughing. 
    10   Kellie Findley similarly heard banging, smashing and yelling from the appellant’s unit. When the appellant came to the door of their unit, she recalled him saying that he thought that he had strangled a guy and that he was dead. When she went into his unit she saw the deceased lying on the floor. Williams and Godfrey were laughing. They and the appellant appeared very drunk. Joseph Both gave similar evidence concerning the conversation at the door to Jodi Keane’s unit. 
    11   Police attended the unit at 12.40am and found the deceased slumped on the floor, dead. Ambulance officer Wise who arrived at about 12.45am, and confirmed that the deceased was dead, noticed that he had a blue tinge about the face. At 12.55am the appellant was stopped on the Kingsway at Cronulla near the Cronulla Police Station, to which he was then taken. 
    12   Former Incremental Sergeant Hazlewood informed the appellant, at about 3.45 am, after making some preliminary inquiries, that he was under arrest for murder. After being cautioned, the appellant made the following admissions: 
     
      
       
       “Well I killed him because he called me a dog and the two other old cunts had nothing to do with it. They’re both in their 60’s and I am 36. It was no problem. I am taking it on the chin. I killed him, I just choked him and snapped his neck”. 
       
      
    13   At about 4.45am, according to Sergeant Hazlewood, the appellant added, while standing in the dock: 
     
      
       
       “I hit him with a hammer to the chest and put my hands around his throat and killed him. The old guys were pissed and they don’t know jack shit. Well I’ll do a lot of time, years over this one”. 
       
      
      
     These conversations were recorded in the officer’s notebook, but were not adopted by the appellant, either at the time when he was spoken to by Sergeant Hazlewood, or when he was interviewed by detectives later. The notebook was not offered to the appellant to read and sign nor was he asked to read it or adopt it. Sergeant Hazlewood was of the opinion that the appellant was “very intoxicated”. 
      
    14   The appellant participated in an ERISP commencing at 6.15 am on 26 April. He said, during this interview, that he, Godfrey and Williams had been drinking methylated spirits and water, and wine during the afternoon before being joined by the deceased. At some point, he said that he and the deceased argued because he was unable to show him his knife. He (the appellant) then began to smash up the place with a hammer. When the deceased called him a “dog” he grabbed him by the throat. He was pulled off by Godfrey and Williams. Some time later when the deceased repeated, “You’re still a mutt” he struck him, with the hammer, in the chest, and grabbed him around the throat. He heard the sound of cracking when he hit the deceased in the chest. While seizing him by the throat he heard another crack, after which he saw his eyes roll back and his tongue turn blue. The deceased, he said, was trying to push him off while this occurred. He checked for a pulse in his neck and placed a broken piece of mirror or glass, against his mouth to see if he was breathing.  
    15   He said later in the interview: 
     
      
       
        “I hit him with the flat (of the hammer) …. Then I put me hands around his throat and I just didn’t let go until he stopped breathing. Looks like I went a little bit overboard, didn’t I?” 
       
      
    16   The appellant volunteered, in relation to his own tolerance to alcohol: 
     
      
       
       “Like I can drink anything you know, 8 to 12 litres a day, you know, and that’s including about two litres of metho on top of that, that’s a lot of drinking, a big day”. 
       
      
    17   It was the assessment of Detective Sergeant Jones, who interviewed the appellant, that although he thought him to be “slightly affected” by alcohol, he appeared to be lucid and to be giving sensible answers to his questions. 
    18   At 8.00am, a blood sample was taken from the appellant. His blood alcohol reading was 0.180 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. It was estimated by Dr. Moynham and by Dr Judith Perl, a forensic pharmacologist, that at 6.15am, when the interview began, it would have been between 0.20 and 0.245 grams per 100 ml, and that at 12.30am, the estimated time of the death of the deceased, it would have been between 0.277 and 0.375 grams per 100 ml. 
    19   Dr. Moynham said that he expected a heavy drinker of alcohol and methylated spirits to develop a “fairly strong tolerance” for alcohol, and would be able to cope with a blood alcohol concentration that, for average persons, would be “embalming” them. 
    20   Dr. Wong, a forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the appellant on 9 September 1998, and took from him an account that was consistent with that given in the ERISP. He was unable to detect any gross impairment in the appellant’s cognitive functioning. Upon viewing the ERISP he concluded that it was unlikely that the appellant had been confabulating, or that he was other than fully aware of what he was being asked. His conclusions, in this regard, were related to the fact that he did not manifest any signs of intoxication, to the fact that much of what he said had been corroborated by independent evidence, and to the manner in which he corrected the police or asked for ambiguities in their questions to be clarified. In his opinion the appellant had developed a significant degree of tolerance to alcohol, an opinion shared by Dr. Judith Perl, who said that a person with a drinking pattern of the kind which was given by the appellant in the ERISP, would be “extremely tolerant” to alcohol. 
     
      
    21   Dr. Perl similarly examined the appellant’s ERISP and concluded that his answers were appropriate and responsive, indicating that his cognition was “not significantly impaired” by the alcohol he had consumed. Her evidence is sufficiently encapsulated in the following question and answer: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Does the demeanour and manner of speaking of the accused during that interview enable you to express any view as to his cognitive ability at the time? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I would have said his cognition was almost intact, very little impairment of his memory and certainly full - appeared to have full comprehension of the questions, gave appropriate answers, there didn't seem to be any obvious significant impairment of his coordination, so I would have put him as being slightly impaired.” 
       
      
    22   Dr. Strum, a forensic psychiatrist, interviewed the appellant on 5 September 1998. He was unable to detect any sign of disorientation or organic brain damage, but thought that the history of personality traits supplied was suggestive of frontal lobe syndrome. He thought the appellant to be an alcoholic who suffered from a borderline personality disorder with poor judgment and poor impulse control. He saw no reason why he should not have been able to choose to take part in the ERISP, the viewing of which gave no indication of any abnormality or of cognitive impairment on his part. Dr. Strum later added that he could not have pretended to have been functioning normally if in fact he did not have that capacity.  
    23   His evidence was supplemented by that of a neuro-psychologist, Alexandria Walker, and by a psychologist, Anna Robilliard. The former concluded that the appellant had suffered mild cognitive impairment (particularly in aspects of frontal lobe function) because of his history of alcohol consumption. Ms Robilliard, who conducted the standard psychological tests, expressed the view that while the appellant displayed signs of severe disturbance across most areas of social and interpersonal behaviour, brain damage was not detected on those tests. 
    24   A certificate was also tendered as to the blood alcohol level of the deceased, which was determined as 0.482 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. The level of alcohol in his occular fluid (0.537 grams per 100ml) and in his urine (0.559 grams per 100 ml) was even higher. Dr Perl said that a reading of 0.482 grams per 100 ml, is likely to result in coma and, most likely in death, except in people who have an extreme tolerance to alcohol as a result of their heavy alcohol intake. 
    25   Post mortem examination of the deceased, by Dr. Lawrence, revealed that he had suffered fractures to two ribs. Blood was found in his lungs indicating to Dr. Lawrence that he was still alive when his ribs were fractured. Those injuries were consistent with him having been struck by a hammer and with the production of an audible cracking noise. An oblique fracture to the thyroid cartilage was found, along with bruising to the neck of the deceased. The fracture to the cartilage was not itself life threatening, and could have occurred immediately before, at the time of, or just after death, (ie during the peri mortem period). 
    26   Three factors contributing to death were noted by him, namely the “combined effects of compression of the neck, blunt force chest injury, and acute ethanol intoxication”. A fourth significant condition of the deceased was noted, namely that he had a seventy five percent occlusion of a coronary artery, which made him vulnerable to the risk of sudden death, without prior warning signs.  
    27   The description of the appellant seeing the tongue of the deceased turn blue and his eyes roll back, Dr. Lawrence said, was consistent with the description of a person “being strangled to the point of unconsciousness”. The presence of forceful movements, while being strangled, and the absence of breathing, or of a pulse, a short time later, was suggestive to him of a temporal link and causal nexus, between the neck compression and death.  
    28   A blue tongue, he conceded, could also be indicative of death from a heart attack or from alcohol poisoning, while the rolling back of the eyes could be a sign of a coma due to acute alcoholic intoxication. Although there were no signs of petechial haemorrhages, a common sign in cases of manual strangulation, that, he said, can occur where the compression to the neck is quick and forceful.  
    29   The normal path towards death from alcohol toxicity, Dr Lawrence said, involved a person becoming progressively more comatose, although that depended on how quickly the alcohol was ingested.  
    30   Dr. Lawrence agreed that, based purely on the autopsy findings, he could not attribute to any one of the likely causes identified, ie neck compression, acute alcohol toxicity, and cardiac arrest due either to atherosclerosis, or to blunt chest trauma, a higher degree of probability than another. 
    31   He said, however, that if the deceased had been arguing with the appellant, and had attempted to push him off as he was being strangled, then it would appear that he had not been in a comatose state due to alcoholic intoxication. He also said that sudden compression of the neck and the forceful application of blows to the chest of a person suffering a significant occlusion of a major coronary artery, could contribute to or accelerate a sudden death from that cardiac condition. 
    32   Dr. Byron Collins, a forensic pathologist, who was called by the defence, said that it was not possible to determine which of the potential causes of death identified by Dr. Lawrence was “the most likely”. They may have acted individually or in conjunction. Those observations, however, so it became clear from his evidence, were based solely on the “pathological findings”.  
    33   The thyroid cartilage fracture, which could be associated with a loud crack, he said was unusual in a case of manual strangulation, but not impossible. The absence of petechial haemorrhage, he also agreed, while common in cases of manual strangulation, was not so uncommon as to exclude that possibility. It was also possible, he said, that the neck injuries were due to a fall or were occasioned after death. The rolling of the deceased’s eyes and the change in colour of his tongue, he thought, did not indicate anything specific other than that the cerebral, musculature and cardiac functions were compromised. Whether that was due to the cardiac problems or to asphyxia he was unable to say. 
    34   The toxic effects of alcohol he explained as acting as a depressant for the central nervous system, particularly the respiratory centre, which can cause breathing to stop, leading to death. Additionally, the toxic effects can damage the heart fibres and produce cardiac arrhythmia of sufficient severity to produce death. 
    35   Another possibility, that emerged in his evidence, related to the circumstance that manual strangulation can lead to sudden death where there is an interference with the carotid sinus and the vagus nerve, a consequence that is more likely in a person predisposed to cardiac arrest. It would in fact help, in the present case, to explain the lack of petechial haemorrhage, as Dr. Collins explained. 
    36   Passing from the pathological findings to the events described by the appellant, Dr. Collins said: 
     
      
       
       “Q. If in this case there was evidence from Mr. Moffatt that the man in question was able to talk some short time before death and, indeed, attempted to push off his assailant just prior to death, would that scenario suggest that this was not death by someone slowly lapsing into an alcoholic coma?  
       
      
      
      
       
       A. I think that’s quite reasonable. It’s certainly not what one would expect in somebody who’s going into respiratory depression and death, but it is entirely consistent with an irritable heart causing sudden arrhythmia and death induced by alcohol.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “Q. Dr. Collins, if you assume that the account given by the accused to police was correct, that at the time that he applied pressure to the neck, that the deceased was attempting to push him off - A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. – without success? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. then there was a crack? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And then there was apparent lifelessness? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. In rapid succession? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Does that suggest to you that the compression of the neck provided some operating and substantial causation resulting in death? A. Well, as I said, it may have. It may have been - the compression may have been related to the carotid sinus stimulation. Simply the fact that there is a crack in the neck doesn’t mean to say that then there is sufficient force there to produce asphyxial type death and we have already commented about the significance or otherwise of the lack of the petechial haemorrhages, but it does not exclude entirely the other conditions that are present in this man, whether aggravated by the manipulation of the neck or not, and that is his coronary artery disease and his high blood alcohol level.” 
       
      
      
     THE ADMISSIONS 
      
    37   It was submitted that his Honour fell into error in receiving into evidence the admissions made to former Incremental Sergeant Hazlewood, as well as those contained in the ERISP, upon the basis that they were involuntary, or alternatively upon the basis that their reception was unfair to the appellant, attracting the provisions of SS 85(2), 90 and 135, or 137 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
    38   Initially there was no objection taken at trial in relation to the admissions recorded by Sergeant Hazlewood, even though the occasion of that conversation fell squarely within the operation of S 424A of the Crimes Act 1900, and possibly also S 86 of the Evidence Act.  
    39   Section 424A of the Crimes Act renders inadmissible evidence of admissions made by an accused person at a time when he or she was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, unless there is available to the Court a tape recording of the interview in which the admission is made; or if a reasonable excuse for the absence of such a tape recording is established, there is available a tape recording of a subsequent interview in which the accused states that an admission was made in the terms alleged; or alternatively, the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why neither of the tape recordings could be made. 
    40   This section, the operation of which was reviewed by this Court in Horton CCA NSW 2 November 1998, unreported, was applicable because the appellant was informed that he was under arrest for murder before he volunteered the relevant admission. Absent proof of the existence of a reasonable excuse for the absence of either of the tape recordings contemplated by S 424A, the evidence was not admissible to show that the appellant had made the admissions described.  
    41   Objection was only taken to its tender after the evidence was concluded. Although tendered, initially, as an admission of guilt once objection was taken, the Crown abandoned any intention to rely upon it for that purpose. At the request of counsel for the appellant, it was thereafter treated as available as a matter relevant for the issue of confabulation which arose in relation to the ERISP. Although not using the words of S 136 of the Evidence Act, it is clear that his Honour thereafter effectively limited its use to that issue. 
    42   Had that course not been taken, for the tactical reasons that appealed to counsel, then consistently with the decision of this Court in Horton, the evidence should have been excluded in its entirety. 
    43   The issue concerning the admissibility of the ERISP turns upon the following provisions of the Evidence Act: 
     
      
       
       S 85 (1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) in the course of official questioning, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) … 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2) it is to take into account: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and 
       
      
      
      (b) … 
      
      
       
       S 90 In criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 
       
      
      
      
       
       S 135 The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
       
      
      
      (b) … 
      
      (c) … 
      
      
       
       S 137 In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.: 
       
      
    44   The admissibility of the ERISP depends upon whether:  
     
      
     a) the Crown had carried the onus required by S 85(2) of the Act, of showing that the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such as to make it  
     unlikely 
      that their  
     truth 
      was adversely affected;  
      
      
     b) notwithstanding the effects of the alcohol consumed, the appellant made a sufficiently free choice to participate in the ERISP, and whether  
      
      
     c) in all the circumstances, it would be unfair, or unfairly prejudicial, to the appellant to allow the Crown to rely upon that interview, or more specifically the admissions contained within it - matters of particular relevance for SS 90, 135 and 137 of the Act. 
      
    45   Any question as to its admissibility fell also to be determined in accordance with the following provisions of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
       S 142 (1) Except as otherwise provided by this Act, in any proceeding the court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) a question whether evidence should be admitted or not admitted, whether in the exercise of a discretion or not, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) … 
       
      
      
       
       have been proved if it is satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) In determining whether it is so satisfied, the matters that the court must take into account include: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question. 
       
      
      
       
        
       S 189 (1) If the determination of a question whether: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) evidence should be admitted (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not), or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) evidence can be used against a person, or 
       
      
      
       
       (c) …  
       
      
      
       
       depends on the court finding that a particular fact exists, the question whether that fact exists is, for the purposes of this section, a preliminary question. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) … 
       
      
      
       
       (3) In the hearing of a preliminary question about whether a defendant’s admission should be admitted into evidence (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not) in a criminal proceeding, the issue of the admission’s truth or untruth is to be disregarded unless the issue is introduced by the defendant.” 
       
      
      
    46   So far as the S 85 inquiry is concerned I repeat what I said in Esposito CCA (NSW) 20 November 1998 at 30.  
     
      
       
       “The correct analysis is, in my view, as follows: If upon the evidence led on the voir dire (and/or in the trial to that point) a question legitimately arises as to whether the circumstances were such that the truth (or untruth) of the admission might have been adversely affected, then it falls to the crown to establish upon a balance of probabilities (Evidence Act S 142) that it was unlikely that this was the case. The inquiry undertaken by the Judge is not concerned with the question whether the admission was in fact made, or whether it was true (or untrue); each is for the jury (S 189(3)) Evidence Act). 
        
       
      
    47   Similar considerations arise in relation to S 90 which permits a discretionary exclusion of evidence where, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to the defendant to use it.  
    48   So far as SS 135 and 137 are concerned, it is beyond question, provided the reliability issue was resolved in favour of the prosecution, that the evidence of the admissions had significant probative value. The question of unfair prejudice to the appellant, arising in respect of these provisions, was bound up in the very same question which fell for determination under SS 85 and 90, namely whether having regard to the state of the appellant when interviewed, there would be a lack of fairness, or unfair prejudice to him in the tendering of the admissions.  
    49   The question of admissibility seems to have been argued at trial, and decided adversely to the appellant, only in the context of SS 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, and in the context of the warning that his Honour was required to give, and did give, to himself under S 165 (1)(a) and (c) of that Act. 
    50   The circumstances now said to be of relevance for S 85, and for the remaining provisions, concern the effects of intoxication upon the appellant: 
     
      
     a) firstly  
     at the time of the incident 
     , and specifically at that point, in relation to his awareness of what was occurring, and his ability to understand or gauge the significance of the signs which he saw in the deceased, and to fix them in a proper context of time;  
      
      
     b)  
     at the time of the making of the admissions,  
     and specifically at that point, in electing to speak to police, and in being able to recount, in a lucid and accurate way what he had seen, or heard, during any altercation with the deceased. 
      
    51   At the trial these issues were examined by reference to whether or not the Crown had excluded beyond reasonable doubt the possibility of confabulation, and if so, whether or not the ERISP was, in all the circumstances, to be regarded as reliable. 
    52   As to the first, his Honour found that confabulation had been excluded taking into account the following matters: 
    · Dr. Wong’s assessment that it was unlikely that the account to police was invented; 
    · the fact that the interview showed, consistently with the medical evidence, that the appellant had developed a significant tolerance to alcohol; 
    · that absence of signs such as slurred speech when interviewed; 
    · the circumstance that the accounts the appellant gave to the neighbours, and to Sergeant Hazlewood before the ERISP and subsequently to Drs Strum and Wong, were substantially similar and consistent with the account given in the ERISP. 
     
      
     In my view the finding in this respect was the only finding reasonably open, having regard to the expert evidence, and the matters identified by his Honour. 
      
    53   As to the second, his Honour had regard to the submissions that: 
    · inebriated persons are not reliable witnesses; 
    · in some respects the version given was confused or contradictory; 
    · the appellant’s assessment of the level of intoxication of the deceased was awry. 
    54   His Honour also resolved this point in favour of the Crown, after taking into account the evidence of the professional witnesses which was in turn based upon the appellant’s responsive and lucid answers, and upon the fact that he was able accurately to paraphrase certain matters put to him by the police, to correct mistakes made by them, to seek clarification of certain questions, and to disagree with some matters put to him.  
    55   I can see no error in the approach taken by his Honour in relation to this evidence, or to the assessment that, although the blood alcohol level of the appellant was high, his tolerance was such as to minimise its effects. The expert evidence in fact was all one way in this regard, and was supplemented by the absence of any clear indication of underlying brain damage. Moreover, the circumstance that the appellant had his wits sufficiently about him to try the pulse and breathing of the deceased to see if he was still alive, was a powerful indication that he was not significantly affected by alcohol, and that his cognitive powers were unimpaired. 
    56   His Honour appropriately, in this respect, also rejected the submission that the account given was implausible, in so far as the appellant had claimed to have murdered someone who was a complete stranger, or had grossly overreacted to an insult, or had argued over a trivial matter, or had underestimated the degree of intoxication of the deceased, or had given answers which were possibly inconsistent concerning the time interval between the two insults. 
    57   I can see no error whatsoever in his Honour’s assessment in this regard. Indeed Dr Strum provided an explanation for the way in which the appellant responded to what might have been seen to be trivial insults, namely that it was attributable to his personality disorder.  
    58   I can also see no error in the approach which his Honour took, in relation to the independent evidence corroborative of the events described in the interview, of which Dr Strum thought the appellant seemed to have a full memory. That evidence came from the neighbours and police concerning the damage done to ornaments and the like in the unit; concerning the presence of the blood of the appellant (but not of the deceased) on the hammer which he acknowledged in the ERISP, came from his hand which he cut while smashing those objects; concerning the presence of broken ribs in the deceased which, according to the expert evidence, would be expected to be accompanied by cracking sounds of the kind the appellant described; concerning the presence of bruise marks upon the throat of the deceased and of a fractured thyroid cartilage, again consistent, according to the medical evidence with the actions the appellant described and the further crack he heard; and concerning the fact that, as foreshadowed to the neighbours, he was found by the police only metres away from the police station to which he said he was going. 
    59   In my view, although the critical issue seems not to have been addressed specifically in the terms of SS 85 and 90, at least at the time of tender of the ERISP, the factual findings expressly made by his Honour in his reasons for the findings on guilt necessarily subsumed the issues arising under those provisions, so far as he found that the ERISP was reliable. Moreover, so far as the appellant’s free exercise of choice to participate in the ERISP is concerned, this was clearly put to rest by Dr Strum.  
    60   Having regard to my assessment that his Honour’s findings on guilt, as well as those in the judgment of 18 March 1999, concerned with SS 135 and 137, were free of error, I am of the view that the challenge to the tender of the ERISP, and of evidence of Sergeant Hazlewood, has not been made good. 
     
      
     CAUSATION 
      
    61   As noted above, the evidence raised a number of possible causes of death: 
     
      
     a) strangulation; 
      
      
     b) blunt force compression of the chest; 
      
      
     c) cardiac arrest; 
      
      
     d) alcoholic poisoning; and 
      
      
     e) a combination, of all or any two or more, of those causes 
      
    62   It was submitted that, in those circumstances, the Crown could not have satisfied his Honour beyond reasonable doubt, that an act of the appellant caused, or accelerated the death of the deceased. More precisely, it was submitted that the reasonable hypothesis that the act of the appellant, which he may have believed caused or contributed to the death of the deceased, occurred after he was already dead or at a time when he was coincidentally dying from unrelated causes. 
    63   So far as this submission rests upon the argument that the observations of the appellant, the subject of the admissions, were unreliable because of the effects of alcohol, and could not be used to displace any reasonable doubt available on the expert evidence, that proposition has not been made good.  
    64   The associated proposition concerning reliability depends upon a somewhat different consideration - namely that even assuming the appellant’s observations and the timing of the events described were reliable, nevertheless, because he lacked medical qualifications, they were of limited or negligible value. This submission, in my view, seeks to place too much significance upon the nature of those observations. They did not depend upon medical expertise. Rather, they were the kinds of observations that a lay person could make which, when considered in the light of the expert evidence, were consistent with the victim being alive before any attack by the appellant. 
    65   His Honour, having noted the evidence of Doctors Lawrence and Byron Collins, correctly observed that the appellant, having used violence on the deceased, had to take him as he found him: Hayward (1908) 21 Cox CC 692 at 693; Murton (1862) 3F & F 492 (176 ER 221), Martyr (1962) Qd.R 398, Blaue (1975) 1WLR 1411 at 1415 and Smithers (1977) 24 CCC (2d) 427 at 437. Mamote-Kulang (1964) 111 CLR 62 is clear authority for the proposition that the presence, in the deceased, of a constitutional defect unknown to his assailant which makes the victim more susceptible to death than would be a person in normal health, does not enable the assailant to claim that death is an accident: Windeyer J there observed, at 79: 
     
      
       
       “A killing is not less a crime because the victim was frail and easily killed”.  
       
      
      
     See also  
     Van Den Bemd 
      (1994) 179 CLR 137. 
      
    66   It does not matter that there is more than one cause of death: Butcher (1986) VR 43, even if the victim is suffering from a condition that is threatening death, so long as the contribution of the accused later mentioned is present. It is indeed a misapplication of principle to attempt a search for a principal cause of death: McKinnon (1980) 2 NZLR 31 and Pagett (1983) 76 CR App R 279  
    67   In the present case, it is true, the appellant was confronted with a man who was susceptible to sudden death, because he had atherosclerotic disease, because his blood alcohol level approached a lethal level, and because he suffered from alcohol related liver disease, which may have reduced his resistance and otherwise impaired his health. 
    68   Having noted that the precise mechanism of death was “obscure”, in those circumstances and upon the pathology, his Honour correctly in my view identified the issue for determination as being whether, by his actions, the appellant accelerated the death of the deceased in a way that met the test of causation. 
    69   On that issue of causation his Honour then correctly directed himself by reference to the fact that in Royall (1990) 172 CLR 378, each of Mason, CJ; Deane and Dawson JJ; and Gaudron and Toohey JJ, in their separate judgments, cited with approval: 
     
      
       
       “… the comments of Burt CJ in  
       Campbell v The Queen 
        (1981) WAR 286, where the following was said: (at 290) 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘(It is) enough if juries [are] told that the question of cause for them to decide is not a philosophical or a scientific question, but a question to be determined by them applying their common sense to the facts as they find them, they appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter.’” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    70   The formulation of the test to be applied was not stated by their Honours in identical terms. Brennan J, said that the accused’s act or omission ‘must contribute significantly to the death of the victim (at 398). Deane and Dawson JJ said that it would be sufficient if the accused’s conduct “is a substantial or significant cause of death’ (at 411). The ‘causal connection must be sufficiently substantial to enable responsibility for the crime to be attributed to the accused.’ (at 412). Toohey and Gaudron JJ said the jury will inevitably concentrate its attention upon ‘whether the act of the accused substantially contributed to the death’ (at 423). McHugh J said that the wrongful act must be “An operating cause and a substantial cause” (at 444). 
    71   What is clear is that the act of the appellant must have more than a coincidental or insignificant effect - rather it must provide a substantial contribution towards the death of the deceased: See also Smith (1959) 2 QB 35; Evans and Gardiner (No2) (1976) VR 523; Bingapam (1975) 11 SASR 469 at 480; Hallett (1969) SASR 141; and Osland (1998) 159 ALR 170 at 174. Although there has been some debate as to whether the expression “significant” is interchangeable for “substantial” in this context, (see Vol 24 Criminal Law Journal April 2000 at 73), I am content to accept for the present purpose the latter.  
    72   If the appellant’s act does not initiate that process of death, then it has been held, that it must at least accelerate it by an amount that is “more than de minimis”: Hennigan (1971) 3 All ER 133; Cato (1976) 1 WLR 110, and Smithers (1977) 34 CCC (2d) 427 at 435 Such expression is, however, somewhat lacking in certainty, and I would prefer to employ a test in terms requiring a substantial contribution to any process that is under way, in order to achieve a consistency in relation to acts initiating and accelerating death. Nothing, however, turns upon that in this appeal, as it is evident that his Honour looked for an accelerating contribution that was substantial.  
    73   The alternative hypotheses identified in the present case related to the possibility that the deceased had suffered a heart attack, or was dying from the effects of alcohol toxicity, before the appellant struck him in the chest and seized him by his throat, and that the signs he saw in relation to the eyes and tongue of the deceased were attributable to those events, rather than to any act of his. 
    74   His Honour found a number of difficulties in the way of the possibility that the deceased had died, or was in the process of dying, before he was struck or strangled by the appellant, that scenario being inconsistent with the appellant’s account of the events, and with his observation that the deceased had seemed fine before the altercation. It was also inconsistent with the autopsy finding of haemo-aspiration which, Dr. Lawrence said, suggested that the deceased was alive when his ribs were fractured, and with the presence of bruising to the chest which, Dr. Lawrence similarly said, made it more likely that the hammer blows occurred before death. The appellant’s observations that the deceased was attempting to push him away in the course of the strangulation, ie was making forceful movements, also indicated that he was still alive. Even more conclusive, his Honour thought, was the temporal link described by the appellant, between the neck compression, the crack, the rolling of the eyes, and the cyanosed appearance of the tongue followed by the absence of signs of life. 
    75   Together, these circumstances, which in my view were compelling, led his Honour to the conclusion, approaching the matter in the common sense way directed by the authorities, that the actions of the appellant were the substantial and operating cause of death. To the circumstances noted might also be added the fact that the deceased was speaking to the appellant immediately before he was struck with the hammer, ie was not comatose as might have been expected had he been on his way to death because of ethanol intoxication; and the further fact that the post mortem examination showed him to have been a heavy drinker, who in accordance with well established medical knowledge, was likely to have developed a substantial level of tolerance to alcohol that may have been lethal to others. Additionally, there is the circumstance that, because of his pre-existing conditions, he was particularly vulnerable to physical violence. 
    76   As was the case in Puckeridge 1999 74 ALJR 373a, it was in my view open to his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had physically attacked the deceased, and that this attack either coincided with or immediately preceded his death. Once this conclusion was reached it was equally open to him to dismiss, as unreasonable, the possibility that his death was unconnected with the attack, but was attributable to the entirely coincidental suffering of cardiac arrest or collapse due to alcoholic toxicity. In this regard, while, on a purely scientific or philosophic basis, the autopsy findings left open several possibilities, once they were considered in the light of the events as described by the appellant, the only reasonable hypothesis open was that found by his Honour. 
    77   For these reasons I am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed and the conviction and sentence confirmed.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    POWELL JA: On 27 April 1998, the Appellant was indicted before Job DCJ at Newcastle District Court on the following charges:

        Between 25 May 1983 and 25 May 1984 at Mona Vale did assault his son (ZM) and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon ZM, he being under the age of 16 years (Crimes Act 1900 s.61E(1)). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1983 and 25 May 1984 at Mona Vale did bugger ZM a male person (Crimes Act 1900 s.79). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1983 and 25 May 1984 at Mona Vale did assault ZM thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm (Crimes Act 1900 s. 59). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1986 and 25 May 1987 at Terrey Hills did assault ZM and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon ZM he being under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.61E(1A). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 8 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1987 and 25 May 1988 at Charlestown did have sexual intercourse with ZM a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.66C(2)). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 9 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1987 and 25 May 1988 at Raymond Terrace did assault ZM and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon ZM he being under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.61E(1A)). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 10 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1987 and 25 May 1988 at Kings Cross did incite ZM to an act of indecency with the accused ZM being under the age of 16 years and at the time of the assault under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.61E(2A)). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 11 
        
       
       
        
        Between 25 May 1987 and 25 May 1988 at Mona Vale did have sexual intercourse with ZM a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.66C(2)). 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 12 and 13 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 January 1989 and 1 May 1989 at Newcastle did have sexual intercourse with ZM a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900 s.66C(2)). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 14 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1989 at Forster did have sexual intercourse with ZM a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the accused (Crimes Act 1900, s.66C(2)). 
        
       
       
      
    2    The Appellant pleaded not guilty to each of the charges and was tried before Job DCJ and a jury of 12.  
     
      
    3    On 1 May 1998, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count in the indictment. 
     
      
    4    On 25 June 1998, Job DCJ sentenced the Appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 5, 11 to 14

        Fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 1 May 1998 and to expire on 30 April 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6 
        
       
       
        
        Fixed term of 2 years penal servitude to commence on 1 May 1998 and to expire on 30 April 2000 
        
       
       
      
    5    Before the Appellant was formally arraigned, and in the absence of the jury panel, counsel then appearing for the Appellant made what I can only describe as a very confused application, the nature of which is to be gleaned from the extracts from the transcript which I set out below. The transcript records that, after summarising, in a very brief way, the charges in the indictment, counsel continued (T.2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The particulars of the charges have not been supplied and they’re in general terms especially for the first six charges related to indecent assault. They’re generalised rather than specific as to time, date and place, the general place, they run a series and that’s the case for most of them, also the evidence seems to suggest that there will be a general allegation of ongoing sexual assault on a daily basis virtually for the whole period from 1983 through until 1989. It is my submission that while the indictment properly framed (sic) in the sense that there is one charge on each indictment, they’re brought in a way which does not allow the accused to meet the charges except in the most general way, that is, they have not, except perhaps in one or two instances, been particularised and furthermore that they are, by their nature leading tendency evidence of which we’d submit firstly that no notice has been give (sic), but even if there had been notice given that, in this instance, it shouldn’t be allowable to be led in terms of the general requirements of significant probative value and other matters that relate tendency (sic) evidence. It is our submission that if the Crown was (sic) to proceed it should select (sic) and particularise and run separate trials in respect to the different offences not just throw up a range of changes (sic) running over a long period without the particulars. The authority for that I cite the case of  
        Esse 
         (?) which is 1989 ALR at page 321 
        .” ( 
        semble 
          
        S. v. R. 
         (1989) 89 ALR 321 
        ) “and the circumstances, the facts of that case are somewhat similar to the fact (sic) in this case and the Crown should elect which charges he is going to run on, particularise those charges and indeed, in our submission, run separate trials.” 
        
       
       
       
      and then, in relation to Job DCJ’s question as to whether or not there should be a separate trial in relation to each count, counsel continued (T.3): 
       
       
        
        “Not in relation to each count necessarily. In terms of certainly 25 May 1983 to 25 May 1984, it is my submission that indeed that those are so general as to warrant if he was to proceed on them, a stay application, just so general that they cannot be met and they are running tendency one on the other. The Crown is running a general tendency line throughout the whole in order to support the allegations without providing the required particulars in my respectful submission.” 
        
       
       
      
    6    The Crown Prosecutor then (T.3) handed to Job DCJ a folder which contained three statements which had been made by ZM and the transcript of the electronically recorded interview (“the ESIRP”) which had been held with the Appellant. That having been done, the Crown Prosecutor then took Job DCJ through the indictment and identified those passages in the statements which had been made by ZM which related to the particular charges in the indictment. 
     
      
    7    After the Crown Prosecutor had dealt with the first six counts in the indictment, Job DCJ indicated (t.7) that he proposed to allow those counts to be tried together. 
     
      
    8    That having been done, the Crown Prosecutor then took Job DCJ to the further counts in the indictment and identified those passages in the statements which had been made by ZM which related to each count. 
     
      
    9    The transcript (T. 8-9) then records the following interchange between the Appellant’s counsel and Job DCJ and the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “(APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): I would submit in terms of the linkage of those charges after charge 6 with those charges from 1 to 6 in terms of tendency and their use in my submission, other than the other ones I have made, is in terms of a separate trial if appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Right. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): On the tendency evidence, the use of tendency evidence and its clear application there 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, well, Mr. Crown I assume you’ll be saying that this shows, what is sometimes called a guilty passion but often now called a sexual interest … 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Between the accused and his son.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR (sic): Which started when he was about, what say about nine years of age and the last instant when he was what? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Fifteen and a bit. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the complainant does talk about there being other incidents in that period of time and I do have available  
        R.v. A.H. 
         (?).” (semble  
        R. v. A.H 
         (1997) 42 NSWLR 702) 
        
       
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Yes I’ve read that. I propose to allow the trial to proceed on all fourteen counts, Mr. Crown. 
        
       
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m satisfied the accused was served proper notice of these matters and that I regard the evidence as being wholly probative which would certainly outweigh any prejudicial value.” 
        
       
       
      
    10    Thereafter, the Appellant was formally arraigned (T.11-13) and, after he had entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges in the indictment, the jury was empanelled and the trial proceeded. 
     
      
    11    Although it is a little out of the correct temporal order to record it at this stage, it should be noted that, during the course of the first day of the trial (T.25), the Appellant on the advice of his counsel made a number of formal admissions (Exhibit “A”). Those admissions included the following: 
     
      
       
      1. that ZM was born on 25 May 1974; 
       
       
      2. that the Appellant is the father of ZM; 
       
       
      3. that during 1983 ZM was in Year 3 at an identified primary school; 
       
       
      4. that ZM attended that primary school until the end of the school year in 1986 when he completed Year 6; 
       
       
      5. that during 1987 ZM was in Year 7 at an identified State high school; 
       
       
      6. that between 4 February and 1 July 1988 ZM was in Year 8 at an identified private high school; 
       
       
      7. that on 24 May 1988 the Appellant signed a contract for the purchase of premises in a suburb of Newcastle; 
       
       
      8. that the transfer of that property to the Appellant took place on 21 July 1988; 
       
       
      9. that the Brisbane Expo occurred during 1988; 
       
       
      10. that the Newcastle earthquake occurred on 28 December 1989. 
       
       
      Given the nature of the offences charged in Counts 1 to 4 and 7 to 14 of the indictment, the relevance and significance of the first two admitted facts is obvious. The relevance and significance of the balance of the admitted facts lies in the fact that, although ZM was unable to identify with precision the date or dates upon which one or other of the offences charged occurred, he was, by reference to one or other of the admitted facts, able to give some indication of the time at which, or the period during which, one or other of the offences charged was said to have occurred. Thus, the offences charged in Counts 1 to 6 were said to have occurred when ZM was 9 years of age, the offence charged in Count 7 was said to have occurred when ZM was in Year 6, and the offence charged in Count 8 was said to have occurred at a time when the Appellant was looking to purchase a home in Newcastle and on the day before he and ZM were shown the property in the suburb of Newcastle which the Appellant was later to buy. 
       
      
    12    The principal witness for the Crown was ZM who gave evidence as to events the subject of the counts in the indictment. Additional evidence was given by BM, the Appellant’s former wife and ZM’s mother, that evidence including evidence that as from the time when ZM was in Year 3 he regularly slept in the Appellant’s room, and that she had found a pornographic video and pornographic magazines in the Appellant’s bedroom, which video and magazines the Appellant admitted having shown to ZM. Further evidence as to the Appellant and ZM having slept in the same room was given by TH, ZM’s sister. Finally, evidence was given by the police officer who conducted the investigation into the complaints which were later made by ZM and who conducted the ERISP, the video tape of which, and the audio cassette relating to which, became Exhibit B, and the transcript of which became Exhibit C at the trial. 
     
      
    13    Although, as I have earlier recorded, ZM’s evidence was, for the most part, directed towards the offences the subject of the various charges, during the course of his evidence in chief he gave some evidence which went beyond the matters the subject of those charges. Thus, the transcript records the following evidence which was given after ZM had given evidence as to the matters the subject of Count 3 in the indictment: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you continue to go into his room of a night? A. After this happened? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? A. I had to sleep in his room all the time after all this. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you have to sleep in his room all the time after this? A. Because I wasn’t allowed to sleep in my own bed, every time I’d sleep in my own bed he’d come in and ask me to sleep in his and if I didn’t he’d get pretty angry. No angry but he’d start getting on my case and saying all this crap that he used to go on with. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. Can you remember any other instance that happened after that in the bedroom? A. Yes lots of times.”  
        (T. 14-15) 
        
       
       
      
    14    The transcript also records the following, as the Crown Prosecutor was leading ZM to deal with the events the subject of Count 12 in the indictments: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well during those holidays did something happen between you and your father? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened between you and your father? A. These things happened to me that often I’m not really sure what you’re talking about.”  
        (T.42) 
        
       
       
      
    15    It should be noted, here, that on neither of the occasions to which I have just referred did counsel then appearing for the Appellant object to the evidence given by ZM, or seek to have it struck out of the transcript, or seek to have Job DCJ then instruct the jury as to the basis on which such evidence might be admissible, or as to the use to which they might legitimately put such evidence. 
     
      
    16    ZM was extensively cross-examined by counsel then appearing for the Appellant - the transcript of the cross-examination extends to some 67 pages. The cross-examination was not directed merely to the detail of the evidence given by ZM as to the various offences charged in the indictment. On the contrary, it is clear from the cross-examination that counsel then appearing for the Appellant had made a deliberate election to charge ZM with having fabricated his evidence and to seek to obtain by cross-examination evidence as to the relationship between ZM and the Appellant and, in particular, evidence as to ZM’s feelings toward the Appellant which would enable counsel to seek to persuade the jury that ZM’s feelings towards the Appellant were such as to cause ZM to lie. 
     
      
    17    The fact that counsel then appearing for the Appellant adopted the latter course led to a number of exchanges of which the following are examples: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Because you were making up a story? A. No I’m not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You see? And the reason you were making up a … A: Excuse me. Why should I make a story up, waste all this time for taxpayers’ money and come here and accuse - if he was such a good father, why would I be sitting here at this time mate? You tell me that.” 
         (T.56) 
        
       
       
      and later: 
       
       
        
        “Q. When you were working with your father, at the MSB right? Remember that? A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your mother would also work there wouldn’t she? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And your sister would also work there? A. At times, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And indeed it was a family - the family worked quite hard didn’t they? A. My parents did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah, and you worked quite hard too, didn’t you? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t want to work? A. No, ‘cause I was a kid, I wanted to have a normal life like every other kid. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And indeed that’s one reason why you disliked your father isn’t it? A. Pardon? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s another reason why you disliked your father? A. Yeah I dislike him for not being a normal human being and raising me like a normal parent would.” 
         (T.57-58) 
        
       
       
      and later again: 
       
       
        
        “Q. But you see in respect of those words you’re making it up? A. No I’m not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s a recent invention? A. I could prove it mate.” 
         (T.72) 
        
       
       
      and later again: 
       
       
        
        “Q. And you didn’t like it when he asked you to work with him did you? A. No, what kid likes to work, you tell me? Would you work when you were 12 and you were supposed to go to school and study? How are you supposed to study when you’ve got to work all night long and do you (sic) schoolwork. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you were quite bitter about that weren’t you. A. Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then you ran away from home? A. Yes, because he sexually abused me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And your running away from home had nothing to do with sexual abuse by your father because it didn’t happen? A. It did happen, sorry sir. I wouldn’t be sitting in this court room wasting my time, I’ve nothing to gain out of this, sitting here accusing my father. If he was such a good father why would I be sitting in this room, you know, wasting all these people’s time? You tell me that. What would I get out of this? What can I get out of this? Nothing. All I want is justice served for what he done to me all them years.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. What I’m suggesting to you is that you’re still bitter about your father? A. I’m bitter for what he has done to me. Not even an animal does that to their own child. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re bitter about your father but it has nothing to do with sexual abuse because he didn’t sexually abuse you …? A. He did sexually abuse me.” 
         (T.115-116) 
        
       
       
      
    18    Again, it is not without point to note that, notwithstanding the first of the grounds of appeal which have been taken on behalf of the Appellant, no application was made to Job DCJ to have struck from the transcript ZM’s answers “Why would I make a story up waste all this time for taxpayers’ money” and “I wouldn’t be sitting in this court wasting my time I’ve got nothing to gain out of this, sitting her accusing my father. If he were such a good father why would I be sitting in this court room you know wasting all these people’s time”. 
     
      
    19    In the course of ZM’s re-examination (T. 121-122), the following occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. At the time you first went to the police officers was there anything particular happening that sent you off to the police station? A. Yes. I rang up Operation Paradox at first when that started and no-one got back to me. Then I seen a counsellor at the Gold Coast Youth Service for people over - under 24 and I seen them and I was talking to a counsellor there and she’s the one who helped the proceed in all this that’s going on right now. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just so everyone knows what you’re talking about, what is Operation Paradox, or what do you understand … ? A. Oh it’s to, where people, young people can ring up and inform on like sex, bad sexual behaviour that’s happened to them or like teachers or their parents, stuff like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say you rang up, who did you ring up, do you know? A. I rang up an 1800 number. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know who runs Operation Paradox? A. I think it was the police. There’s - I’d alike to say there’s also more charges up in Queensland to be dealt with, with this.” 
        
       
       
      
    20    The last answer given led counsel then appearing for the Appellant to apply to Job DCJ to have the jury discharged upon the ground that that answer was non-responsive and highly prejudicial (T.123). 
     
      
    21    The transcript (T. 126-128) records the following as part of the discussion which took place on that application: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I think we sometimes treat juries as if they have no intelligence at times and I think it’s quite wrong. I think the matter has to be clarified in some way. He did use the word (sic) ‘charges in Queensland still to be dealt with’. That may be his understanding of when he talks about charges, his charges, but I think the matter ought to be clarified and I’d ask the Crown how he proposes to clarify it and you can listen to what the Crown has to say, what do you want to do Mr. Crown? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: What I want to do your Honour is firstly clarify what he referred to as charges in Queensland were allegations that he has relating to the same period of time of similar conduct by his father. Secondly, to then have him say that he has not - he has spoken to the Queensland police, that he has not made a formal statement and that as far as - and leave it at that your Honour. And that his father has not been charged formally with any offences in Queensland.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I think you’re going a little bit too far. I think it would perhaps would be sufficient if you got them in that, while he’s talking about charges in Queensland, what he says were matters which took place in Queensland or similar nature.  
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL) If he goes into the area of having spoken to the Queensland Police, we cannot possibly … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Exactly, that’s what I’m trying to stop the Crown from doing.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’ll leave that alone your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): But the concession also from the Crown that no charges are pending is important in my respectful submission. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’ll get him to agree that no formal proceedings have commenced in Queensland. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): Well that’s …  
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL (sic)): Well I’ll make that concession.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes I think you could make that concession. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): That formal proceedings are somewhat different to charges. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s correct, I think it would be reasonable to say that, get him to explain that what he meant by charges in Queensland were allegations which he made of a similar nature here and then the Crown could see (sic) that there are no charges pending in Queensland. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): That would … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Does that satisfy both of you? It probably won’t completely satisfy (Appellant’s counsel) but I don’t propose to discharge the jury. I don’t want it undermined any more. 
        
       
       
        
        (APPELLANT’S COUNSEL): Yes certainly but I accept what Your Honour’s saying. The only thing that would satisfy me of course is the discharge of the jury…” 
        
       
       
      
    22    The transcript (T. 131) also records the following, which occurred shortly after the passage to which I have just referred: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. (ZM), a short while ago in answering the question that I asked you, you said that there are other charges pending in Queensland? A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just listen very carefully and I want you to answer this question ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A. Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you referred to charges in Queensland were you referring to allegations by you of similar conduct by your father against you? A. That’s right, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That conduct is alleged to have occurred during the same period as we’ve been talking about in this court room? A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s what you meant by ‘charges’? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS RETIRED 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown concedes there are at this stage no actual charges pending in Queensland. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well there’s been no charge made by the Queensland police against the accused?  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s right, yes your Honour.” 
        
       
       
      
    23    At the commencement of his summing-up, Job DCJ, as might have been expected, gave a number of what one might call the expected directions. 
     
      
    24    When he came to the question of onus of proof, his Honour said (PP, 5-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, the next important direction of law I give you concerns what is called ‘the onus of proof’. Both counsel have addressed you on that, but, nevertheless, I am obliged to give you these directions. This is a criminal trial of a serious nature. The burden of proof of the guilt of the accused is placed firmly upon the Crown. That onus remains upon the Crown in relation to every issue in the case. Now that does not mean that the Crown has to prove the truth of every assertion of every Crown witness.  
        
       
       
        
        What the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt is each ingredient in the various charges. There is no onus of proof on the accused at all. It is not for him to establish his innocence, but it is for the Crown to prove his guilt and prove it beyond reasonable doubt. It is and always has been a fundamentally important part of our system of justice that people tried in these courts are presumed to be innocent of the charge or charges alleged against them until a jury of their fellow citizens has been satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that they are guilty of those crimes. The accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in your minds.  
        
       
       
        
        You do not have to be satisfied that an accused is innocent before you acquit him. If you are unable to decide where the truth lies, even though you feel that he may be guilty, if you have a reasonable doubt about it, you must find him not guilty. I should warn you that suspicion is not a substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion must play no part in your function as judges of the facts. Not even the gravest suspicion will suffice as proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        Now as you were told by the Crown, I think even in his opening, there is one witness who is essential to the proof of the Crown case and that is still the situation. I think he also told you that in his final address. That is, of course, the young man (ZM). You should, therefore, examine and scrutinise his evidence with great care before you decide that a verdict of guilty should be brought in, if at all, and should only find the accused guilty if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the truth of the evidence of that witness.  
        
       
       
        
        Now the fact that I have given you that warning does not mean that I have formed any views as to the honesty or reliability of that witness. It is a warning that would be given in every case where the Crown case depends upon the evidence of one witness.” 
        
       
       
      
    25    A little later, Job DCJ turned to the approach to be taken by the jury to the times which had passed between the occurrence of the matters of which ZM had given evidence and the time when, in 1996, ZM had gone to the police and made his statement. In this regard, his Honour said (pp. 8-9) 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, the young man concerned was between nine and perhaps fifteen at the latest when he left home and the charges that the Crown bring are within those periods of time. He is now, I think the Crown said, twenty-four years of age, he went to the police and made his statement in 1996, so he’s giving evidence about matters that took place some time ago. He is also giving evidence about matters when he was very much younger. It started off, he said, these events, when he was nine.  
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, I am accordingly obliged to warn you that the evidence of a person giving evidence after that period of time being a young man, it may be unreliable. Now whether it is unreliable, of course, is a matter for you. But the matters that may cause it to be unreliable include the gaps of time that have passed and the fact he’s giving evidence about matters when he was nine to fifteen years of age. Consequently, I give you this warning, that you will need to use caution in determining whether you accept that evidence and the weight that you should give to it. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        It will be a matter too, even though I have given you that warning and the fact it is only one witness, you should be looking at the evidence as to whether there is material which supports what the young man said. And you have heard the Crown, he has submitted to you that there is evidence, there is material in the case which does support the young man’s evidence. That again is a matter which will be entirely for you and I will come to that later on.” 
        
       
       
      
    26    Following the morning adjournment, Job DCJ then turned to deal with the question of the use which the jury might make of the evidence of what might be called “the wider sexual history”. In this regard, his Honour said (pp. 11-13): 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, just before I come to the ingredients, I did say to you that the young man (ZM) told of constant sexual abuse over a lengthy period of time. Now I also told you that the Crown must identify specific acts and occasions for each count and it must prove those particular acts and not some other acts on other occasions. That is fundamental to the case. Now that does not mean that you may not take into account some wider sexual history, if it is proved; that is, the evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant. Now you do not do that in order to substitute those other acts or occasions for those charged. 
        
       
       
        
        The history of a wider series of other sexual offence is led for a different purpose altogether. It is important for you to understand what that purpose is. It is to place the evidence of the particular acts which are charged in the indictment into a true and realistic context  
        and 
         where appropriate, to show the existence of what could be called a guilty passion or sexual interest on the part of the accused towards the complainant. Otherwise, a jury such as yourself may wonder as to the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly without any reasons, without any reason without being repeated. 
        
       
       
        
        Now if a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of that kind, you would be entitled to say to yourselves as people of common sense, well really it is very odd for there to be such isolated acts between these persons, which were not repeated or which had no precursor. For that reason you might have cause to entertain some doubt as to the likelihood or accuracy of the witness.  
        
       
       
        
        If however the particular acts charged are placed in the wider context, that is a wider context of an on-going history,  
        and 
         show or tend to show the existence of guilty passion or sexual interest on the part of the accused for the complainant, then that curious feature would disappear.  
        
       
       
        
        Now it is for that reason that the law allows the history of a wider sexual activity to be proved. This is to avoid artificiality or unreality. Now for one or two instances to be artificially isolated and selected for a witness to be confined to those, would make it very difficult for the complainant to proceed intelligently with the evidence. However, I emphasise to you again you must not substitute evidence of any other acts for the specific acts charged. You must not reason on a basis, well this accused may have done some wrong things on other occasions relating to the complainant, and therefore we will convict him on the counts that are charged. The Crown must prove the particular acts in the indictment beyond reasonable doubt. You have the wider history merely to show or to place the evidence into context,  
        and 
         if you think it is appropriate, to show the existence of a strong and guilty passion or sexual interest in the complainant by the accused.”  
        (my emphasis) 
        
       
       
      
    27    Job DCJ then turned to deal with the various charges in the indictment dealing, in the first instance, with the elements to be established in relation to each of those charges, and then dealing with the evidence which had been tendered, on the one hand, by the Crown and, on the other, by the Appellant in respect of each of those charges. In the early stages of his cross-examination of ZM, counsel then appearing for the Appellant had pressed ZM with his apparent failure to complain earlier of the Appellant’s alleged conduct toward him and, as I have earlier recorded, sought to establish that, because of ZM’s resentment of the Appellant’s general conduct toward him, he (ZM) had fabricated his complaints against the Appellant. It is against that background that Job DCJ said, in the course of his summing-up (pp. 31-34): 
     
      
       
        
        “He went down to Sydney and gave descriptions in Kings Cross, Manly and was asked, ‘Have you ever told your mother about any of these incidents’ He said ‘No’. He said ‘I didn’t tell no one’. Said ‘Why didn’t you tell her about the first one?’ He said ‘I don’t know, it was just embarrassing. I didn’t know how she’d take it, I was just a kid then, I didn’t know who to tell like’. He did say later on that he mentioned it to a prostitute he had slept with on his birthday when his mother had given him some money. That he met her and he told her something about it. I think it words something like ‘My father’s sicko, he makes me do sick things’, words to that effect.  
        
       
       
        
        Later one he said when he went away he talked to a few people, like a Community Service Centre, either the Catholic Church or the Community Centre. And members of the jury he obviously went to the police, as we know, otherwise none of us would be here about this now, and made statements to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, he did not make what is called a complaint until many years later. He said the reason for that was because first of all was (sic) under the authority of his father and he did not know what to do about it, but he ran away he said he got onto the drugs, got into rehabilitation at one stage and then he told somebody about it, was asking (sic) what he was doing and he told them what had happened with his father, and they told him he would have to clean himself up first before he did anything about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, it is a matter for you as to what you make of the fact that he did not complain but it is a matter which you should take into account in assessing his credibility that he did not make a complaint until some considerable time later and he did not tell it to anybody in authority until as I said, many, many years later. That is a matter which you must take into account in relation to his credibility.  
        
       
       
        
        So what the defence puts to you is that the delay is inconsistent with those things happening. Members of the jury I am also required to warn you that the absence of a complaint or delaying complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed was false. I am also required to inform you that there may be good reason why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in making or may refrain from making a complaint about this assault. Now you may think that that is all perfectly obvious. There may be good reasons to delay in complaining or for not complaining at all.  
        
       
       
        
        The question for you to consider is whether in this case, the complaint, well there was no real complaint, the absence of complaint is consistent with the allegations or whether they throw doubt upon those allegations. What the young man said well, it was my father, and then he ran away and did not do anything about it and he said, I think in evidence, that he was also reading about sexual assaults and he decided then to complain and he rang up I think Operation Paradox and then later on he did.  
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, you were in Court. You saw him give his evidence and it is for you to judge him. That is what I told you at the beginning of the trial. It is for you to look at the witnesses and assess their evidence. He was cross-examined about that, that he had not gone to the police. He was asked why not? One of his answers was ‘Well I was sort of embarrassed. I didn’t want to go up to some stranger and tell them what happened to me?’ He said ‘Well there was a prostitute’. ‘Yes I know’. ‘She was a stranger.’ ‘Yes’. Well it is for you to consider whether that is a matter as to telling a prostitute would be the same as going to somebody in authority.  
        
       
       
        
        And you also heard the Crown address you on this. The complainant said ‘Why would I make a story up. Waste all this time for taxpayers money and come here and accuse if he was such a good father. Why would I be sitting here at this time mate, you tell me’. Well you have heard the criticism of those answers made by (Appellant’s counsel) as the passion that was involved. And I think it came out perfectly clear to you that he certainly hates his father.  
        
       
       
        
        The young man was cross-examined by (Appellant’s counsel) about his father trying to do the best for him at school but he also made him work, going to the restaurant up till - I think the young man said about 11 o’clock at night. Then when he was at Newcastle working with him at night time in the cleaning business, and the young man said he hated it. Well members of the jury, these are factual matters for you to consider and you will give (Appellant’s counsel’s) submissions the weight you consider that they warrant. That if he was doing poorly at school, if it be the case, and he said it was, the fact that he was going to school and staying up until 11 o’clock at night when aged nine years of age, you perhaps would not think he would be doing particularly well at school.  
        
       
       
        
        However, it is quite clear that (the Appellant) is from a different culture, as you have heard, from us. He is obviously a man you have heard who has worked very hard. And at one stage he did make a lot of money. He also, at Newcastle, again when the boy was still at school, he was taking him at night time to do the cleaning and the boy disliked that. And the submission to you from (Appellant’s counsel) is that you would take those into account because he hated his father so much, that he has made up his mind to make these false allegations. You remember it was, put quite passionately, he said he wants to see him, if you like, pay for what he has done because he said ‘He has been sexually abusing me all these years’. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course members of the jury, it is a matter for you to decide but if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he commit these particular offences, it would be a matter which you could understand the person would be very much aggrieved towards his father.” 
        
       
       
      
    28    Later, when dealing with the Appellant’s case, Job DCJ, at the request of counsel for the Appellant, who had sought a direction as to “the difficulty in testing the evidence because of the delay” said (p. 42): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I did give you some directions about the delay in the complaint. The complainant has given evidence about matters which took place from 1983 to about 1989 so that is some time ago. And the complaints were not brought to the notice of the authority or any complaint was brought to the notice of the authorities until two years ago. And it is fair for you to take into account the matters I told you earlier. But it would also mean that there would be some difficulty in the accused being able to think back as to exactly where he was at the various times these things have happened and perhaps even for the defence to be able to cross-examine the young man about these matters because of their antiquity.  
        
       
       
        
        In this case, what the Crown did call was evidence of things happening on specific occasions and not necessarily able to give the date but lining it up with certain events taking place. Members of the jury of course the accused might find some difficulty in knowing where he was maybe at some particular stage and you must take that into account. My understanding of this and it is no doubt perfectly clear, the accused has denied that he ever sexually interfered with his son at all. Said it just did not happen. So anyhow, they are matters but nevertheless you must take those matters into consideration.” 
        
       
       
      
    29    When he came to deal with the case put forward by the Appellant, Job DCJ returned to the question of onus. In this regard he said (pp. 38-39): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the accused has given evidence on oath. As you have been told he was not obliged to do that. He could have said nothing at all because as I said earlier, it is not for the accused to prove his innocence but for the Crown to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. But by giving evidence the accused became a witness like all the other witnesses. Exactly the same principles apply in evaluating his truthfulness and reliability as apply to the other witnesses. 
        
       
       
        
        I do remind you that by giving evidence the accused in no way altered the fundamental principle as to where the onus of proof lies. It is not for the accused to satisfy you of his innocence, it is for the Crown to satisfy you of his guilty and to do beyond reasonable doubt. “ 
        
       
       
      
    30    Then, having dealt briefly with the accused’s evidence - which was in substance a categorical denial that he had ever sexually abused ZM - Job DCJ drew attention to the evidence which had been given as to the accused’s good character and directed the jury (p. 41) that that fact might be taken into account when they came to assess the credibility of the accused’s evidence and, as well, in determining whether or not he committed the offences alleged against him.  
     
      
    31    Having then inquired whether either the Crown Prosecutor the Appellant’s then counsel sought any further directions as to the facts or as to the law, and having received a negative reply, Job DCJ concluded (p.43): 
     
      
       
        
        “Well members of the jury, I have been much faster than I thought I would be there. The accused said that none of these things happened so you cannot elaborate on that much more than that, he just flatly denies. Remember it is for the Crown to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that they did and you must look at the fourteen specific charges and look at all those separately.” 
        
       
       
      
    32    As I have earlier - para. 3 (above) - recorded, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count in the indictment, following which Job DCJ imposed on the Appellant the sentences which I have earlier - para. 4 (above) - recorded.  
     
      
    33    On 7 July 1998, the Appellant gave notice of his wish to appeal against both his conviction and his sentence.  
     
      
    34    On 18 February 2000 the Appellant gave notice of his wish to rely on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1.  
      Ground 1 
       
       
        
        1.1 The trial miscarried due to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the introduction into the trial of the question of whether there was a motive in the complainant to lie about the allegations; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the failure of the learned trial judge properly to direct the jury in relation to this issue. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        1.2 The learned trial judge misdirected the jury in relation to the motive of the complainant to lie. 
        
       
       
        
        1.3 The learned trial judge failed to direct the jury that it was not for the accused to prove a motive in the complainant to lie. 
        
       
       
      2  
      Count 2 
       
       
        
        2.1 The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of other sexual acts between the complainant and the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        2.2 The learned trial judge erred in his direction to the jury in relation to the evidence of other sexual acts. 
        
       
       
      3.  
      Ground 3 
       
       
        
        3.1 The learned trial Judge erred in failing to discharge the jury on the application of defence counsel. 
        
       
       
      
    35    The appeal came on for hearing on 20 March 2000, on which day Mr. I. H. McClintock appeared for the Appellant, while Mr. C.K. Maxwell QC appeared for the Crown. 
     
      
    36    I turn to deal with the various grounds of appeal which have been raised. 
     
      
       
       
       
      MOTIVE TO LIE 
       
      
    37    It is to be noted, first, that, in contrast to the situation which arose in some of the authorities (see, for example, R. v. Palmer  (1988) 193 CLR 1; R. v. AH  (1987) 42 NSWLR 701), the question “why should the Complainant lie” was not raised by the Crown Prosecutor either in the course of cross-examination of the Appellant (R. v. Palmer  (1997-1998) 193 CLR 1) or in the course of final address (R. v. E.  (1996) 39 NSWLR 450); R. v. Jovanovic  (1997) 42 NSWLR 520; R. v. AH  (1997) 42 NSWLR 702) nor was it, as was the case in R. v. F  (1995) 83 A Crim R 502, a case in which the trial judge described as “the central theme” of the case the question “why would the complainant lie”. Further, it is to be recalled that, virtually from the outset of his cross-examination of ZM, the Appellant’s then counsel accused ZM of having fabricated his evidence and set out to demonstrate - and, one might observe, did succeed in demonstrating - both ZM’s extremely antipathy to the Appellant and many matters which could have founded that antipathy, thus providing himself with a firm basis upon which, in the course of his final submissions, to seek to persuade the jury of the unacceptability of ZM’s evidence. 
     
      
    38    All these matters notwithstanding, it was Mr. McClintock’s submission that, except in those cases in which it can be said that the question “why should the complainant lie” arises in a peripheral fashion, a trial judge should always give a direction of the type suggested by Sperling J in R. v. Jovanovic  supra at 541-542 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “DRAFT DIRECTIONS: 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has submitted that a necessary corollary of the approach in this Judgment would be that, in every case, a trial judge would be bound to give directions to the jury as to how they should deal with the natural question: why would the complainant have made up these serious allegations? That may be so. I do not think the point detracts from the approach to the problem in  
        R. v. E 
        , in  
        R v. Uhrig 
         or in this judgment. But I am happy to take the point head on. If juries require assistance on this point, in order to avoid error in legal principle, then assistance should be provided. 
        
       
       
        
        Guidance may be obtained from the way the courts have dealt with a cognate problem, the  
        Jones v. Dunkel 
         situation. A witness one would expect to be called to answer the Crown case, if the Crown case were not true, is not called. (It is often the accused who is not called.) What inferences may be drawn from this election? Not that the Crown case is true, although that would be the every day conclusion as a matter of commonsense. Directions have been devised to deal with this problem. Warnings have also been given about comments which should not be made: see  
        R. v. OGD 
        . Having to deal with every day methods of thinking which run counter to the necessary rigour of a criminal trial is not novel, as was illustrated by reference to other situations in  
        R. v. E 
         (at 645) and is again illustrated by  
        R v. OGD 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst it may not be necessary to give a particular direction in every case involving complainant evidence, the following would, in my view, be a suitable direction: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It would be natural to ask yourselves why the complainant, X, would make up such serious allegations against the accused. I give you the following directions about that question: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) As you have been told, the essential elements of the Crown case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt or the accused must be acquitted. If the case turns of the evidence of X, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that X has told the truth.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) As you have been told, it is your duty to decide whether you accept the evidence of a witness in whole or in part. X is no exception to that.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) It would be wrong to conclude that X is telling the truth because there is no apparent reason, in your view, for X to lie. People lie for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it is apparent. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes the reason is discovered. Sometimes it is not. You cannot be satisfied that X is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for X to have made up these allegations. There might be a reason for X to be untruthful that nobody knows about.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I provide the following draft direction, not because I am satisfied that such a direction is necessarily required in every case such as the present case, but in order to answer the suggestion that the approach in this Judgment leads in some way to an unmanageable situation in the context of a criminal trial.” 
        
       
       
      
    39    I am unable to accept Mr. McClintock’s submission in this respect, which submission, as it seems to me, is not supported by the authorities. 
     
      
    40    In the joint Judgment of Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Palmer v. R.  supra the following passages occur: 
     
      
       
        
        “Cross-examination is permissible and evidence is admissible to establish that a complainant has a motive to make and persist in false allegations.  
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        In  
        R. v. Uhrig 
         Hunt CJ at CL said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A motive to lie where it does exist is a very relevant factor in judging a witness’s credit. It will almost inevitably have substantial probative value in relation to the issue of credit, and so will pass the test posed by s.103 of the Evidence Act 1995 for admissibility. If the alleged motive is denied by the witness, other evidence may be lead to rebut the denial in accordance with s.106.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It is one thing to permit cross-examination of a complainant in order to elicit, if possible, a motive to lie. It is another thing to permit cross-examination of an accused to show that an accused cannot prove any ground for imputing a motive to lie to the complainant. A complainant knows whether he or she has motive to lie and, as a motive to lie is a fact that may be proved to impeach the complainant’s credit, the complainant may be asked about it. And evidence may be given by other witnesses of events from which such a motive may be inferred. But the fact that an accused has no knowledge of any fact from which a motive of the kind imputed to a complainant in cross-examination might be inferred is generally irrelevant. In general, an accused’s lack of knowledge simply means that his evidence cannot assist in determining whether the complainant has a motive to lie, but if the facts from which an inference of motive might be drawn are facts that the accused would know if they existed, his lack of knowledge could be elicited to disprove those facts.  
        
       
       
        
        If it were permissible generally to cross-examine an accused to show that he has no knowledge of any fact from which to infer that the complainant has motive to lie, the cross-examination would focus the jury’s attention on irrelevancies, especially when the case is ‘oath against oath’. In such a case to ask an accused the question: ‘Why should the complainant lie?’ is to invite the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused.” 
        
       
       
       
      and later: 
       
       
        
        “Nevertheless, as the question is irrelevant to any issue in the case, it ought not to be asked. As Hunt CJ at CL pointed out in  
        R. v. Uhrig 
         the question ‘Why would the witness lie?’  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘invites the jury to speculate … to the conclusion that, unless they are satisfied by the accused that the witness has a motive to lie they should accept the evidence of that witness and to convict. In my view, that danger of such illegitimate speculation is a sufficient reason for saying that the rhetorical question should not be raised in such a case.’” 
          
         
        
       
       
       
      and later again: 
       
       
        
        “It is necessary to distinguish between cross-examination of a witness as to the motive of that witness to lie and cross-examination of another witness designed to show that that witness does not know of any fact from which to infer that the first witness had a motive to lie. The distinction was referred to in the context of a criminal trial by Hunt CJ at CL in another passage from his Judgment in  
        Uhrig 
        : 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘What this Court said in  
          R v. F 
           and in  
          R v. E 
          . should not be interpreted as excluding arguments being put to the jury, by either counsel or the judge, relating to the validity of the motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case. That is so not withstanding that there is no requirement for the accused to prove such a motive, although in many such cases where the evidence of that witness is vital to the Crown case it would be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury that, even if they reject the motive to lie put forward by the accused, that does not mean that the witness is necessarily telling the truth, and the emphasise that the Crown must still satisfy them that the witness is telling the truth. I believe that it is necessary for such a distinction to be stated expressly, in order to avoid skilful advocates attempting to persuade trial judges that a necessary consequence of this Court’s decision in those two cases is that arguments relating to a motive to lie are excluded in every case. That is not a necessary consequence at all.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    41    The present case is, as it seems to me, one which is far removed from those which have been condemned in the authorities to which I have referred, first, since as I have already noted, the Crown Prosecutor did not seek to cross-examine the accused on the subject; second, the defence was conducted on the basis, inter alia, that ZM had a motive to lie; and, third, since, as is clear from that part of his summing-up which I have recorded above (see para. 27) Job DCJ’s reference to the question was little more than a passing reference to that part of ZM’s cross-examination where he (ZM) posed the question in an unresponsive answer to the Appellant’s then counsel and did not amount to any recommendation of the question to the jury as a legitimate process of reasoning to be adopted by them. I would therefore reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
       
      RELATIONSHIP EVIDENCE/TENDENCY EVIDENCE 
       
      
    42    In the absence of the statements which the Crown Prosecutor made available to Job DCJ at the time at which counsel then appearing for the Appellant made the application to which I have earlier (see para. 5 (above)) referred, it is not possible to know to what matters, other than those relating directly to the offences charged, his Honour’s attention was directed, nor is it possible to know for what purpose any matters, other than those relating to the offences charged, were included in those statements. If the evidence which was in fact given by ZM on the hearing before Job DCJ is to provide any guide, then the only material contained in those statements which went to what might be called a general history of molestation and, thus, went beyond the offences charged, was material of the type which I have recorded in paras. 13-14 above.  
     
      
    43    Whatever may have been the material contained in those statements, the passage from the discussion which occurred before the Appellant was arraigned which I have set out in paragraph 9 (above) would tend to indicate that the evidence which the Crown Prosecutor proposed to lead on the hearing was intended to be relied on by him not merely to establish the offences charged but also to demonstrate that the Appellant was a person who had a propensity for committing offences of the type charged. Thus, in the passage to which I have referred, Job DCJ said: “I assume you’ll be saying that this shows what is sometimes called a guilty passion”, a suggestion to which the Crown Prosecutor assented. Further, his Honour’s statement that he was satisfied that the Appellant had been served with proper notice and that he regarded the evidence as being wholly (quaere highly) probative and such as substantially to outweigh any prejudicial effect it might have clearly indicate that his Honour had in mind the provisions of s.97(1)(a) and 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    44    It is the fact that, to the extent to which it went beyond establishing the offences charged, the evidence led by the Crown Prosecutor on the hearing was directed toward proving both the relationship between ZM and the Appellant and, as well, that the Appellant was a person who had a propensity to commit offences of the type charged, and the direction which Job DCJ gave to the jury as to the use of that evidence which forms the basis for the second ground of appeal.  
     
      
    45    In R. v. Beserick - an appeal heard by this Court prior to the coming into operation of the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 - the Court was concerned (inter alia) to deal with the bases upon which, in cases of the type with which we are now concerned to deal, evidence of sexual activity between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the charge or charges in question, was admissible. In the course of his Judgment, Hunt CJ at CL - with whom Finlay J and Levine J agreed - said  supra at 515-516: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true bases for the admissibility of evidence of sexual activity between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the charge were analysed in some detail most recently by this Court in 
         R. v. Wickham 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 December 1991, unreported). The evidence is admissible, first, in order to establish a sexual relationship which makes the complainant’s allegation more likely to be true. The ‘guilty passion’ of the adult for the child which such conduct shows may well make more credible the complainant’s evidence that the sexual activity took place upon the particular occasion which is the subject of the charge. In other words, it makes it more likely that the offence charged was in fact committed:  
        Martin v. Osborne 
         (1936) 55 CLR 367 and 376 (Dixon J);  
        Harriman v. R. 
         (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 631 (McHugh J);  
        B. v. R. 
         (1992) 175 CLR 559, 602, 609, 610-11, 618). Secondly, the evidence is admissible in order to place the evidence of the offence charged into a true and realistic context, in order to assist the jury to appreciate the full significance of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act occurring without any apparent reason.  
        R. v. Wickham 
         provides a very good example of how the act of sexual intercourse which was the subject of the charge would have appeared to be astonishing, and almost unbelievable, if the jury had not been made aware of the existing sexual relationship between the adult accused and the child complainant. Such evidence provides the key to an assessment of the relationship between them and, as such, constitutes part of the essential background against which the evidence of the complainant and the version of the accused necessarily falls to be evaluated:  
        B. v. R 
         (at 610): see also (at 602-603; 605).  
        
       
       
        
        Evidence of sexual activity between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the charge is nevertheless frequently of a highly prejudicial nature, in that in tends to show a propensity on the part of the accused to commit crimes of the nature charged or crimes of a similar nature. Its admissibility has therefore always been subject to the well known discretion in criminal trials to exclude evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect:  
        R. v. Christie 
         [1914] AC 545 at 559, 564;  
        Noor Mohamed v. The King 
         [1949] AC 182 at 192;  
        Driscoll v. R.  
        (1977) 137 CLR at 541;  
        Phillips v. R.  
         (1985) 159 CLR 45 at 51;  
        B. v. R.  
        (at 602, 608, 618). I shall return to the exercise of that discretion later. If the judge declines to exercise that discretion to exclude the evidence of such other sexual activity an explanation should invariably be given to the jury - as soon as the first of that evidence is given and, if necessary, again in the summing up - as to the purpose for which the evidence is admitted, together with a warning to the jury that they must not  
        either 
         substitute evidence of such sexual activity for the specific activity which is the subject of the offence charged  
        or 
         reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong with the complainant on some other occasion or occasions, he must also have done so on the occasion which the subject of the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Neither the relevance of evidence of sexual activity other than that which is the subject of the offence charged (in those cases where that offence is alleged by the complainant to be part of a wider pattern of behaviour on the part of the accused) nor, despite its suggestion of propensity, its admissibility (subject only to the discretion to which I have referred) can now be disputed.” 
        
       
       
      
    46    Although in the course of their separate Judgments in Gipp v. R.  (1998) 194 CLR 106 Gaudron J  at 111-113 and Callinan J  at 168-169 expressed the view that general evidence of sexual abuse on occasions other than those charged is, in the absence of conduct on the part of the defence which raises an issue to which prior abuse is relevant, not admissible unless it has a special probative value which renders it admissible as propensity evidence, that view does not appear yet to command a majority in the High Court. Thus, in their joint dissenting Judgment Gipp v. R., McHugh and Hayne JJ wrote  at 131-132: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge did not direct the jury that, if they accepted that the appellant had sexually interfered with the complainant on occasions other than those charged, they could use that fact to infer that the appellant had committed the offences which the subject of the five counts left to them. The evidence tendered was general in its nature and, as the above passage makes clear, was admitted for the limited purpose of making the circumstances of the specific offences more intelligible. It was admissible because it was evidence ‘as to acts so closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself as to form part of one chain of relevant circumstances’. Counsel might have objected to the generality of the evidence and insisted that the complainant should recite in detail, so far as she could, the times, places and manner of these sexual interferences. But he preferred - what seems to us to have been the better forensic choice - that the evidence of the sexual history should be given shortly and without prejudicial detail.  
        
       
       
        
        If the evidence of sexual history had been directed to specific incidents, although not the subject of charges, the learned judge would have been entitled to direct the jury that if they found one or more of those incidents proved, they could use such a finding or findings as proof of a ‘guilty passion’ in support of the charges in the indictment. In that event, it would have been necessary to direct the jury that these incidents as well as the charges have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        No doubt the evidence of general behaviour, if accepted, proved the commission of other criminal acts. But it was not tendered as propensity evidence. If the evidence had been tendered to prove propensity, it would have required careful direction in accordance with the principles emphasised by this Court on numerous occasions in recent years. Moreover, as  
        BRS v. R 
         shows, if evidence admitted for reasons other than propensity in facts reveals a criminal or reprehensible propensity on the part of the accused, a trial judge must carefully direct the jury as to the use which they can make of the evidence. In  
        BRS  
        McHugh J pointed out: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If the evidence is admitted for a reason other than reliance on propensity, the judge must direct the jury that they can use the evidence for the relevant purpose and for no other purpose. In some cases, the judge may need to be more specific. He or she may need to direct the jurors that they cannot use the evidence for an identified purpose. If the evidence is admitted because the Crown wishes to rely on the accused’s propensity as an element in the chain of proof, it is especially necessary that the judge give the jurors clear directions as to the manner in which they may use the propensity evidence.’” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    47    In the circumstances, it seems to me to be appropriate to proceed on the basis that, in a case such as this, it is open to the Crown to lead evidence, even of a generalised nature, directed towards establishing what was the relationship between the complainant and the accused.  
     
      
    48    The passage from the discussion which occurred prior to the Appellant being arraigned which I have set out earlier (para. 9 (above)) and the passage from the summing-up by Job DCJ which I have set out in para. 26 (above) make it clear, however, that the material as to the relationship between ZM and the Appellant was tendered on both bases, that is, as providing evidence of the context in which the offences charged were said to have occurred and, as well, “if (the jury thought) it appropriate” establishing a propensity on the part of the Appellant to commit offences of the type charged and thus making it more likely that the offences charged were in fact committed.  
     
      
    49    This being so, it seems to me, that it was incumbent on Job DCJ to identify with some care the evidence which was relied upon as establishing the relationship between the parties and to direct the jury that, unless and except to the extent that the incidents the subject of that evidence were proved beyond reasonable doubt, they could use that evidence for no purpose other than to establish what was the relationship between the parties and, in particular, that they could not use that evidence as establishing the Appellant’s propensity to commit offences of the type charge and thus use it as an element in the chain of proof of the offences in fact charged.  
     
      
    50    As the passage from his summing-up which I have set out in para. 26(above) demonstrates, Job DCJ did not identify, except in the broadest and most general terms, the evidence which was put forward as relationship evidence and, perhaps, as justifying a finding of “guilty passion or sexual interest”. Nor, although his Honour did advise the jury as to the purpose for which relationship evidence stricto sensu might be tendered and the purposes for which it might be used, did he direct the jury as to the test required to be fulfilled before relationship evidence might justify a finding of “guilty passion or sexual interest” and then used a step in the chain of proof of the offences charged. In this respect, therefore, his Honour’s summing-up was defective (see also R. v. AH  supra at 708-709 per Ireland J). 
     
      
    51    Although, as I have earlier (para. 31 (above)) noted, counsel then appearing for the Appellant did not seek any further direction from Job DCJ, the fact that, prior to the Appellant being arraigned, counsel then appearing for him sought to object to the tender of any tendency evidence suggests to me that this is a case in which leave to raise Ground 2 ought to be granted and the appeal upheld on that ground. 
     
      
    52    I should add that, during the course of submissions, Mr. McClintock drew our attention to the decision of this Court (Abadee, Ireland and Barr JJ) in R. v. Veitch  [1999] NSWCCA  in which case the Court held that a summing-up which included a direction in terms very similar to those used by Job DCJ in the passage to which I have referred in para. 26 (above)) constituted “a significant error in the conduct of the trial … in that the purpose for which the critical evidence was introduced was not made clear and directions to the jury, appropriate to the established purpose for its introduction, were not given”. The fact that the relevant passage in the summings-up of Coolahan A-DCJ in R. v. Veitch and of Job DCJ in the present case were in such similar terms would suggest that the relevant passage is derived from a form of standard direction to be found in a Bench Book. If this be so, steps should be taken to have the standard direction amended so as to conform with the views expressed by McHugh and Hayne JJ in the passage from their Judgment in R. v. Gipp  supra which I have set out in para. 47 (above). 
     
      
       
       
       
      FAILURE TO DISCHARGE THE JURY 
       
      
    53    Although, in the light of my conclusion in relation to Ground 2, it is strictly unnecessary for me to deal with this ground, it is as well that I do so. In this regard, it is convenient to record what was said by Brereton J in R. v. Ball  [1961] SR 37, 41: 
     
      
       
        
        “This application turns upon the single question whether the learned trial judge wrongly exercised his discretion in refusing to discharge the jury when an allegedly prejudicial answer was given by a Crown witness to a question asked of him in cross-examination by counsel for the defence. There is no doubt that if irrelevant and prejudicial matter be volunteered by a witness and a subsequent application for discharge of the jury be refused, this Court can, and in a clear case will, intervene even though the matter arose in cross-examination by the defendant’s counsel and a matter of judicial discretion be involved. It is, in my opinion, equally clear that if the answer complained of is a direct, proper and unadorned answer to such a question (even though irrelevant) neither the trial judge nor this Court would regard the matter as being any more than an illustration of the rule that it is imprudent for cross-examiners to indulge in fishing expeditions.  
        
       
       
        
        Initially, if allegedly damaging and irrelevant material be volunteered, the matter lies at the discretion of the trial judge. He knows what is being stressed and what is not, he is alive to the temper and the atmosphere of the trial, he can appreciate suggestions and reactions not conveyed by a typed transcript. He is in a much better position than an appellate court to determine what is specious or technical pretext and what is genuine complaint. Therefore, in considering whether or not his discretion was rightly exercised, an appellate court must make due allowance for these factors and must, as far as it can, place itself precisely in the trial judge’s shoes before it interferes. Before substituting its own discretion for his, the appellate court must be clearly of the view, not that it would have exercised its discretion differently, but that the trial judge manifestly exercised his wrongly.” 
        
       
       
      
    54    The passages from the transcript which I have set out in paras. 21 and 22 (above) in my view indicate that, far from Job DCJ’s discretion having miscarried, the course which his Honour took was an appropriate one. In my view this ground has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
       
      I therefore propose the following Orders: 
       
       
      1.  
      ORDER 
       that the Appeal be allowed. 
       
       
      2.  
      ORDER 
       that the convictions and sentences be quashed. 
       
       
      3.  
      ORDER 
       that there be a new trial. 
       
       
       
      
    55    HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Powell JA and with His Honour’s Reasons. However, I would add the following.  
     
      
    56    In paragraph 50, Powell JA said that Job DCJ should have directed the jury to the effect that the jury could only use evidence of incidents other than that the subject of the particular charge under consideration as showing a propensity to commit offences of the type only if, and to the extent to which, they were satisfied those other incidents were proved beyond reasonable doubt. Authority binding on Job DCJ leads to that conclusion. However for reasons set forth in R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 I have difficulty in accepting that that authority is correct. To the references in Le I would now add Pantoja v R (30 November 1999) where the High Court refused special leave to appeal from the decision of this Court holding that motive - a species of circumstantial evidence - need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      
    57    DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Powell JA in draft form. I agree with the orders proposed by Powell JA and with His Honour's reasons except in so far as there may be any conflict with the reasons given by Hulme J with which I concur.

     REGINA -v- Kevin Sean RYAN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I invited Ireland J to deliver the first judgment.2    IRELAND J: This is an application for leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 3    On 6 February 1995 the applicant was charged with demanding money with menaces in contravention of s 99 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence allegedly occurred on 27 January 1995. He was committed for trial on 29 August 1995 and on 1 September 1999 Judge Gibson in the District Court refused an application that the proceedings be permanently stayed.4    It is alleged that on 27 January 1995 the victim, Raymond Henry Page, received a typed letter at his home. The author of the letter stated that he had video and photographic evidence of the victim committing homosexual acts in a public toilet in the Fairfield area. He demanded $6000 not to disclose this and instructions were given as to where the money was to be delivered.5    On 3 February 1995 the victim delivered a parcel to the designated location. Surveillance by police was carried out and on 4 February 1995 a co-accused, Peter Spinks, was arrested in possession of that parcel. 6    Mr Spinks was interviewed and admitted his involvement in the offence in an ERISP. He made a statement adopting his interview and a further statement in June and July 1995. He also gave evidence at the committal hearing. 7    He stated that the applicant, whom he had known for several years, was the instigator of the offence and had asked him to pick up the money. He also said that prior to the letter of demand being given to the victim, Mr Page, the applicant asked him to pick up the applicant's typewriter from an acquaintance, Mr Leonard Gould. Mr Spinks initially gave the applicant his own typewriter. The applicant said it did not work properly and asked again if he would obtain his typewriter from Mr Gould. Mr Spinks did this and gave it to the applicant. He was to receive $2000 for his part in the offence.8    On the first day of the committal hearing, a witness known as WS14 in the Royal Commission into The New South Wales Police Service, a former detective said that an identification of the applicant had been made in the foyer of the court by the victim.9    It is apparent that this aspect of WS14's evidence is the only significant part of the police evidence relied upon in the Crown case. WS14 gave evidence before the Royal Commission as a protected witness and the need for his protection and also his ill health are matters which have contributed to the unfortunate delays in the history of this matter.10    In his judgment of 1 September 1999, Judge Gibson set out the chequered history of appearances in the matter and, for convenience, I will relate them from his judgment, there being no issue as to the sequence of events he refers to, although the precise detail has been expanded in the careful and comprehensive written submissions made by Ms Burgess on behalf of the applicant. At page 1 his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the accused was charged on 6 February 1995 at Parramatta Police Station and it was first listed for trial on 20 November 1995, a period of some eight months, the committal proceedings having finished on 29 August 1995. There then followed a number of occasions on which the matter was before the Court, originally at Campbelltown on 20 November 1995, when the matter was not reached. 
        
       
       
        
        It was then listed for trial on 13 March 1996 and on 14 March the person known as WS14 was found to be involved as a witness in this trial and before the Royal Commission and a medical certificate was produced and that trial was aborted. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, up until that time I think it is fair to say that it proceeded fairly swiftly and that it was in the middle of proceeding to trial when this incident with the witness and the Royal Commission occurred.”  
        
       
      
    11    I continue to cite from his Honour's judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now, it has taken from 14 March 1966 until 7 June 1999 before the matter was again ready to proceed.  
        
       
       
        
        On 9 August 1996 there was a joint application that the trial date which had been set for 23 September 1996 be vacated at Parramatta District Court and the matter be stood over for mention to Sydney District Court due to security facilities needed for WS14, so that the matter was then moved to Sydney. 
        
       
       
        
        On 30 August 1996 it was listed for trial. On 18 November the hearing was to take place. On that date a Crown witness had gone overseas. She was a witness who had been subpoenaed and served with a subpoena to appear. The application for the adjournment was opposed but the Court, in the circumstances, allowed the application. It was stood over to a date to be fixed. It was listed for trial. There was then no date available until early 1997. It was called over on 29 May 1997 and there was in fact no date available between that date and 20 April 1998.  
        
       
       
        
        On 8 April 1998 the trial date of the 20th was confirmed and then it was mentioned again on 17 April in which witness WS14 had had a heart attack and was unavailable to give evidence. He was a witness that was quite naturally required by the defence to be cross-examined and an application was made, whether it was by the defence or by consent or by both parties, that the trial date be vacated because he was unavailable, and it was.  
        
       
       
        
        It was later stood over to a date when there was no appearance by the accused, which appears to have been some sort of mistake because he had appeared on all these other occasions and apparently the appropriate document had not reached him and on 5 June there was a call-over and it was once again adjourned, due to the uncertain health of the witness WS14, to 3 August 1998. 
        
       
       
        
        It was stood over on that date to 7 August 1998 by consent, as I understand it, for mention to fix a trial date, as still waiting for the prognosis and a list of available dates for this witness WS14 and on 17 August it was in the list where, as I understand it, a defence application to stand over and it was stood over to 10 October to fix a trial date.  
        
       
       
        
        On 5 June at Sydney District Court the Court was still waiting for a prognosis in regard to WS14 so it went over until 3 August 1998 and then to 17 August and then to 10 September, for call-over on each occasion.  
        
       
       
        
        On 10 October it was listed for trial an estimate of 10 days and it was listed for mention on 28 May 1999 to confirm the trial date. On that day the accused appeared unrepresented and there was a notice of motion to vacate the trial and stay proceedings which was stood over until 7 June 1999.  
        
       
       
        
        On that day the accused was represented by counsel. An adjournment was applied for because a witness who was missing had gone overseas, not being the witness mentioned before but a different one. The Crown were wanting to, as I understand it, use the provisions of the  
        Evidence Act 
         in relation to his evidence. The accused's representatives said they wanted the witness so that he could be cross-examined, as they were entitled to do, and that, they said, there was also a stay application. So on that call-over the trial date was stood over for mention to 16 July 1999 and the stay application was listed for today (1 September 1999) and on 16 July the trial was listed for 22 November 1999, subject to the stay application in the list before me."" 
        
       
      
    12    His Honour went on to say that he would accept the fact that the delays and the length of time in which the proceedings had been on foot had caused the applicant to be depressed in relation to the problems that he was suffering, being frustrated by the delays of this trial coming on, and he recognised that, in fairness to the Crown, not all of the delays had been brought on by the Crown not being prepared to carry out the duty of prosecution but for other reasons.13    He also made reference to the fact that the death of the applicant's grandmother was not without some significance because of the intention to call her concerning a phone call and the non-connection of an answering machine at a relevant time, which was said to be of some significance. His Honour noted it was unfortunate that this lady was not available to give evidence and that there was no way of proving whatever admissible evidence she could give. 14    That, with respect, is not necessarily the situation. It may be possible, for example, to establish the evidence which this lady would have given by other means. It is perhaps significant that she was seventy-nine years of age at the time of her death and that at the time she died the matter had been listed on at least four occasions. Whether or not there is some documentation of her intended evidence is a matter of which we know nothing.15    His Honour noted that the applicant is a person who is not eligible for legal aid, and that is a matter which has since been resolved in his favour on the documentation which is placed before this Court. His Honour was referred, as we have been, to the similarities which are said to exist with regard to the case of Bradford Fegan Nicholson (1998) 102 A Crim R 459. Those similarities in some regard parallel those in the present case and in that case Smart J, with whom Grove and McInerney JJ agreed, reviewed the principles relevant to a case such as the present and gathered together much of the relevant authority.16    There are certainly a number of similarities. There are, however, some matters of distinction which are significant, apart from the commonality of delay. In Nicholson's case there were five not reached markings, on each occasion the parties being ready to proceed. That in itself is a most unusual circumstance and does not really have application to the present case, where the adjournments invariably were made by consent with, I think, one exception, where the matter was actually marked not reached when everyone was prepared to proceed.17    Significantly, in Nicholson's case, there was loss of an eye witness to the criminal activity, there was a doubtful unsigned record of interview and there was the factor of the impact upon two children, although that did not seem to be a really serious matter.18    At p 463 in the judgment of Smart J, his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is incorrect to regard this case one of mere effluxion of time. I have already indicated some matters which show that more is involved."" 
        
       
      
    19    At p 469 his Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        "" ... the accused may face more difficulties than the Crown especially having regard to the position with Radovan and McInerney."" 
        
       
      
    20    Radovan was the deceased eye witness and McInerney was another witness who was ill and may have been unable to give evidence. His Honour went on to say:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""What has weighed heavily with me is the oppressive conduct to which the accused has been subjected by the District Court and its system. Over a lengthy period the accused has had to prepare for a trial on no less than five occasions and been subjected to 'not reached' markings. The dates of the further trials were fixed a long time ahead. There was no finality. The strain was considerable and it had an adverse effect on the whole family, especially the elder child. The funds of the accused were exhausted and he ended up having to rely on legal aid. He has been put to considerable expense because of the fixing of the trial dates and the 'not reached' markings. The situation was made worse by the accused having to travel from the far North Coast to appear and to answer bail. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not surprising that there is no reported case in which the facts even remotely resemble those in the present case. It is rare for the course of proceedings in a court to give rise to oppressive conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        The additional evidence placed before this Court has highlighted the oppressive conduct which the accused has had to bear. The evidence before the primary judge was not so complete and he did not have as full a picture as we have. Nor did he have the evidence as to the position of McInerney. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence charged is serious and a permanent stay should only be granted in exceptional circumstances."" 
        
       
      
    21    It is essential to recognise, of course, that this appeal is an appeal against the exercise of a discretion on the part of the primary judge. It is trite law that this Court will not interfere with the exercise of a discretion in the absence of error. The error stated to have been exhibited is, firstly, the failure of his Honour to make reference to the strength of the Crown case. Secondly, the unreasonableness of the result itself within the principle enunciated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 and more recent decisions.22    As to the first matter, it is fair to say that in his judgment Judge Gibson did not specifically make reference to the strength of the Crown case. But to say that a judge of the experience of Judge Gibson, because he did not mention it, had not taken it into account is another thing altogether. For my part, I am not persuaded that his Honour did not have this aspect fully in mind. Nor am I able to accept that the result was so unreasonable as to amount to the degree of unreasonableness identified in House v The King.23    I do not in fact identify any error in the exercise of discretion in the Court below as to warrant interference by this Court. I would grant leave but I would dismiss the appeal.24    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the order proposed by Ireland J and with his Honour's reasons. I wish, however, to add some brief observations with respect to his Honour's analysis of the case of Nicholson (1998) 102 A Crim R 459.25    It is important to recognise that there were a number of significant reasons entitling the Court of Criminal Appeal to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the trial judge in Nicholson, reasons which are not present in the current proceedings, as Ireland J has shown. 26    First, his Honour Smart J, when delivering the principal judgment of the Court, identified at p 463 an extract from the trial judge's reasons, in which the trial judge appeared to regard the case as one involving ""mere effluxion of time"". As Ireland J has already indicated in his judgment, Smart J was of the view that that was incorrect with respect to the facts of that case.27    Second, as his Honour Smart J set out at pp 469.10 to 470.1, the evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal was much more complete and provided what Smart J described as a more ""full picture"", with respect to the events that had occurred.28    Third, there was evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal in Nicholson, with respect to the position of a co-offender, McInerney, that was not available to the trial judge in that case at all. McInerney, as appears from pp 460-461 of the judgment, was, if anything, more closely associated with the receipt and delivery of the prohibited substances than was the accused Nicholson himself. No doubt McInerney had been dealt with for the offence, probably in the Australian Capital Territory, where he was arrested. The precise detail of McInerney's treatment does not appear from the judgment.29    What does appear, however, from p 464 is that he was ill. He had a form of cancer and had had radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There was a medical opinion to the effect he should not attend court in Sydney as a witness. Of particular significance was the fact that the Crown had approached McInerney with a view to obtaining a statement or record of interview from him only shortly before the appeal was heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal. As the judgment of Smart J points out at p 464.6, the accused had not determined what he would do in case there was any such interview, because he had only been advised of the position with regard to McInerney as a potential witness on the afternoon of the day before the day the appeal was heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal.30    As his Honour went on to say at p 464 McInerney, together with the other participant in the crime, Radovan, who was by that stage deceased, were the most significant potential witnesses as to the precise participation of Nicholson in the events of that day.31    These are matters of significance which arose for the first time in the Court of Criminal Appeal. In Nicholson they are three matters which have no parallel in the present proceedings.32    For the reasons Ireland J has given, I agree that the circumstances are not such as to warrant this Court interfering in the exercise of the discretion by the primary judge.33    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Ireland J and I agree with the remarks made by the Chief Justice.34    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is leave is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

The principal issue at the trial was identification. The appellant denied involvement in the alleged offence and put forward an alibi which was rejected by the jury. He was sentenced to a minimum term of 2 years penal servitude starting on 2 December 1998 and an additional term of 3 years. 
    5   The appellant complained that the Summing Up was deficient in that it contained no direction as to how the jury should deal with the inconsistent accounts given by him as to his activities on the night of the robbery, that the absence of certain fresh evidence at the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice and that the judge erred in his directions as to identification evidence. 
    6   PB, the complainant was walking along Marion Street, Leichhardt about 8.30pm on Saturday, 14 February 1998. As she approached Cromwell Street a person’s back appeared in front of her and she thought that it was someone putting out their garbage. As he looked a nice, friendly sort of person, she smiled and went to step around him. She said that his whole expression changed and he grabbed her shoulder bag, held a large carving knife above his head and screamed “Give me your bag.” He ripped the bag off her shoulder, turned around with it and ran up towards Cromwell Street. She started screaming to attract attention from the houses nearby and ran after him. He was much faster than her and got a distance ahead of her. She saw him getting into a car on the corner. 
    7   She described the car as white and “just like an old style sedan of some sort”. She could not see the car clearly. She gave this description of her assailant. “He was about six foot tall, quite strongly built, … sort of medium, but solid build and had short brownish hair, Caucasian appearance, Australian accent and sort of casually dressed in t-shirt and jogging pants and runners …” She described the t-shirt as having “some sort of writing, it was white and thin and old and had some sort of writing on it, but I didn’t take in what it was …” Her arm was badly bruised and grazed. Some men came out of a nearby house and helped her call the police. 
    8   The complainant said that when the robber turned around to face her he was less than a metre away. He was in front of her for several seconds and she was looking directly at him. It had just started to get dark and the lights had gone on. She kept her eye both on the appellant and the knife. She had never seen the robber before; he was a complete stranger to her. Her handbag contained, amongst other things, bank and credit cards, about $10 in cash, her cheque book and her house keys. 
    9   On Monday morning 16 February 1998 the complainant attended to obtaining replacement cards and a new set of keys. While at the Mr Minit Shop she told the gentleman who served her some of what had happened. On her second trip to the Marketown shopping centre about 12.15pm she was walking down towards Woolworths when she saw a young man standing outside Woolworths. She immediately recognised him as the man who had attacked her. She went past him and on to the Mr Minit shop where she was getting her keys cut. She remarked to the person behind the counter that she had just seen the man who had robbed her and asked if she could use their telephone to call the police. 
    10   Before telephoning she said, “I’ll just go back and just get a closer look because I want to be absolutely sure.” She walked back towards Woolworths. She saw the man sitting down on the ground and had another look at him. She walked into Woolworths, purchased a carton of milk and walked out again and checked that the man was still there. She returned to the Mr Minit shop and telephoned the police. While they were waiting for the police the gentleman who worked in Mr Minit kept an eye on where the man was as he had moved away from Woolworths. 
    11   The complainant waited in the shop. The detectives came and she accompanied them to Balmain police station. She said that at the shopping centre she noticed that the robber seemed to wearing the same clothes as he wore on Saturday night. At Balmain police station an identification line up was held at the request of the appellant. The complainant identified him from amongst 11 men. 
    12   Upon his arrest and after being cautioned the appellant volunteered that he was in Wollongong on Saturday night. 
    13   The appellant was interviewed at Balmain police station on 16 February 1998 by Constable Kyneur. That interview was electronically recorded. The appellant told the police that he had been with his brother all day working on his car (Q & A 91). He said that he and his brother had left Summer Hill at 7.30pm and had driven to Hilltop and back, a journey of about 200kms. He said that he returned home about midnight and that on that evening he had been wearing grey track suit pants and a blue Nike polo shirt. The appellant also said that he had called into see a friend at Summer Hill at about 9.30pm. 
    14   When questioned about the time that he and his brother left Summer Hill, he said that he and his brother had taken the appellant’s car at about 7.30pm, driven to Blaxland, returned and then taken his brother’s car to Hilltop. He thought it was Hilltop. He seemed a little uncertain of the point where they turned around. He insisted that he had not driven anywhere near Leichhardt on that evening. He stated that he smoked dope (marihuana) daily and had a short memory so that he was not really sure on anything. 
    15   The appellant’s brother in an electronically recorded interview said that at about 7.30pm he and the appellant had driven along the M5 to Liverpool and that they had returned at about 11pm. They had stopped at McDonalds on Liverpool road to get something to eat. The appellant had been wearing a white t-shirt and grey pants. He said that on the Friday before he and the appellant had driven to Blaxland, a journey of about 3 hours return.  
    16   In his evidence the appellant stated that on 14 February 1998 he and his brother started working on their cars about 3pm when his brother got home from work. About 5.30 to 6pm they left home and drove to a chicken shop at Brighton-Le-Sands for dinner. He was not sure when they returned but thought it was roughly around 7.30pm. They then went for a journey in his brother’s car using the M5 motorway to Hilltop, a turn around point. They like driving. The return journey is over 200km. From their home in Summer Hill, Hilltop and return takes about 3 hours. They arrived home about 11pm. Their mother’s friend had left to go to the station to go to his home. At their mother’s request they collected him and drove him to Manly. After which they returned home. The appellant stated that he had driven to Blaxland on the Friday before the alleged incident. 
    17   The appellant explained his change of story during his interview thus: 
     
      
       
       “I’m just not good when I’m put on the spot. Like I need a few minutes to think about what I really, what I have done like I don’t think about what I do throughout the day I just do it, you know. When I’m asked what I did a certain day it’s like, I don’t know I can’t remember.” 
       
      
    18   He also relied on his poor memory and confusion arising out of doing a fair bit of driving. 
    19   The appellant stated that he was trying to tell the police the truth. Since his arrest he had sat down with his brother, discussed matters and worked out exactly what they did on Saturday, 14 February 1998. He denied that he had been involved in the robbery and that he was anywhere near Leichhardt on that day. He said that he went to Marketown on 16 February 1998 to do the family’s weekly shopping with his brother and his mother. 
    20   In cross examination he agreed that he did not visit a friend between 9.30am and 10.00pm. It was earlier in the evening shortly after they had left home to drive to Hilltop. He did not wear a watch and has not worn one for a number of years. He relied very much on his brother to help him with his times. The appellant stated that after he returned from Manly he visited the home of a nominated friend. The appellant and the friend were apparently smoking partners. It was not easy to accept that the appellant could not remember some of the matters about which he was asked, especially those which he mentioned to the police. 
    21   In cross examination the Crown highlighted the discussions in the family. This evidence appears: 
     
      
       
       “Q. You wanted to make sure you got your stories straight, is that correct? 
        
       A. That’s right. 
        
       Q. You didn’t want to come in here and tell different stories to the jury? 
        
       A. Exactly.” 
       
      
    22   The appellant was open about the family discussions which were had and his need to rely upon others for the times and some of the details. There was material on which the jury could take the view that the appellant was sensibly trying to sort out the details of 14 February 1998 and material on which they could take an adverse view. 
    23   Near the end of the cross examination it was put to the appellant that he was the robber. He denied that, saying, “No, I don’t rob people.” The cross examination concluded thus: 
     
      
       
       “Q. I put to you that the reason that you have told a number of stories about your activities that night is because you are trying to cover up what in fact happened in Leichhardt and you haven’t been able to keep your story straight, what do you say to that? 
        
       A. Nothing.” 
       
      
    24   Darren Glen Richard Smith, the appellant’s brother gave evidence that he had been at work from 7am to 3pm, arrived home and worked on his car. He and the appellant drove to Brighton-Le-Sands to get something to eat. They arrived back at their home about 7.30pm. They changed cars and took his car for a drive, stopping for a short period (about 10 minutes) at the home of a friend of the appellant in Summer Hill. He then drove to an area which he now knows is called Hilltop and then returned home. He did not detour through Leichhardt. That journey took about 3 hours. He estimated that he arrived home about 11pm to 11.30pm. Later, when he drove to Manly he passed through Leichhardt. Mr Darren Smith said that he liked driving and went on a long drive every weekend, usually with his brother. Mr Darren Smith said that he was confused and incorrect when he told the police that he went to McDonalds on Liverpool Road to eat that night. 
    25   Darren Smith did not tell the police of the visit to Manly. When asked about what happened after he arrived home from his long drive he gave this evidence: 
     
      
       
       “Q Who was at home when you arrived home? 
        
       A. My mother. 
        
       Q. Did you speak to her once you got home? 
        
       A. I don’t remember. 
        
       Q. Was there anybody else at home that you recall when you arrived home? 
        
       A. No, that’s all.” 
       
      
    26   This evidence cannot be reconciled with the evidence that his mother asked him to take her friend to Manly. Darren Smith told the police that, if he remembered correctly, his brother was wearing a white t-shirt and grey pants. 
    27   Mrs Lily Smith remembered that on 14 February 1990 her two sons were working on their cars. She saw them in the later afternoon. The appellant said he was going for a drive. She next saw her sons about 11pm. She asked them to pick her friend up and take him to Manly. They did so. There were some differences between the mother’s evidence and Darren Smith’s evidence as to where her friend was when the sons arrived home. Mrs Smith had discussed the events of 14 February 1998 with her sons and had tried to recreate what happened that evening. 
    28   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
     
      
       
       “The trial judge erred in failing properly to direct the jury regarding the inconsistent accounts given by the appellant in relation to his activities on the night of the robbery.” 
       
      
    29   Counsel for the appellant accepted that he gave a number of inconsistent accounts when spoken to by the police. Counsel relied upon the general drift of the appellant’s cross examination and the last question asked of the appellant in cross examination and quoted earlier. Inter alia, the cross examination highlighted the changes in his account of what he did on the night of 14 February 1998 and the version he produced after speaking to his brother and mother. It also highlighted that he was questioned be the police only two days after the incident and that then he and his brother had talked about the matter to get their story straight. He could not explain how he got the times wrong when he spoke to the police. It was submitted that the last question in his cross examination was putting to the appellant that he had told a number of inconsistent stories, that some of them must be false, that he has told them to cover up the offence, that he is guilty, that he knows he is guilty, that he knows that the truth will convict him and that therefore he was concocting false stories in order to evade the consequences of his actions. In brief, the appellant was telling lies about what he was doing on the night in question because he knew he was guilty of the robbery. He conducted himself when questioned by the police and subsequently in a way reflective of his guilt. 
    30   The appellant also relied on the cross examination of the brother. The appellant drew attention to the Crown asking him if since the police interview he and his brother had discussed what happened on the night of 14 February 1998 to try and get their stories straight. The brother assented to that proposition. He said that he told his brother what they did that night. The brother was cross examined about exactly what he and the appellant did and where they went on the afternoon and night of 14 February 1998. He was also cross examined about what he told the police. He agreed that there were errors. It was not put to the brother that he was untruthful. The effect of the cross examination was to challenge his reliability and show that he was unreliable. Given the demonstrable inconsistencies in his version of events the Crown did not have to demonstrate that the brother was lying. It sufficed if his evidence was unreliable. The Crown did not go further. 
    31   The appellant has tried to extract too much out of his cross examination which covered the events of 14 February 1998 and the movements of the appellant. The allegation “you have told a number of stories about your activities … because you are trying to cover up what in fact happened in Leichhardt and you haven’t been able to keep your story straight” carries it with the suggestion that the appellant had told lies and that he was attempting to set up an alibi but it goes no further. No one seems to have suggested that the lies should be used as evidence of guilt. 
    32   I do not accept the appellant’s submission that the effect of the cross examination was not to show that anybody was lying and therefore they lacked reliability but to show that the accused had put his head together with his brother to concoct a story to cover up his guilt I would put the matter differently. The cross examination had the simple purpose of demonstrating that the alibi defence had no substance and was based on unreliable evidence, namely, that of the appellant and his brother. It is true that the Crown suggested, in effect, to the appellant that he had told lies and that it also suggested that the appellant relied upon his brother for important details as to times and where they went on the night in question as distinct from other occasions. 
    33   It should not be overlooked that there was but one question in which the allegation was put and that the reply of “Nothing” makes no concession. The truth of the allegation in the question was not accepted. The question contains a number of propositions. It was just left and taken no further. This was probably because the question was argumentative and got nowhere. 
    34   The defence was that the appellant was not the robber and could not have been the robber as he was elsewhere. The Crown was simply endeavouring to demonstrate by its cross examination that there was no substance in the alibi defence and that the evidence in support of it was unreliable. 
    35   The appellant submitted that the judge should have given a warning to the jury about concluding that the appellant was guilty because he had told lies. Further, the judge should have pointed out the possibility of other explanations for the inconsistent accounts and directed the jury that they should not use the inconsistent accounts as positive evidence of guilt unless they were satisfied that they were deliberate lies. 
    36   As no request was made for such a direction Rule 4 applies. 
    37   In summarising the Crown case the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “The Crown reminded you that the accused had given conflicting accounts in his record of interview. First of all he said he had been to Hill Top 7.30 to 12.30, then he said that there were two journeys. One in his own car to Blaxland and then to Hill Top in Darren’s car. And then today he gave evidence that there was only one long journey to Hill Top which got them home between 10.30 and 11 but today, as the Crown reminded you, he referred for the first time to the journey to Manly to take Mrs Smith’s friend home.” 
       
      
    38   While this court does not have a transcript of the addresses of counsel it was apparently never put by the Crown in address that they could or should use the initial oral statement of the appellant to the police and the various accounts in his record of interview as evidence of lies and consciousness of guilt. The judge did not suggest that the jury should do this. 
    39   Even if I am wrong in the view I have taken of what can fairly be gathered or implied from the cross examination and the question I do not think that the jury would have been tempted to reason as the appellant suggested. The Crown does not appear to have put its case on the basis that the jury could rely on the lies as evidence of guilt nor did the judge. The Crown case was simply that the suggested alibi had no substance. 
    40   No competent counsel would have asked the judge for a direction on lies and risked having the judge explain to the jury that if they were satisfied that the appellant had told deliberate lies on material matters and that they were told because the appellant realised his guilt then they could use such lies as evidence supporting his guilt. That would bolster the identification evidence which was under attack. In the present case the jury could have thought, if their attention had been directed to the matter, that the appellant had told deliberate lies on material matters and done so because he realised or knew that he was guilty. Of course, if a direction as to lies were given a further direction conforming with Edwards v The Queen, 178 CLR 193 would be required. 
    41   In the circumstances of the present case the interests of the appellant were best served by no such direction being given. There were inherent difficulties for the appellant in his interview and his varied accounts of his movements. There has been no miscarriage of justice. This ground of appeal must be rejected. 
    42   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
       “The absence of fresh evidence at the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice.” 
       
      
    43   The fresh evidence proposed is that of Donald Mcleod Thomson, Professor of Psychology at Charles Sturt University. In his report of 23 March 2000 he has stated that he has read the two statements of the complainant of 15 and 16 February 1998 and her evidence at the trial. He wrote: 
     
      
       
       “2. Extensive psychological research by research psychologists into eyewitness identification has found the following: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) accuracy in identifying someone previously seen is related to the length of time that target person had previously been observed by the eyewitness; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) accuracy in identifying someone previously seen is related to the lighting conditions prevailing at the time the target person had been observed. A study by Wagenaar & van der Schrier shows that, at night time, even in well lit streets accurate identification is not possible at distances of over 12 metres, in streets that are poorly lit accurate identification is difficult even at 3 metres; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) accuracy in identifying a previously observed target person declines as a function of the time which elapses between observing the target person and attempting to identify that target person; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (d) accuracy in identifying a target person is impaired if that target person has a weapon which is visible and is perceived as threatening to the observer, studies show that the focus of a person threatened with a weapon is on the weapon to the detriment of accurate identification of the target person; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (e) non-target persons may be falsely identified as the target person on the basis of similar features. Features which contribute to false identification include similar clothing. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       3. From the accounts of [PB], the offence occurred sometime between quarter to nine and nine o’clock at night on February 13, 1998 (court transcript, page 6, line 30, page 11, line 15). I note that by quarter to nine on February 2, 2000, it was quite dark. 
       
      
      
       
       4. [PB] stated that her first view of the offender was his back when he appeared suddenly in front of her and that he turned around just as she was about to pass him (court transcript, page 6, lines 40-45, page 12, lines 8-9). [PB] further stated that at this point, the offender made a grab for her bag and held up a large carving knife above his head. The offender ripped the bag off her shoulder and turned and ran up towards Cromwell Street (court transcript, page 6, lines 40-55). 
       
      
      
       
       5. The perceptual conditions at the time the offence occurred, particularly the short period of time available to observe the offender, and the presence of a threatening weapon are conditions which have been shown experimentally to significantly impair accuracy in identifying strangers. 
       
      
      
       
       6. Given that the accused had similar clothes to the offender (T 9.5) there was a significant risk in this case that the accused was falsely identified on the basis of that similar feature. 
       
      
      
       
       7. Given the prevailing perceptual conditions and the similar clothing of the accused the risk of a false identification of the accused was substantial.” 
       
      
    44   The solicitor advocate who appeared for the appellant has sworn that she did not adduce any expert evidence in relation to the identification of the accused because she did not think that any such evidence would be admissible. 
    45   This Court has been provided with copies of the two statements of the complainant and an affidavit from the appellant’s solicitor to the effect that in December 1999 he was alerted by the appellant’s mother to the possibility that Professor Thomson may be able to provide relevant expert evidence. Thereafter, a report was obtained, the first draft being received in early February 2000. 
    46   The appellant contended that the evidence of Professor Thomson was fresh evidence not simply new evidence. It became available well after the trial and conviction of the appellant. The view of the appellant’s legal representative at the trial that the evidence was not admissible was probably based on the common law position. Under the common law, expert evidence in relation to identification is inadmissible because it concerns a matter “within the range of human experience which must be determined by the jury” (Smith v The Queen, per Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, (1990) 64 ALJR 588 at 588F). It was submitted that the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) has expressly abolished the common knowledge rule. Reference was made to the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission 26, Vol 1, para 743. It proposed to “omit the common knowledge requirement and to rely upon the relevance provisions, the discretions to ensure that unnecessary evidence is not admitted. The effect of this will be, for example, that testimony by psychiatrists and psychologists on the behaviour of the “normal” man will, so long as it is relevant be prima facie admissible … In addition relevant testimony upon the dangers of identification evidence under some circumstances … will be prima facie admissible subject to the application of exclusionary discretions.” 
    47   It was submitted that, given satisfaction of the requirements in s 55 and s 79 the fresh evidence was admissible, subject to s 135. This trial started in late November 1998 some three years after the Evidence Act 1995 came into force. The point now under consideration is not one which has attracted much attention. Nevertheless, there is a limit on treating evidence as fresh evidence because it was not obtained due to a misunderstanding of the law. 
    48   It was pointed out by the Crown that similar evidence to that now proposed was available from a Dr Thomson in Smith v the Queen, supra and rejected and that this could have been picked up without much difficulty by a little research into the subject. 
    49   The point at issue is whether the evidence could have been procured by the use of reasonable diligence on the appellant’s part or that of his legal advisers. In Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 517 Barwick CJ said “Great latitude must of course be extended to an accused in determining what evidence by reasonable diligence in his own interest he could have had available at his trial, and it will probably only be in an exceptional case that evidence which was not actually available to him will be denied the quality of fresh evidence.” That statement has been applied in subsequent cases: Lawless v The Queen 142 CLR 659, Gallagher v The Queen 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg v The Queen 167 CLR 259. 
    50   By 1998 practitioners generally were not aware that there were substantial grounds for arguing that the Evidence Act 1995 had superseded the position at common law. Nor were they generally aware of the body of psychological research available as to identification evidence. Some of course would have been. A practitioner would need to be aware of both matters. The reference to Dr Thomson in Smith is a passing one and there is no outline of the evidence which he proposed to give and insufficient detail to assess whether he could give relevant evidence in the present case. 
    51   I conclude that while the evidence of Professor Thomson could have been discovered and obtained with exceptional diligence it would not have been obtained by the use of reasonable diligence. I hold that the evidence proposed to be adduced is fresh evidence, but that is not the end of the matter.  
    52   In Gallagher v The Queen (1985-1986) 160 CLR 392 at 399 Gibbs CJ pointed out that it is not enough that there is a bare possibility that a jury might have been influenced by the evidence to return a verdict of not guilty. The Chief Justice added, “On the other hand it is too severe, and indeed speculative, a test to require that the Court should grant a new trial only if it concludes that the fresh evidence was likely to have produced a different result, in the sense that it would probably have done so.” Gibbs CJ was in substantial agreement with the test proposed by Mason and Deane JJ. 
    53   Mason and Deane JJ said at 400: 
     
      
       
       “It is settled that an appellate court dealing with an application for a new trial on the grounds of fresh evidence has some responsibility to examine the probative value of the fresh evidence.” 
       
      
    54   They continued at 402: 
     
      
       
       “… the ultimate question for decision by an appellate court when considering an application for a new trial on the ground of fresh evidence in the relevant sense, is, as the remarks of Rich and Dixon JJ in  
       Craig 
        indicate, whether there has been a miscarriage of justice at the trial. The appellate court will conclude that the unavailability of the new evidence at the time of the trial involved such a miscarriage if, and only if, it considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant of the charge if the new evidence had been before it in the trial.” 
       
      
    55   The appellant relies on s 80 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides that evidence of an opinion is not inadmissible only because it is about a matter of common knowledge. Section 79 provides that if a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge. The opinion rule is contained in s 76 which provides that evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion is expressed. 
    56   Section 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides: 
     
      
       
       “The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
       
      
      
       
       (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
       
      
    57   The Crown relied upon both paragraphs (a) & (c) and contended that if the proposed evidence were tendered it would be rejected. 
    58   Counsel for the appellant stated that if this Court ordered a new trial and the evidence of Professor Thomson was led, the Crown would be entitled to lead evidence in reply. The Court queried this statement. If the Crown was aware of the evidence proposed to be adduced from Professor Thomson and the complainant was cross examined in chief to the effect that for all or any of the reasons advanced by him her identification was unreliable, the Crown’s expert should be called in the Crown’s case in chief. 
    59   One factor to be borne in mind, but not a decisive one, was that the routine admission of expert evidence in cases where identification was the main issue would lengthen the hearing of these cases and to some extent change the way in which they are conducted. They would become more costly. It would not be a matter of simply giving evidence of conclusions but the basis of those conclusions would require examination. 
    60   There is also the difficulty that while the research materials might point to some general conclusions and to what is generally the position, the question remains whether they apply to the particular case. For example, did the presence of a weapon affect the accuracy of the complainant’s identification? Even though the complainant only saw the robber face on for several seconds and very close to her (less than one metre away) but at night was she able to gain and retain a sufficiently accurate picture of him to identify him with certainty 2 days later. Was she significantly influenced by the similarity of the clothing worn by the robber and the man whom she saw abut 38-40 hours later. Much depends on the person identifying the robber. The complainant insisted that she was looking directly at the robber, could see quite clearly and had no difficulty in seeing him. She said that as a journalist she always took the details in and was consciously thinking that she would have to remember what happened. She denied that she identified the robber by the similarity of his clothing on 16 February 1998. She said that “the immediate thing was the way he was standing and his whole presence.” She mentioned his physical build, his distinctive stance and physical presence. 
    61   The report of Professor Thomson does not capture the strength of the complainant’s evidence and his purported application of stated general research conclusions to her and her evidence goes further than is permissible. He would, however be able to state the results of his research and the general state of learning and answer questions based on assumptions. It would be for the tribunal of fact to decide whether they applied in the present case. That is upon the assumption that his evidence was not otherwise excluded. 
    62   During argument the question was raised with counsel whether the Crown would be entitled if it was aware of an accused intending to lead evidence of the kind given by Professor Thomson to have the observer psychologically tested to assess the effect of a weapon being presented upon the observer’s powers of observation of the robber and then lead the results of such a test. Counsel was initially inclined to think that such evidence may not be admissible as it went to the credibility of the observer. Subsequently, he thought that such evidence was not limited to credibility. It went as well to the central issue of identification and the capacity of the observer to identify the robber with accuracy and certainty. 
    63   I would not leave out of account the experience of the courts which have seen instances of great coolness under stress. I recall particularly this Court’s decision in R v Murray, CCA, unreported, 11 September 1998 where a retired Chief Inspector of Police who was working as a security guard made careful observations of an armed robber in circumstances far more terrifying than those revealed in the present case. The experience of the Courts points to how important it is to look at the particular circumstances and the particular victim. General considerations and research have their value but they do not supplant the particular inquiry and assessment that has to be made in each case. In the present case the complainant insisted that she kept her eyes on the appellant and the knife. She did not feel he would use the knife unless she struggled. She said, that when the incident happened she was “sort of frozen,” it was so sudden and that she did not have time to react except by looking. The re-action comes afterwards. 
    64   For many years the courts have been troubled by issues of identification and directions have been given to juries warning of the problems and dangers. The directions and the warnings have become fuller. For some years judges have been giving directions as to identification in accordance with the instructions of the High Court in Domican v The Queen (1991-92) 173 CLR 555. Juries are warned generally of the dangers of identification evidence in cogent terms and their attention is directed to the particular respects in which the identification evidence in question may be unreliable. The need to examine the identification evidence with special caution is stressed. The matters or topics to which Professor Thomson refers are frequently the subject of warnings from judges but in less detailed and more restrained terms. 
    65   In the present case the judge gave cogent general warnings and stressed the need for special caution when examining the identification evidence because of the possibility that even a completely honest witness may have been mistaken in her identification. The judge directed the jury’s attention to these matters, namely, the appellant was previously unknown to the complainant, the time of observation was only a few seconds, the appellant was holding a knife and whether this focussed her attention away from the robber’s face, whether the shock or trauma was likely to have affected her powers of observation and the light. Later, when summarising the cross examination of the complainant the judge referred to the suggestion put to her that it was the clothes that first alerted her at Marketown on 16 February 1998 and the complainant’s response that this was not so and that it was the appellant’s whole physical presence which she remembered and on which she relied. Counsel did not ask the judge for a direction about the clothing point. No doubt counsel felt that the point had been mentioned and that the complainant’s answer was unhelpful. 
    66   Despite the greater detail, the supporting research and the views of Professor Thomson that the perceptual conditions (the light, the short period of time available to observe the offender and the threatening weapon) and similar clothes are likely to impair the accuracy of any identification the question remains whether the instant identification was unreliable given the evidence of the complainant and her conduct and reactions. More correctly, the issue is whether the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to its reliability. The points have been well and sufficiently covered in the evidence and the Summing Up. 
    67   No jury would doubt that the factors which have been mentioned could affect the accuracy and reliability of the identification and often would. 
    68   The jury had to determine whether there was a reasonable doubt, as a result of these factors, in the present case as to the reliability of the identification. I accept that questions of fact are for the jury not the court. However, having regard to the evidence and the circumstances revealed at the trial there is no significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant had the fresh evidence been before it at the trial. This disposes of Appeal Ground 2. 
    69   The Crown contended that the fresh evidence would and should be excluded under s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995. There is much to be said for the view that in the circumstances of the present case its probative value would be outweighed by the danger that the evidence might cause or result in undue waste of time. The leading of such evidence by the appellant and the response to it by the Crown might take a considerable time. The research would have to be investigated and evaluated and tests may have to be conducted. Then attention would again have to be directed to the critical question of the reliability of the identification in issue. 
    70   No general ruling can be given and each case has to be assessed on the merits. In the present case the relevant points were before the jury and they made an assessment and brought in a verdict. In my opinion, the evidence of Professor Thomson if tendered at trial should be excluded under s 135(c). 
    71   I do not accept that there would be no prejudice to the Crown. If there were a new trial witnesses would have to give evidence again and that is usually difficult in an identification case. After a trial witnesses may well try to put matter out of their minds and the details fade with time. There was some delay in having this appeal ready for hearing. The appeal did not proceed as promptly as it could have. The first hearing date of 7 February 2000 was vacated as the appellant sought to obtain a verified report from Professor Thomson. It is unnecessary to take this matter further.  
    72   Appeal ground 2 fails. 
    73   Appeal Ground 3 reads: 
     
      
       
       “The trial judge erred in his directions in respect of identification.” 
       
      
    74   The single complaint under this ground was that the trial judge failed to direct the jury on the potential significance of the clothing worn by the appellant on 16 February 1998 being the same as that worn by him 38-40 hours earlier on the night of 14 February 1998. I have earlier summarised the extensive directions which the judge gave. He did not mention the clothing as being a matter that could lead to a false identification. However, as earlier mentioned he did refer to the cross examination on the clothes and the reply of the complainant. The point was not missed although it was not covered in the conventional way. The answer of the complainant was destructive of the point and re-enforced the reliability of the identification. It is not a matter which the appellant would have wanted repeated. No request was made for a further direction. No miscarriage of justice has occurred. Counsel for the appellant at the trial has stated that she thought that the Summing Up was very fair. It was. 
    75   This ground of appeal fails. 
    76   The appeal against conviction must be dismissed.

     GROVE J : 
       
      This is an appeal against conviction of manslaughter following a trial before Karpin DCJ at Parramatta District Court. After conviction the appellant asked to be taken into account on sentence two offences, respectively of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and breaking entering and stealing. There was also presented against the appellant a second indictment, to three counts of which, charging assault occasioning actual bodily harm, assault and possessing a shortened firearm, the appellant pleaded guilty. These pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown in discharge of all counts in that indictment. Karpin DCJ dealt with both indictments and the matters taken into account contemporaneously and application is made for leave to appeal against the sentences ultimately imposed. 
      
       
      
     2     
     I turn first to the appeal against conviction. A short summary of facts will suffice. At about 6 am on 2 December 1995 a person engaged in recreational running passed a house in Baulkham Hills and observed a body lying supine in the front lawn with feet pointing towards a carport. Police were called and later a government pathologist Dr Ellis attended the scene. External examination revealed injuries to the face including a small hole in the middle of the forehead and bruising to both eyes, more severe to the right eye.  
      
       
      
     3     
     Dr Ellis later performed a post mortem and established the cause of death as bleeding into the abdomen. He found significant damage in that area which included a frank partition of the pancreas and multiple rib fractures. Dr Ellis expressed the opinion that a significant degree of force would have been required to achieve the degree of damage to the pancreas. Blood analysis showed that the deceased had a blood alcohol of 0.378 per percent. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Police enquiries identified two persons at the house. They were, Miss Patsy Beeken the resident and the appellant. When asked what happened the appellant said “Yeah, Bernie (the deceased) wouldn’t leave when Patsy and I asked him to. He threw a few punches and I threw a few at him”. The appellant gave evidence at his trial. At no time did he dispute that there had been a fight between himself and the deceased. He described exchanging punches inside the house and continued fighting when they went outside. He told police that the last time he saw the deceased he was walking down the driveway, directing verbal abuse back at him. It might be mentioned that, given the injuries which he detected, Dr Ellis had thought it unlikely that the deceased would have lost consciousness immediately. Enquiries revealed he had been involved in a traffic accident and suffered other trauma in the preceding few days. In particular however, the appellant denied that he hit the deceased in the abdominal area. 
      
       
      
     5     
     At the relevant time there had been a party conducted at the next door premises and the trial included the calling of a number of persons present at the party who denied being involved in any altercation with the deceased. For present purposes it is not necessary to trace this evidence. 
      
       
      
     6     
     Whilst it must be acknowledged that the appellant bore no onus of proof, his case was that any blows which he struck in the course of his fighting with the deceased did not include any blow to the relevant body area and thus no blow which was capable of inflicting the damage which was causative of death.  
      
       
      
     7     
     The grounds of appeal against conviction were expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The trial judge erred by failing to direct the jury about self defence. 
         
        
        
         
          2. The trial judge erred in failing to define the meaning of an unlawful and dangerous act. 
         
        
        
         
          3. The trial judge erred by instructing the jury to put out of their minds completely what the appellant’s counsel said about the issue of reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     Where an issue of self defence arises upon an indictment for manslaughter, it is incumbent upon the Crown to negative the issue. The opening address of the Crown Prosecutor was recorded and included a statement to the jury “the Crown says that the act in the course of the assault was unlawful and dangerous and that it was not done in self defence”.  
      
       
      
     9     
     At the close of the Crown case the learned trial judge raised the matter in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: That is the basis of the Crown case. And Mr Watts, I take it that there is no issue of self-defence in this case? 
         
        
        
         
         WATTS: No. The Crown has got to negative that - I think it’s Jones’s case. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: But that’s in circumstances in which it is conceded that the event occurred. It would be hard to see how self-defence arises when what the accused’s case is, that there was a punch by Mr Doorey to which he responded and that was it, and he walked off. Self-defence surely only arises inevitably when the circumstances of the altercation, for example, indicate that the cause of death must have been occasioned during the course of that altercation? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown’s case of course is that the altercation involved a lot more than what Mr Goff is prepared to concede and in any event he raises that he acted in self-defence, although he limits what involvement or what acts he committed. He raised it with the police and self-defence is something I think, both in manslaughter and murder that -- 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: I’m sorry, Mr Watt, you mutter as you look down and I can’t hear a word you’re saying. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Self-defence is, as I understand it, effectively an element that the Crown must negative. I am thinking of the case of Jones and Justice Hunt’s model directions in relation to murder and manslaughter. Your Honour is probably familiar with it but would your Honour be assisted by it? 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: I fail to see that it arises - I mean, one has to be careful not to simply give rote directions in every trial when you are looking at different facts. Anyway, hand me up the copy and I’ll have another look at it but I –” 
         
        
       
      
     10     
      And after some discussion on another matter her Honour returned to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Mr Watts, just on this issue of self-defence. It still seems to me it doesn’t matter. I can’t see how it arises. Although the Crown suggests it does I can’t see how it possibly does. … (not transcribable)…..looking at a totally separate incident. It couldn’t possibly arise in these circumstances. 
         
        
        
         
         WATT: I don’t want a self-defence direction your Honour. I think it would be confusing to the jury.” 
         
        
       
      
     11     
     The issue of self defence did not arise upon the case as being fought by the appellant. His case was that he struck no blow to the body which could have been causative of the damage which ultimately led to death. Nevertheless there was evidence that there had occurred, what was described in various terms including fight and scuffle, and the witness Ms Beeken described both men as falling in the course of struggle. In determining that the issue of self defence did not arise it was overlooked that the jury may not accept the version being advanced by the appellant and they would then be required to consider all the evidence which included testimony by both the appellant and Ms Beeken that it was the deceased who commenced the altercation by punching the appellant. With respect to the contrary view of the learned trial judge, it was essential that the jury consider and reject self defence (to the necessary standard) before they could return a guilty verdict. 
      
       
      
     12     
     It was the duty therefore of the trial judge to give the jury directions which would enable them to consider this alternative to the case being advanced on behalf of the appellant. There is ample authority that the conduct of counsel cannot relieve a trial judge of the duty to give such directions.  
      
       
      
     13     
     In  
     Pemble v The Queen 
      1971 124 CLR 107 Barwick CJ referred to the course which counsel may see fit to take and observed that in that case: 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be raised: he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to matters he did raise. However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury upon the evidence, could find for the accused”. 
         
        
        
       In the same case Menzies J wrote: 
        
        
         
         “Moreover, counsel for the defence cannot effectively disclaim a defence open to the accused upon the evidence. The judge must submit that defence to the jury. Even less can counsel concede a matter of law to the disadvantage of the accused”. 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     The approach has been affirmed in subsequent cases  
     R v Galambos 
      1980 2 A Crim R 388;  
     R v Stokes and Difford 
      1990 51 A Crim R 25;  
     R v Lawson and Forsythe 
      1986 VR 515. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The transcript extracts to which I have adverted in the present case make it clear that it was the view of the Crown Prosecutor that directions concerning self defence were required and I consider that his view was correct. The ground of appeal should be upheld. 
      
       
      
     16     
     In that circumstance it will suffice to deal briefly with the other grounds. There was no explanation in the charge to the jury of the meaning or ambit of the expression “unlawful and dangerous” act. Given the evidence that the damage to the body of the deceased required blows of the severity mentioned by Dr Ellis it would not in my view lead to a quashing of the conviction if there was an omission to tell the jury that the blow or blows which caused such damage had to be such that a reasonable person in the position of the then accused would have realised that by such act or acts the victim was being exposed to appreciable risk of serious injury. There was, however, a requirement that there be given a definition of unlawful and this is simply confirmatory of the need for a direction on the issue of self defence, because an act done in self defence is not unlawful and that was an issue which did arise in the context of the evidence. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Ground 3 has reference to a note which was received from the jury during the course of their deliberations. The transcript shows that the learned trial judge passed the note to counsel, as was requisite in relation to any matter upon which it may be relevant to hear submissions. It would appear that, unfortunately, her Honour did not invite submissions before she proceeded to respond in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Members of the jury, thank you for your note which I have and which will be Marked for Identification 7. I will just read that onto the record. It says, 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           with reference to the term ‘reasonable doubt’ could her Honour give some guidance on the degree of reason which may be applied. Should ‘reasonable doubt’ be interpreted in any way as any doubt? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         I suppose the simple answer to that last is, ‘No’. I said to you yesterday, as both counsel have said to you, that I am the Judge of the law and you should take the law as I tell you. I said to you yesterday, without defining what it was that had troubled me, that I did not agree with something that Mr Watts had said to you in this regard, and it was what he said to you about reasonable doubt. I would ask you please to simply put out of your minds completely what he had to say to you about this issue of reasonable doubt and listen to what I say to you.” 
         
        
       
      
     18     
     Her Honour continued to affirm to the jury that the expression beyond reasonable doubt conveyed no more and no less than the plain English meaning of the words. No complaint could be made of that part of her response. After the jury resumed their deliberations the transcript continues: 
      
       
        
         
         “WATTS: Your Honour, I would like it on the record, if it is not on the record already, that what I said to the jury were words to this effect, that if they had any doubt that was reasonable they must acquit. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: No, you didn’t. What you said, I’m afraid - and that’s why I took issue with it - they must have absolutely no reasonable doubt; and it is the use of that word - I’m sorry, just a minute, I’ll just find it - they must have absolutely no doubt that is reasonable. It is the use of the words, ‘absolutely no doubt’, which becomes a problem, and I regard it - as I said to you yesterday, I would have preferred that you had just left that alone because I am very much of the view that the words that should be used are the traditional words. But it will be on the record anyway, Mr Watts. 
         
        
        
         
         WATTS: Well the addresses aren’t. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Of course not. I took those words down as you spoke them. 
         
        
        
         
         WATTS: I am content with - I am sure that those were the words that I said, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         WATTS: Thank you.”

     This Court is obviously not in a position to resolve any dispute as to the accuracy of recollection of what was said but what has occurred in this case is a useful reminder of the prudence of compliance with the requirement that, where a jury request for directions or assistance is made, the submissions of counsel should be heard and, if necessary, a ruling given by the trial judge as to what will be conveyed to the jury by way of response. Given that the response to the jury’s enquiry about the meaning of the expression beyond reasonable doubt was not flawed, I would not uphold the appeal on this ground.  
      
       
      
     20     
     Nevertheless, having regard to my conclusions concerning grounds 1 and 2, the appeal against conviction should be upheld and the conviction quashed. The Court has been informed that there had been a previous trial in which a jury had been unable to agree but it is a matter for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion whether a third trial should be held. The basis upon which I am of opinion that the present conviction should be quashed is a procedural defect in the conduct of the trial which led to miscarriage in the sense that the appellant did not have the benefit of the jury being given a direction which may have resulted in his acquittal and I would exercise the discretion of this Court to order a new trial. 
      
       
      
     21     
     The order which I propose necessarily involves quashing of the sentence imposed for the offence of manslaughter upon which were taken into account the two matters to which I have made previous reference. The appellant was arrested on 2 December 1995 and remained in custody until he entered bail on 1 February 1996. He remained at conditional liberty until 24 February 1998 when he was arrested in relation to the matters on the second indictment and he remained in custody until sentence.  
      
       
      
     22     
     On the conviction of manslaughter the appellant was sentenced to six years and six months penal servitude by way of minimum term commencing on 7 January 1998 and expiring on 6 July 2004 together with an additional term of five years and six months. On the second indictment, for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years imprisonment commencing on 12 March 1999 (the date upon which the sentence was imposed) and expiring on 11 March 2001; for the offence of assault to a fixed term of twelve months commencing on 12 March 1999 and expiring on 11 March 2000 and for possessing a shortened firearm to a fixed term of three years commencing on 12 March 1999 and expiring on 11 March 2002. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Expressly conscious of the principles of totality, her Honour imposed sentences on the counts in the second indictment which will be fully subsumed within the minimum term component of the sentence on the first indictment. As that conviction and sentence are now to be quashed, the question arises as to what sentences should be imposed in respect of the matters on the second indictment. It is not possible for this Court to deal with the matters taken into account in the sentence now quashed which was imposed in respect of the first indictment. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The facts concerning the matters on the second indictment were shortly these. At about 5.30 pm on Tuesday 24 February 1998 two couples were engaged in an argument in Toongabbie. The appellant approached and joined in, approaching a victim and throwing a punch at him. This person stepped back but then retaliated by hitting and kicking the appellant. During this altercation the appellant removed a sawn off .22 bolt action rifle from his tracksuit pants pocket which he pointed at the victim and said he was going to shoot him. He later hit the victim on the head and shoulders with the butt of this rifle. It was not loaded at the time. The appellant turned around to bystanders with the rifle and said he was going to shoot every one of them. The victim sustained a minor laceration behind the ear and swelling to the face. Police opinion was that the appellant was affected by intoxicating liquor at the time and they had detected a strong smell of liquor on his breath. 
      
       
      
     25     
     The appellant has a considerable record which includes other convictions for assault occasioning bodily harm and in connection with possessing and causing firearms to be shortened. His prior record gains him no leniency. However, his pleas of guilty need to be taken into account and although it is difficult to perceive any manifestation of remorse for his offences, the appellant is entitled to the utilitarian benefit which the community gains from the pleas of guilty. I would adopt findings favourable to the appellant made by her Honour. It is necessary for this Court, however, to resentence in isolation from the manslaughter indictment and the principles of totality which attached to the sentence in respect of it. 
      
       
      
     26     
     I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances requiring departure from the setting of a non-parole period of seventy five percent of the longest head sentence. Further having regard to the time spent in custody which I have indicated, I would date this sentence from 24 February 1998 when the appellant was taken into custody in respect of the matters on the second indictment. 
      
       
      
     27     
     I propose the following orders: On the first indictment the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
      
     28     
     On the second indictment leave to appeal against sentence is granted and the appeal allowed. The sentence imposed on counts 2, 3 and 4 of the second indictment are quashed. In lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to concurrent terms as follows: on count two, charging assault occasioning actual bodily harm the appellant is sentenced to two years imprisonment to date from 24 February 1998 and to expire on 23 February 2000. I set no non-parole period in respect of that head sentence as it will be subsumed within a later sentence to be imposed and, in any event, is expired. 
      
       
      
     29     
     On count 3 in the second indictment, the appellant is sentenced to twelve months imprisonment to date from 24 February 1998 and to expire on 23 February 1999. I set no non-parole period in respect of that sentence for reasons coordinate with those given for not setting one in respect of the second count. 
      
       
      
     30     
     On the fourth count of possessing a shortened firearm the appellant is sentenced to three years imprisonment to date from 24 February 1998 and to expire on 23 February 2001. In respect of that sentence a non-parole period of twenty seven months is set commencing on 27 February 1998 and expiring on 23 May 2000. The Court orders that the appellant be released to parole on 23 May 2000. 
      
       
      
     31     
     IRELAND J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     32     
     ADAMS J: I also agree with what has fallen from the presiding Judge, but I wish to add an observation of my own. 
      
       
      
     33     
     In dealing with the issues before the Court the learned trial judge repeatedly referred to rational explanations, suggesting that “rational” in the context of “reasonable” meant the same thing. Judgments both of the High Court of Australia and this Court have pointed out on many occasions that the directions which are appropriate in circumstantial evidence cases, especially directions of the kind referred to in  
     Peacock v The King 
      should be used with caution. The clear suggestion of her Honour’s directions in this regard was that the jury should not have a doubt unless they were persuaded it was a rational one. This is a significant misdirection. 
      
       
      
     34     
     In  
     Green v The Queen 
      (1971) 126 CLR 28 at pp 32 and 33 the Court said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “A reasonable doubt is a doubt which the particular jury entertain in the circumstances. Jurymen themselves set the standard of what is reasonable in the circumstances. It is that ability which is attributed to them which is one of the virtues of our mode of trial; to their task of deciding facts they bring to bear their experience and judgment. They are both unaccustomed and not required to submit their processes of mind to objective analysis of the kind proposed in the language of the Judge in this case. ‘It is not their task to analyse their own mental processes:’ Windeyer J. Thomas v The Queen(1). A reasonable doubt which a jury may entertain is not to be confined to a ‘rational doubt’ or a ‘doubt founded on reason’ in the analytical sense or by such detailed processes as those proposed by the passage we have quoted from the summing-up. Yet that is what they were directed to do in this case.” 
         
        
       
      
     35     
     Before an inference can be drawn there must, it is true, be a rational basis in the evidence for the drawing of the inference. However, a reasonable doubt is not an inference in this sense and it is not speculation to consider whether the facts as a whole give rise to particular reasonable possibilities. 
      
       
      
     36     
     This was not made the subject of a ground of appeal. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, I think that it is important to bear in mind what fell from the High Court in  
     Green’s 
      case. 
      
       
      
     37     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, in respect of both indictments will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v CRAIG BROOKES DALLY   JUDGMENT 
     
    1   SULLY J: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with Smart AJ.  
    3   SMART AJ: Craig Brookes Dally appeals against his conviction of manslaughter and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence comprising a minimum term of 5 years 3 months and 13 days penal servitude and an additional term of 2 years. The judge thought that a sentence comprising a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 2 years was appropriate. The sentence imposed reflected that the applicant had spent a total period of 8 months 2 weeks and 4 days in custody prior to his trial. The jury had found the appellant not guilty of murder. 
    4   The case was left to the jury on the basis that it was open to them to find the appellant guilty of murder or manslaughter or not guilty of either. Self defence was raised. The jury were told that it could bring in a verdict of manslaughter if the Crown did not negative provocation or if the Crown failed to prove the specific intent necessary for the crime of murder, but was satisfied that a deliberate act of the appellant had caused the death of the deceased and that act was unlawful and dangerous. 
    5   As at 6 January 1997, the date on which the appellant killed Raymond Marden, the two men shared a flat at 1/590 Elizabeth Street, Redfern. The deceased was the tenant and the appellant paid him for accommodation and food. The appellant was aged 47, temporarily unemployed and divorced. He was five feet seven inches tall and of slight build. The deceased was taller, thick set and of a much heavier build. He had ceased work as a chef because of his diabetes and was in receipt of an invalid pension. Both men had time on their hands. Both frequented the Woolpack Hotel. 
    6   The deceased had a lot to drink on 6 January 1997. He had a blood alcohol level at the time of his death of 0.265 grams per 100mm of blood. The appellant also had been drinking, but not nearly so much. During the course of the day the appellant and the deceased had an argument and a disagreement. The deceased told the appellant that he would not continue to provide food for the appellant, who protested that he had paid in advance. 
    7   The appellant left the Woolpack Hotel about 7 pm and returned to the flat, showered and washed up some dishes. The deceased arrived at the flat about 7.30 pm. In the appellant’s recorded interview, he said that when the deceased arrived home he began shouting “Get out of my house”. The appellant declined unless the deceased refunded the rent paid. The appellant said that he told the deceased to leave him alone. The argument continued with some robust exchanges on the part of both men. 
    8   During the interview, the appellant stated that he went into the kitchen and got “quite a long carving knife.” The deceased kept haranguing and abusing him, and he kept telling the deceased to leave him alone. The deceased came over and started pushing and pulling at the appellant who stabbed the deceased once. The deceased collapsed. The appellant did not see where the knife entered the body. There was a wound to the left front part of the chest above the level of the nipple. The wound passed through the coronary sac, aorta and lung. Death would have followed in a couple of minutes. The appellant said that when he realised that the deceased was in trouble, he (the appellant) telephoned 000 for the ambulance and the police. The tape records the appellant stating that he had put a 12 inch carving knife through the deceased’s heart and killed him.  
    9   The appellant agreed during his recorded interview with the police that when the police entered the flat he said to the police “I did it. I did it.” He was then cautioned. The appellant agreed that he further said to the police at the scene “Yeah I killed him. I stabbed him. I killed him. He’s dead.” He stated “I’d like to know what I’ve been charged with. Probably murder, is it? Is that right?” It is not clear whether the appellant was confirming what he said in the dock area of the police station or was speaking directly to the interviewing detectives. At a later stage of the interview he said “I put a knife in his guts. I’m sorry I did it … that’s all I can say.” 
    10   During the interview the appellant stated that the deceased when drunk was the most obnoxious person whom you could meet. Towards the end of the interview the appellant said “I have nothing more to say. He’s walked in with a big bucket mouth as usual and I put a knife in his guts. That’s all.” 
    11   The appellant stated that he was angry with the deceased. The appellant stated that when he went to the kitchen and grabbed the carving knife his intentions were “Scare him. Just piss off, go away and leave me alone.” The appellant stated that he was never in fear of his own personal safety. 
    12   When asked during the interview what state of intoxication he was in, the appellant replied “Pretty sober”. He estimated that he had had eight schooners of New beer between 10.30 am and 7.30 pm. He agreed that when he left the hotel he felt “all right”. 
    13   During the interview the appellant stated that over a 3 year period the deceased had verbally abused him but had never physically assaulted him. The deceased had, however, pushed him a couple of times. 
    14   The police took possession of the carving knife. It was on the floor behind the front door when opened. The appellant had said that he dropped it after the deceased collapsed. 
    15   Constable C.J. Stevenson gave evidence that at 8.50 pm on 6 January 1996 he was on duty in the charge room area of Redfern Police Station. The appellant, who was sitting in the dock area said: 
     
      
       
       “I called you and did the right thing, but you’re doing the wrong thing. I could have rung you up and said “I put a knife in a bloke’s gut”. You think I’m a horror and a nut. I want my wallet. It’s at Joe’s, the bloke who died. I want you to contact my sister. She’s in Perth. What am I going to be charged with? Yeah, it’s murder. What am I up for? Is it murder?” 
       
      
      
     Constable Stevenson replied: 
      
       
       “Did you kill him?” 
       
      
      
     The appellant responded: 
      
      
       
       “Yes I did. I stuck a knife right in his guts. Of course I’m up for murder. Of course I am. I know he’s dead. I felt for his pulse and knew he was gone. I didn’t mean to do it.” 
       
      
      
     At 8.55 pm the appellant said: 
      
       
       “ 
       I’m 47 years old and that’s the end of me”. 
       
      
      
     At 9.38 pm the appellant said: 
      
       
       “I did a fucking good job on him. 47 years old and that’s the end of me. Will I get life? I did the job. I’m going to get life because of a c---, that f---- c---.” 
       
      
    16   Constable Stevenson was not cross-examined. The appellant, when asked about this during the recorded interview, agreed in substance with the version of Constable Stevenson. It appears from that record that the appellant felt that he could have been handled more gently when he was arrested and placed in the caged police vehicle. 
    17   The appellant’s evidence involved some significant departures from what he had said in his record of interview. He explained that he was feeling very dizzy at the time of the interview. He said that on 6 January 1996 the deceased had been whining and niggling. During the afternoon he had accused the appellant of having intercourse with his de facto wife. The appellant denied this allegation. He said that the deceased, who was upset at having lost his job two weeks previously, became angrier and angrier and eventually ordered the appellant to leave his flat. The appellant declined unless the deceased refunded the two weeks rent paid in advance. 
    18   The appellant said that he left the hotel around 7 pm to 7.30 pm and went to the flat. He started cleaning the dishes in the sink. The deceased came home and grunted. The appellant said that he finished doing the dishes. About a minute later the deceased screamed at him to get out and moved towards him. The appellant said that he saw the deceased’s right hand coming up swinging towards him. He was struck on the bridge of the nose. He was wearing his glasses. He said that he was going down, he was nearly unconscious, with black spots in front of him. His knees went to jelly. The deceased turned around and walked towards him. The appellant said that he staggered into the kitchen and as the deceased kept coming, he (the appellant) ripped open the second drawer and grabbed a pair of something and came back to the lounge room. The deceased took off. The appellant said that he waved, holding the knife at one stage. He said that he was leaning on the half barrel (a writing desk) which was in the corner, with the knife against his chest.  
    19   The deceased went back to his starting point and bent down to pick something up. The appellant pointed the knife and said “No”. The deceased picked up a fly screen from the floor and hurled that at him. It just grazed the appellant’s right shoulder. The deceased ducked to the left to pick up the ashtray but it fell out of his grasp. The appellant attempted to head for his bedroom but the deceased blocked his way. They stood and looked at each other for about two seconds. The appellant started to collapse due to shock with the knife falling as he demonstrated at the trial.. The deceased said “You wouldn’t dare” and charged the appellant who still had the knife pointing. The appellant said that the deceased threw a big right haymaker at him, and he told the deceased to “Piss off, you idiot”. The deceased jumped around like a boxer and came at the appellant again, who had the knife against his chest. 
    20   The deceased threw some punches and engaged in grabbing/wrestling. The appellant said that his arm was fending and pulling. The appellant said: 
     
      
       
       “He came to get down and bouncing back and I felt the knife going into something. He looked up like that and it was out, went into the back of the wall [near the doorway] and sort of collapsed”. 
       
      
      
     It is not easy to follow the appellant’s version because he gave a number of demonstrations while giving evidence which he did not explain in words. 
      
    21   The appellant was unable to recall what happened in relation to the 000 telephone call and what he said. The appellant said that he was a little bit intimidated when he was in the police station. 
    22   The appellant said that he had seen the deceased being violent and aggressive towards other people on a number of occasions. The appellant said that he was terrified when the deceased came at him “after he said hit me or something”. 
    23   In his evidence the appellant said that his broken nose caused him to forget the events he had participated in earlier on the evening of 6 January 1996. He could remember only bits and pieces of his police interview. 
    24   He said that he forgot to tell the police about the deceased hitting him before he went into the kitchen. He corrected his answer to Question 138. That question was “When he picked up the ashtray did he throw it at you?” The appellant’s answer was “No, he put it down. I said ‘You wouldn’t do it’ and I stabbed him”. In his evidence the appellant said “No, it didn’t happen like that. He said ‘You wouldn’t dare’ and then charged me.” 
    25   The appellant could not remember telling the police that prior to the deceased picking up the ashtray he was standing in the middle of the rug and that there were no blows thrown. He added that he had forgotten what had happened. 
    26   The appellant said that the answers he had given to the police as to the knife being on the sink were wrong in that he had forgotten about being blinded by some blow to the face and rooting around in a drawer through linen to get a knife. The difficulty with this explanation was that the appellant had told the police that he had just done the washing up, that the knife was sitting on the sink and that he “didn’t pull it from the drawer.” The appellant said that he was concussed and in shock at the police interview and that is why he made no mention of the deceased hitting him in the face and following him into the kitchen. 
    27   The appellant agreed that on the form signed by him on being placed in gaol he did not refer to his broken nose although there was a provision for him to state any medical problems. He claimed he mentioned it to the nurse. 
    28   As to the appellant’s claims that he was very apprehensive about the deceased, the appellant did not tell the police that in his interview. He described his position thus in the interview: “I don’t know how it was. It was just instantaneous. I just - I just had enough of him you know.” Later in the interview he said “No, I’m never scared of him. I wasn’t even scared of him.”. The appellant struggled to explain away this remark but unsuccessfully. 
    29   The appellant maintained that despite the deceased being a diabetic, very overweight, on an invalid pension and quite intoxicated, he was dancing around like a prize fighter trying to hit the appellant. 
    30   The appellant stated that he did not stab the deceased deliberately but that he pulled the appellant into him and he came onto the knife. He denied that he raised the hand holding the knife and stabbed it down into the deceased. 
    31   The version of events given by the appellant in the witness box contradicted in significant respects that given by him to the police. The version given in the witness box lacked credibility and some of the appellant’s explanations were illusory at best. At no stage did the appellant suggest that he was so intoxicated that it affected his understanding of what he was doing and what was happening. 
    32   The judge directed the jury’s attention to a substantial body of evidence from independent people who knew the deceased to the effect that the deceased’s conduct was unremarkable when he was sober but when he was drunk he had a tendency to become angry and violent. He became argumentative, very boisterous and aggressive. He passed cheeky and unnecessary remarks. His former de facto wife described the deceased as very moody. One minute he could be a really good friend, the next minute an enemy. 
    33   Three of the people at the Woolpack Hotel became aware of the disagreement between the deceased and the appellant on 6 January. Each said that the appellant came over to him and complained about the deceased’s attitude. The bar attendant said that the appellant told her that the deceased was antagonising him. One of the men at the hotel tried to calm the appellant down describing him as “aggravated”. 
    34   There was ample material available to the jury to find that the deceased’s conduct had been provocative or at least not to be satisfied that the Crown had negatived provocation. By their verdict the jury negatived self defence. 
    35   In his final address, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the crux of the case was that about five hours after the killing the appellant gave one version of events to the police and a very different version when he gave evidence. The Crown emphasised that there was only one wound and that there were no other wounds consistent with a struggle. The fatal wound was downwards and thrusting as it travelled through the deceased’s body. This and other features pointed to the version given after the incident as the correct one. The appellant did not say to the police that the deceased had attacked him. Nor did the deceased mention any injuries. 
    36   The Crown contended that the version of events given in Court was cobbled together by the appellant months after the incident to raise the issue of self defence. The Crown submitted that the appellant became very angry with the deceased and intended to kill him. The Crown also contended that even if there was provocative conduct on the part of the deceased it was not such as to cause the appellant to so lose his self control as to kill the deceased. 
    37   Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was the appellant who had provided the bulk of the evidence. He alone knew what had happened. He denied that he intended to kill the deceased or inflict grievous bodily harm. He had telephoned the Emergency Services immediately after the incident. He had asserted at the time, “I didn’t mean to do it”. 
    38   As to the police interview it was noted that for the first part only the audio recording was available. Counsel relied on the appellant’s condition; he was sobbing, many of his answers could not be recorded or could not be understood. The appellant was very upset. He was not in his right mind and could not be expected to think about every detail. 
    39   The appellant contended that there was evidence of a struggle in the flat and that he was injured. It was stressed that the deceased was a large aggressive and drunken man with an abusive tongue. Even on the first version he started abusing the appellant when he entered the flat and was aggressive towards him. Counsel reminded the jury that the iron bar found near the deceased had never been tested for blood or finger prints. It was suggested that this may have been used by the deceased to cause the injury which the appellant received to the nose. The gash bled. Counsel referred to and relied on the appellant’s evidence to support self defence. 
    40   Counsel also submitted that the jury could conclude that the appellant had been provoked, reducing the offence to manslaughter. Counsel told the jury that the judge would also give directions as to manslaughter if the appellant did not intend to kill. These matters were mentioned in passing. In neither address was intoxication on the part of the appellant mentioned. 
    41   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
     
      
       
       That the trial judge erred in directing the jury as to unanimity in respect of manslaughter. 
       
      
      
     No criticism was made of the judge’s directions as to provocation and manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. At SU.76 he said: 
      
      
       
       “It is necessary for your verdict to be unanimous, but it is not necessary that you all arrive at the same result by the same approach or for the same reasons.” 
       
      
      
    42   The judge explained to the jury (SU.77) that if they were to find the accused not guilty of murder and some of them thought that he was guilty of manslaughter on approach A (unlawful and dangerous act) and some thought he was guilty on Approach B (provocation) that would not matter. Their unanimous verdict would be guilty of manslaughter. The judge also explained (SU.77) that any of the possible verdicts could be arrived at for any amount of different reasons provided that the verdict, whatever it be, was unanimous. The judge continued: 
     
      
       
       “So whether the accused is to be found guilty of murder or not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder or manslaughter, all that is necessary is that one of those three results is unanimous. It does not matter how each of you individually arrive at whatever result it is that is unanimous.” 
       
      
      
    43   The appellant submitted that these directions were wrong. There was a fundamental difference between the two types of manslaughter, no specific intent being required in the doing of the unlawful and dangerous act. For members of a jury to be permitted to arrive at their verdict of manslaughter when some found (or may have found) the requisite intent and provocation and others were not satisfied (or may not have been satisfied) as to intent but found an unlawful and dangerous act, involved contradictory reasoning and findings on important elements. The alternate bases mentioned involve materially different issues and consequences, and lack of unanimity on these offended concepts of justice. 
    44   The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed in accordance with Brown (1983) 79 CAR 115 that the concept of a unanimous verdict required that each member of the jury be satisfied that the prosecution had established its case in one particular way. Brown was charged with fraudulently inducing investments contrary to S.13(1) of the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1958, the particulars being that he fraudulently induced four persons to enter into agreements to acquire shares in a company by making misleading statements. Five statements were particularised. S.13(1)(a) provided: 
     
      
       
       “Any person who, by any statement which he knows to be misleading, false or deceptive … induces … another person - (a) to enter into … any agreement for, or with a view to, acquiring … securities shall be guilty of an offence.” 
       
      
      
     What was forbidden was a knowingly misleading statement inducing an agreement to buy shares. A misleading statement was at the heart of the offence. Subsequent cases have attached considerable importance to the form of the section and the core of the offence. 
      
    45   The jury in Brown asked the judge: 
     
      
       
       “If the individual members of the jury find him guilty of different parts of the count is he guilty of the whole count and is the verdict of guilty unanimous?” 
       
      
      
     They were directed that it was sufficient if all agreed that there was a dishonest inducement even if they differed as to the statement in the particulars upon which they relied upon as an inducement. 
      
    46   The English Court of Appeal said: 
     
      
       
       “… where a number of matters are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the offence, and any one of them is capable of doing so, then it is enough to establish the ingredients that any one of them is proved; but … any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly. … they should all be satisfied that the statement upon which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.” 
       
      
      
     It would not suffice if half the jury thought that one of the statements had been proved and the other half thought that another statement had been proved.  
     Brown’s 
      case and its statutory background differ from the present one. 
      
    47   By way of general observation the Court in Brown said: 
     
      
       
       “Different members of the jury may arrive at their conclusions by different routes. Far from invalidating their final conclusion, different approaches which lead to the same result may often be seen as strengthening the verdict. They may be able to say that, whichever way one looks at it, the case is proved. A juror may reach his conclusion by relying upon certain parts of the evidence and having reached that conclusion, find it unnecessary to proceed to see whether he accepts other parts of the evidence.” 
       
      
    48   Brown was considered in Giannetto 1997 1 Cr. App. R.1. At 4 the English Court of Appeal said as to Brown: 
     
      
       
       “The jurors may have been divided as to which pieces of evidence and which arguments they found compelling, but that would be of no consequence provided they all concluded (albeit for different reasons) that one particular statement set out in the charge was misleading, false or deceptive.” 
       
      
    49   In Phillips (1988) 86 Cr. App. R. 18 Woolf LJ adopted what had been said by Hodgson J in the Court of Appeal in More: 
     
      
       
       “It seems to us however that it will only be necessary for us to give a direction on the lines set out in  
       Brown 
        … in the comparatively rare case where it emerges at some stage in the course of the trial, or as a result of a question asked by the jury, that there is a risk of disagreement between the members of the jury as to whether a particular ingredient of the offence has been proved.” 
       
      
      
     That proposition was also adopted by the English Court of Appeal in  
     Giannetto 
      (supra) at 6. 
      
    50   In Giannetto the appellant was charged with the murder of his wife. The Crown’s case was that he had either murdered her himself or he had got someone else to do so. The Court placed considerable reliance on Section 8 of the Accessories and Abettors Act, 1861 which provided that accessories and abettors should be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender. The Court said at pp 4-5: 
     
      
       
       “The effect of that section is that even if the appellant did no more than encourage someone else to kill his wife he was liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender, and where, as here, the prosecution, for good reason, is unable to say whether the defendant did more than encourage, it must be open to the prosecution to invite the jury as a whole to find that at least the defendant encouraged. If the jury does convict it may do so with some jurors satisfied that the defendant was actually the killer, but all will be satisfied that if not himself the killer at least he encouraged and by reason of the statutory provision in the 1861 Act which we have cited no more is necessary to prove the offence. If that approach is correct, then this ground of appeal must fail, so we turn now to consider whether, in the light of the more significant authorities cited before us, the approach which we have outlined can be sustained.” 
       
      
      
     Their Lordships’ review showed that that approach could be sustained. 
      
    51   That Court reviewed a number of English authorities, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Thatcher v. R.  (1987) 39 DLR (4th) 275. Thatcher was charged with the murder of his ex-wife. Alternatively, it was said that he had her killed on his behalf. Section 21 of the Canadian legislation had a similar provision making accessories and abettors liable as principals. Dickson CJC pointed out that Section 21:  
     
      
       
       “had been designed to alleviate the necessity for the Crown choosing between two different forms of participation in a criminal offence. The law stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability.” 
       
      
      
      
     The Chief Justice distinguished  
     Brown 
     , if correct, on the basis that it applies only to the separate identifiable legal elements of the offence. The Court in  
     Giannetto  
     agreed. It also agreed with Lamer J and La Forest J that it was important to examine the facts to see if one possible explanation might not result in guilt. 
      
    52   In Giannetto  at 7 the Court commented: 
     
      
       
       “In an article in the 1988 Criminal Law Review Professor Smith considered the English authorities, and concluded that the principle stated in  
       Brown 
        applies ‘when the prosecution allege more than one factual basis for the crime charged and it is not possible to say “if it was not the one then it must have been the other” ‘ [1988] Crim. L.R. 344. If in any given case the factual basis of the crime charged is in reality coterminous with an essential element or ingredient of the offence then we can accept without difficulty Professor Smith’s formulation, and in relation to the facts of the present case it was possible to say, plainly and the prosecution did say, that if the appellant was not himself the killer, then he instigated the offence.”  
        
         
       
      
    53   In Giannetto at 8 the Court referred with approval to these remarks of Lloyd LJ in Gaughan  [1990] Crim. L.R. 880 (p.7G of the transcript): 
     
      
       
       “Committing an offence as a principal and committing an offence as an accessory are two different ways of participating in the same offence. They are not separate offences.” 
       
      
      
    54   These remarks can be applied to the present case. What is involved is the same offence of manslaughter and two different ways in which it may be committed. 
    55   The appellant relied upon the statement in Giannetto that the jury must be agreed upon the basis on which they find a defendant guilty. It was explained that if the defendant must have committed the offence either as principal or as secondary offender and the jury cannot say which: 
     
      
       
       “the basis on which the jury must be unanimous is that the defendant having the necessary mens rea, by whatever means caused the result which is criminalised by the law. The Crown is not required to specify the means, because the legal definition of the crime does not require it and the defendant knows perfectly well which case he has to meet.” 
       
      
    56   The Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in Clarke and Johnstone (1986) V R 643 at 661 said: 
     
      
       
       “The prosecution case of manslaughter is often put in several ways involving different elements. It has never been the law that, before convicting, the jury must all be satisfied of guilt in the one way.” 
       
      
      
     That statement of the Victorian practice accords with the practice in New South Wales. 
      
    57   The appellant relied upon three Australian decisions to which I shall now turn. In KBT v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 417 KBT was convicted of maintaining an unlawful sexual relationship with a child contrary to S.229B(1) of the Criminal Code.(Q). The complainant had given evidence of various incidents on the farm on which she lived with KBT and his wife. The judge instructed the jury that to convict KBT they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on at least three occasions within the period charged, the accused had, for instance, unlawfully and indecently dealt with the child. He did not instruct them that they were required to be of the unanimous opinion that KBT had done the same three acts each constituting an offence of a sexual nature against the complainant, on the same three occasions. The Crown conceded that such a direction should have been given. 
    58   The High Court held that the essence of the offence required acts each constituting an offence of a sexual nature in relation to the child on three or more occasions. The actus reus of the offence was maintaining an unlawful sexual relationship. Thus a person could not be convicted under S.229B(1) unless the jury is agreed as to the commission of the same three or more illegal acts. KBT is too far removed from the present case to be of any direct assistance. 
    59    Beach (1994) 75 A Crim R 447, was convicted of causing the death of another by the culpable driving of a motor vehicle in that he drove the motor vehicle (a) negligently or (b) whilst under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. The judge told the jury, inter alia, that they could convict if some of them were satisfied that the accused was negligent and the rest were satisfied that he was under the influence of alcohol to the required degree. The Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal but only because of the jury’s verdict of guilt on the second count, namely, causing serious injury by criminal negligence to another person who was injured in the same collision. That was consistent in the circumstances of the accident in which the deceased met his death only with a finding of criminal negligence on the first count. The death and the serious injury arose out of the same accident in which the accused as the driver of the vehicle caused such death and serious injury. The same test of culpable driving applied to the allegation of criminal negligence in the first and second count. 
    60   By way of obiter the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
     
      
       
       “In our view, a very different situation would exist where no such finding could be made. In that circumstance, we do not consider that a verdict of guilty could be properly sustained …. 
       
      
      
       
       We consider that the legislature cannot have intended the injustice involved in the acceptance of a verdict of guilt of an accused of the commission of a serious criminal offence, based upon quite disparate findings relating to the very foundation upon which the verdict rests.” 
       
      
    61   The appellant contended that those remarks applied in the present case and that the findings involved in the two aspects of manslaughter left to the jury involved quite disparate findings. In my opinion, once the jury were satisfied, as they were, that the Crown had negatived self defence, there was a very strong Crown case. In the circumstances of the present case, any juror who was satisfied of manslaughter consequent upon provocation would also have had to be satisfied there was manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
    62   Leivers and Ballinger 1998 101 A Crim R 175 were convicted of the murder of H. They were co-offenders. They complained that the judge had, when the prosecution relied on alternative bases of liability, namely, aiding murder or, participation in common purpose, failed to direct the jury that they should accept one or another of these alternatives in respect of each appellant and that their verdict had to be unanimous in respect of each relevant element constituting this basis of liability. Indeed, the judge directed the jury that they might; 
     
      
       
       “have different points of view in the course of reaching a decision and you may reach the same conclusion by different routes… in the end you must all agree with the verdict which is announced whether it happens to be guilty or not guilty in each instance.” 
       
      
    63   The majority (Fitzgerald P and Moynihan J) reviewed the authorities on unanimous verdicts. At 188 they said: 
     
      
       
       “When more than one basis of criminal liability is relied on against an accused, it is, in our opinion, necessary for the jury to be unanimously satisfied that the requirements of at least one basis of liability are proved beyond reasonable doubt. It will not necessarily be sufficient for some members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of one basis of liability are established and for other members of the jury to be satisfied that the requirements of another basis of liability are established. However, that will be sufficient if the alternate bases of criminal liability do not involve materially different issues or consequences.” 
       
      
      
    64   I would not apply the principle first stated in that paragraph to the case where a person is charged with murder and the alternative verdict of manslaughter is left to the jury and murder and manslaughter are put in several different ways. There are a number of reasons for that view: 
     
      
     (a) There is one offence of manslaughter and it arises out of the one incident despite the different varieties. 
      
      
     (b) Provocation and manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act are frequently not mentioned by counsel for the defence although available, or are the subject of a passing reference. The accused, as in this case, generally prefers to rely on self-defence. The Crown also may not address upon them or do so very briefly. It is the judge who deals with them often explaining that they have not been canvassed by counsel. The judge deals with these matters in a neutral way and often relatively briefly. The main emphasis is upon self defence, or accident or lack of intent. It is a major handicap when the jury and the judge have not had the benefit of useful addresses from counsel on these points. 
      
      
     (c) Even if the judge elaborates on provocation and manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act he has to be careful not to change the emphasis of the trial and the issues for decision. 
      
      
     (d) Trials for murder are complex enough as they are and juries have a difficult enough task dealing with the issue of murder, which is often put several ways, and the issue of manslaughter, which is also often put in several ways. Provocation, especially the second leg of the test (the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm) often causes a jury difficulty. 
      
     (e) Juries are not familiar with the concepts surrounding and involved in the law of murder and manslaughter. Their task should not be complicated but kept as simple as possible. They should not be distracted from their task of bringing in a unanimous general verdict by having to consider whether they are unanimous on provocation or manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The task is all the more complex for a jury because before there can be a conviction for murder the Crown must negative provocation. Manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act usually arises for consideration where the Crown has not established the requisite intent or the evidence falls short of establishing reckless indifference. 
      
      
     (f) It would be unsatisfactory if a jury were agreed that manslaughter should be the verdict but there had to be a new trial because the jury were not unanimous as to whether provocation had been negatived or it was manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The difficulties would be exacerbated if the second jury agreed on a verdict of manslaughter but were not agreed on the variety of manslaughter. 
      
      
     (g) In many instances those members of the jury who were not satisfied that the Crown had negatived provocation but were satisfied as to intent would be satisfied that there had been an unlawful and dangerous act. 
      
      
     (h) It is not the variety of manslaughter but the facts which determine the objective gravity of the offence. Neither variety is inherently more serious than the other. A good example of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act with a very high level of culpability was  
     R. v. Bessant  
     unreported, 20 May, 1998, Smart J. The jury had acquitted Bessant of murder and convicted him of manslaughter, the accused only intending to frighten a family but not to harm them. He discharged a shotgun into a family home from the street. A child inside the house was killed by two pellets which penetrated the security screen and a wooden front door. 
      
      
     (i) The accused is amply protected on sentence by the judge having to be satisfied of the elements, the incriminating facts and any aggravating circumstances beyond reasonable doubt. Further, any findings made by the judge must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. 
      
      
     (j) The suggested requirement would involve a departure from the long established existing practice. There is no good reason to do so and further burden the jury in their difficult task. 
      
    65   These reasons are not dissimilar from those given in R. v. Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. There a bench of five judges of this Court held that while a trial judge has a discretion to question a jury as to the basis of a verdict of guilty of manslaughter, as a matter of practice the trial judge should refrain from asking the jury the basis of a verdict save in exceptional cases. At 379-380 the Court said:  
     
      
       
       “First, to inform the jury, in the course of a summing-up, that they will later be invited to answer a question, or questions, as to the basis of the verdict, may distract them from their task of seeking unanimity on a general verdict, and provoke unnecessary confusion and disagreement as to the basis of the verdict.  
        
         
        
       Secondly, the jury’s response to any such question may be unclear. A response that indicated two grounds of decision might, depending upon the circumstances, indicate that the jury were unanimous on both grounds, or that some jurors adopted one ground, and the remainder adopted another. The response may create more uncertainty than previously existed. 
       
      
      
       
       Thirdly, there may be various possible views of the evidence in a case; different jurors may adopt different views and yet, consistently with their directions, reach a common verdict. To invite them to refine their verdict may be productive of mischief. 
       
      
      
       
       Fourthly, there is a substantial risk that the jury will be invited to make a decision upon which they have not been properly addressed by counsel. The present case provides a good example. Trial counsel never addressed the jury on provocation. Rarely would defence counsel’s address to a jury be expressed in terms appropriate to a plea in mitigation.  
       
      
      
       
       Fifthly, where there are two or more accused the jury might choose to answer the question with respect to one or more and not with respect to another or others. This would be invidious. 
       
      
      
       
       Sixthly, the judge may be embarrassed if he or she does not agree with the jury’s answer to the question. 
       
      
      
       
       Seventhly, where two or more partial defences are advanced, if the jury were to come to a conclusion favourable to an accused on the first defence they considered, they might not consider the other or others; if that occurred, an answer to the question might convey a false impression of having considered and rejected the other or others.” 
       
      
      
    66   These considerations also bear upon the instant ground of appeal. Isaacs involved a slightly different but related point. It is one thing to tell a jury that they must be agreed on the basis of their verdict. It is another to ask them to specify that basis. This is virtually a distinction without a difference. It is highly improbable that the Court in Isaacs would have held as it did if it were not of the view that manslaughter was but one offence and that different sections of the jury could arrive at the finding of guilt by different routes, namely, provocation or unlawful and dangerous act. 
    67   In R. v. Cramp [1999] NSWCCA 324 this Court comprising Sully, Ireland and Barr JJ. further considered the need for unanimity where there were alternative grounds for arriving at the verdict of manslaughter. In that case two varieties of manslaughter were advanced, namely, gross negligence and unlawful and dangerous act. Barr J. who delivered the reasons of the Court undertook an extensive review of the authorities. I will not travel over that ground again. At para. 58 he said: 
     
      
       
       “There is strong authority in this State for regarding as good a conviction, particularly for manslaughter, which might have been reached by alternative processes of reasoning even where the jury have not been instructed that they must all agree about one or other of them.” 
       
      
      
     At paras. 63-66 Barr J. continued:  
      
      
       
       “It states the relevant principle too widely to say that jurors who are trying a case of alleged manslaughter must be directed that, insofar as the Crown case relies upon suggested alternative bases for a finding of guilt, the jurors must be unanimous as to some one or more of the suggested bases before they can return a verdict of guilt based upon that basis or those bases. The relevant principle is still too widely stated even if there be added a rider that such unanimity is not required in a case where the accused must be liable on one or other of the suggested alternative bases, and it is impossible to say which. 
       
      
      
       
       The English, Canadian, Queensland and Victorian cases accord with those that bind this Court. They are highly persuasive and should be followed in this State.  
       
      
      
       
       A distinction is to be made between alternative factual bases of liability and alternative legal formulations of liability based on the same or substantially the same facts. The cases to which I have referred speak about the former. This appeal is about the latter. 
       
      
      
       
       The jury were obliged to consider the whole of the conduct of the appellant for the purpose of considering whether he caused the death of the deceased by his unlawful and dangerous act or by his gross negligence. Each process of reasoning invited by the Crown rested on substantially the same factual basis.” 
       
      
      
    68   For the reasons earlier given, I would reject the contention that in a case of manslaughter the jury have to be agreed on the basis of liability for manslaughter. It is sufficient if all the jury are agreed on a verdict of manslaughter and it does not matter if some travelled the provocation route and others found that there was an unlawful and dangerous act. This accords with the approach that has been taken by the courts over many years. 
    69   In any event in the present case any jurors who were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the deceased or inflict grievous bodily harm, but who were not so satisfied that the Crown had negatived provocation, must have been satisfied that there had been an unlawful and dangerous act. On any view, a knife was presented at close quarters by the appellant to the deceased and the jury rejected self defence.  
    70   At the trial counsel for the accused did not ask the judge to correct, alter or add to the directions which he had given, The judge was not asked to give directions along the lines now contended for by the appellant. I would stress the importance of these points being taken at the trial. It is unnecessary, however, to pursue that matter in the present case. 
    71   I would reject Appeal Ground 1. 
    72   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
       That the trial judge erred in directing the jury with respect to intoxication. 
       
      
    73   The appellant contended that despite the appellant and the Crown not raising the question of intoxication at the trial, there was sufficient evidence of intoxication to require the judge to give a direction. No direction was given or sought as to intoxication and its effect on whether the act was deliberate and the issue of intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
    74   At no stage in either his record of interview or his evidence did the appellant suggest that he was affected by liquor to the extent that the stabbing was not his voluntary act or that he lacked the intent. He did not suggest that his ability to function was affected. 
    75   As earlier mentioned, he estimated in his record of interview that he had 8 schooners of “new” between 10.30 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. He described himself as “Pretty sober” and said that when he left the hotel he felt all right. The appellant was not at the Woolsack hotel from about 11 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. The deceased was there drinking steadily from about 11 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. 
    76   Mr. Wolfgang Blau was at the Woolpack Hotel from about 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. He saw the appellant and the deceased sitting together and drinking. He talked with the appellant who complained about the deceased. Mr. Blau said that the appellant “was quite sober, yeah, yeah, he wasn’t drunk, no.” It appears that apart from briefly greeting the deceased on entering the hotel Mr. Blau did not talk to him, and that he (the deceased) remained seated at another table in the hotel. When asked if he had formed any opinion as to how drunk or sober the deceased was, Mr. Blau replied “Same stage I would say, yeah.” It is apparent that Mr. Blau had little opportunity to gauge the state of the deceased’s sobriety. He made a guess as his answer indicates. 
    77   On the evidence, the issue of intoxication did not arise. The appellant appreciated what he was doing and it could not be said that his capacity to form the requisite intent was affected. The evidence as to what the appellant did made it virtually impossible to contend to the contrary. 
    78   When dealing with “self defence” the judge said at SU 61: 
     
      
       
       “Next, because the question involves this particular accused, you have to take him as he is in terms of his personal characteristics and as he was at the time in terms of his mental state as you find it to have been. Now, his personal characteristics include, for example, his size relative to that of the deceased. The accused’s mental state includes the extent to which he may have been affected by alcohol, for example. A person’s perceptions may be affected by alcohol. You may take that into account in determining whether the Crown has established that the accused did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self defence to do what he did. You are bound to consider whether alcohol may have affected either the accused’s appreciation of the gravity of the threat which he faced or the reasonableness of his response to that danger.”  
        
       
      
     In the circumstances of the present case this was an adequate direction. Indeed, given the evidence, it was a favourable direction.  
      
       
      
     I would reject Appeal Ground 2. 
      
    79   Sentence 
     
     Appeal Ground 3 reads: 
      
      
       
       (a) The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the appellant on the basis of manslaughter by provocation. 
        
       (b) The sentence was unduly harsh and severe. 
        
       
      
    80   The appellant contended that as the judge did not ask the jury for the basis of its verdict, he could not know whether his findings were consistent with the basis of the verdict. Hence the judge should have asked the jury as to the basis of its verdict. This submission is contrary to Isaacs and must be rejected. Isaacs should not be reconsidered.  
    81   It was further submitted that there was a great difference for sentencing purposes between the criminality involved in manslaughter on the basis of provocation and manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. I do not agree. Nor did the Court in Isaacs. This not an area in which discussion in abstract terms is useful. The focus should always be on the particular facts of the case under consideration and what they reveal. 
    82   My study of the evidence has led me to the conclusion that there was ample material to support the judge’s view that this was a case of manslaughter because of provocation. Indeed, any other finding would have been surprising. 
    83   In his challenge to the severity of the sentence, Counsel submitted that the judge failed or failed sufficiently to take into account  
     
      
       
       “* the age of the applicant (49 years at the time of sentencing) 
       
      
      
       
       * the circumstances of the offence namely that the applicant had stabbed the deceased after the deceased, a much taller and bulkier man in comparison with the applicant and who was significantly affected by alcohol at the time, had been verbally abusive and had made threats of physical violence 
        
        
       * the crime did not involve any degree of planning or premeditation 
       
      
      
       
       * the applicant’s background as contained in the various reports showing that the applicant had led an unhappy and lonely life resulting in alcohol dependency and an alcohol abuse disorder (report of Dr Nielssen) 
       
      
      
       
       * the applicant had only one conviction for simple assault some 21 years earlier 
       
      
      
       
       * the applicant’s response in calling triple zero and staying with the deceased after he had stabbed him 
       
      
      
       
       * when he was spoken to by police the applicant was co-operative and made full and frank admissions 
       
      
      
       
       * the offence having occurred on the spur of the moment and arising out of a situation never likely to be repeated, considerations of personal deterrence did not carry as much weight as in the ordinary case.” 
       
      
    84   The judge stated that the jury must have been satisfied that the act of stabbing was deliberate and not done in self defence. The judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant stabbed the deceased deliberately and with the intention at least of causing grievous bodily harm. The judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to kill the deceased. The judge found that the provocative behaviour was the deceased’s verbal abuse and threats of physical violence. The judge did not find - as asserted by the appellant - that the deceased struck the appellant across the nose with an iron bar found at the scene. 
    85   The judge took into account: 
     
      
     (a) The appellant’s background including his parents’ separation when he was young, his rejection by his natural father, and his loss of contact with his twin brother, his unhappy marriage which led to separation from his wife, his decline, his inability to form long term relationships and his only occasional contact with his daughter; his life has been rather lonely; 
      
      
     (b) the appellant is of normal intelligence, does not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder but does have an alcohol abuse disorder;  
      
      
     (c) the appellant is not disposed to violence; 
      
      
     (d) his record contained nothing of significance. (He had received a number of fines for a few minor offences and some driving offences - the last minor offence having occurred in 1987 and the last driving offence in 1984); 
      
      
     (e) the appellant notified the Authorities immediately after he discovered he had killed the deceased and voluntarily and promptly gave the police a full and honest account of what had occurred; 
      
      
     (f) the appellant feels a considerable degree of remorse; 
      
      
     (g) the crime was not pre-meditated; 
      
      
     (h) the appellant is unlikely to commit any similar crime again. 
      
    86   The judge held that notwithstanding these considerations the objective seriousness of the crime compelled the sentence he imposed. I too appreciate the strength of the appellant’s subjective features. The approach taken by the judge was well open on the materials. The objective gravity of the crime was high. I respectfully agree with the judge. 
    87   I propose these Orders: 
     
      
     (a) Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
     (b) Leave to appeal against sentence granted; appeal dismissed.

     FRIDAY 28 APRIL 2000 
      
      
      
      REGINA v. ROSLYN KAY BURKE 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 1 February 2000, Roslyn Kay Burke pleaded guilty to an indictment charging her with the murder of Barry Simmons on 7 October 1997 at Menindee. She stands convicted on that plea. 
    2   The plea was accepted by the Crown in the special and peculiar circumstances of this case as entered solely on the basis that at the time of the act causing death the offender had an intent to cause grievous bodily harm but that the Crown was unable to discharge the necessary onus to show an intention to kill or a foresight of that consequence in the offender at the time of the doing of that act. 
    3   It was accepted by the Crown that at the time of the doing of that act, the offender was subject to a degree of intoxication and that the circumstances overall of the case were such that, although one of the necessary intentional states for the commission of the crime of murder was made out, and accepted by the offender's plea, nonetheless, the crime should not be regarded as culpable as a killing involving an intent to kill even where that killing had occurred in circumstances where the intent was formed, as it would appear it did here, on the spur of the moment and during the heat of an argument. 
    4   Nonetheless, the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty is the offence of murder, not the offence of manslaughter. In that sense, the offence is more serious in criminality. Its particular culpability, however, as will be seen from the facts to which I will turn and the peculiar circumstances of the prisoner, is not unlike the culpability which attaches to serious manslaughters occurring in circumstances of intoxication and domestic violence. 
    5   The offender had come forward for trial on this charge of murder at Broken Hill before Grove, J. and a jury on 12 July 1999. At that trial she had pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. 
    6   At all times she has, by her plea on that occasion and before me, accepted the fact of the killing. The only matter in issue has been her intentional state. That matter is one to which a deal of the evidence presented before me on the plea relates. 
    7   On the occasion of her trial in Broken Hill, her plea of guilty to manslaughter was not accepted by the Crown. The trial proceeded for some 12 days terminating when events occurred requiring his Honour to discharge the jury. Those events are in no way the fault of the offender. 
    8   Although the present plea to the charge of murder was entered on 1 February 2000, nonetheless, it appears accepted that the offender is to have the benefit of her acceptance and recognition from indeed only moments after the killing that she had performed the fatal act. This is not a matter in which the Crown submits that the offender should be deprived of such benefits as would ordinarily flow to her under s.439 of the Crimes Act 1900. It is submitted on her behalf that she should be entitled to the benefits of an early plea insofar as that plea is a recognition of the commission of the offence, or at least the factual elements of the offence and the expression of contrition. I accept that she should be entitled to those benefits. 
    9   In the circumstances of her psychological and intellectual conditions, to which I will refer in due course, I do not regard it as inappropriate that, having recognized the facts of the killing, the issue of her mental state was left to be ventilated at the trial, although now recognized as appropriate to a finding of guilt of the more serious offence. Consequently, I do not consider that the fact that there was a 12 day trial should deprive her entirely of the pragmatic benefit to be associated with a plea which has the effect of saving the community costs. 
    10   Following the entry of the plea, the proceedings before me were by consent adjourned to permit the preparation of submissions and the compiling of written evidence. In addition, oral evidence was called by video link from Broken Hill. 
    11   I have received from the Crown the material by way of submissions and evidence contained in a volume marked Exhibit A; and from the defence material by way of submissions and evidence contained in a volume marked Exhibit 1. That material has included additional certificate material relating to courses completed by the offender in gaol and additional report material tendered today and admitted into evidence. The oral evidence to which I have referred was that of Clarence James Mitchell, the offender's brother, supplementing his affidavit and in particular concerning her prior circumstances, her family, her upbringing and the circumstances of her children. 
    12   The offender is an Aboriginal woman born on 18 July 1970 and is the mother of four children. She is a person who, as will be seen from the material to which I will turn when I come to examine the subjective circumstances, has had a deprived and abused life in remote locations and in circumstances such that she had developed a condition of alcoholism and intellectual impairment. In the circumstances of social deprivation and personal abuse she has experienced, it is not surprising that she had turned to the lifestyle in which she was involved at the time of the commission of this offence. 
    13   The deceased and the offender had, prior to 7 October 1997, been living in a de facto relationship for some months. They had used the deceased's motor vehicle, a Toyota station wagon, which had been acquired only a short while prior, as joint sleeping and living accommodation and for the storage of personal belongings. 
    14   On 7 October 1997, they had been residing in a vacant modest house in Menindee with the permission of the person who was to take up residence in that house. The offender informed that person that she had hidden six cans of Victoria Bitter beer so that she could have a beer later. Subsequently, that person saw the offender with a can of beer at the premises and saw her in the company of the deceased at which time they were behaving affectionately together in the kitchen of the premises. 
    15   Later that evening, the deceased was drinking with a friend, having informed the owner of the local hotel that he would return to that hotel later. The offender was seen at about that time to be drunk, ""charged up"", having had ""a few drinks"". She was enquiring for the deceased. She went to the hotel and was observed to seem annoyed at his absence saying, ""I wish he would hurry up"". Earlier, there had been a telephone conversation in which the offender had enquired of the deceased's friend if she could speak to the deceased, but the deceased, who was present with his friend at that time, did not want to talk to her. 
    16   The offender continued to make enquiries for the deceased, saying at one stage, ""I heard something about 'Snake' and if I find out it is true I'm going to stab the old cunt"". She refused to say what it was she meant. Later, when speaking to another person while apparently drunk, she said, ""He's probably got another woman. I will kick him in the prick"" and other similar things. 
    17   Later, she appeared to be quite happy and referred to the deceased and herself getting married in a few months time. She continued to try to find the deceased, eventually playing poker machines and leaving the hotel some time after 9.30 pm. She was able to use a telephone directory and telephones without apparent difficulty at about that time. 
    18   Some time after her departure from the hotel, at a time when she was ""pretty drunk"" and her conversations apparently disturbed, she referred to the smashing of a window at the house she occupied whilst she was in the toilet and that persons (unnamed) had apparently objected to her association with the deceased. 
    19   She was driven back to the home after leaving the hotel and in that journey said that she had heard something about the deceased that night and if she found out it was true she was going to go off her head and if she did so the whole town would know about it. 
    20   On arrival at the home, a glass panel in the door was found to be broken. The station wagon of the deceased was seen to be parked in the backyard and she was, while she was approaching the station wagon, apparently in a good mood and seeking to talk to the deceased who may possibly have been at that stage in the car. 
    21   It is the Crown's contention that shortly afterwards the offender re-entered the house, removed a knife from a knife holder in the kitchen, approached the station wagon, opened the front passenger seat and stabbed the deceased once in the chest as he was seated in the driver's seat drinking a can of Victoria Bitter beer. The accounts the offender later gave to the police of what happened do not accord with this scenario. There is no direct evidence of that scenario. The deceased was found dead in the car stabbed in the heart in circumstances that are at least strongly suggestive of his having died without moving following the stabbing, as in the opinion of Dr. Bradhurst, who gave evidence at the prior trial and who provided a statement which is in evidence before me. 
    22   Shortly after the offender had been left at the premises she was seen crying in a public telephone box and the emergency services were rung by a neighbour. The police were contacted. 
    23   On arrival of the police at the telephone box, it was found to be empty, but the offender was heard yelling out several times, ""No cunt believes me, I didn't do it"". But when first spoken to by the police when she was seated on a nearby footpath and asked if she was all right, she said, ""I stabbed him, right, I stabbed him, right. You cunts always blame me"". She then ran off and was eventually found nearby. When spoken to at that point she denied having a knife, although the fact of her having a knife was obvious to the police since she had it held in her left hand. She was restrained until she dropped the knife and upon recovery the knife appeared to have blood on the blade. She was arrested and an attempt was made to place her in a police van. Whilst the knife was being locked up in the police van, she ran off but was apprehended after a short chase. 
    24   She then directed the police officer to the house and then told the officer that the man she had stabbed was not there, subsequently leading the officer to a number of different locations within Menindee apparently seeking to show to him where the stabbed man was to be found. 
    25   Whilst in the police van, she called out, ""Follow Poochie, he will take you to Daddy"". Apparently, these remarks were made referring to a small dog which was beside the van. 
    26   Some time later the deceased's body was found, and when the offender was interviewed at the police station she said, ""I stabbed Barry tonight with a knife"". Later, she said, ""I didn't mean to stab him, sweetie. We were talking, okay, up at a friend's place. I didn't mean to do it."". 
    27   When further interviewed at the station, she described her relationship with the deceased as a good de facto relationship with no arguments and contended that whilst she and the deceased were having a bit of a blue, he started ""pissing her off"" so she went to the kitchen and obtained a knife, walked up and stabbed him while he was sitting up in a chair in the kitchen; that she ran to the phone and telephoned the police on two occasions and that the deceased, when she returned on the second occasion, had left the kitchen. She said she could not remember what she had done with the knife, but sometimes when she has too much ""grog"" in her system she blanks out and does not remember. She later said she could remember stabbing the deceased once on the left side of his chest, but did not mean to kill him. She just had a little jab and that was it. She said she just wanted to play a joke, but she went too far. She said that she had not meant to hurt or kill him. 
    28   When it was put to her that the deceased had been stabbed in the car, she insisted the stabbing had occurred while he was in the kitchen. 
    29   A reading of the evidence at the former trial and of the committal statements included in Exhibit A persuades me that the offender's account of having stabbed the deceased in the kitchen is factually unreliable. As I have said, the evidence, and particularly that of Dr. Bradhurst, points strongly to the offender having stabbed the deceased in the car. But, considering the offender's intoxicated and emotional condition, and particularly having regard to her psychological and intellectual conditions to which I will later refer, I do not conclude that she was necessarily lying, having regard to her perspective of events, and particularly because I conclude that, although the deceased was stabbed in the car, it is not possible to conclude that there was not an initial dispute, which commenced in the kitchen and which had not terminated as the parties moved from that location to the location of the car. Indeed, it seems to me that whatever it was that triggered the dispute and wherever that trigger occurred, the stabbing, wherever it occurred, while it was accompanied by the admitted intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and the obtaining of a knife were both in the context of the prisoner's belief that she was engaged in some form of dispute or alcohol induced emotional outburst with or against the deceased. 
    30   There was evidence that the offender may, at an earlier stage of the evening, have contemplated some violence to the deceased, as I have said, but in the light of her intoxication, emotional condition, psychological and intellectual conditions and her obvious mood swings, I am unable to conclude that there was any real premeditation. I accept that her actions and utterances subsequent to the stabbing displayed a considerable degree of irrationality. I am unable to conclude that there was any substantial degree of rationality prior to, or at the time of, the action of stabbing. I conclude that at that time the offender was drunk, although the degree of intoxication was not such as to have precluded the necessary intent sufficient to establish the offence to which she has pleaded and that she was seriously emotionally disturbed at that time. 
    31   Thus, I conclude the evidence does not enable me to find that the killing occurred otherwise than on the spur of the moment during the heat of some dispute, real or imagined on her part, and that, although the intent existed, it was not an intent which had been formed prior to the killing to any great extent or with any real consideration. 
    32   The offender does have a prior record, but that is a record substantially for street offences, malicious damage, assault police and other local court matters extending back some 10 years prior to this offence. For these offences she has received penalties of fines, community service orders and recognizances. 
    33   Her personal circumstances are tragic. There was admitted by consent a document setting out her personal history supported by substantial other material. 
    34   She had been removed from her mother's care at the age of about four and placed at the Home of Compassion at Broken Hill. She had grown up without regular involvement with her immediate or extended family. Prior to that removal she had been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions suffering from gastroenteritis. When the Home closed down when she was about 13, she went to live with her older brother and at about that time commenced to develop alcohol abuse. She finished school at Year 9 and had her first child at the age of 17 years. 
    35   She formed a relationship in 1988 which extended for some years during which time she was viciously and regularly abused physically and sexually by her partner. She had a second child when she was 19 and in 1990 was the victim of an attempted rape. 
    36   She had required, as a result of the relationship with her partner, hospitalization on a number of occasions, including hospitalization for being bashed with an iron bar, being indecently assaulted and being stabbed in the arm. 
    37   She had two more children. Her children were, however, removed from her by the Department of Community Services and placed with the family of her partner. It transpired, however, regrettably, that the children informed the Department that the partner had been sexually interfering with, at least, the girls. At that time the offender ended her relationship with the partner and her cousin died. That death, occurring when it did and in the context of the other matters then occurring, affected her profoundly. 
    38   She reacted to the abuse, the removal of her children, the termination of her relationship and that death by developing acute depression manifested in particular by binge alcohol drinking, living in the streets and sleeping in parks and abandoned buildings. She attempted suicide. She had, during this time, removed herself from her local community to the eastern seaboard. 
    39   After the attempts of suicide, she returned to the Broken Hill area, was the subject of further violence and pursued a lifestyle characterized by abandoned drinking and regular minor criminal misconduct resulting, in particular, in the later offences in the criminal record to which I have referred. She was on numerous occasions transported to hospital by ambulance, after having been assaulted including with a bottle, affected by what may have been petrol or glue sniffing and as a consequence of being found being incoherent or unconscious in the streets. 
    40   She was treated within the Corrective Services system for delirium tremens, and her drinking history documented in about 1996. 
    41   It was in mid-July that she formed a relationship with the deceased, but even during that relationship she had presented to the Menindee Health Service with violence indicating her lifestyle was unchanged. 
    42   That recitation, taken from the personal circumstances of the prisoner set out in the submissions in the material provided by the defence, is not only supported by the references set out in that document to the primary data material also provided, but also by the medical and expert reports that have also been admitted into evidence. 
    43   It is not surprising that it has been submitted to me, and I accept, that the prisoner's personal history reveals a history of unrelenting tribulation and harshness which is most difficult for most people to comprehend. She is a person who has existed in socially deprived circumstances, as was submitted, consigned to a lifestyle of poverty, deprivation and entrenched alcohol abuse in an atmosphere where she is the subject of violence and conditioned to violence as a social response. 
    44   It is not necessary to go so far as to exemplify her life as a direct result of the problems faced by members of the Aboriginal community in the remoter locations of Australia, nor does the evidence on this plea deal with the more general phenomenon of deprivation and dispossession suffered by the Aboriginal community, but it is enough, and the evidence persuades me, that the conditions personal to her of alcoholism, emotional disturbance and intellectual impairment and the deprived lifestyle in which she has been involved are such as to set a context for conditioning her to react in the way in which she did under whatever the emotional stimulus she suffered that night. 
    45   The evidence with which I was provided in relation to her personal circumstances includes a number of reports. The report of Dr. Robert McMurdo, psychiatrist, concludes that the prisoner had been the subject of alcohol dependency and abuse over several years and refers to alcoholic amnesia episodes and the impulsive stabbing of the deceased whilst the offender was in a state of alcoholic disinhibition. 
    46   The report of Julie Hendie, clinical and consulting neuropsychologist, established that the offender was a person of limited intellectual abilities with an IQ within the lower limit of the borderline of the intellectually impaired range. Her IQ falls within a band that has its lower limit in the upper end of the mentally retarded level and its upper limit in the middle of the borderline range. 
    47   Although there were no specific features which would suggest brain damage, the general consistency and results are supportive of the views that those figures represent the offender's natural abilities. However, she has sustained a number of insults to the head and has spent the past 15 years abusing alcohol and therefore Miss Hendie concludes that she is someone whose natural levels of functioning would have been in the lower normal to upper borderline range but that because of her life and tragic circumstances has suffered that downgrading of abilities. Miss Hendie would not expect that were the prisoner to abandon alcohol, there would be an improvement. 
    48   Dr. John Couter Smartt, psychiatrist, referred to the extent to which abuse of alcohol has affected the prisoner and the tragic circumstances of her prior life. He points out that there must be serious doubt in her circumstances, taking into account the limited intellectual capacity, intoxication and disturbed emotional circumstances, of how fully she would have appreciated what it was she was doing that night when she stabbed the deceased. That material is material which, when taken in conjunction with her subjective circumstances, leads me to consider that the objective circumstances of the offence must be regarded as less serious than one would otherwise expect for a deliberate stabbing performed with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 
    49   The circumstances of the case are such that both the Crown and the offender's counsel have referred me to the principles in Regina Fernando (1992) 76 A. Crim. R. 58 at 62-63 and remarks made by other justices of this court in other decisions when coming to sentence persons who have been the subject of lives as appallingly damaged as hers has been. I will apply those principles in respect of the head sentence and the non-parole period I determine. 
    50   There is no doubt of her contrition, remorse and distress. 
    51   There is no doubt that in her circumstances a long custodial sentence, particularly in the absence of her children who, however, are brought, in the case of two of them, in particular, immense distances to visit her at Broken Hill, will be more than unusually onerous for her. There is no doubt that she can enjoy some degree of support and assistance from her community and her family were she to be retained in a Corrective Services establishment at Broken Hill and that it is only if she is so detained there that she will have contact with her children, her immediate family and her extended family. 
    52   Having regard to her Aboriginality and her personal circumstances, I will, particularly having reference to the letter from Mr. Leo Keliher, the Commissioner of Corrective Services of 13 March 2000, recommend that she be placed for the custodial portion of her sentence at Broken Hill. 
    53   It was submitted on her behalf that some degree of rehabilitation has already occurred, that there is an attempt to manage her alcohol problem. That is amply borne out by the material to which I will later turn, but there should also be a recommendation that, both whilst she remains in custody and during the parole period of her sentence, she be afforded the opportunity to participate in all appropriate rehabilitation programmes and that her release be conditional upon her participation in such programmes as might be available in Broken Hill and I will recommend that such occur. 
    54   There is now available for her within the Corrective Services system, and as provided by the Far West Area Health Service and the Aboriginal Medical Service, programmes and facilities to seek to attain her rehabilitation and the avoidance of alcohol abuse. All of that material suggests that she is an appropriate candidate for such programmes, that she has in fact, within the gaol system, achieved a remarkable degree of personal rehabilitation and attainment of qualifications, such that one can say she has a strong prospect for rehabilitation. 
    55   It is, having regard particularly to the evidence of the offender's brother, Mr. Clarence Mitchell, a matter for considerable hope that her circumstances for the future will be so supported by the family and by the programmes that she will not offend again. Mr. Mitchell gave evidence of the local facilities, of the family support and of his willingness to marshal his own and the support of Aboriginal organizations to assist her. He gave evidence of the deep bonds that still existed with the children and which bonds may themselves further be assisted. All of this is material to which I should have regard when I find whether the circumstances are special and also in respect of the overall length of the sentence. 
    56   In regard to the question of the proportion of non-parole period to head sentence, the Crown concedes that, because of the length of the sentence, the circumstances of her children and family, her prospects of rehabilitation, the necessity for her to have to serve a lengthy sentence, for her prospects of rehabilitation after release from gaol to be a reality requiring the support of her family and for her to see and have contact with her children, there are special circumstances such that her sentence should be comprised of components which would not require the non-parole period to be 75% of the head sentence. 
    57   To what the Crown had said in this regard should be added the considerations referred to in Fernando (supra) which require regard to be had to the particular aspect of alcohol abuse and violence within aboriginal communities so that the sentence is so crafted as to afford an opportunity for the future to avoid any further involvement on her part in the circumstances which would give rise to violence. The realistic recognition by the court not only of the endemic presence of alcohol within such communities as she might come in contact with but of the effect of alcohol in inducing violence within these communities requires that the court have regard to that matter in the form of sentence which it passes in the hope of avoiding the offender's further resort to violence. 
    58   It can be seen that in this woman's circumstances are evidenced the social problems which affect others rather than just her. But this sentence, in the context of these circumstances, is one that turns peculiarly upon the most unusual and particular facts and her peculiar circumstances. 
    59   I am required to sentence the prisoner for murder, not for manslaughter. There are many cases which, although they do not establish any tariff for sentences in such circumstances, for a crime of manslaughter, do give some indications of an appropriate range of sentence. There are few, very few indeed, remotely similar where there has been a plea of guilty to murder. I have to have regard to a fact that a life was taken. I have to have regard to that fact that it was taken in the circumstances in which a weapon was wielded. I must have regard to questions of deterrence and rehabilitation. I can have regard to that question of intoxication and intellectual disabilities in considering the extent to which the mind turned to the action both in looking at the objective circumstances of the crime and when reflecting on those personal circumstances which have turned the prisoner to violence. But having regard to those matters, I am unable to conclude that this is an offence for which the prisoner's punishment should be greatly in excess of that which might have been expected had she been found guilty of the crime of manslaughter. 
    60   I have reviewed the extensive material provided to me by both the Crown and the defence comparing cases. In particular, my attention was drawn to two decisions of Regina v. Johnson (Ireland, J., unreported 5 August 1999) and Regina v. Gillespie (Sharpe, J., unreported 6 September 1991) by both the Crown and the defence. Johnson (supra) involved a sentence for manslaughter and Gillespie (supra) a sentence for murder. In the latter, a sentence of 11 years, comprising a minimum term of six years and an additional term of five years, was passed in September 1991 on a person who had stabbed the deceased once in circumstances where the offender and the victim had been for many years best friends and where the offender was heavily intoxicated. However, in that case, there was no such material as to the conditioning of the offender to violence, as appears here, establishing the offender's disturbed mind, alcoholism, and deprived circumstances. Further, the Crown concedes that, unlike the offender in that matter, the present offender must benefit when the Fernando (supra) criteria are applied, and because of her plea and contrition. 
    61   The Crown does submit, however, that the prospects of rehabilitation are such that, although special circumstances should be found, the sentence should not be so structured as to require only half of it to be spent in custody and submits that, notwithstanding the distinctions from the Gillespie (supra) and Johnson (supra) cases, an appropriate sentence should approach a total period of imprisonment of 11 years with a minimum term of six years. The statistics with which I was provided do not indicate for the crime of murder that any sentence with a minimum term lower than five years has, in recent years, been imposed. 
    62   In the oral submissions both counsel for the defence and the Crown indicated ranges of sentence which appear to centre on five years for the minimum term. Before me, in further argument, each has diverged somewhat from that in their submissions. 
    63   It is tragic to have to pass sentence on a person offending in these circumstances and to require that the offender remain in custody for a number of years more, but given the fact of the killing, the nature of the crime and the necessary components in sentencing of general and personal deterrence, it is incumbent upon me to pass a sentence which requires that the offender spend a substantial period of time in custody and that the overall sentence recognize that sufficiently. The length of the sentence must also recognise that, although she may be discharged earlier than the expiry of the head sentence, such a discharge be conditional and she may be returned to custody to serve the whole of it. 
    64   As I have said, I recommend that the sentence, in accordance with the letter from Mr. Keliher, be spent as to the custodial portion, at least, at Broken Hill and I recommend that she be afforded those programmes and that the Parole Board impose a condition upon her release not only to require supervision, but a participation in appropriate programmes to achieve her rehabilitation. 
    65   I find special circumstances, as I have said, and I am of the view that I should impose a head sentence of nine years imprisonment to date from 7 October 1997. That sentence, having regard to the special circumstances, should be structured with a minimum term of five years imprisonment to date from that day and an additional term thereafter of four years imprisonment. 
    66   Miss Burke, would you please rise? 
    67   I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of nine years to date from 7 October 1997. That sentence is to include a non-parole period of four and a half years to date from 7 October 1997.  
     
      
     UPON RESUMPTION A SHORT WHILE LATER. 
      
    68   HIS HONOUR: Miss Burke, I have made an error in my calculations. The sentence that I have imposed is a sentence that you will be imprisoned for nine years commencing on 7 October 1997; that there be a non-parole period of five years commencing on 7 October 1997 and expiring on 6 October 2002; that there is an additional term thereafter of four years to commence on 7 October 2002 and to expire on 6 October 2006, within which time you may be released from custody, but may be returned to custody if you are in breach of your parole. I recommend that you be detained at Broken Hill so that you may be in touch with your family and such programmes as there are there, and that whilst you are in custody and whilst you are on parole you will be afforded the opportunity to participate in appropriate programmes and that the Parole Board consider a condition that you be required to participate in those programmes on your release on parole.

     REGINA v Leonard Rappley OSBORNE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Although no documentation has been filed in this respect, the Court is treating the proceedings presently before it as an application by the applicant, Leonard Rappley Osborne, for an order that the summary dismissal on 18 March 1999 of his appeal be set aside. In the event that the order is set aside, the applicant seeks to rely upon a second notice of appeal which was filed on 17 March 1999. 
    2   The applicant was born on 31 August 1967. On 18 December 1997 he was sentenced by his Honour Judge Armitage QC at the Newcastle District Court in relation to pleas of guilty to an indictment containing four counts. 
    3   The first and fourth counts were counts under s 112 of the Crimes Act 1900, (the Act) - break, enter and steal, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. The second count was one under s 195 (b) of the Act - maliciously damage property by fire or explosives, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. The third count was one under s 154AA(1) of the Act - steal motor vehicle, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. 
    4   His Honour was also asked to take into account the following offences under a Form 1: eight of steal motor vehicle, one of maliciously damage property by fire, four offences of stealing, three of false pretences, one of goods in custody, one of possess implements, two of possess prohibited drug, one of administer prohibited drug, two of being an unlicensed driver, one of driving an unregistered vehicle, and one of using an uninsured vehicle. The offences ranged over the period between March 1997 and 30 June 1997. 
    5   A second Form 1 involved an offence of attempting to escape lawful custody. That offence was committed on 23 October 1997. In relation to the first and fourth counts, and taking into account all the Form 1 matters his Honour imposed a minimum term of four years penal servitude to commence on 26 May 1997 and to expire on 25 May 2001, with an additional term of 16 months to commence on 26 May 2001, to expire on 25 September 2002. 
    6   In relation to the second and third counts, his Honour imposed a minimum term of two years penal servitude to commence on 26 May 1997 and to expire on 25 May 1999 with an additional term of eight months, commencing on 26 May 1999 and to expiring on 25 January 2000. 
    7   The applicant came before his Honour with a very bad record. His criminal career commenced on 3 June 1985 when he was only 17 years of age. He was thereafter continuously before courts until the subject matters were dealt with. He has a history of drug addiction. His Honour outlined the criminal conduct involved, and it is not necessary for me for present purposes to enter into the detail of those matters, all of which were serious.  
    8   It is to be noted that during this episode of criminal conduct, the applicant was twice granted bail and on each occasion, nevertheless, committed further offences. The subjective material before his Honour included a pre-sentence report dated 28 October 1997 under the hand of Lorraine May, Probation and Parole officer, Lake Macquarie District Office and a psychiatric report under the hand of Dr Jolly, psychiatrist, dated 5 December 1997. Dr Jolly attributed the applicant's offending to his addiction to drugs. He noted normal grief following the death by accident of his mother which was during his period in gaol on remand. The doctor concluded that a lengthy period of supervision in the community was necessary after his discharge from gaol. These matters were all considered by the experienced learned sentencing judge. 
    9   The original notice of appeal was filed on 30 December 1997, some 12 days after the sentences were imposed. The grounds of appeal, which were completed by the applicant personally, are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       ""I am appealing for a shorter time in gaol and longer time on parole with admission to a long term rehabilitation centre as a condition of parole. I feel this will be more beneficial to my future and will better help me to settle successfully with my wife and family into the community when my sentence is served. I will take advantage of counselling while in gaol, but would appreciate the opportunity of more intensive therapy in rehab before my release."" 
       
      
    10   There was some communication between the Registry and the applicant following the filing of this notice of appeal. This involved, to some extent, reference to attempts by the applicant to obtain legal aid, which apparently proved fruitless. However, subsequent correspondence by the Registrar to the applicant was not answered and eventually, on 8 March 1999 this Court (Simpson J and Smart AJ) ordered that the application be summarily dismissed. 
    11   The response to that order was a further notice of appeal by the applicant, dated 17 March 1999, in which he states: 
     
      
       
        ""I have had this appeal in for over two years. I have transferred from different gaols a lot in that time and unfortunately missed two letters from the pro-bono solicitor. They requested 17/3/99 that I ask the court to refile my appeal application whilst I wait for them to get all my legal papers. Contact person at Pro-Bono NSW Law Society for this is Nancy Walker -solicitor (02)93737367. See attached"".  
       
      
     
     
     Apparently the pro bono solicitor did not proceed further with this matter. 
      
    12   On 3 May 1999 the applicant wrote to the Registrar, Mr Schell, indicating that he wished to submit certain information to support his request for the filing of the second appeal. He pointed out that the offences for which he is still incarcerated were committed as a direct consequence of his previous narcotic addiction. He referred in this letter to efforts which had been undertaken by him to control and overcome his substance abuse. 
    13   The efforts which in fact have been undertaken by the applicant since his incarceration to rehabilitate himself and to deal with his substance abuse are indeed worthy of the highest commendation. He has obviously made every effort to use the time when he has been incarcerated to educate himself in preparation for obtaining gainful employment upon his release and to come to terms with his drug addiction and the difficulties, of an emotional kind, which he has encountered during the course of his life. There is adequate documentary material to support what he says in this letter. 
    14   Doing the best one can, with the very considerable assistance of Mr Grogan, counsel for the Crown, and taking account of the matters that the applicant has put before this Court on his own behalf this afternoon, it would appear that his submission is that the learned sentencing judge did not have proper regard to his willingness to undertake drug and alcohol counselling. Secondly, that his Honour failed to have regard to the applicant's grief arising from his mother's death. Thirdly, that his Honour failed to take into account the contents of reports tendered during the sentence proceedings. Fourthly, his Honour failed to consider home detention as a sentencing option. Clearly, in relation to ground four there could be no substance, had the appeal proceeded in the normal fashion, so far as that ground is concerned. 
    15   This Court's task, in an application such as the present, has been explained by Street CJ, (with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Allen J concurred), in Regina v Bell, (1987) 8 NSWLR, 311. 
    16   Applying the principles enunciated in that case, the position is that the summary dismissal of the application for leave to appeal by the Court on 8 March 1999 constituted a procedural dismissal and not a dismissal on its merits. So much is, of course, self evident. However, the Court retains an inherent jurisdiction to go behind the dismissal where its enforcement would lead to a miscarriage of justice, and for this purpose, the Court may consider the likelihood of success of the appeal and how it came about that the matter was summarily dismissed. 
    17   Mr Grogan has indicated to the Court that his experience is such that when inmates, such as the applicant, are moved from gaol to gaol during the pendency of his appeal being heard, difficulty is necessarily experienced in their receiving communications. One must necessarily accept that to be the position, but nevertheless, of course, when an applicant has leave to appeal he or she is under an obligation to take steps, so far as he or she can, to pursue the application for leave to appeal, despite the difficulties that are created by transportation from one corrective services institution to another. However, naturally this Court must take a lenient or tolerant view of the difficulties which prisoners experience in this regard. Nevertheless, the summary dismissal by this Court is an important matter which cannot be treated lightly. 
    18   The manner in which I have approached this case consistent with Bell's case, is carefully to consider the material which was before the learned sentencing judge, his reasons for the penalties which he imposed and the matters that were raised in the original notice of appeal going to the appropriateness or otherwise of the sentences imposed, together with the matters that have been raised today, to determine whether the refusal by this Court to set aside the summary dismissal would or could lead to a miscarriage of justice. This Court is, however, unable in determining that primary question to take into consideration the commendable efforts which the applicant has made to rehabilitate himself which I have earlier set out. 
    19   Clearly, in my view, the sentencing regime imposed by Judge Armitage was within the sentencing discretion available to him. Indeed, bearing in mind the applicant's prior criminal record, and the objective seriousness of the litany of offences with which his Honour was required to deal, I would say that the sentences imposed were towards the lower end of the range rather than the higher end of the range. Thus I am quite satisfied that the setting aside of the summary dismissal of the appeal would not or could not lead to a miscarriage of justice, and I would therefore propose that such application should be dismissed. One can only express the hope that the disappointment associated with such dismissal does not deter the applicant from continuing with his exemplary efforts of rehabilitation in the year that lies ahead of him to complete the minimum term imposed by Judge Armitage. 
    20   HULME J: I agree. Accordingly, the orders of the Court are that the application to set aside the previous orders of this Court summarily dismissing the applicant's appeal is refused.

     REGINA v Brendan Bernard CAMPBELL 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   HULME J: I will ask Carruthers AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Brendan Campbell seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him at the District Court, Sydney on 4 June 1999. The applicant had pleaded guilty on 19 March 1999 to a litany of offences contained within 25 counts on the indictment. 
    3   Count 1 was a charge under section 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, as amended (the Act) of obtaining money by false or misleading statements. This count carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Counts 2 to 20 were under section 300 of the Act, i.e. using false instruments. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. Count 21 was a count under section 112 of the Act i.e. break, enter and steal which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. Counts 22 to 25 were under section 188 of the Act i.e. receiving, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. 
    4   His Honour was also asked to take into account the following offences under a Form 1: one offence of make a false instrument, 93 offences of using false instrument, 5 offences of receiving and one offence of goods in custody. The offences covered period from 5 August 1997 to 6 January 1998. 
    5   His Honour imposed the following sentences declaring that he was applying the principle of totality. In relation to the first count he imposed a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to commence on 18 December 1998 and to expire on 17 December 1999. In relation to each of counts 2 to 20 his Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years penal servitude to commence on 18 December 1998 and expire on 17 December 2000. 
    6   In relation to count 21, his Honour imposed a minimum term of 4 and a half years penal servitude to commence on 18 December 1998 and expire on 17 June 2003 with an additional term of 1 and a half years to commence on 18 June 2003 and expire on 17 December 2004. 
    7   In relation to each of counts 22 to 25, his Honour imposed a fixed term of 2 years penal servitude to commence on 18 December 1998 and expire on 17 December 2000. 
    8   The applicant was born on 27 July 1977 and was accordingly 31 years of age at the date of sentence. His prior criminal record commenced on 10 June 1982 and contains a considerable number of offences of varying kinds. Generally it would be fair to say that in relation to those offences he has received a considerable degree of leniency. It is not necessary for present purposes to deal at length with the various offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 
    9   Two briefs of evidence were tendered before his Honour. In relation to the first brief which related to the section 178BB and section 300 offences, the relevant facts are summarised in the remarks on sentence as well as in a statement of facts which was before his Honour. Briefly stated, the offences occurred during November and December 1997. Police searched the applicant's unit at Glebe on 6 January 1998 when he was arrested for breach of parole. Property and documents were seized during the search which were relevant to the subject offences. However, for some reason which did not appear in the evidence before his Honour, the applicant was not apparently interviewed with regard to such offences until 30 June 1998 when he participated in an ERISP. He cooperated fully with the police and made admissions and also named other persons allegedly involved in the offences. 
    10   As to the facts, on 27 November 1997 the applicant attended the Colonial State Bank at Pagewood and completed a bank document requesting banking facilities in a fictitious name, Stephen John McDowell trading as Encom Computers. In support of this application he produced a number of false documents. On 2 December 1997, the applicant returned to the bank and applied for and was granted a merchant facility for that account. He was given a credit card and a cheque book in the name Encom Computers. Between 18 and 24 December 1997 false sales vouchers and merchant voucher imprints, which totalled $183,061, were prepared purporting to be for goods supplied by Encom. This amount was purported to be deposited into the account. 
    11   Between 19 and 23 December 1997, the applicant drew 9 cheques on the Encom cheque book totalling $104,484.70. He signed the cheques in a fictitious name. Six of the cheques were cashed at various Colonial State Bank branches for the amount of $45,987.10. A further $50,000 was deposited into a Westpac account. Police were unable to ascertain details of who transferred this money. However, at the date of sentence enquiries were continuing. The total amount thus fraudulently withdrawn from the Encom account was $95,487.10. 
    12   The applicant claimed he received only a small amount of this money, about $8000 or $9000, and that the remainder went to the other persons involved. He said he did not have anything to do with the deposit side. 
    13   The reason he asserted in the ERISP for the commission of those offences was he was using amphetamines and needed the money to support his drug habit. 
    14   Once again this Court has before it an example of a fraudulent scheme resulting in large amounts of money being illegally obtained from a large banking institution. The frequency with which such matters come before the District Court is a matter of some concern. 
    15   I turn then to the second brief. With regard to the first matter, I note that when the applicant's unit was searched on 6 January 1998 property was found that had been stolen during different break and enter offences in Sydney. When asked in a second ERISP on 30 June 1998 about certain property taken from premises at 32 Quinlan Parade, Manly on 11 December 1997, the applicant made an immediate admission. He said that he had committed the offence because he had a ""terrible amphetamine habit"". The value of the property stolen was approximately $15,000 and about half of that property was recovered. 
    16   For myself, I accept what was put on behalf of the applicant by Ms Burgess in her careful submissions that if the applicant had not confessed to the break, enter and steal matters, the prosecution may not have been able to have made a case out against him in this regard. 
    17   As to the receiving counts, when questioned about property from other break, enter and steal matters, the applicant admitted that he had bought certain items, namely, a television set, a stereo, a Walkman and a printer from a man he identified to police as Patrick Walton. He said that Mr Walton had gone to Darwin and left some other property at his unit. He assumed that such property was stolen. 
    18   It is convenient to refer, at this stage, to the following facts so far as the applicant's custody was concerned prior to the sentencing process. On 28 February 1996 the applicant was sentenced to a 7 months minimum term from 15 January 1996 to 14 August 1996 and an 18 months additional term from 15 August 1996 to 14 February 1998, in relation to the breach of a recognizance granted in 1995 for an offence of malicious wounding. He remained in custody after his minimum term expired on 14 August 1996. As from 28 February 1997 he was in custody on remand for a charge of sexual assault. He was acquitted of this charge and released on parole on 28 February 1997. 
    19   On 6 January 1998 he was arrested for breach of parole and remained in custody from that date until 6 May 1998. As already indicated on 30 June 1998 he was formally arrested and interviewed in relation to the instant matters. He was then granted bail. His parole was again revoked on 16 September 1998 and he remained in custody in that regard until 18 December 1998. Thereafter he was ‘bail refused’ in relation to the subject matters. Thus there was a period of approximately 3 months in custody immediately preceding the date from which his Honour imposed the subject sentences viz 18 December 1998. I shall refer to that aspect of the matter later. 
    20   It is convenient to take the subjective matters from the written submissions on behalf of the applicant. As I have indicated, the applicant was 31 years of age at the date of sentence. He came to Australia from New Zealand in his first year with his family. A report from Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist, was tendered on his behalf, as well as references from Gary Ferguson CFC, the Chaplain at Silverwater Gaol and David Rowe, a drug and alcohol worker. Dr Nielssen recorded that the applicant grew up in Glebe where his parents established a community newspaper which left little time for the family. He had 12 step siblings and a younger brother. He had a disrupted childhood and was sent for a number of years to live with his grandparents in Queensland. He later attended boarding school in Bowral and St. Josephs at Hunters Hill. He began drinking alcohol at about age 12 and ingesting drugs in his early teenage years. His convictions for violence were said to be mainly related to drug and alcohol abuse. 
    21   Dr Nielssen said that the background to the offences was that after his release on parole on 28 February 1997, the applicant arranged for his supervision to be transferred to Queensland so he could live with his mother. However, she was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and he was required to care for her. It is said that he returned to Sydney in a distressed state and recommenced using amphetamines intravenously to the extent of as much 7 grams in a 2 day period. 
    22   It is said that his amphetamine habit became expensive and he committed offences to obtain money. Dr Nielssen reported the applicant has a history of hypomania and had numerous psychiatric assessments. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Canberra in 1993 with acute paranoid psychosis induced by amphetamine abuse. 
    23   There is also a family history of hypomania. There is also a family history of drug abuse. Dr Nielssen did not consider that the applicant was suffering from mania when the subject offences were committed, although he noted it is difficult to separate symptoms of mental illness from a state induced by a chaotic lifestyle and continuous heavy amphetamine abuse. Dr Nielssen thought the treatment most likely to assist him would be drug and alcohol rehabilitation. He considered that the applicant should accept very close community supervision after release, to minimise contact with the criminal milieu and to decrease the risk of resuming drug use. 
    24   Ms Burgess argued that his Honour erred in failing to give the applicant any reduction with respect to assistance to the authorities pursuant to section 442 B of the Act. Shortly stated, counsel submitted that in relation to the first brief, the applicant named a co-offender, one of whom had worked in a bank and therefore provided esoteric information for the commission of the bank offences. Further that the applicant had during the course of the ERISP interview agreed to view a video shown to him by the interviewing police officers for the purpose of identifying persons alleged to be co-offenders. Certain persons were identified by the applicant. 
    25   The applicant explained the way the crimes had been committed. The applicant also indicated that he was prepared to assist further, but due to additional information otherwise coming to the knowledge of the police officers, the applicant was not in a position to assist the interviewing police further. It was not contended by the investigation police officers that the applicant was not genuine or correct in the information which he tendered to them in relation to co-offenders. 
    26   Counsel stressed that in relation to the receiving matters and the break, enter and steal there was an absence of independent evidence. 
    27   Reliance was placed upon the particular reference to Patrick Walton who was, in fact. convicted of stealing the property found in the applicant's premises, albeit, Mr Walton had been charged prior to his being named by the applicant. 
    28   In his remarks the learned sentencing judge referred to co-operation by the applicant, but said: 
     
      
       
       ""I am, nevertheless not of the view that any real basis exists for a section 442 reduction of any sentence to be imposed on this basis. It seems to me that the assistance you gave to the police has been quite minimal. It is restricted, as I have said to names, so far as the brief 1 matters are concerned and although the police investigation has continued for a considerable time it has not succeeded in bringing to light any of these persons."" 
       
      
      
     His Honour then went on to say. 
      
       
       ""I take into consideration your present status as being in protective custody albeit at your own request."" 
       
      
      
    29   Counsel referred the Court to remarks by Hunt CJ at CL in Yenice (1994) 72 A Crim 234 at 239 where his Honour said (with the concurrence of Dunford and Blanch JJ). 
     
      
       
       ""s442B does make is necessary for a judge to consider the usefulness of the information given when determining the extent of the discount to be made to the sentence imposed.” 
       
      
      
     And further, 
      
      
       
       “That requirement of s 442B does not mean that  
       no 
        discount can be made for the assistance given where the prisoner 
        has 
        been unable to establish the usefulness of the information provided. The section is not expressed in terms that a discount may only be made if the information  
       has 
        been shown to have been useful to the authorities. But it does mean that the extent of the discount must be less where the usefulness of the information has not been established.” 
       
      
      
    30   With regard to the reference by his Honour to the applicant being in protective custody, Ms Burgess emphasised that the applicant is in such custody because of his co-operation with the investigating police. She contended that his Honour had obviously, by inference, failed to give adequate weight to the fact that his co-operation with the police was resulting in the applicant's custodial situation being more harsh than would otherwise have been the position (see s 442B(3)(g)). I shall return to these matters shortly. 
    31   It was also submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient consideration to the applicant's drug addiction when considering the objective seriousness of the case, and our attention was drawn to certain authorities in that regard.32   In his submission in response, Mr Grogan of counsel for the Crown submitted (inter alia) that there is no issue that notwithstanding his drug use, the applicant was capable of playing the dominant role in the commission of offences which manifested in a high degree of sustained planning. In the final analysis the drug use was nothing more than the motive to achieve the fundamental object of the commission of the offence, the obtaining of the money. 
    33   During his remarks on sentence the trial judge adverted to the applicant's history of drug abuse and his attendance, whilst in custody, at the alcohol and other drugs section of the Silverwater gaol, and also other positive steps that the applicant had taken in regard to his drug abuse. 
    34   I am unable to conclude that his Honour erred in relation to the relevance of the applicant's long history of drug abuse which was clearly present at the time of the commission of the subject offences and the impact that such addiction would have on the sentencing process. This is not an appropriate case to review the statements of principle in that regard which were referred to during the course of the oral submissions and in the written submissions. 
    35   It was further argued that the overall sentence of 6 years was manifestly excessive taking into account the applicant's plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, particularly in relation to the break, enter and steal and receiving matters, his co-operation with the police and the subjective features, including his drug addiction. 
    36   Reference was also made to the fact that the bank offences were committed over a relatively short period of time and that his Honour had accepted that the applicant had only received $8000 or $9000 of the total amount taken. 
    37   Reference was also made to statistics from the Judicial Commission which show in particular, that the sentence imposed had been the break enter and steal charge and receiving charges are at the top of the range for all offenders, which includes pleas of not guilty and multiple charges. 
    38   Finally, reference was made to the commencement date of the sentence and the question of special circumstances. His Honour declined to hold that there were special circumstances. Ms Burgess has argued, however, that as his Honour accumulated the sentences he imposed on the sentence served between 17 September 1998 and 18 December 1998, his Honour should, consistently with cases such as Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58, have accepted that there were special circumstances to ensure that a proper proportion between the effective total minimum term and the effective additional term was achieved. Apart from this, it was argued, that his Honour nevertheless in failing to find special circumstances. There was ample evidence, it was submitted, to support a finding of the need for a longer than usual additional term to foster the applicant's rehabilitation. 
    39   When sentencing the applicant, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""I accept the proposition of Mr Driels (appearing for the applicant before his Honour) that the appropriate method of approaching the imposition of sentence in respect of these offences is by adopting the principle of totality and I wish to emphasise that when I come to an indication of the sentences in respect of these offences in detail, that those sentences are calculated with the principle of totality firmly in mind."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    40   His Honour made no reference to the Judgment of the High Court in Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. Ultimately it was submitted by the applicant before this Court that the sentence imposed by his Honour in relation to the break, enter and steal matter of an overall 6 years penal servitude demonstrated, first, that it was an excessive sentence bearing in mind the sentencing regime for offences of that kind and, secondly, that it demonstrated a failure by his Honour to comply with the principles enunciated by the High Court in Pearce. In Pearce the High Court indicated that it is necessary for a sentencing judge to impose a sentence for each offence when dealing with multiple offences which reflected the criminality for that offence. Thereafter, the judge may consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
    41   I must say, with respect, that I consider that there is some substance in the submissions made on behalf of the applicant in relation to the way in which his Honour dealt with the section 442B issue before him. However, it must be borne in mind that the regime laid down by section 442B, from beginning to end is a discretionary matter. Secondly, subsection 2 provides: 
     
      
       
       ""A court must not reduce a sentence so that the sentence becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the case.” 
       
      
      
    42   His Honour was faced with an extraordinarily difficult sentencing matter, bearing in mind the youth of the applicant, his unfortunate prior criminal record and his addiction to amphetamines, together with the large number of serious offences which the applicant had committed. Numerous factors jostled against each other for primacy in the sentencing process to use an oft quoted expression of Wells J. 
    43   Accordingly, allowing for what I consider to be of some substance in the submissions that are made on behalf of the applicant with regard to section 442B, the overall sentences imposed by his Honour nevertheless fall so comfortably within the allowable sentencing range for the subject offences, that I am unable to come to conclude that a discount under section 442B would have disturbed what would otherwise have been an appropriate total sentence for the subject offences. I am quite confident, if I may respectfully say so, that his Honour was well aware of the fact that the co-operation which the applicant had afforded to the police would have resulted in a harsher manner of serving his sentence than otherwise would have been the case and I do not consider that the arguments that have been submitted in this regard undermine, in any way, the sentencing process. Nor do I think, allowing for the argument that was submitted in relation to the accumulation of these sentences upon the 3 months for breach of parole which the applicant has served, there is sufficient justification for disturbing the overall sentencing regime. Bearing in mind the level of criminality involved in these proceedings such an error, if it were, does not justify any disturbance of the overall sentencing regime. I think his Honour was entitled to take the view that an 18 months additional term was quite sufficient for the rehabilitation, if such were to occur, of the applicant in the circumstances of this case. 
    44   However I have come to the conclusion that in light of the principles cited in Pearce that the sentencing regime should be adjusted because I accept the argument that the overall sentence of 6 years broken up into a minimum term of 4 and a half years and an additional term of 1 and a half years was beyond the sentencing discretion available to his Honour for that particular offence. 
    45   However, I am of the view that overall the period which the applicant should serve should not be disturbed. I would propose therefore that the application for leave to appeal be allowed and that the appeal be upheld but only to the extent necessary to comply with the principles enunciated in Pearce. 
    46   In relation to count 21, I would vary the sentence imposed by his Honour to the following extent, I would set aside the minimum term of 4 and a half years and additional term of 18 months and impose a fixed term of 3 years to commence on 18 December 1998 and to expire on 17 December 2001.47   Secondly, in relation to the sentence imposed on the first count, I would set aside the fixed term of 12 months and impose a minimum term of 18 months to commence on 18 December 2001 and to expire on 17 June 2003 and I would impose an additional term of 18 months to commence on 18 June 2003 and expire on 17 December 2004.48   HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour’s reasons. 
    49   I would add only that the applicant has an appalling record for offences of dishonesty including offences of dishonesty of the precise nature of those which were dealt with by his Honour, Judge Davidson. A corollary to the leniency which is extended to offenders who appear in court for the first or first few times, is that once they become repeat offenders who apparently have learned nothing from their prior sentences, there is an obligation on the courts to ensure that sentences imposed are salutary. Having regard to the totality of the applicant's criminality, I by no means regard the sentences which were imposed as excessive. I myself would have imposed more severe sentences. 
    50   The order of the Court will be leave to appeal is granted. The sentences imposed in relation of counts 21 and 1, are quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as outlined by Justice Carruthers.

     REGINA v Phyllis MASSART 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SMART AJ: The Crown appeals against the alleged inadequacy of five concurrent sentences each comprising a minimum term of one year and an additional term of three years in respect of each of five counts of supplying a prohibited drug; two counts relating to the supply of methylamphetamine and three to the supply of amphetamine.  
    2   The offences took place within a period of seven weeks from 30 October 1995 to 15 December 1995. The trial lasted from 17 August 1999 to 30 August 1999. It does not appear why there was such a long delay in the trial taking place.  
    3   The Crown alleged that the prisoner supplied the drugs in question to Bone Metreski who then supplied the drugs to an undercover police officer. The judge described the Crown case as a strong one. It included observations of the prisoner in the car park in which the supplies took place and the tapes of a number of a telephone conversations. She denied that she was in the car park and that the telephone conversations were referring to her supplying drugs. She said that they were referring to her obtaining drugs. In her evidence she denied any involvement in selling drugs to Metreski. She said that she had once made an arrangement with Metreski around 14 December 1995 to purchase amphetamine from him. 
    4   $1,000 was paid for the drug supply on the first count, $1,000 on the second count, $2,200 on the third count, $6,500 on the fourth count and $6,500 on the fifth count.  
    5   As to count 1, the powder supplied weighed 28 grams and contained 2 per cent methylamphetamine. As to count 2, the powder supplied weighed 276 grams and contained 1.5 per cent methylamphetamine. As to count 3, the powder supplied weighed 55.2 grams and contained 4.5 per cent amphetamine. As to count 4, the powder supplied weighed 227 grams and contained 6.5 per cent amphetamine. And as to count 5, the powder supplied weighed 235.1 grams and contained 5.5 per cent amphetamine. It can thus be seen that the amounts of methylamphetamine and amphetamine involved were relatively small.  
    6   Bone Metreski pleaded guilty as to his involvement in offences with the prisoner and to a charge involving the supply of drugs in which the prisoner was not involved. Metreski’s criminality was overall significantly greater in extent than that of the prisoner. Metreski was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and an additional term of two years. He had a lengthy history for drug offences and dishonesty offences. He had been dealt with by the courts on many occasions and had served a prior full-time gaol sentence. He had a longstanding drug problem and needed to undergo a long-term residential program so that he could be rehabilitated. As there were real prospects of rehabilitation Phelan DCJ held there was a need for a longer than usual additional term.  
    7   At the time of the offences the prisoner was undertaking community service.  
    8   Her record comprised the offences of goods in custody and one of receiving for which she was ordered to undertake the community service just mentioned. Her record was minimal compared to that of Metreski and in the normal course of events she would receive a lesser sentence than Metreski. In dealing with the prisoner considerations of parity will require that Metreski’s sentence be kept well in mind.  
    9   The judge rejected the Crown submission that the prisoner was above Metreski in the hierarchy of criminal activity. The judge was unable to be satisfied of that. The judge said: 
     
      
       
       “On the evidence in the trial I am only able to find that someone supplied the prisoner and the prisoner supplied Metreski. I do not know how many links there were in the chain”. 
       
      
    10   It is difficult for the Crown to overcome the judge’s lack of satisfaction especially given the prisoner’s mental state and behaviour.  
    11   It would be too facile an approach to say, as the Crown contended that because the prisoner supplied Metreski with the prohibited drugs Metreski was necessarily in a lower position. The Crown's complaint that the judge should have found that the prisoner was above Metreski is not made out. Further, this may well be a case where they are both so far down the chain that there is little if anything to choose between their respective roles.  
    12   The prisoner was born on 23 September 1954 and is a sole parent. She separated from her husband in about 1988. She has two daughters, the younger of whom is a teenager and ordinarily resides with her. Her elder daughter is married and lives at Liverpool. The prisoner is in contact with her aging parents who have remained supportive of her. Her siblings also remain supportive of her. When released the prisoner intends to reside in a home unit belonging to her sister.  
    13   The consideration which weighed heavily with the judge was her mental condition since about 1992/1993. The report of Dr C Canaris of 29 September 1999 is both illuminating and disturbing. She suffers to a marked degree from formal thought disorder. She described herself thus “My head's all been tangled up”. She commented to this effect to a close friend, “One day … my head will open up and ... I will see all the lice inside laying their eggs”.  
    14   She suffers from delusions. It is unnecessary to give further details.  
    15   Dr Canaris’ diagnosis was one of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder. He noted she was being treated with antidepressants. He preferred to have her started on an antipsychotic drug to see if this would dampen down some of her delusional beliefs. He thought that the principal priority should be to help her regain control of her mental illness and thereby hopefully reduce her propensity to reoffend. Her belief that her hair was infested with insects was based in large measure on tactile hallucinations. This is a well recognised symptom but one of relatively rare occurrence.  
    16   Dr Canaris said: 
     
      
       
       “I recognise that the charges of which she has been found guilty are quite serious. However the court needs to be aware that the very nature of this woman's illness, schizophrenia, or schizo-affective disorder, would be associated with substantial impairment in judgment and impulse control. I respectfully suggest that this be given due consideration as a mitigating factor in the determination of any sentence. I would also suggest in the event of a custodial sentence that sentencing is structured in such a way as to allow for a significant period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service upon release. The principal aim here would be to help ensure compliance with treatment as well as hopefully reinforcing the need for structure.”  
       
      
    17   The judge in accepting Dr Canaris’ views stated that they coincided with the observations he had made. The judge had the advantage of observing the prisoner for an extensive period during the court hearing. I do not accept the Crown suggestion that the prisoner’s medical condition was not of much relevance. The Crown contended that when regard was had to the number of offences, namely, five, these were not impulse offences and that the condition of the prisoner could not be said to bear upon the commission of the offences.  
    18   The question whether these were impulse offences is not of particular importance when we are dealing with an underlying condition of some severity of both delusions and disturbed or impaired judgment.  
    19   I would not accept the Crown submissions that the condition did not bear upon the commission of the offences. Nor did the judge. 
    20   The judge also placed reliance on the evidence of Mrs Polias, the prisoner’s sister, and the written statements of Mr Barry Reberger, her brother-in-law and Mr Poulton, a close neighbour. There were other testimonials. The materials established that for some years the prisoner went out of her way to help others. Mr Reberger explains how she came to descend into her current state. Upon the break-up of her marriage, she came under the influence of undesirable men. As a result, she became unstable and entangled in criminal activities. 
    21   The judge was clearly conscious of the objective gravity of the offences. There was strong evidence before the judge of the twin and associated needs of restoration of the prisoner’s health and rehabilitation. This was going to take considerable time. The judge was impressed by the extensive support available to the prisoner on her release. It was well open to the judge to take the course which he did given the circumstances. It was an exceptional case as the judge correctly recognised.  
    22   The sentences imposed were not manifestly inadequate in the circumstances and I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed.  
    23   DUNFORD J: I agree. 
    24   FOSTER AJA: I also agree. 
    25   DUNFORD J: The order of the court will therefore be that the Crown appeal is dismissed.

     R v Henry William SMITH 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is a Crown appeal against the alleged inadequacy of the sentence imposed on the respondent by his Honour Judge Woods QC in the District Court at Sydney following his pleas of guilty at committal, pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902, on five counts of fraudulently omit to account contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act 1900; which offence carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude, now imprisonment, for seven years. In addition, a further 14 similar offences were taken into account on a Form 1. 
    2    On 3 November 1999, his Honour sentenced the respondent on counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 to a fixed term of penal servitude for three years to commence on that day and expire on 2 November 2002. In respect of count 3, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the respondent to penal servitude for five years comprising a minimum term of three years to commence on 3 November 1999 and expire on 2 November 2002, with an additional term of two years to commence on 3 November 2002 and expire on 2 November 2004. 
    3    The respondent was a solicitor at Coolangatta in Queensland and also held a practising certificate in New South Wales. By September 1996, he was being investigated by the Queensland Law Society in relation to investments he had managed for clients amounting to more than $6m and at that time, he voluntarily surrendered his Queensland practising certificate. But on 1 October 1996, he moved to 24 Bay Street, Tweed Heads in this state, and recommenced practice as a solicitor using his then current New South Wales practising certificate and without notifying the New South Wales Law Society that he was under investigation in Queensland and had surrendered his practising certificate in that state. 
    4    The Queensland matters involved receiving money from clients for investment on registered first mortgages, but not using it for such purpose and then using later receipts to pay interest to the investors in Queensland in respect of the non-existent mortgages. When he moved to New South Wales the respondent continued to receive moneys for investment on registered first mortgages and continued to use those moneys to finance his practice, make payments - purportedly the interest payments - on the earlier bogus mortgages, and for living expenses. 
    5    Meanwhile, the Queensland Law Society commenced proceedings against the respondent and notified the New South Wales Law Society of such proceedings, whereupon the latter, on 6 March 1998, suspended the respondent's practising certificate. This did not deter the respondent, who continued practising as Smiths Solicitors and Conveyancers utilising the practising certificate of one Mark Harrison Donnelly whom the respondent caused to be registered as principal of the firm, although Mr Donnelly believed he was only employed as a consultant to the firm. 
    6    Count 2 on the committal document and counts 2, 3, 5, 7 and 12, on the Form 1, related to moneys received after that date. On 27 April 1998, the Queensland Supreme Court ordered that the respondent's name be struck from the role of solicitors in Queensland, and on 29 May the New South Wales Law Society was contacted by Metway Bank in relation to a deposit of $200,000 and thus became aware that the respondent was still practising even though suspended in this state, and thereupon placed his practice into receivership. 
    7    The total amount for which he failed to account in New South Wales over a period of 20 months was $2,832,740, of which $250,000 was subsequently recovered. To carry out the deception involved, the respondent prepared bogus mortgages, certificates of title and epitomes of mortgage, so that the depositors were led to believe that they had registered first mortgages. The respondent, therefore, created an ongoing and continuing need for money and to prevent or postpone detection, failed to account for additional moneys and created more bogus instruments, thus adding to the deception over a number of years. 
    8    Moreover, when suspended in Queensland, instead of facing up to the situation he had created, he continued receiving and failing to account for additional moneys in New South Wales and when suspended in New South Wales he did not stop then, but used the subterfuge of using another solicitor's practising certificate to continue and further compound the wrongdoing. Needless to say he did not disclose to the clients investing money with him in New South Wales that he had been suspended or struck off in Queensland, and later suspended in New South Wales. He must have realised that he could only postpone detection by continuing his criminal activity. 
    9    He is not to be punished in these proceedings for the offences committed in Queensland or for forging and passing false instruments or practising as a solicitor after his licence had been suspended, but these factors show the degree of planning and deliberation involved, as do the length of time over which the wrongdoing continued; and the amount involved, $2,832,740. These factors, including the steps taken to avoid detection, render these among the more serious offences of this nature. The receiver appointed by the Law Society formed the opinion that the respondent was actually running his solicitor's practice at a loss and that his lifestyle, although comfortable, was not extravagant; he was not gambling. 
    10    I should add at this stage that there is evidence before us that the respondent has been charged in Queensland with dishonestly applying to his own use the sum of $6,221,400.65. Those proceedings have been stood over until the respondent can be made available in Queensland, pursuant to the relevant legislation. He will no doubt, if convicted, be dealt with eventually for that offence, and the Queensland courts will have regard to principles of totality, including what sentence he ultimately is required to serve in this state. Our responsibility is to deal with the New South Wales matters which are presently before us as though they were the only matters. 
    11    In sentencing the respondent, the trial judge noted the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, and said that he regarded the respondent as a person of prior good character, noted that he had co-operated with the receiver, that he was a loving and devoted family man, and had qualified as a solicitor after much earnest work, but that in time he found he was only able to sustain his wife and children in the lifestyle and respected public and community position which he maintained by expenditure which was greater than that which was forthcoming from his practice. He worked for local charities and was a religious person involved with his church and his children's school organisations. 
    12    His Honour referred to evidence placed before him on sentence relating to a depressive illness suffered by the respondent and he accepted the opinion of Dr Curtis that he was suffering from a major depression. But he also noted Dr Curtis' further opinion that it was not a credible proposition to consider that a crime of complicated fraud perpetuated over a significant period of time could be put down to a single cause such as a non-psychotic major depressive disorder. 
    13    It is unlikely that the respondent will re-offend. In particular, he will not again be in a position to do so, because he will presumably not again be practising as a solicitor. His Honour noted the need for punishment and for general deterrence, as well as rehabilitation.  
    14    The principles on which this court deals with Crown appeals on the ground of alleged inadequacy of sentence have been summarised in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562-3 and it is not necessary to repeat them here. 
    15    In my view, two particular errors can be identified in his Honour's reasoning. In his Honour's Remarks on Sentence, he noted that the offences were planned and deliberate and were such as to inflict serious pain of a financial kind and probably also of the psychological kind on those who were affected, and represented a serious breach of trust. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
       ""Persons who are permitted to act as solicitors and barristers have privileges before the courts and an advantaged position in relation to so much of the administrative government activity of a kind with which solicitors, particularly, are involved. It is necessary for the court to impose significant penalties as a lesson to other legal professionals and other persons in positions of trust that this kind of misconduct will not be tolerated."" 
       
      
      
     I would endorse his Honour's remarks. However, shortly afterwards, his Honour compared a professional person committing white-collar crime with a person from a working-class background committing other offences such as armed robberies which netted funds similar to those involved in the present case and said: 
      
       
       ""I do not impose any particularly increased penalty upon Mr Smith because he is a solicitor, but equally he does not get a free ride because he happens to be a member of a profession. ... I will treat him as if the offences he has pleaded guilty to were offences committed by a person of neutral background."" 
       
      
      
     In this approach, I consider that his Honour erred. Persons whose offences involve breaches of trust, and solicitors in particular, are not persons of neutral background when they come to be sentenced. In  
     R v Hawkins 
      (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 436, Lee J in a case of a solicitor misappropriating clients' funds said: 
      
       
       ""These were not cases of mere fraud where there was some false promise or wrongful access to a trust account or something of that nature. They were cases where the prisoner was prepared on 13 occasions to forge documents in order to implement his plans and in my view, that fact, along with the magnitude of the moneys involved, takes the case wholly out of the ordinary kind of case where for instance a solicitor has been guilty of a breach of trust towards his clients in using trust funds which frequently comes before the courts."" 
       
      
      
     And later he went on to say that it was of fundamental importance for the courts to recognise that solicitors are persons placed in a special position of trust by the law and the community, and that their position is one which in the eyes of the community requires persons of the greatest integrity; that members of the community put their trust in the honesty of solicitors, and it is because that is so that the profession of solicitor is a large one and one which provides high financial rewards. When that trust is abused by the commission of fraud in any form, not only does the client or person of fraud suffer, but the integrity of the profession is necessarily called into question and the courts must impose sentences which are calculated to ensure that no solicitor will be left in doubt as to the serious consequences that will follow from such conduct. 
      
    16    His Honour then quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of McClemens J in R v Cole (unreported - Court of Criminal Appeal - 10 May 1974) as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Defalcations by persons in a position of trust have to be regarded by the courts as much more serious than other types of defalcations. In this regard the solicitor stands in a particular position. He is an officer of this Court, he is held out by it as a fit and proper person to practice his profession, to receive his clients' money and to be the recipient of their justified financial trust and confidence. It is not possible for the courts to regard lightly the defaulting solicitor whose actions tend to undermine the security of ordinary people and the fabric of a profession on which and on whose integrity the public are to such an extent dependent. This is particularly the type of case in which the court is entitled to express, on behalf of the community, its disapproval of the particular type of breach of trust involved."" 
       
      
      
    17    Reference was made to a passage in the judgment of Grove J in R v Poppert (Court of Criminal Appeal - 25 July 1994) where his Honour appears on one view to have suggested that a solicitor charged with malpractice is entitled to expect, by reason of his membership of the legal profession, to be treated no more harshly than any other offender, nor by the same token is he entitled to expect any more leniency than any other offender.  
    18    If his Honour was intending by that passage to depart from the principles laid down in Hawkins, I would respectfully disagree. In R v Holmwood (Court of Criminal Appeal - 25 October 1995) - another case involving a solicitor - reference was made to Poppert, but in delivering the judgment of the court in that case, Gleeson CJ said that the applicant could derive no comfort from the decision in Poppert, and referred in particular to R v Corbett (1991) 52 A Crim R 112 and R v Sellen (1991) 57 A Crim R 313. The latter was a case involving an accountant, but it similarly involved a breach of trust. See also R v Hunt (Court of Criminal Appeal - 30 September 1997). 
    19    The second error which I detect in his Honour's reasoning is the extent to which his Honour stressed good character and the lack of previous convictions.  
    20    In my view, this is not a case where the respondent is entitled to rely on good character. These offences were committed in order to prevent detection of deficiencies which he had already created by criminal activities in Queensland, and were committed to cover up those earlier offences.  
    21    Even having regard only to the New South Wales offences he was not a first offender from the time he committed the second offence, only he had not been caught out. See also R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 448.  
    22    In many respects the position may be compared with a sexual offender who commits a number of offences on young persons over a number of years where those offences go undetected for a long time. He cannot rely on the fact that he has no previous convictions when he comes to be sentenced for those offences. These offences are of a very different nature but, so far as relying on prior good character, it seems to me that similar considerations apply. 
    23    Moreover, references in his Honour's Remarks on Sentence to charitable and community work were all based on a false premise, namely, that the respondent was funding those activities as a result of his own work. His integrity, respectability and community work was itself all a deception of those who were falsely impressed and who furnished the references.  
    24    As Ireland J said in R v George (Court of Criminal Appeal - 23 September 1994), ""whilst the [respondent] may not have sought to line his own pockets nor sought to live a lavish, materialistic lifestyle he did seek to maintain the pretence of integrity and responsibility honourable solicitors maintain without pretence"".  
    25    We were referred to a number of cases including Poppert and George, and the summary of other matters contained in the judgment in George, but the amount involved here is considerably greater than the amounts in those cases, and these offences involve the other aggravating features to which I have referred, namely, the continuation of offences to cover up what had occurred, the previous criminal activity in Queensland, the use of bogus documents to satisfy the investors, and the use of a New South Wales practising certificate and later someone else's New South Wales practising certificate after he had surrendered his own and been suspended in Queensland.  
    26    In my opinion, the sentence imposed was significantly below the range of a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion, and I consider that having regard to the principles in Allpass to which I have already referred, this Court should intervene and impose a sentence which more truly reflects the criminality involved although, as it is a Crown appeal, the sentence I would propose would not be what I would have considered appropriate if dealing with the matter at first instance.  
    27    In my opinion the Crown appeal should be allowed in respect of the sentence imposed on count 3, and in lieu thereof, I would propose that the respondent be sentenced to a total sentence of six-and-a-half years, consisting of a minimum term of four-and-a-half years to commence on 3 November 1999 and expire on 2 May 2004 and with an additional term of two years to commence on 3 May 2004 and expire on 2 May 2006. 
    28    FOSTER AJA: I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons that have been given for them by the learned Presiding Judge. 
    29    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
    30    DUNFORD J: The orders will therefore be as I have indicated.

      Wednesday, 3 MAY 2000 
     
     
     R v Scott John CAMPBELL 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the respondent by Acting Judge Nader QC in the District Court at Newcastle on 22 October 1999 following his plea of guilty to a charge of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon with wounding, contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900, which offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years. The respondent also pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault contrary to s 61 of the said Act, but after he had been sentenced (apparently only in respect of the offence under s 98) he was permitted to withdraw his plea to the common assault charge, on the ground that the preferring of the two charges was duplicitous. 
    2    His Honour sentenced the respondent to a sentence of six and a half years penal servitude consisting of a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of two years. 
    3    The notice of appeal was signed on 24 December 1999 and was served on the respondent on 5 January 2000. 
    4    At about 12.30 am on 10 February 1999 the respondent and his co-offender, Natalie Jane Davies, travelled to premises at 18 Wilton Road, Awaba. The co-offender knocked on the door and spoke with one of the victims, Mr Leslie Wellard, asking him for some water because her car had broken down. He gave her some water. She returned to the car and appeared to put water in the radiator. She then got into the front passenger seat and the car was driven away. 
    5    At about 1.15 am the same night Mr Wellard was watching television when he heard his dog barking. He opened the front door and saw the co-offender, who told him that her car had broken down again and asked if she could use the telephone to ring the NRMA. Mr Wellard turned towards the phone, which was in the lounge room, and gave the co-offender permission to use it. As he turned back towards the front door he saw the respondent standing about a metre away from him, holding a sawn-off shotgun to his left shoulder, pointed at Mr Wellard's head. The respondent's finger was on the trigger. He told Mr Wellard to lie face down on the floor, which he did, and the respondent then sat on his back and placed the barrel of the gun to the back of his head. Mr Wellard believed that he was about to be shot in the head. 
    6    The respondent demanded money. Mr Wellard told him that he only had $1, so the respondent then taped his hands with duct tape behind his back. His legs were taped together as well and tape was placed around his mouth. He then told the co-offender to steal the video recorder from the television cabinet. 
    7    At that time Mr Wellard's brother, Allyn Wellard, was in his bedroom. He heard raised voices and opened the bedroom door. The respondent pointed the shotgun at Mr Allyn Wellard and told him to lie down or he would shoot him. Mr Allyn Wellard replied that he would go back to his room, which he did, and closed the door. As Mr Allyn Wellard stood behind his bedroom door with his left hand extended holding the door shut by the door handle the respondent discharged the shotgun. The shot penetrated the door and Mr Allyn Wellard was struck in the upper chest and chin by a number of pellets. 
    8    The respondent and the co-offender then left the premises and drove away in a silver-coloured Camira sedan. Later police and ambulance arrived and Mr Allyn Wellard was taken to hospital and treated for his injury; namely, three puncture wounds to the right pectoral region and one puncture wound to the right side of his chin and some grazes. 
    9    On about 6 March the respondent and the co-offender were arrested and taken to Cessnock police station where the co-offender was interviewed. Later police interviewed the respondent and he denied any knowledge or involvement in the crime, and also denied pawning the stolen video recorder. 
    10    Whilst he was being interviewed police executed a search warrant on premises belonging to the respondent's mother and located a sawn-off 12 gauge shotgun. They then informed the respondent what they had found and conducted a further interview with him in which he admitted that he had gone with the co-offender to the victim's premises with the intention of stealing money and cannabis. He stated that when they went there he was in possession of a shortened shotgun and cartridge. 
    11    The respondent said that when the co-offender was allowed into the premises he loaded a single cartridge into the shotgun and approached the first victim, pointing the shotgun at him. He said he tied the victim up with duct tape and looked under the lounge for money and cannabis. He said at that stage the second victim came out of the bedroom and he asked him to lie on the floor but when the victim closed the door and returned to his bedroom he swung around and the shotgun went off which passed through the door. He said that he did not intend to discharge the firearm, but his Honour expressly found that he fired it deliberately. 
    12    The respondent said that the co-offender had stolen the video recorder from the lounge room at his request and he also admitted pawning it for the sum of $50, which was spent on food, and he said that after the incident he secreted the shotgun in the washing machine in his mother's garage.13    The respondent was born on 23 April 1971 and was, accordingly, aged twenty-eight at the time he stood for sentencing. He was the eldest of three children. His parents separated when he was young and both his father and grandfather were heavy drinkers and prone to violence. He was raised principally by his mother and stepfather, but he felt the latter never accepted him and flogged him so that he often ran away to his grandparents' home. 
    14    The respondent told the psychologist, Ms Barrier, that he played up at school but did not have a lot of trouble with school work. He completed Year 10 but was not awarded the School Certificate on account of disciplinary reasons. Since leaving school he has generally been in employment but shortly before the offence, due to a back injury and retrenchment, he became unemployed with the result that he and his co-offender, who was his de facto wife, lost the rented premises in which they were living; and at the time of the offence they were living in a tent in a caravan park. He had known his de facto wife for fifteen years and been in a relationship with her for six. There is one child of the union, aged three. 
    15    He said that he used alcohol to excess and also used amphetamines and cannabis but was not addicted to either. 
    16    The psychologist concluded that he suffered a personality disorder with paranoid features with the result that he would be wary and distrustful of others and felt characteristically embittered and resentful and tended to be over-sensitive and defensive.17    The respondent has a criminal record going back for many years, involving assault and robbery as a juvenile, whilst as an adult he has a number of relevant offences including eight convictions for assault, including assault police, four for malicious damage, two for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two for malicious wounding and one for stealing. He has served a number of terms of imprisonment. The longest was a minimum term of nine months with an additional term of three months in 1993 to a charge of malicious wounding and most recently, three months on two counts of assault police in 1994. Although his record showed a bad and very alarming propensity to violence, there was only one previous stealing offence as an adult and nothing which, on the face of it, indicated a prior use of firearms, although it may be expected that the charges of malicious wounding probably involved a weapon of some nature. 
    18    This was the first time he had committed an offence which was dealt with on indictment, and after his prison sentence in 1994 for assaulting police he did not return to prison until apprehended for the present matter. 
    19    He pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was originally committed to the District Court for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902 but the Crown presented an indictment containing reframed counts. 
    20    In his favour it can be said that he was not a drug addict committing armed robberies on a regular basis as a means of supporting a drug habit and, notwithstanding his propensity to violent criminal behaviour, he had generally been in honest and regular employment and in a stable domestic relationship. 
    21    As his Honour correctly acknowledged, the starting point in a matter such as this is the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, although his Honour correctly acknowledged that that was a case under s 97(1); namely, robbery armed with an offensive weapon or in company and it carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment, whereas this offence is under s 98 and carries a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment. It also involves the additional elements of assault or wounding a person and, therefore, generally the range of penalties should be higher than the penalties for offences under s 97(1). 
    22    In Henry at paras [161] to [165] this Court laid down a guideline penalty of four to five years for the full term in cases under s 97(1) involving: 
     
      
       
       (1) Young offender with little or no criminal history. 
        
       (2) Weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
        
       (3) Limited degree of planning. 
        
       (4) Limited, if not actual, violence but a real threat thereof. 
        
       (5) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
        
       (6) Small amount taken. 
        
       (7) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
      
     In relation to these criteria I note the following: 
      
       
       (1) This respondent was not a young offender but was twenty-nine years old and he had a considerable criminal history including many offences involving violence. 
        
       (2) The weapon was not a knife or a similar weapon, but a loaded shotgun, much more dangerous than a knife and much more readily capable of causing death or grievous bodily harm. Indeed, a loaded shotgun is probably the most dangerous weapon available on a personal basis in the community. In addition, a shotgun, even if not loaded, is prone to cause panic and fear in the minds of victims, and this was in fact the case in the present instance. 
        
       (3) There was here more than a limited degree of planning. His co-offender was used to case the premises and entry was gained by the subterfuge of requesting to use the phone. 
        
       (4) This is not a case of limited violence but of quite substantial violence; two persons were assaulted, one had the gun held to the back of his head whilst tied up and gagged, and then a shot was fired at random through a door which caused actual wounding but which could have caused fatal injuries. 
        
       (5) Although the victim was not in an isolated position at night such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver, these were two pensioners, not particularly elderly, whose home was invaded in the middle of the night; and the community has a right to feel safe, particularly in their own homes at night: compare  
       R v Srey 
        (Court of Criminal Appeal - 1 November 1996) at p 4. 
        
       (6) There was only one item taken, the video recorder, which was pawned for the paltry amount of $50, but that is not why the respondent and his co-offender were there. They had heard that there was $2,000 and a supply of cannabis in the premises. I hasten to add that there is no suggestion that there was, but it was because of this belief that the offenders went there. 
        
       (8) There was a plea of guilty but its significance was limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
    23    In Henry at para [170] Spigelman CJ referred to a number of aggravating features including, in particular, the nature of the weapon, the scale of planning, the intensity of the threat or actual use of force and the effect on the victims. 
    24    I also refer to R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181 at 185 where the ascending seriousness of armed robberies involving the use of a firearm is discussed, and I note the situation here is at the top of the range. That case also emphasises the need for specific and general deterrence in cases of armed robbery, particularly where there is the use of a loaded gun. 
    25    These considerations all indicate that there should have been a total sentence considerably higher than the range indicated in Henry. His Honour acknowledged this fact and the sentence of six and a half years is, of course, higher than the range suggested in Henry and, accordingly, the Crown cannot point to any specific errors of judgment in his Honour's reasoning.26    However, as pointed out in R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562, where the error does not appear in the reasons given by the sentencing judge the sentence itself may be manifestly excessive or inadequate and thus disclose error. 
    27    In my opinion, that is the position here. I consider that although his Honour imposed a sentence greater than the guideline indicated in Henry, the sentence imposed should have been much higher and, having regard to the matters I have referred to, I consider that a total sentence of at least eight or nine years was called for. 
    28    However, as Allpass points out, when in response to a Crown appeal the Court decides to re-sentence an offender it ordinarily gives recognition to the element of double jeopardy by imposing a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance, and does so in the light of all the facts and circumstances available to it at the time of sentencing, including events which have occurred after the original sentence. 
    29    In the present case reports from the gaol authorities and the certificates which have been tendered indicate that the respondent has been addressing drug and alcohol issues, has completed an anger management program and has been working in the prison industries. Not surprisingly, in view of his pre-sentence work history, he is described by his supervisor as a good and reliable worker. Provided he continues in this way his prospects for rehabilitation are good. 
    30    Before leaving the matter I should refer to the question of the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission. The use and limitations of such statistics have been described in a number of cases, including Bloomfield (Court of Criminal Appeal - 15 July 1998). The sentence imposed in this case was within the range indicated by those statistics. However, those statistics, both in respect of offenders and those with prior offences of a different type, cover a period 1990 to 1999 and, in my opinion, their use needs to be qualified by reference to the guidelines set in Henry. Those guidelines were set because the Court concluded that there had been a pattern of systematic leniency in relation to offences of this and a similar nature, and so when considering statistics relating to the period before Henry it is necessary, to have regard to that factor. 
    31    For these reasons, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. Having regard to the principles to which I have referred dealing with Crown appeals, and so as not to interrupt any more than is necessary the respondent's progress towards rehabilitation I propose that the appeal be upheld but a sentence be imposed which is somewhat less than I consider should have been imposed at first instance. 
    32    I would, therefore, allow the Crown appeal, quash the sentence imposed by his Honour and in lieu thereof order that the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of five and a half years to date from 11 March 1999 and to expire on 10 September 2004, with an additional term of two years. The earliest date on which the respondent would be eligible to be released on parole would be 10 September 2004. 
    33    FOSTER AJA: I agree. 
    34    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
    35    DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will, therefore, be as I have indicated. The exhibits may be returned.

     REGINA v Eric Leonard MURRAY 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   HULME J: In this matter the court is in a position to give judgment and I will ask Carruthers AJ to give the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Eric Leonard Murray seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by McGuire DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 25 November 1999. 
    3   On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count under s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900, - receiving, which carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for ten years. 
    4   There was a second count, firstly, of armed robbery under s 97 (1) of the Crimes Act with an alternative second count of receiving. 
    5   The applicant pleaded guilty to the receiving count and the Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the second count. He also pleaded guilty to two counts, namely 3 and 4 under s 62 (1) (b) of the Firearms Act 1996, commonly referred to as ""possession of shortened firearm"", which carries a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
    6   In relation to each of counts 3 and 4, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two years imprisonment to commence on 25 November 1999 and to expire on 24 November 2001. In relation to each of counts 1 and 2 his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 12 months imprisonment to commence on 25 November 2001 and expire on 24 November 2002, with an additional term of 18 months to commence on 25 November 2002 and expire on 24 May 2004. 
    7   The applicant was born on 3 April 1931 and was accordingly 68 years of age at the date of sentence. Before I turn to the facts relating to the subject matters I shall deal briefly with his subjective circumstances. 
    8   His prior criminal record contains eighteen entries culminating with a fine for theft on 13 November 1975. He came from what would now be referred to as a dysfunctional family and received little formal education or training. He spent some time employed as a bell boy, then barman and then ship's steward on the Australian coast and subsequently he was employed in some capacity on the wharves. In more recent years his employment has been intermittent. 
    9   He has been married to his present wife for some 45 years. She has experienced continuing health problems. The applicant suffered from severe meningitis as a boy. At an early age, when he worked as a paper boy on the trams, he occasioned a severe head injury with considerable laceration of the face requiring restorative surgery to his left arm with major facial scaring. Psychometric assessment indicated diminished cognitive skills which may be due to the head injury and the meningitis. About four years ago the applicant suffered a heart attack. He presently suffers from both circulatory and gastrointestinal disease with periods of internal bleeding. 
    10   He has an occlusion of his carotid artery which increases his risk of stroke. He also suffers from ulcers. Psychometric testing in November 1999 demonstrated that he was suffering from severe depression. A medical report indicates that he requires ongoing supervision and medication for his heart and his gastrointestinal condition. Both conditions are significant and require ongoing medical management and supervision. 
    11   I turn then to the relevant facts which may conveniently be taken from the statement of facts before his Honour under the hand of Detective Senior Constable Justin Hallett of 25 November 1999. This statement which was adopted by McGuire DCJ in his remarks on sentence is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       "" 
       COUNT 1 
        
        
       On 24 April, 1998 Police Officers from Strike Force COLOMBO executed a search warrant at the premises of 4 Furber Street, Centennial Park. These are the premises of Beryl DOCTOR the sister of Lola Fay MacLEAN a close friend of the prisoner. 
        
        
       The warrant was executed as a result of information obtained from a lawfully obtained listening device, on telecommunications service 02 93872518 leased in the name of Eric Leonard MURRAY of unit 3 No 4 Prospect Street, Waverley. 
        
        
       Conversations were intercepted between the prisoner and Lola MacLEAN the content of these conversations indicated that police had been to Beryl DOCTOR's home. The prisoner showed concern regarding items which had been left at Beryl's premises by Ms MacLEAN. The prisoner requested that Ms MacLEAN attend her sister's premises at Centennial Park and retrieve these items. 
        
        
       During the search of the premises at Centennial Park, police located underneath the rear ground decking a blue plastic bag. Inside this bag were items of jewellery and jewellery pouches. 
        
        
       Statements obtained from Ms MacLEAN and Ms DOCTOR establish that the prisoner had given those items of jewellery along with other costume jewellery to Lola MacLEAN as gifts or presents. 
        
        
       One of the items of jewellery recovered by police is described as a gold charm bracelet, which has a number of gold charms hanging from it. Along with this item of jewellery were two jewellery carry pouches, one mauve and one red. The gold charm bracelet had an approximate value of $2,000.00. 
        
        
       The gold charm bracelet and carry pouches have been identified by their owner Mrs Britta RYAN who resides in the Manly area. Mrs RYAN was the victim of a robbery whilst armed in circumstances of aggravation offence, (home invasion), about 2.00 am on the 17th July, 1997 in which these items and other property were stolen. 
        
        
       While police were executing the search warrant at the premises of 4 Furber St, the prisoner attended to take possession of the items from Ms MacLEAN. He was subsequently arrested and charged. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
       COUNT 2 
        
        
       On 12th December, 1997 Police Officers from Strike Force COLOMBO executed a search warrant at the premises of Eric MURRAY at unit 3 of number 4 Prospect Street, Waverley. 
        
        
       During the course of the search warrant numerous items were located and seized. Located in the pocket of a jacket hanging up in the wardrobe of the prisoners bedroom were a number of items. These consisted of two gold bracelets, gold pendant, gold 'Dunhill' brand cigarette lighter and a gold 'Raymond Renee' brand men's watch. The approximate value of these items was $5,000.00. 
        
        
       These items have been identified by Margaret FALLOON and William MADDEN of 38 Bulls Road, Burraneer Bay as their property. These items amongst other items were stolen during the course of a robbery whilst armed in circumstances of aggravation offence, (home invasion), which occurred at their premises in the early hours of the 11th September 1997. 
        
        
       The items of jewellery were located in pocket of a jacket handing up in the wardrobe in the prisoners bedroom. When questioned about the jacket he stated that it was his. When asked if he was able to say who owns the jewellery he stated ""No."" He was later interviewed at Waverley Police Station but declined to comment in relation to his possession of the items. 
        
        
       COUNTS 3 AND 4 
        
        
       On 12 December, 1997 Police Officers from Strike Force COLOMBO executed a search warrant at the premises of Eric MURRAY at unit 3 of number 4 Prospect Street, Waverley. 
        
        
       A search was conducted of the prisoners bedroom, which contained a large wooden wardrobe. An item resembling a balaclava and two shotgun shells were located in a black bag on top of this wardrobe. Along the lower portion of this wardrobe were a number of drawers. One of the drawers were removed and secreted underneath this drawer were two loaded, shortened pump action shotguns. One of which is described as a Bentley brand, 12 gauge pump action shotgun, wrapped in a yellow towel. The main body of the gun was marked with the letters 'D' and 'S' on either side. 
        
        
       When both of these shotguns were removed from beneath the wardrobe they both appeared to be in good condition and free from any dust or dirt. 
        
        
       Upon initial contact at the search warrant the prisoner was questioned specifically whether he had any firearms in his premises which he said he did not. (Statement of D.S.C. SIPOS paragraph 8). 
        
        
       When police located the two shotguns the prisoner was again cautioned by Detective Sergeant SHORT. He was asked about the guns, Sgt SHORT said, 'What can you tell me about that gun?' the prisoner said 'Not a thing.' Sgt SHORT said, 'Does that gun belong to you?' the prisoner said, 'No, it certainly does not.' Sgt SHORT said 'Can you tell me who it belongs to?' the prisoner said, 'No, I wouldn't have a clue.' Sgt SHORT said, 'You've never seen that gun before, is that what you're telling me?' the prisoner said, 'I'm not saying, but it ain't mine.' (Transcript of audio of search warrant, 13.12.97, page 7) 
        
        
       The prisoner was not the holder of a Firearms Licence or Permit nor was he the holder of a Permit or authorised to have in his possession the two shortened pump action shotguns."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    12   When sentencing the applicant his Honour said, in relation to the firearms offences: 
     
      
       
       ""Their only possible purpose involved major illegality. Shortened pump action shotguns are not kept as protection, souvenirs, heirlooms nor for some innocent pursuit such as hunting. They were simply weapons designed or adapted to inflict destruction or to create terror. To my mind the possession of loaded shortened pump action shotguns represents criminal conduct of a very high order."" 
       
      
       
      
     His Honour added:  
      
       
       ""There is no evidence that the prisoner actually used these weapons in any criminal endeavour or that he intended to use them. However, the potential for their use was ever present. The presence of the balaclava and the additional shotgun cartridges is at odds with the prisoner's claim to his Probation and Parole Officer that the shotguns were left with him to be looked after some six or seven years ago by an acquaintance now deceased."" 
        
        
       
      
    13   That being so, the applicant came to be sentenced in relation to the firearm offences upon the basis that there was no explanation before his Honour for the possession of the weapons. As to the receiving matters, his Honour accepted that the applicant may not have been aware that the jewellery was from the proceeds of major robberies. However, his Honour said that the applicant was fully aware that the items of jewellery had been stolen in some manner. 
    14   As to the subjective circumstances, his Honour accepted that there were special circumstances and thus varied the prima facie ratio between minimum and additional terms of the sentences imposed. 
    15   An important plank in the forceful arguments presented by Mr Byrne of senior counsel on behalf of the applicant was that all these matters to which the applicant pleaded guilty could have been dealt with summarily by reason of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. If the receiving matters had been dealt with summarily the maximum penalty in respect of each matter would have been one year. If the firearm offences had been dealt with summarily the maximum penalty which could have been imposed in respect of each offence was two years. His Honour specifically adverted to the fact that the firearm matters could have been dealt with summarily. However, he made no reference to the fact that the receiving matters could you have been dealt with summarily. Bearing in mind the vast experience of the sentencing judge, I would be quite unable to conclude that his Honour would not have been unaware, by reference to his knowledge of the relevant legislation and the value of the jewellery received by the applicant, that the receiving matters could have been dealt with summarily. 
    16   It was put to the Court by Mr Byrne SC that in effect, and I hope I am not misquoting him, it was only something of a accident that the matters came to be before the District Court in that the indictment contained a count of armed robbery which was not pursued. It is a question of discretion for the Director of Public Prosecutions whether matters such as this be proceeded with in the Local Court or the District Court, and it would only be in a rare matter, I would have thought, that this Court would be prepared to express a view as to whether it was or was not appropriate for the Director to have elected to proceed in the District Court in relation to certain matters as distinct from the Local Court. However, in view of the forceful argument that was put to this Court in this regard, I have no hesitation in expressing my view that, independently of the armed robbery count, it would have been clearly appropriate, if I may respectfully say so, for the Director to have commenced these proceedings in the District Court. It is, however, a factor as the law presently stands, for consideration in the sentencing process. 
    17   Senior counsel for the applicant also relied upon the fact that the applicant had not been before a court for 24 years prior to being dealt with for the subject offences and this was the first occasion upon which he had been before a court on indictment. 
    18   As to the firearms possession charges, he submitted that the rejection by his Honour of the applicant's explanation for the possession of the weapons did not lead to a conclusion, and was not capable in law to lead to a conclusion, that the applicant was involved in the use of weapons. The point was made that the applicant was charged with possession of the subject weapons and not with the use of the subject weapons. One must, of course, bear in mind in this context the judgment of this court in Thurgar (1990) 51 A Crim R 109, which concerned the possession of an unlicensed pistol, contrary to s 25 of the Firearms and Dangerous Weapons Act 1973, where Gleeson CJ said (at 117):  
     
      
       
       ""It is not accurate to say, as was submitted on behalf of the appellant, that the learned judge was obliged to sentence the appellant on the basis that there was nothing more to the second charge than the bare fact of possession of an unlicensed pistol. There is also the circumstance that no innocent explanation for such purpose had been advanced by the appellant…"" 
       
      
    19   That observation is often referred to and has now stood for some ten years. When dealing with the quantum of the sentence imposed in relation to the firearms matters, Mr Berman of counsel for the Crown also drew attention to the following passage in the judgment of the Gleeson CJ (at 113) where the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        ""Subject to an important qualification that will be mentioned below, as the learned trial judge said, the most obvious circumstance calling for the imposition of the penalty at the higher end of the range would be one relating to the purpose for which such a weapon was possessed. In particular, and again subject to the qualification to be mentioned below, the possession of such a pistol for a purpose connected with proposed criminal activities would be likely to be the kind of thing that would lead to the imposition of a penalty close to the maximum."" 
       
      
       
    20   I think I am correct in saying that the relevant maximum for that offence in Thurgar was four years imprisonment. When one considers what the Chief justice said in Thurgar, the fact that these ""fearsome weapons"", as McGuire DCJ described them, were in a concealed position in the applicant's home, fully loaded and in serviceable condition in close proximity to a balaclava, gives a somewhat chilling aspect to the possession charges; albeit one must, as I have indicated, constantly bear in mind that the applicant was only charged with possession not use. However, that charge must be considered in the light of the gloss contained in Thurgar. 
    21   With regard to the receiving matters, Senior Counsel for the applicant submitted that the evidence was such that it was impossible to conclude that the applicant was a professional receiver because he had the subject jewellery in his possession for a longer period than one would reasonably expect of a professional. Senior Counsel also relied upon certain relevant statistics of the Judicial Commission. However, in this particular matter, if I may respectfully say so, one does not really get any significant assistance from those statistics, helpful as they may be in certain other cases. They certainly demonstrate, however, strange as it may be thought, that the vast majority of shortened firearm possession matters are dealt with in the Local Court. Generally stated, they indicate that the subject sentences, both in relation to the receiving matters and the possession matters, if one looks at both the Local Court and the District Court statistics, are in the higher echelon of the sentences imposed in these types of offences. 
    22   The applicant had before his Honour and before this Court, a strong subjective case particularly by reason of the fact that he had no prior criminal conviction for some 25 years, these were his first indictable offences and, significantly, his age and his poor medical condition. However, those matters are overtaken by the objective seriousness of both the receiving and the possession matters. This Court has said on innumerable occasions that in appropriate cases subjective circumstances must yield to the deterrent aspect. 
    23   His age and health does, speaking for myself, cause me concern. However, there are provisions in the Sentencing Act 1989, where the appropriate authorities may take account of a person's health as an exceptional and extenuating circumstance. I refer, of course, to s 25 A (1) of that Act. 
    24   Giving full weight to the arguments put on behalf of the applicant, all of which I have not dealt been specifically referred to in this judgment, and balancing the subjective and the objective circumstances, I am quite unable to conclude that the sentences imposed by his Honour were outside the sentencing discretion available to him. In the circumstances I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    25   HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and, with one reservation, with his Honour's reasons. The one reservation concerns his Honour's reference to the provision of the Sentencing Act bearing on the care of the applicant while in prison. I do not find it necessary to rely on that aspect of the matter. I would add only this: but for the applicant's age I would have regarded the sentence imposed on him, having regard particularly to the presence of two loaded shortened shotguns in the near vicinity of the balaclava when the maximum punishment prescribed for the possession of but one of those weapons for ten years, as woefully inadequate. If the community and its representatives are serious about getting rid of this sort of weapon, sentences far, far higher than disclosed in the statistics put before us should surely be imposed. 
    26   The order of the court is the application is dismissed.

     REGINA v Martin WOOD. 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: The applicant, Martin Wood, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Rummery QC at the Penrith District Court on 20 October 1995 following the cancellation by his Honour of a periodic detention order made by Judge Graham at the Parramatta District Court on 30 June 1994. 
    2   The brief history of the matter is as follows. The applicant was born on 25 May 1969 and has a history of addiction to alcohol dating back, it is said, to about 12 years of age. Later, there is history of an addiction to drugs. He does appear, however, to have come from a good home, and his family is still supportive of him. Prior to 15 January 1994, which is the date of the subject offence, the applicant had been before Local Courts and Children's Courts on four occasions. In 1993, he served a period of six months periodic detention for stealing from the person. 
    3   On 15 January 1994, he was employed at the Shell Service Station at Lethbridge Park. On that date, in company with one Robert John May, he robbed another employee of $21,620, the property of the service station proprietor. At the time, the co-offender was armed, to the knowledge of the applicant, with a long knife which was used to terrify and subdue Mr May, who was thereupon tied to the door handle of a room in the service station. 
    4   Working together, the two men, aided by the applicant's knowledge of the security system within the service station, removed the stolen money from the safe. 
    5   The applicant was charged with robbery in company, under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. 
    6   As indicated, the applicant was sentenced by Judge Graham at Parramatta District Court on 30 June 1994. His Honour took into account the fact that the applicant had provided considerable assistance to the authorities and also took into account, from the subjective point of view, his addiction to amphetamines and his long history of alcohol abuse. 
    7   His Honour acknowledged the substantial risks to which the applicant would have been exposed if a full time custodial sentence were imposed, by reason of the assistance which he had afforded to the authorities. His Honour took into account, of course, the plea of guilty and what he considered to be the genuine remorse and contrition attending that plea. 
    8   Accordingly, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of three years penal servitude to be served by way of periodic detention. His Honour directed that the applicant report to the Periodic Detention Centre, Emu Plains, by 7 pm on Friday 8 July 1994. 
    9   Regrettably, the applicant failed to take advantage of the obvious leniency which had been afforded to him by Judge Graham and accumulated total of 18 absences without leave, albeit he had served as at 20 October 1995, 36 weeks of the sentence. 
    10   The Department of Corrective Services applied to the District Court for cancellation of the periodic detention order. A notice of listing of this application was sent to the applicant's home at Tregear on 29 June 1995 requiring the applicant's attendance at the Penrith District Court on 18 August 1995. The applicant attended in person on that day and, at his request, was granted an adjournment until 15 September 1995. 
    11   On 15 September 1995, the applicant again attended. On this occasion, Mr Mulder of the Legal Aid Commission appeared as amicus curiae to assist the court on his behalf. The matter was then adjourned by consent until 20 October 1995. 
    12   It is now apparent, by reason of evidence before this Court that the applicant decided, after discussion with his partner, that he would not attend court on 20 October 1995. He and his partner decided that they would start a new life and move to Newcastle. They were aware at the time that, as a consequence, the applicant would ultimately have to go to gaol. They said, however, that no-one ever came looking for him. They came back to Sydney in 1999 because his partner's father was dying of cancer. 
    13   The matter duly came before Judge Rummery on 20 October 1995 and the applicant did not appear and no explanation was given for his non-appearance. At the request of the legal representative of the Commissioner for Corrective Services, his Honour dealt with the matter in the absence of the applicant. His Honour was informed by the Departmental representative that the period remaining to be served on the periodic detention order was 121 weeks. 
    14   On this date, s.27(4) of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981 was still in force. That subsection enabled the court to set minimum and additional terms, if it thought fit, and make a parole order. 
    15   His Honour did not have the advantage, obviously, of any submissions on behalf of the applicant. His Honour considered that the only question for him was whether, in sentencing the applicant in respect of the unexpired portion of the periodic detention order, he should impose a minimum and additional term. He decided that he should adopt that course, and applied what is sometimes referred to as a statutory ratio. Thus his Honour ordered that the applicant serve the unexpired portion of the sentence imposed by Judge Graham by way of a minimum term of 91 weeks from the date of arrest and an additional term of 30 weeks to commence immediately upon the expiration of the minimum term. 
    16   His Honour directed that a warrant under s.26A of the Act issue. This seems to be an error for a warrant under s.26(1A) of the Act. Such a warrant was issued. 
    17   Be that as it may, the applicant remained at large until he was brought before Penrith Local Court on 27 April 1999 when he was convicted of one count of mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol and one count of drive whilst licence cancelled. On each charge he was sentenced by the Local Court to a fixed term of three months imprisonment to date, in each case, from 27 April 1999. 
    18   It is accepted that the applicant was arrested by the execution of the warrant under s.26(1A) of the Act on 27 April 1999. Accordingly, the applicant commenced to serve the sentence imposed by Judge Rummery as from 27 April 1999 with the minimum term expiring on 22 January 2001 and the additional term expiring on 20 August 2001. 
    19   An application for leave to appeal against the orders made by Judge Rummery on 20 October 1995 was lodged on 10 August 1999. The grounds of appeal state: 
     
      
       
       ""1. An order for periodic detention cancelled in my absence on 20 October 1995. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       2. I had medical certificates to explain my absence from periodic detention. These were not presented to the District Court."" 
       
      
     
     
     With regard to the late lodgment of the application for leave to appeal, the applicant stated: 
     
     
      
       
       ""I did not seek legal advice and I was unaware I had to lodge an appeal within 10 days."" 
       
      
     
    20   It has been pointed out to this Court in the applicant's written submissions that, at the time of the cancellation of the periodic detention order, Judge Rummery, necessarily, did not have the benefit of the subsequent decisions of this court in Wilson (1997) 93 A Crim R 301 or Webster (1998) 100 A Crim R 26, which decisions emphasise the practical undesirability of a court proceeding to hear a cancellation application in the absence of the detainee. See also the judgments of this Court in Biddle (unreported, 6 March 1997) and Lloyd (Terry) (unreported, 17 June 1997). 
    21   I will merely note what Smart J said in Webster at p 34: 
     
      
       
       ""The appeals which have come before this Court have demonstrated how necessary it is for detainees to be before the court when a judge is cancelling an order for periodic detention and deciding whether to fix minimum and additional terms and the length of each."" 
       
      
     
     
     And later at p 38, his Honour said: 
     
     
      
       
       ""I conclude that it is necessary for the proper, fair and effective administration of justice and the Act to imply a power that on the non-appearance of a detainee on a cancellation application and on the department establishing a prima facie case, the Local Court has the power to issue a warrant for the arrest of the detainee and to bring him before the court. Otherwise it is not possible to deal fairly with the detainee on the cancellation."" 
       
      
     
    22   It is true that the applicant elected not to present himself before Judge Rummery on 20 October and, as I have already indicated, his Honour necessarily did not have the benefit of subsequent decisions of this Court. However, in the light of the problems enunciated by the cases to which I have referred, commencing with Wilson, it is now manifestly clear that the course adopted by Judge Rummery was inappropriate. The appropriate course would have been to have a warrant issue for the arrest of the applicant, and the application for cancellation of the periodic detention order then dealt with in the presence of the applicant when he was brought before the court consequential upon his arrest. 
    23   In these circumstances, despite the careful arguments which have been put to this Court on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions by Mr Berman and, on behalf of the Commissioner for Corrective Services, by Mr O'Brien, I am of the view that the intervention of this Court is called for. It is necessary, therefore, for this Court to consider now, in the light of the evidence presently before it, whether the minimum and additional terms imposed by Judge Rummery should be varied and, if so, to what extent. 
    24   Firstly, one must consider as a factor that the translation of the unexpired 121 weeks of periodic detention into 121 weeks of full time custodial sentence necessarily constitutes a much harsher penalty for the applicant, albeit, he brought this situation upon himself. 
    25   The evidence, one is pleased to note, which has been put before this Court to demonstrate the attempts which the applicant has made towards his rehabilitation is very impressive indeed. I shall not deal in detail with this material, which comes both from officers within the Department of Corrective Services, who are concerned with the welfare of the applicant, as well as persons external to the Department who provided their services to assist the inmates with rehabilitation. 
    26   There is also some evidence of the applicant having an orthopaedic disability, which is a relevant consideration insofar as special circumstances are concerned. Thus, for my part, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances which require this Court to vary the ratio between the minimum and the additional terms fixed by Judge Rummery. 
    27   An additional factor which has been raised during the course of argument is that the first three months of the full time custodial sentence, which were served after the applicant's arrest on 27 April 1999, were served concurrently with the sentences imposed by the Local Court in relation to the PCA matter and the drive whilst unlicensed matter. That is a matter which should be taken into account in adjusting the ratio between the two terms. 
    28   The objective seriousness of the subject offence is, of course, another matter which has to be considered. Balancing the objective and subjective circumstances, I am of the view that the order made by Judge Rummery on 20 October 1995, to the extent that it involved the sentencing of the applicant to full time custodial sentence, should be quashed and, in lieu thereof, that this Court should impose the following orders, namely, that the applicant serve a minimum term of 91 weeks from 27 April 1999 and expiring on 29 September 2000 and that he serve an additional term of 30 weeks commencing on 30 September 2000 and expiring on 20 August 2001. 
    29   HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour's reasons. There is, however, one matter I would add. 
    30   In the decision of this court in Wilson v The Department of Corrective Services given on 12 February 1997 and reported in 93 A Crim R page 301, this court drew attention to the fact that the Department of Corrective Services and the Director of Public Prosecutions could not seem to make up their mind who, on behalf of the Crown, should appear in matters such as this. 
    31   While I appreciate that these days it seems to be important to government departments to shift as much as possible the costs of government onto some other department, it really is of no benefit to the taxpayer, who, after all, has to fund all departments to have representation in these sort of proceedings from two government departments when with a little co-operation it could be effected by one.  
    32   It seems to me a farce that three years after the remarks of this court in Wilson these two government organisations cannot agree amongst themselves to have one representative in matters such as these. After all, both represent the Crown and the Crown has an interest in the result of the proceedings. 
    33   The orders of the court are, accordingly, as outlined by Carruthers AJ.

     REGINA v Paul Stephen RICHMOND 
      
     JUDGMENT:  
    1   DUNFORD J: In this matter I will ask Smart AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   SMART AJ The Crown appeals against the alleged inadequacy of a sentence of 300 hours of community service in respect of the offence that Mr Richmond falsely stated that he was the driver of BMW motor vehicle number 825-CNZ (Qld) when it was involved in a collision with Toyota motor vehicle number TV-1976 which resulted in the death of Lewis Ryu with intent to hinder police investigations into the identity of the driver of motor vehicle number 825-CNZ for the offence of dangerous driving causing death. This offence under s 315 of the Crimes Act, 1900 carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
    3   The Crown case was that on 2 March 1997 Mr Richmond was a passenger in the BMW which collided with a Toyota minibus after the BMW went through a red traffic lights on New South Head Road at the corner of McLaughlin Street, travelling in excess of 60-70 kilometres per hour. Mr Ryu was killed and another occupant of the minibus was seriously injured. 
    4   The driver was seen to get out of the BMW, walk around the vehicle and look in at the front passenger side from outside the vehicle and leave the scene. Mr Richmond was removed by police officers, ambulance officers and paramedics from the front passenger side area. He was wedged in. He was taken to hospital suffering from fractured ribs and bruising. He was treated in hospital for five days. 
    5   Mr Richmond stated at the scene that he was the driver. He continued to assert that during an ERISP interview on 21 March 1997. He maintained that he had a green light immediately prior to the collision and that he was driving very slowly.  
    6   On 30 August 1997 when formally requested by the police to supply the name and details of the driver he replied that he did not commit an offence and that he was the driver. The police did not accept that Mr Richmond was the driver, having compelling evidence that he was not.  
    7   Mr Richmond was charged and subsequently committed for trial in November 1998, some four witnesses having been cross-examined. On 25 February 1999 he pleaded guilty to the subject offence. The Crown had apparently contemplated laying a more serious charge. Thereafter the sentencing hearing was adjourned from time to time for reasons not before this Court. 
    8   On 6 September 1999 Mr Richmond’s solicitor forwarded to the DPP’s office a facsimile copy of an unsigned draft statement from Mr Richmond wherein he nominated Louise Hall as the driver of the vehicle. The police experienced some difficulty in contacting Mr Richmond whom they claimed, did not return telephone calls. Eventually, on 29 September 1999 Mr Richmond supplied a telephone number and an address in London for Miss Louise Hall. The police made further inquiries.  
    9   In November 1999 the police had received information that Louise Hall was believed to be residing in Perth, Western Australia. On 21 November 1999 the police sought to contact Mr Richmond. On the afternoon of 22 November 1999 he attended Kingsgrove police station and was interviewed by the police. 
    10   In his evidence before the sentencing judge Mr Richmond said that he was prepared to give evidence on any occasion if the DPP required him to do so. He said that at some distance Louise Hall might appear to be a male, given the slimness of her build. He could not understand why the police had trouble contacting him as they had his mobile telephone number. 
    11   It seems that on the morning of the accident Mr Richmond left his home and his wife to go to a nightclub/bar he ran at Kings Cross. He picked up Ms Hall on the way. She was an English tourist with whom he had been having an affair for the previous ten days. He claimed that he did not want his wife to find out about it; their marriage was rocky. 
    12   For some months prior to the accident Mr Richmond had been depressed as a result of an acrimonious parting with his father and sister arising out of difficulties in the conduct of the family business in Cairns. He claimed that he was subjected to unjust criticism from family members. Relations were such that he withdrew from the family business at a large personal and financial cost to himself and came to Sydney with his wife and two young children to start afresh. The business in Sydney required a great deal of his personal attention and time.  
    13   The judge found, and it was open to him to do so, that when asked by the police about the accident Mr Richmond was still suffering from the after-effects of the injury and his depression which had deepened noticeably. The judge seemed to accept that Mr Richmond chose not to tell the truth about who was the driver of the BMW in order to try and prevent what would probably have been a catastrophic end to his marriage and his business.  
    14   Mr Richmond said that he was unable to work after the accident for many months. He could not settle down and apply himself. His wife stepped in and shouldered a heavy load. Notwithstanding this and because of his condition he lost the business with consequential financial loss. The judge observed that the decisions made by Mr Richmond not to supply accurate information were reprehensible.  
    15   It is understandable, but not justifiable a man might lie to hide an affair from his wife if he thought that would completely end his marriage and he did not want that to happen, or even to protect his lover. Mr Richmond must have been in a desperate and disordered state. He took the risk of being convicted of a serious driving offence and being sent to gaol. In one sense this was to lie against his own interests. 
    16   Under s 315 of the Crimes Act 1900 the offence of Mr Richmond lay in the lie he told, not in failing to disclose the name of the driver and her address. Section 315(3) provides that it is not an offence against this section merely to refuse or to fail to divulge information. Of course, it is an offence not to supply the name and address of the driver to the police on request. This was the position both under the Motor Traffic Act 1909 and under its successor, the Road Transport (General) Act. 
    17   As earlier mentioned, the police did not believe Mr Richmond’s assertion that he was the driver. The police lost time and incurred expense in obtaining an expert report and in making investigations. It should not be assumed that at any stage Miss Hall would or would not agree to being interviewed. This is not known. 
    18   The judge recognised that the delay would make it more difficult for the Crown to prove its case. The judge recorded that Mr Richmond and his wife had separated in November 1998 but that there was a real possibility of their marriage being rescued and revived. 
    19   Mr Richmond was born on 16 November 1960. He has had but one previous conviction; namely, driving under the influence in 1982. That can safely be disregarded. For some time, prior to the date of sentencing Mr Richmond had been employed in a responsible position and was doing well. He was building up his employer’s business and earning a good salary. He often worked seven days per week.  
    20   The judge was reluctant to take a course which would result in Mr Richmond losing his job when he was rehabilitating himself so well after being injured, suffering depression (for which he had been on medication) and losing his business. Family considerations were not overlooked.  
    21   A submission was put to the Court on behalf of Mr Richmond that the Crown could not now urge that a custodial sentence be imposed because it had not sought that at the hearing before the sentencing judge. When one has regard to the remarks of the solicitor for the Crown at the sentencing hearing and the judge’s remarks at page 8 of his judgment, it is apparent that the question of a custodial sentence was at least in contemplation. 
    22   The offence was serious but it had unusual aspects and there were strong subjective features. It is over five months since Mr Richmond was sentenced and over three years since the offence. Considerations of double jeopardy are important when there has already been a large measure of recovery and no custodial sentence has been imposed. 
    23   This Court has the advantage of having Mr Richmond’s situation brought up to date. That indicates that he now has different employment and that he is, again, in receipt of a substantial income. Importantly, he, his wife and the children have become reconciled and are living together at Bondi. 
    24   While the police were subjected to additional expense and there was probably some delay in the investigation, it could not be said that Mr Richmond’s criminality extended to other than making a false statement which was not accepted. 
    25   In the whole, of the circumstances, I am of the view that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
    26   DUNFORD J: I agree, 
    27   FOSTER AJA: I likewise agree. 
    28   DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will, therefore be that the Crown appeal is dismissed.

     2977/97 RICHARD RUSSELL HUNT v PETER JAMES BARLOW 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: These proceedings relate principally to the ownership of an interest as one of two tenants in common in equal shares in the property at 62-64 Nuwarra Road, Moorebank, New South Wales, in Certificate of Title Volume 7917 Folio 225. The building there is a former squash court which was used by Hi-Rel Pty Ltd for its manufacturing and other operations. The registered proprietors are the plaintiff Richard Russell Hunt and Harry Barlow, each as proprietor of a half share. Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow purchased the property from the previous registered proprietor, Mr K.C. Linden, by a contract dated 15 September 1987 and completed the purchase on 13 November 1987; the transfer was registered on 12 January 1988.  
    2   Mr Harry Barlow died intestate on or about 20 July 1995. The defendant Mr Peter James Barlow is one of his sons, and he obtained letters of administration from this court on 30 January 1996. 
    3   The proceedings turn on issues of fact, the principal issue being whether the deceased did in fact agree to transfer his interest to the plaintiff in a written agreement dated 2 December 1994. The defendant denies that any such agreement was made, and through his counsel has suggested that the evidence of the agreement given by the plaintiff and Mr Kenneth Livingstone is fabricated evidence, that the events they give evidence of did not in truth ever happen, that the copy of a written agreement which they put forward is a forgery, and that the document was created after Mr Harry Barlow died. Although there are other issues, most of the material in evidence relates directly to the alleged agreement or to probabilities which bear on whether the agreement was made as alleged.  
    4   The plaintiff bears the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities, that the agreement was made; the defendant does not bear any onus of proof. Suggestions by the defendant that there has been wrongful and criminal behaviour require careful consideration, but they do not alter the standard of proof, or the burden of proof, which remains on the plaintiff throughout. In Briginshaw v. Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361 Dixon J stated the standard of proof thus: “The truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found.” 
    5   Where a claim is made against the estate of a deceased person and knowledge of the facts on which the claim is based is not available to those who represent the estate, judicial experience requires a careful approach to fact-finding, although there are no special legal rules relating to the burden or to the standard of proof. In Plunket v Bull (1915) 19 CLR 544 at 548-549 observations of Isaacs J show how such cases are scrutinised. Isaacs J said: 
     
      
       
       “Then we come to the question how far the onus of proof which lay upon the plaintiff was satisfied. She had the burden of establishing the original creation of the indebtedness of the deceased to her, and undoubtedly it is established that in cases of this sort the Court scrutinizes very carefully a claim against the estate of a deceased person. It is not that the Court looks on the plaintiff’s case with suspicion and as  
       prima facie 
        fraudulent, but it scrutinizes the evidence very carefully to see whether it is true or untrue. In the case of  
       Lachmi Parshad v. Maharajah Narendro Kishore Singh Bahadur 
        some observations were made by the Privy Council with reference to the sufficiency of proof. In that case their Lordships were not satisfied that the plaintiff had established a reasonably clear case. For instance, he had failed to bring forward evidence which he ought to have brought forward, and which was available. That was a material circumstance, and having regard also to some other circumstances of the case their Lordships thought that his appeal should fail. Lord  
       Morris 
        said: ‘In an action brought to recover money against an executor, or, as in this case, the heir, of a deceased person, it has always been considered necessary to establish as reasonably clear a case as the facts will admit of, to guard against the danger of false claims being brought against a person who is dead and thus is not able to come forward and give an account for himself.’” 
       
      
    6   Other members of the High Court did not refer to this subject and the authorities cited by counsel (at 545) do not appear to relate to it.  
    7   There were also expressions of caution in Birmingham v. Renfrew (1937) 57 CLR 666, which related to mutual wills; Latham CJ referred to the need for care at 674 and Dixon J at 681 said: “Such an agreement can be established only by clear and satisfactory evidence.” There is no legal requirement for corroborative evidence: see In Re Cummins (dec’d); Cummins v Thompson [1972] 1 Ch 62 at 68-69. See too Grundel v. The Registrar General (1990) 5 BPR 97-340 at 11,219 (McLelland J). These cases express the results of much judicial experience in fact-finding.  
    8   In dealing with the facts in Lachmi v Maharaja, (1891) LR 19 IA 9, to which Isaacs J referred, the Judicial Committee took a remarkably exacting approach and showed an expectation that all persons involved in the transaction in any way should be called. It would not always be appropriate to make such exacting requirements, but in the present case the plaintiff in fact called all persons allegedly involved in making the agreement who could be called, and reasonable limits have to be accepted to the expectation that the plaintiff will call witnesses who might be able to deal with corroborating circumstances.  
    9   Mr Hunt and Mr Harry Barlow formed Hi-Rel Pty Ltd in 1978. 5000 shares of $1 each were issued to each of them; no other shares have ever been issued. Each became a director; Mr Hunt still is. Mr Harry Barlow remained a director until his death. Except for disputed events which are said to have made Mr Peter Barlow a director there has never been any other director. Hi-Rel’s business was to manufacture electrical and electronic components for use by manufacturers of hearing aids and other electronic equipment. At first Hi-Rel operated in rented premises in an industrial complex in Chipping Norton. From 1987, when the Moorebank property was acquired, Hi-Rel carried on its operations there, and so far as appears from evidence there was no lease or formal arrangement establishing the terms of occupation. The scale of operations declined, in March 1993 the last employees were terminated and since then there has been very little activity of manufacturing or otherwise in Hi-Rel’s business; the only persons who could carry out any operations were the directors, and only Mr Hunt since Mr Harry Barlow died. 
    10   The agreement alleged by the plaintiff is in the form of a letter on Hi-Rel letterhead in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “2nd December 1994. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr R. Hunt 
        
       64 Nuwarra Road 
        
       MOOREBANK NSW 2170 
       
      
      
       
       Dear Dick 
       
      
      
       
        I confirm discussions we had in the presence of Ken Livingstone. I wish to cease my activities with the Company and retire. 
        
        
        I am conscious that without interest, I owe you $55,000 for my house loan and $65,000 which you paid as my proportion for the business premises.  
       
      
      
       
        I have no capacity to find this money and offer you my equity in the freehold and the Company as repayment of my debt. 
       
      
      
       
        As Ken explained, it would be best if this occurred after the final accounts were struck as at 30th June 1995. 
       
      
      
       
        I seek your acceptance to the offer I make. This offer is irrevocable and is made by me or on behalf of my executors, heirs and assigns if this be the case at the time of execution of the documents. 
       
      
      
       
       Yours sincerely 
       
      
      
       
       H.C. BARLOW 
       
      
      
       
       I accept your offer. 
       
      
      
       
       R. HUNT 
       
      
      
       
       This letter was signed by Messrs Barlow and Hunt in my presence. 
       
      
      
       
       K. LIVINGSTONE” 
       
      
    11   The agreement states as facts:· Mr Harry Barlow wished to cease his activities with Hi-Rel and retire.· Mr Harry Barlow owed Mr Hunt $55,000 for his house loan.· Mr Harry Barlow owed Mr Hunt $65,000 which Mr Hunt had paid as Mr Harry Barlow’s proportion for the Moorebank premises.· Mr Harry Barlow had no capacity to pay Mr Hunt $120,000. 
     
     An address to the probabilities makes it relevant to establish whether these really are facts. Evidence relating to the earlier dealings between Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow was very extensive. It is also relevant to consider whether there were grounds for Mr Livingstone to explain that it would be best to complete transfers after the final accounts were struck as at 30 June 1995, so as to consider whether it is probable that he gave that explanation. 
      
    12   To establish as reasonably clear a case as the facts admit of it was necessary for the plaintiff to call the evidence of every person now available who witnessed the agreement or was present on that occasion, to produce the agreement or prove what its terms were and to explain why the original was not produced, and to produce whatever evidence was available to corroborate facts stated in it.  
    13   It is not essential for the proof of the plaintiff’s cause of action to prove the truth of the facts stated in the agreement, and the agreement could, in logic, be authentic even if some of the facts stated in it were not accurate, but evidence about those facts is potentially a source of corroboration, and the plaintiff is entitled to prove them so as to establish as reasonably clear a case as the facts will admit. 
    14   According to Mr Hunt’s evidence the letter was prepared by Mr Livingstone after earlier discussions, was brought to the factory premises by Mr Livingstone and there signed by all three as appears on its face. There were difficulties and variations in Mr Hunt’s evidence about the times of discussions preceding the events of 2 December 1994. If the document is authentic its terms establish that Mr Barlow did owe Mr Hunt money, and that the agreement was made for consideration. When 30 June 1995 had passed and the final accounts of the company for that year had been struck Mr Hunt would have been unqualifiedly entitled in equity to ownership of the premises and the shares.  
    15   According to the plaintiff’s case, on the same occasion as the agreement was signed Mr Barlow signed a transfer to Mr Gordon Ian Hunt, the plaintiff’s son, of one share in Hi-Rel for an expressed consideration of $1; this transfer was left undated at that time (although the date 30 June 1995 was later written in it) and has never been registered. 
    16   In giving his evidence Mr Hunt exhibited what I regard as a good demeanour. His evidence was emphatic and clear, he spoke about the facts which constitute his case with conviction and he gave every appearance of sincerity. He gave the strong impression of a sincere person who was badgered about details he did not always remember of transactions the main points of which he regarded as undoubted. His cross-examination was extremely lengthy and occupied about seven hours on three different sitting days, and was conducted by counsel with open hostility. A number of very confronting allegations were put to Mr Hunt by the defendant’s counsel as was her duty, and he showed some signs of heightened feeling and impatience. Evidence took him to circumstances of his involvement in conflict with Mr Peter Barlow, and on this subject too he showed impatience.  
    17   In his conflict with Mr Peter Barlow, Mr Hunt behaved in ways which were ill-considered and suggest some loss of self-possession through rage, and some heat of conflict came through in his evidence. Overall, this was not adverse to my impression of his demeanour; he projected a strong air of his sense of right. 
    18   I should not let an impression based on demeanour dominate fact-finding; to do that would place the process of finding the facts under the control of impression and appearance to an unduly high degree, in a case where scrutiny of the plaintiff’s evidence is appropriate, the defendant is in a poor position to adduce any positive material, and sources to which it is natural to look for confirmation do not furnish it.  
    19   Mr Livingstone gave evidence on affidavit and orally in support of the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff had a forensic need to call his evidence. In December 1994 Mr Livingstone practised as a chartered accountant, and over many years he gave advice and accounting services to Hi-Rel and its directors. He also handled moneys and investments on behalf of Mr Hunt and of Mr Barlow. Cross examination of Mr Livingstone and scrutiny of his accounting records in evidence were very extensive.  
    20   Mr Livingstone is not a witness in whose evidence confidence can be placed. He is now in prison under sentences for crimes of dishonesty and grave social irresponsibility. On 11 March 1999 in the District Court at Sydney he was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited imports between about 1 September 1986 and 13 November 1986, and of giving false evidence to the Crime Commission between 3 February 1994 and 17 February 1994; he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment on the first charge and 2 years to be served concurrently on the second. Those offences and his criminal conduct did not have any direct relation to the facts of this case.  
    21   Mr Livingstone’s accounting records of transactions involving Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow on which he gave evidence are very irregular and unsatisfactory. They were not prepared according to ordinary professional standards, contain striking anomalies, and also contain records of deposits and other transactions in the names of Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow which on other evidence are very unlikely actually to be their transactions. Some transactions attributed to Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow which probably do not really relate to them are mixed up with others which do. 
    22   Mr Livingstone was at a considerable disadvantage as a witness, as he was cross-examined for some hours and on two widely separated sitting days. As he was in custody and escorted by prison warders he did not have as full an opportunity as an accountant would hope to have to collect, review and consider extensive documents relating to transactions over many years. One effect of the criminal investigations and proceedings, no doubt a small part of the whole but important for present purposes, is that the order of his accounts and his opportunity to search out and produce papers have been disrupted by investigations, searches and seizures, criminal proceedings and his imprisonment. Those of his records which were produced however were quite extensive and they showed that records which he made of the transactions of Mr Hunt and Mr Harry Barlow, and other transactions relating to them, were not made to professional standards. I do not regard them as reliable, and they do not have the air of due compilation and reliability which plays a part in the acceptance of business records as evidence of the truth. Under severe challenge he adhered to the substance of his evidence about the events of 2 December 1994. I have sought to make allowance for the difficulties and embarrassments of Mr Livingstone’s position, but even so I found him an unimpressive witness.  
    23   The other person who according to the plaintiff’s case was present on 2 December 1994 was the plaintiff’s son, Mr Gordon Ian Hunt. He gave evidence that he attended at the factory premises in response to a telephone call. It was a working day and he spent the day driving a truck in the metropolitan area. During the working day he made the journey to the factory because, as he stated, he had been requested to sign a share transfer. The date he gave was 4 December 1994, which was a Sunday, and was not the day or date on the letter, nor was it consistent with his account of attending the factory during a working day. He had no actual knowledge of what date or day of the week on which the event he spoke of happened, except that it was a working day. His evidence is that he was given a share transfer to sign, that he did not read it but signed it, and that he did not take any other part in the events but then left. He does not claim to have seen or read the agreement, although he speaks of seeing a document on a letterhead, and at one time said that the transfer which he signed was on Hi-Rel letterhead. The transfer form is rather strange as it would transfer one share in Hi-Rel to Mr Gordon Hunt whereas the agreement related to the transfer of all Mr Harry Barlow’s equity in Hi-Rel to the plaintiff, and Mr Barlow owned 5000 shares.  
    24   It would not be difficult to accept that a share was to be transferred to Mr Gordon Hunt as a nominee; he had no other possible part in the event, and in 1994 it would have been usual to ensure that there were at least two share holders on a company share register. However apart from what is written in the transfer there is no evidence of an arrangement for one share to be transferred to a nominee of the plaintiff. 
    25   Mr Gordon Hunt gave a strong impression of blunt sincerity, while not having much involvement in the events. The plaintiff’s case required that Mr Gordon Hunt’s evidence be called, but what he did say does not have force as corroboration of the making of the agreement on 2 December 1994.  
    26   According to the letter of 2 December 1994 Mr Barlow states “… I owe you $55,000 for my house loan …”. Mr Hunt’s evidence is to the effect that in August and September 1987 Mr Barlow borrowed from Mr Hunt sums of money to repay mortgage debts to the St George Building Society. Mr Hunt said he deposited eight cheques for the benefit of Mr Barlow to the credit of account No. 04-707-353 at the St George Building Society; these sums total $55,000 and were as follows: 12 August 1987, $9,000; 12 August 1987, $9,000; 13 August 1987, $9,000; 26 August 1987, $9,000; 26 August 1987, $9,000; 26 August 1987, $5,000; 16 September 1987, $1,500; 17 September 1987, $3,500. Mr Hunt produced a photocopy of a list of these cheques which he had compiled in 1987. Mr Hunt did not have and claimed that he was unable to produce any other records corroborating the fact that he had made these payments, such as records of any bank or financial institution on which he wrote the cheques or from which he paid the cheques, or any records of the St George Building Society. He gave evidence to the effect that he was unable to identify the accounts he wrote the cheques on as they were in various assumed names which he could not remember, and that he could no longer remember the financial institutions with which he maintained the accounts. As he gave no significant details of the transactions, no process of inquiry and confirmation could begin.  
    27   Mr Hunt could not give in evidence any clear or probable account of how he was able to accumulate $55,000 in the course of several years from the sources which he indicated, namely drawings from the company, wages and business expenses. In relation to his activities at that time and his income as shown in copies of his tax returns, this is an improbably high amount for him to accumulate. He was not able to give any recognisable explanation for his having at least two and perhaps a greater number of accounts in false names, and when the cross-examiner offered him the opportunity to explain his explanations were: “I was unable to accumulate sufficient funds, I found, in my own home account” and “it seemed a good idea at the time.”  
    28   In 1987 Mr Harry Barlow did have a mortgage debt, which related to land he purchased at Bossley Park in January 1984 on which he later built a house funded by mortgage. The mortgage was not to St George Building Society but to New South Wales Building Society and was for much less than for the $55,000 amount mentioned, namely $25,000. The mortgage was not paid off in 1987 and a small debt on it still existed when he died in 1995. Mr Harry Barlow also, with his former wife, owned a parcel of unimproved land at St Georges Basin; this is unlikely to have been of much value.  
    29   There is nothing which could be a written acknowledgment by Mr Barlow of a loan of $55,000 or any loan made to him by Mr Hunt, unless it is the letter of 2 December 1994. What Mr Hunt said was his own list of payments totalling $55,000 (Annexure B to his affidavit of 21 July 1997) was a copy of a memorandum which his evidence seems to mean he made at about the time of the payments: later he made a handwritten copy and gave it to Mr Livingstone at Mr Livingstone’s request, and kept the original; he claims that he later lost all of his own documents in a burglary. I understand that the copy produced in evidence is based on a document which he says he obtained from Mr Livingstone. Mr Livingstone denied that Mr Hunt had given Mr Livingstone a list or any records relating to advancing $55,000 to Mr Barlow (t155). The list does not mention the name either of Mr Hunt or of Mr Barlow, and does not say that the amounts deposited were loans or advances. The heading is “Account paid to 
     
      
     Made payable to A.C. No 04-707-353 St George” 
      
    30   In his affidavit of 16 April 1999, relatively late in preparation for the hearing, the plaintiff gave an account of the arrangements leading to these advances. He said that Mr Harry Barlow said to him to this effect: “I am in some difficulty with my mortgage. The interest rate is very high. I need some money to cool off the interest. Can you see your way clear to lending me some money?” He also says that Mr Harry Barlow said to him at a later point of the conversation, “Can you make the payee my St George Bank Mortgage Account” and gave him the mortgage account number. Mr Barlow requested that the cheques be in amounts of $9000 because he was concerned with new regulations affecting deposits greater than $10,000.  
    31   There is no evidence identifying whose account was account no. 04-707-353 at the St George Building Society, whether that account related to a mortgage or whether that account had any connection with Mr Harry Barlow. None of the properties which Mr Barlow is known to have had at the time was mortgaged to St George Building Society. A mortgage to St George Building Society over a property at Kincumber which was then owned by Mr Harry Barlow’s former wife was discharged in September 1987, and it was suggested that this may be an explanation for Mr Harry Barlow’s borrowings. There is no evidence which establishes any real connection. The suggestion is a speculation.  
    32   At about the time when the plaintiff claims that he advanced $55,000 to Mr Barlow in August and September 1987 Mrs Kathleen Mahoney, who had formerly been Mr Barlow’s wife, obtained finance to pay off the balance of $59,900 which she had borrowed from the St George Building Society in December 1985. She regarded paying off that loan as bridging finance pending completion of her sale of the Kincumber property. In her understanding the bridging finance was provided by Mr Livingstone, whom she did not know and with whom she did not deal directly; she dealt with Mr Livingstone through Mr Barlow. (There followed some confusing transactions extending over some years between Mr Livingstone and Mrs Mahoney, which it is neither possible nor necessary to resolve). Mrs Mahoney’s evidence does not tend to confirm that Mr Barlow had a need to pay or did pay any money to St George Building Society in September 1987. Her evidence seems to mean that she paid Mr Livingstone $120,000, that after some years and some difficulties Mr Livingstone paid her $60,000, and that these transactions were treated as in some way an acquittance of the bridging finance. It has not been established that Mr Barlow had a need for funds in the order of $55,000 in August and September 1987, for the purpose of paying off Mrs Mahoney’s mortgage or for any purpose. 
    33   There is really no objective confirmation of the plaintiff’s claim that there was an agreement for loan and that he made advances to Mr Harry Barlow by paying money into the St George Building Society. 
    34   The plaintiff’s position is that the Certificate of Title, which records the interests of both himself and Mr Harry Barlow as tenants in common, was and is held by him as a security under an arrangement with Mr Harry Barlow. In an affidavit (21 July 1997 para 12) Mr Hunt said that prior to the settlement of the property loan (and that would refer to 1987), he said to Mr Harry Barlow, “I will take possession of the certificate of title to the Moorebank property as a form of security for the money you owe me” and Mr Barlow agreed. In November 1989, about two years after settlement, the solicitors who acted for them were given a written authority, signed by both of them, directing the solicitors to hand over the Certificate of Title, which was done accordingly. The written authority did not direct the solicitors to hand the Certificate of Title particularly to Mr Hunt, and did not refer to its being held as a security. Some years later Mr Hunt sent the Certificate of Title to Mr Livingstone for safekeeping, with a letter asserting that Mr Hunt held it as security (and that he had no other security). There was no objective confirmation of the plaintiff’s claim that he had the agreement of Mr Harry Barlow to hold the Certificate of Title as a security. The circumstance that one of two co-owners held the Certificate of Title does not tend to confirm that it was held by way of security; that would be an ordinary event. 
    35   There is no document which bears out in any satisfactory way Mr Hunt’s evidence to the effect that he deposited a further $130,000 with Mr Livingstone to be held in some way to back up or support an advance to Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow of the balance of purchase money for the Moorebank property. That arrangement would be strangely convoluted, because if Mr Hunt had enough money to pay for the Moorebank property a more direct arrangement would be for him to pay the purchase price, treat half the amount paid as a loan by Mr Hunt to Mr Harry Barlow and get Mr Barlow to acknowledge this by a mortgage, or in some other way which gave security over his half interest. The disadvantage of Mr Barlow knowing that Mr Hunt possessed that amount of money does not seem to justify the convolutions of the arrangement claimed. There is no deposit receipt, loan agreement or any like document in evidence. Mr Hunt’s evidence was that he did not see Mr Livingtone’s records and had no statements or records of the deposit from the Scott Family Trust, with whom the money was alleged to have been deposited, or from anyone else.  
    36   When explaining how he had raised $130,000 in 1987 Mr Hunt attributed the money to selling mining shares which he had bought in 1985 for $50,000 to $70,000 which came from severance pay in earlier employment and from Hi-Rel. At another point he gave a narration of share transactions which could be traced back much earlier. Mr Hunt could not name what companies he held shares in, or what stockbrokers he dealt with. 
    37   It is established in what I regard as a clear way that there was an advance of $130,000 in 1984 by some entity to Hi-Rel, and this fact has to be regarded when considering whether it is probable that there was another and different advance of $130,000 to Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow to purchase the Moorebank property.  
    38   The claim that there were two different transactions each involving $130,000 was supported by evidence of Mr Livingstone which referred to Annexure A to his affidavit, a copy of a ledger sheet Folio 99 which he says was “prepared by me for my own records”. There are two ledger accounts on Folio 99, the first one headed “Dick Hunt”. The entries open with the following under date 1985: Dept to SFT $130,000 
     
     Lent to Hi-Rel $130,000. 
       
      
    39   As explained by Mr Livingstone, according to my understanding although his explanation was not clear, this entry records a deposit by Mr Hunt, not in 1985 but earlier, of $130,000 to an account Mr Livingstone referred to as the Scott Family Trust, although it was no longer conducted in the interest of that trust, and then a loan out of that account to Hi-Rel.  
    40   The only other entry in this account is “1992 June 30 Harry & Dick advised taken 00 sales. Coy DR SFT $130,000 CR sales $130,000.” This seems to mean that by 30 June 1992 Mr Hunt had received what was treated as repayment of his deposit with the Scott Family Trust by money taken out of the proceeds of Hi-Rel’s sales. The entries cannot be understood. Whatever the entry is, it is not a ledger entry in accounts of the Scott Family Trust kept according to conventional double entry bookkeeping methods. I am unable to see that these entries record the discharge of the debt of $130,000 owed by Hi-Rel to the Scott Family Trust, being a discharge effected by Messrs Hunt and Barlow paying the Scott Family Trust $130,000 which they took out of the proceeds of Hi-Rel’s sales. Mr Livingstone said (t137) to the effect that those were the events recorded; in my finding, the entries do not record those events. The transaction as narrated by Mr Livingstone is very improbable. The evidence of Mr Hunt says nothing to bear it out.  
    41   Reference to the advance to Messrs Hunt and Barlow to purchase the Moorebank property as being for $130,000 is anomalous because the full purchase price of the Moorebank property was $130,000 of which $13,000 was paid as a deposit by Hi-Rel and charged as $6,500 each to the loan accounts with the company of Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow. If the evidence relating to the cheque (Ex G) were accepted, that would bear out an advance of $119,897.21, and not of $130,000. There is a clear possibility that the transaction involving a loan of $130,000 by Ophix Finance to Messrs Hunt and Barlow, referred to in a letter of 1 July 1991 and subject to a Deed of Guarantee and loan agreement, was the borrowing which appears in Hi-Rel’s accounts from 1984 onwards; this possibility has not been rebutted. The effect of Mr Livingstone’s affidavit, his schedule and his explanation is not to establish any particular state of facts, but to make it doubtful whether his records should be relied on.  
    42   The second series of entries on Annexure A to Mr Livingstone’s affidavit and their explanation in Annexure B are also extremely difficult to follow. Whatever else they show, they do not bear out that Mr Hunt made a deposit of or exceeding $130,000 to Mr Livingstone or some entity related to Mr Livingstone against which moneys were drawn. 
    43   Mr Livingstone produced what he said were copies of ledger sheets relating to moneys deposited by Mr Harry Barlow with Mr Scott: Annexures E, F, G and H to Mr Livingstone’s affidavit. Annexures E and F appear to show that significant sums of money were held by Mr Scott to Mr Barlow’s credit from 31 May 1988 to 31 January 1991. Annexure G appears to record debits against Mr Barlow of $96,000 apparently debited as of 13 September 1988 and treated as “B to B” (meaning back to back) with the account for which he was in credit, and then resolved on 31 January 1991 by offsetting $124,196 against Mr Barlow’s credit in the other account, leaving him still with the significant credit of $47,431. It could be thought of as a difficulty for Mr Hunt’s case if Mr Barlow actually had significant funds available to him during this period, but only if I had confidence in Mr Livingstone’s records. What are apparently records of dealings with Mr Barlow are continued in the Blue Book (Ex J), no more than rough notes in an exercise book, in which I have no confidence. It is very unlikely that the Blue Book is an original record, or was ever relied on for any serious business purpose. 
    44   Annexure A, whether or not supplemented by Mr Livingstone’s explanation in Ex K, does not bear out the proposition that the purchase of the Moorebank property was financed with an advance of $130,000 by Ophix Finance, or by any other entity. Nor do the ledger entries provide corroboration that Mr Hunt was the source of the deposits against which moneys were drawn to settle the purchase. Both those propositions depend on acceptance of oral evidence of Mr Hunt and Mr Livingstone. I find it remarkable that there is no corroboration in written records of these two propositions; in view of the amounts involved, it is highly likely that records would exist, and the fact that none are produced in evidence is a difficulty for accepting the evidence.  
    45   I referred earlier to the ledger sheet (Annexure G) which appears to show that Mr Barlow borrowed $96,000 on 13 September 1988. The opening entry “Advance to friend” does nothing to assist credibility. Mr Livingstone refers to this ledger sheet in his affidavit (para 12) and says that the borrowing was repaid on 3 April 1989. However Annexure E shows a deposit of $96,000 on 3 April 1989 being credited to the other ledger sheet headed “Harry Barlow”, while the borrowing of $96,000 on Annexure G continued to incur interest until 31 January 1991 when the total of the debt and interest of $124,196 was set off against the other account. I do not find these entries comprehensible. It is not consistent with the pattern of Mr Barlow’s affairs suggested by the plaintiff’s case that Mr Barlow should have had varying but significant sums of money held for him in the account under Mr Livingstone’s control for some years, and there is no place in that pattern for Mr Barlow to have needed to borrow $96,000 in September 1988 or having been able to repay it in April 1989; let alone his being prepared to be charged interest on it for several years after he had repaid it.  
    46   Mr Livingstone maintained another ledger, referred to as the Chinese Ledger, which shows that as at 30 September 1987 Hi-Rel had $144,414.06 to its credit in the Scott & Slattery Clearing Account. If this were the whole position it could not be understood why those moneys were not used for the purchase of the Moorebank premises, either by Hi-Rel itself becoming the purchaser or by Hi-Rel advancing the moneys to its own principals. Mr Livingstone maintained that this is not the whole position, that Hi-Rel had another account with the Scott Family Trust which was recorded in a different account book, now missing, and was in debit in a way which should be offset against the amount shown to credit. Mr Livingstone’s evidence that there was another ledger book was challenged. It cannot be said that it has been clearly proved that there was no other ledger book. However his evidence that there are two offsetting accounts but that they are not recorded in the same ledger book is anomalous and difficult to accept. It is doubly anomalous because it is difficult to see why there would be two offsetting accounts, and it is difficult to see why, if there were, they would be in different ledger books. 
    47   It remains obscure who it is said lent Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow money with which to complete the purchase of the Moorebank property: whether it was the Scott Family Trust (and it is obscure what entity is represented by that name) or whether it was Ophix Finance. There may be some confirmation in the letter of 1 July 1991 from Mr Scott to Mr Hunt, a copy of which is Annexure C to Mr Hunt’s affidavit of 21 July 1997. The letter is headed “Re Loan by Ophix Finance to Barlow and Hunt” and in it Mr Scott purportedly states “… I have transferred an amount of $130,000 of money you have on account into the loan account of Barlow and Hunt.” According to the terms of the letter a Deed of Guarantee and Loan Agreement were then returned; there is however nothing in evidence which could establish the dates or contents of those documents, or identify the guarantor. The letter was prepared by Mr Livingstone, and the defendant disputed its authenticity. 
    48   According to accounts of Hi-Rel a loan by Ophix Finance to Hi-Rel of $130,000 existed from 1984, well before the alleged borrowing for the Moorebank purchase. The loan is reflected in Hi-Rel’s 1985 accounts, and continued until the 1991 accounts to appear as a debt of Hi-Rel to Ophix of $130,000. In the 1992 accounts there is no such liability. It seems anomalous and unlikely that that loan should have already existed before the mortgage transaction, yet that, as he claims, Mr Hunt should have made a deposit of $130,000 in 1987 to back another advance of the same amount. The terms of the letter of 1 July 1991 show a loan of $130,000 being paid by setting it off against $130,000 held on account on behalf of Mr Hunt. I regard it as very unlikely that this refers to a debt arising from an advance in 1987 for the Moorebank purchase. There is no objective support for the proposition that Mr Harry Barlow joined in borrowing $130,000 for the Moorebank purchase, and to my mind it is very unlikely that a transaction of that size would be entered into with no written acknowledgment or record of Mr Barlow’s liability. I do not find it possible to accept as credible Mr Hunt’s explanation in terms of that being the nature of the relationship between them in view of the size of the obligation.  
    49   The cheque (Ex G), drawn to cash on 10 November 1987 on a bank account called “J Scott and J Slattery Clearing Account” for $125,697.61 could very well, according to notes on the back of it, have been used to obtain bank cheques totalling $119,889.21 for the settlement of the Moorebank purchase, and to pay bank fees of $8.40, but does nothing to confirm that there was an advance or loan of the total of those amounts by any identifiable entity, or by way of loan to Messrs Hunt and Barlow. If it did show that, it would show an advance of $119,897.61, not of $130,000. 
    50   If there was a loan by some entity to Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow to complete the Moorebank purchase, the proposition that Mr Barlow was indebted to Mr Hunt would have to be supported by proving in a satisfactory way that Mr Hunt paid the debt or bore the burden of its payment in circumstances which created a debt by Mr Barlow to him. The letter of 1 July 1991 does not give any real support to such a proposition because its contents are consistent with its dealing with the borrowing attributed in the company’s accounts to Hi-Rel as borrower. 
    51   Evidence which dealt with Mr Hunt’s interest and dealings in a house property in Davidson was injurious to his credibility. Rent from that house was treated as income of Mr Hunt in his income tax returns for some years. Mr Hunt’s evidence was to the effect that this property was bought on trust for him in 1989 for $400,000, that the trustees were Mr Livingstone’s son and daughter-in-law, that there was no trust deed, and that he sold the property to the trustees for $400,000, in about 1998, and received the sale price through Mr Livingstone. Mr Hunt said that he raised $400,000 from “the remains of my share sales” or partly from the sales of shares; he did not give any manner of detail about such shares or sales. I take this with Mr Hunt’s explanations of raising the $55,000 which he says he was able to advance to Mr Barlow; these explanations were difficult to accept, appear to be not always consistent, and included, at least at one point, attributing part of the $55,000 to share sales. I also have regard to his explanation how he raised $130,000 which he says be deposited with Mr Livingstone. Mr Hunt had recurring difficulties in explaining how he was able to raise significant sums of money, and in explaining the strange nature of his transactions. 
    52   The evidence relating to the form of share transfer to Mr Gordon Hunt presents anomalies. Although Mr Gordon Hunt’s evidence was obviously not correct in all details, it is probably true in a broad way that, as he narrates, he was called to the Moorebank premises and signed a form of share transfer as transferee. However those events and the share transfer itself have no force as confirmation of the plaintiff’s claims. The share transfer was not completed with a date on the occasion when it was signed, and it is not altogether clear that it was completed with any other details such as the parties’ names when Mr Gordon Hunt signed it. The transfer is for one share but Mr Barlow had 5000 shares. There are anomalies about what was done with the form of transfer; the original is not forthcoming, but it does seem clear that nothing was done to stamp or register the transfer. At some time the date 30 June 1995, which is certainly not the date of the transfer, was written into it. Mr Livingstone’s evidence is that he realised in January 1995 that the share transfer referred to the wrong number of shares, but he did not take any action; he left everything until 30 June. Mr Livingstone’s evidence was that he put the date 30 June 1995 on the share transfer after Mr Barlow had died. If one follows the terms of the letter of 2 December 1994 the transfer was not to be required until completion which was to happen after preparation of the 1994/1995 accounts. Mr Gordon Hunt’s evidence does not in any way confirm that the agreement in the letter of 2 December 1994 was made.  
    53   Nothing was done to carry forward the project of transferring Mr Barlow’s interest in the land to Mr Hunt. The explanation offered was to the effect that Mr Livingstone advised that the next step should be taken when the accounts for the year to 30 June 1995 were available, as they would be required for valuation of the shares for stamp duty purposes. This is a possible explanation but I do not find it a convincing explanation for leaving valuable rights without any real protection, and without taking any steps to establish legal title to them. 
    54   In some instances Mr Hunt could not furnish confirmation for his assertions and explanations for reasons which should be regarded as unfortunate. It could well be that significant documents were lost as a result of a burglary at the factory premises in mid-December 1994 and disposal of documents by Mr Harry Barlow while cleaning up after the burglary. I do not regard that as an altogether clear and satisfactory explanation for the absence of significant documents, because if they were or were possibly significant it is hard to understand why Mr Hunt and his sister, who was present while Mr Barlow was cleaning up papers, allowed many documents to be thrown away without examining them. 
    55   There were some aspects of Mr Hunt’s admitted behaviour which should disturb confidence in his credibility. One is his use of assumed names to conduct bank accounts; this is not an indication of reliability. Another is his behaviour in the conflict with the defendant, Mr Peter Barlow. Each accused the other of acts of harassment in relation to the occupation of the premises at Moorebank; both denied the allegations, but I was left with a strong impression that there may well be some substance in the complaints of both of them. Mr Hunt’s evidence included acknowledgment that he burst in on Mr Peter Barlow in his office with a camera and took photographs of him engaged in compromising sexual activity, and his evidence showed that Mr Hunt contemplated and intended using the availability of the photographs to influence Mr Peter Barlow’s behaviour. No doubt the influence Mr Hunt says he contemplated was an influence for the better. Taking the photographs is one of the things which Mr Hunt explained by saying that it seemed a good idea at the time, an expression which acknowledges that it was not a good idea. It does appear to me that Mr Hunt was contemplating using the photographs for blackmail, perhaps only in a mild form, and that this behaviour is adverse to his credit and credibility. 
    56   The cross-examiner challenged all the facts which are pillars of Mr Hunt’s case. In the course of making these challenges various alternative interpretations of the events were put forward which cannot be regarded as established. One was that the money used as purchase money for the Moorebank property was money owned by Mr Hunt and Mr Barlow and held in the Scott & Slattery Clearing Account. Another was that the copy of the letter of 2 December 1994 and the copy of the share transfer had been concocted by using cut and paste methods to put a copy of Mr Barlow’s signature on a form of the document and then making photocopies of the result. Although these suggestions were not established, or made to seem probable, it must always be remembered that the defendant does not bear an onus of proof on the plaintiff’s claim.  
    57   Mr Livingstone was in a sea of difficulties throughout his cross examination in explaining his accounts and records. In her closing submissions the defendant’s counsel described Mr Livingstone’s accounts as ludicrous and this expression, although severe, was appropriate. Taken in whole, the records cannot be understood. They do not have any of the authority usually attributed to business records kept in a business-like fashion. It is not possible to be confident that transactions and dealings attributed to Mr Hunt or to Mr Barlow in these records in truth have any reference to those persons. The knowledge that Mr Livingstone has recently been convicted of giving false evidence hangs over all consideration of his evidence. 
    58   The plaintiff’s counsel contended that it should be found that Mr Barlow was in need of funds at all material times, meaning 1987 to 1994. In my view it is not objectively clear that this is correct, and an inference that this was the position would depend, first, on the plaintiff’s case generally being accepted. 
    59   The facts relating to the plaintiff’s claim cannot be decided on the basis of certainty. I see a clear possibility that the plaintiff’s claim is correct; it has not been demonstrated in a convincing way that it is false. However that is not the direction from which findings of facts should be approached. When I ask myself, reminding myself of the plaintiff’s need to establish a reasonably clear case, whether I feel an actual persuasion of the existence of the facts on which the claim is based, my conclusion is that I do not. They could well be true, but the plaintiff has not carried my mind to the conclusion that they probably are. There are aspects of Mr Hunt’s evidence and of his behaviour which significantly qualify his credibility. Whenever I look for corroboration it is not available or not satisfactory. The evidence is not clear and satisfactory, and the plaintiff has not established a reasonably clear case. 
    60   The defendant produced in evidence a copy of what purported to be minutes of an extraordinary general meeting of the members of Hi-Rel Pty Ltd held on 26 March 1996. The minute records that Mr Peter Barlow and the plaintiff were present and also that Helen Margaret Barlow was present. The meeting records a number of resolutions; a resolution agreeing to short notice of the meeting, a resolution electing Mr Peter Barlow to be Chairman of the meeting, a resolution declaring that Mr Peter Barlow was entitled to the rights formerly held by Mr Harry Barlow, a resolution approving transfer of his shares, and a resolution appointing Mr Peter Barlow as a director. The records of resolutions are entirely false; no such resolutions were passed and the plaintiff who was the only person in a position to cast a vote did not vote for or support any of them. The events of 26 March 1996 did not make Mr Peter Barlow a director; they did not confer on him any entitlement to represent the company, as he purported to do thereafter in a number of ways, although without the authorisation of the company or of the plaintiff. Mr Peter Barlow, who is an accountant, cannot possibly have believed that the purported resolutions were effective. He referred to the provisions of Table A, meaning Table A in the fourth schedule to the Companies Act 1961, and counsel referred to Arts 24 and 25; these articles do not contain any possible justification for his behaviour. Although it was very difficult to obtain responsive answers from him, in substance his evidence confirms that he always knew that there were no such resolutions as the minute purports to record. His production of this false document and his reliance on it establish that he is a person of poor credibility, but in the result his credibility is of little significance in disposing of the case.  
    61   The claims in the Amended Statement of Claim under heading A relate to the Moorebank property. Claims under A1 seek to establish that the plaintiff is the equitable owner of the interest of which Mr Barlow is the registered proprietor, with specific performance of the agreement to transfer it. Claim A2 seeks removal of the defendant’s caveat. Claim A3 is a claim for judgment for possession and related relief arising out of the defendant’s occupation. Claim A4 claims a charge over the land in respect of an alleged debt owing by the deceased and his estate; the debt has not been proved and there is no basis for the charge. These claims fail. Claim A5 is a claim for consequential orders including orders under s.66G of the (NSW) Conveyancing Act 1919. In my opinion the plaintiff should recover an order under s.66G for appointment of trustees for sale, and distribution of the proceeds on the basis that the plaintiff and the defendant as administrator are each entitled to one half. 
    62   Claims under heading B relate to Hi-Rel Pty Ltd. Claims under B1 relate to ownership of the 5000 shares held by the deceased. The plaintiff and Mr Gordon Hunt have no interest in those shares and these claims fail. Claims under heading B2 relate to directorships in the company. The defendant’s claims and purported acts as director are quite ineffectual and these claims should succeed. 
    63   I have not yet considered questions of costs. 
    64   The orders are: 
     
      
     (1) Declare that the defendant has at no time been validly appointed a director of Hi-Rel Pty Ltd. 
      
      
     (2) Order that the defendant himself, his servants and agents be restrained from acting as or holding himself out as being entitled to act as a director of Hi-Rel Pty Ltd unless and until after the date of this order the defendant is duly appointed a director of that company. 
      
      
     (3) Reserve further consideration of the appointment of trustees for sale. 
      
      
     (4) Save as aforesaid, dismiss the plaintiff’s claims. 
      
      
     (5) Costs reserved.

     SENTENCE 
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     HIS HONOUR : 
       
      Each of the prisoners was jointly indicted on a charge of murdering Christopher Mark Dorrian and, alternatively, of being an accessory after the fact to the commission of that murder by the co-accused. The jury found the prisoner Yeo guilty of murder and the prisoner Galea guilty of being an accessory after the fact to it. 
      
       
      
     2     
     It will be necessary to deal separately with each prisoner but there is some commonality in the facts with which I can deal for the purpose of sentence. It is important to bear in mind that the jury’s verdict necessarily implied that Galea did not participate in the actual commission of the murder. His culpability derives from his knowledge that Yeo had committed the murder and, with that knowledge, acted with the intention of assisting her to escape detection or prosecution. 
      
       
      
     3     
     At material times Yeo and Galea lived in a de facto relationship. Yeo was employed as a psychiatric nurse in the Palm Court Rehabilitation Unit at Rozelle Hospital. Galea worked under contract for a political organization, the Shooters Party. They lived in premises at Petersham. From time to time, both had been actively engaged in target pistol shooting. Galea kept a number of licensed firearms in a safe at the premises. Significant among these was a .22 calibre weapon known by the brand/manufacture name of High Standard Citation. Yeo knew where a spare key to the safe was located and thus had access to the safe and its contents. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Yeo met the victim Christopher Dorrian as a result of his being a patient at Palm Court. There is no need to detail their encounters. She decided to leave Galea. She had spent nights with Christopher Dorrian in nurses’ quarters at the hospital into which she had moved and at Petersham on an occasion when Galea was absent. Ultimately she leased a small flat at Lilyfield, in the interim arranging for a former fiance (not Galea) to accommodate Mr Dorrian for a few days.  
      
       
      
     5     
     The relationship between Yeo and Mr Dorrian was brief. I am satisfied that Yeo was motivated to kill him by a combination of her reaction to Mr Dorrian’s disinterest in establishing any relationship with her beyond engaging in casual acts of sexual intercourse and her apprehensions concerning the possible consequences of investigation into her professional conduct in entering a relationship with a former patient of the hospital at which she was employed.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The evidence does not enable findings as to precise times of many events and much detail can only be known to the offenders. There is, however, no doubt that Galea’s High Standard Citation pistol was used to discharge three bullets into, and ultimately to be recovered from, the head and neck of the victim. At some time, I am satisfied that Yeo accessed the safe, obtained that weapon and used it in the Lilyfield flat to shoot Christopher Dorrian. This registered pistol was later returned to the safe from which it was eventually taken by police. I find that the killing took place at some time shortly before Saturday 7 June 1997, in all probability on Friday 6th.  
      
       
      
     7     
     After the killing Yeo offered to and did resume her relationship with Galea and enlisted him in assisting her to seek to avoid detection of her crime. That assistance included disposal of the body of the victim and cleaning the flat in an effort to obliterate evidence of what had occurred there. Neither Yeo nor Galea disputed that they had been at the flat on Saturday and Sunday 7 and 8 June and for a short visit on Monday 9th, but they claimed that their activity was limited to cleaning the flat in the conventional sense for the innocent purpose of ensuring a return of Yeo’s security deposit when she terminated the lease. She terminated the lease on Tuesday 10 June. I am satisfied that during their visits over the weekend Yeo and Galea both participated in the dismemberment of the body of the victim. My finding is based upon the distribution of matter including DNA of the victim and the presence of the prisoners in the flat when the body mutilation must have happened. There is no reasonable basis for hypothesizing that anybody else had entered the flat at the relevant time. It is fanciful to suggest that anyone else was concerned in this activity and I conclude to the necessary standard that both participated in the dismemberment and disposal of the body and the cleaning of the flat. 
      
       
      
     8     
     Police investigation commenced when the victim’s head was discovered in a bag in tidal waters of the Cooks River on Saturday, 21 June. The relevant reach of the river is relatively near to the premises at Petersham where the prisoners had resumed cohabitation. Specific submissions were made by counsel for Galea that the evidence does not enable me to find that Galea assisted in anything beyond cleaning up the flat in distinction from participating in the dismemberment of the victim, the attempted disposal of the head in the river and the disposal of the decapitated balance of the body which has not been located. I reject those submissions although I accept the further submission that Galea had no foreknowledge of the crime which is, of course, consistent with his conviction as an accessory after the fact; but I would, as invited, find in the negative to any proposition that Galea had reason to anticipate that Yeo was going to commit the murder. 
      
       
      
     9     
     I turn to subjective matters, first concerning Yeo. She is a woman aged twenty eight years and has no prior convictions. Her work history appears to have been relatively good and she is, as mentioned, qualified in the nursing profession. As was her right, she gave no evidence at trial, nor after conviction. From incidental sources and what I have been told from the Bar table, I have some information about her family circumstances and some of her relationships. After the offence she and Galea resumed cohabitation but they have since parted. A gentleman described as her current partner gave evidence on an issue relating to bail during the trial. 
      
       
      
     10     
     It appears that Yeo’s mother has been in poor health for many years. Some evidence was given by her sister about this and I gather from what has been said that her illness is of a psychiatric nature. I know no more about the topic than that and that, arising therefrom, the prisoner as eldest sibling needed to care for the family. I accept that she discharged this burden. She had left home however long before the killing. The evidence included some writings of the prisoner in the nature of diaries and the like. The content of these suggested that a psychiatric survey might be useful but, as her counsel mentioned in submissions at the sentence hearing, none is to be made available to me. On such an aspect I can therefore draw no inference either to the benefit or detriment of the prisoner.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Much of counsel’s submission was focussed upon resisting imposition of an indeterminate sentence. I confirm what I said earlier that I have concluded that a specified term of imprisonment should be assessed. 
      
       
      
     12     
     I have already found to the contrary of a submission about motive and the final submission was a contention that I should ignore the circumstances of the mutilation and disposal of the body. I reject that submission. I accept of course that the crime was complete when death occurred and I find that this was as a result of and at the time of the shooting and necessarily preceded dismemberment and disposal of the body. Those latter circumstances were not ingredients of the crime but they are pertinent to the overall assessment of its seriousness. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The absence of plea or acknowledgment of guilt deprives the prisoner of any special lenience derivable from the demonstration of contrition or remorse. The necessary obtaining of the pistol from the safe manifested a degree of planning and I find that the killing was not the result of sudden passion or impulse. Although I have not classified the crime as being in the worst case category, it objectively involved a high degree of culpability. I shall take into account, to the extent that I can, the favourable subjective matters advanced on behalf of the prisoner but it must inevitably be concluded that a substantial sentence should be passed.  
      
       
      
     14     
     The prisoner was in custody from 23 July 1997 to 26 September 1997 and since 17 December 1999. I will date the sentence from 14 October 1999 to take those periods into account. 
      
       
      
     15     
     I am satisfied that the appropriate proportion of the head sentence to be specified as a non parole period is seventy five percent and I find no special circumstances which persuade me to depart from that proportion. 
      
       
      
     16     
     I turn to the prisoner Galea. I emphasize again that the conviction entered as a result of the jury’s verdict is for a crime, the essence of which is offence against justice and a distinction must be drawn between that situation and the different situation of a confederate involved in the commission of, or the actual planning and facilitation of a killing. 
      
       
      
     17     
     As I have said, I am satisfied that the prisoner Galea rendered assistance to Yeo intending to help her avoid detection and prosecution and that assistance extended to the mutilation and dismemberment of the victim at Lilyfield and the disposal of the body parts, including that which has been recovered from the Cooks River. The prisoner was also engaged in cleaning the flat in an attempt to obliterate evidence of what had occurred there. I reject the submission that such findings could or should not be made.  
      
       
      
     18     
     I accept the submission that the prisoner was motivated by his then infatuation with Yeo. That may explain his behaviour; I find it mitigates it only slightly.  
      
       
      
     19     
     The prisoner Galea has no previous convictions. He is divorced from the mother of his son, parted from Yeo and has formed a new relationship. Plans to marry his new partner are mentioned in a letter written by her and tendered at the sentence hearing. That letter does not make clear whether the author recognizes the prisoner’s guilt or not. Good character witnesses were called at trial and at the sentence hearing and a large batch of testimonial letters was tendered. There is a great variation in the apparent appreciation of the witnesses and authors of those testimonials as to why the prisoner is before the Court. However, I accept the general tenor of their opinions that the prisoner Galea is a generally law abiding citizen - apart from this crime - and is a hard working person, a sincere contributor to causes in which he believes, a generous volunteer with time and energy in particular to the Air Training Corps and his pistol club. He is regarded by his associates as a loyal friend and colleague. 
      
       
      
     20     
     He can, however, lay no claim to special leniency for manifestation of contrition or remorse for his crime. The jury must have found that his claim to ignorance about the killing was a pretence and his adherence to that claim attracts him no credit. 
      
       
      
     21     
     A submission is made that I should invest the sentence with an element of lenience, or alternatively, temper downwards the proportion between non parole period and head sentence, by reason of hardship visited upon the prisoner’s son. Although in calendar years he is in his early twenties, he is said to be intellectually developed into his teens. Some detail of hardship is contained in a letter dated 5 March 2000 signed by the prisoner’s son and what is contained in it is confirmed in some other letters to which I need not specifically refer. The circumstances of the young man are sad and, whilst it is true that there has apparently been a change in the willingness of his mother and her husband to accommodate him, as he states himself, they have expressed the view that it was time that he faced the challenges of life for himself. Imprisonment invariably affects the family members of a convict in different ways reflecting the needs, circumstances and dynamics of any particular family. I apprehend that every case would be different. I do not categorize this particular case as exceptional in that regard. Neither for the reason advanced nor otherwise do I find special circumstances persuading me to depart from the formula specified in s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
      
     22     
     The objective seriousness of the prisoner’s crime is high. The prescribed maximum penalty legislated by Parliament is twenty five years imprisonment (formerly penal servitude). The offence is comparatively rare. Some Judicial Commission statistics were handed up and showed very few cases but in the survey period between January 1990 and July 1999 the highest full term appears to have been eight years and the highest minimum term (for comparison with what will now be a non parole period), four years. Counsel referred to some cases:  
     Tan Do 
     ;  
     Farroukh 
     ; and  
     Wilson 
     . I do not find a great deal of helpful guidance in either the statistics or the cases. Each case must depend on its own facts. It is true that the prisoner was not seeking to protect someone engaged in professional criminal activity but to protect the object of his infatuation; however, the lengths he was prepared to and did go to, reveal a blatant willingness on his part to engage in horrific behaviour to assist her to seek to avoid retribution for her crime. The fact that the longest sentence in the statistical survey is eight years does not establish that period as appropriate to a worst case. A worst case potentially attracts the maximum prescribed by Parliament. The sentence I will impose does not represent a finding that the crime is in a worst case category but is proportionate to the objective criminality involved, tempered as far as I consider might reasonably be done, by the subjective matters favourable to the prisoner. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Galea has been in custody from 23 July 1997 to 31 October 1997 and since 29 December 1999. I shall date the sentence from 20 September 1999 to take those periods into account.  
      
       
      
     24     
     Keng Hwee Yeo, for the murder of Christopher Mark Dorrian, you are sentenced to imprisonment for twenty four years to commence on 14 October 1999. I set a non parole period of eighteen years from that date. You will become eligible for parole from 13 October 2017. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Raymond Galea, for being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Christopher Mark Dorrian by Keng Hwee Yeo, you are sentenced to imprisonment for eight years to commence on 20 September 1999. I set a non parole period of six years from that date. You will become eligible for parole from 19 September 2005.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    POWELL JA: On 17 August 1998 the Appellant was indicted before Backhouse DCJ at the Parramatta District Court on three charges, each alleging that, on 6 December 1995, at Fairfield, he assaulted DKN and, at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency on DKN, he being a person under the Appellant’s authority (Crimes Act 61M(1), (3)(c)). 
     
      
    2    The Appellant pleaded not guilty to each of the charges in the indictment and was tried before her Honour and a jury of 12.  
     
      
    3    On 24 August 1998 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty to each of the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    4    On 16 October 1998 her Honour sentenced the Appellant on each of the charges to community service for 400 hours, with the sentences on each charge to be concurrent. The Appellant was ordered to report on 21 October 1998. 
     
      
    5    The Appellant is an ordained minister of religion who, at the time of the alleged offences, was aged 47 years and who, at that time, was a teacher at a private school in the Western suburbs of Sydney - he had, at that time, been a teacher for about 22 years. Although, at the time of the alleged offences, the Appellant was accustomed to teach ancient history and religious studies, it would seem that, in addition, he had, over the years acquired an extensive and expert knowledge of iconography and calligraphy, subjects in which, so it would seem, the Complainant had an interest. 
     
      
    6    At the time of the alleged offences, the Complainant was aged 16 years and was in Year 10 at the school at which the Appellant was then teaching. The Complainant, so it would seem, had been a student at the school since the commencement of his secondary education - Year 7 - and had been taught by the Appellant during the previous year, Year 9. The Complainant regarded the Appellant very highly as a teacher and, as well, because he (the Complainant) had an interest in such subjects as Christian history, iconography and calligraphy, would from time to time discuss such subjects with the Appellant. 
     
      
    7    The Complainant gave evidence - which was not disputed - that if, while he was a student at the school, the Appellant had given him an instruction or direction, he would be required to follow that instruction or direction. 
     
      
    8    I record below, in summary form, the case which the Crown set out to establish at the hearing before Backhouse DCJ. 
     
      
    9    As I have earlier recorded, at the time of the alleged offences, the Complainant was in Year 10 at the school which he then attended. Towards the end of that year - the date was later identified by the investigating police officer as 6 December 1995 - there was held at the school a function, apparently known as an employers’ awards night - the awards were apparently sponsored by employers and businesses in the district and went to students who, during the year, had been doing work which was relevant to the business of the sponsors. Associated with the presentation of the awards was a dinner for the sponsors, teachers and pupils who were to receive awards. At the time wine and beer were available for the adults who were present and there were soft drinks - such as Coca Cola and lemonade - for the pupils who had attended. As the Complainant was to receive an award that evening, he was in attendance both for the presentation and at the dinner.  
     
      
    10    Although the evidence is not entirely clear, it would seem that, after the presentations but before dinner had been served, many of those present stood around in conversation. The Complainant’s evidence was that, while was this was occurring he was talking to the Appellant. While they were talking, the Appellant obtained a cup of white wine for the Complainant who, when he tasted it, did not like it and drank no more of it. 
     
      
    11    At the time when this function was held, there had been erected in the school grounds a new chapel which, at the time, was in the process of being fitted out. The plan which was tendered on the hearing indicates that the chapel was rectangular and the description later given of it by the Appellant when interviewed by the police was that it contained three rooms, they being, the body of the chapel and, separated by a wall which was behind the place where the altar was to be installed, two rooms described by the Appellant as a work area with a sink and a storage area.  
     
      
    12    While the Complainant and the Appellant were talking, the Appellant asked the Complainant if he wished to see the chapel. Although the chapel was situated in a area to the side of the hall, access to it was restricted and direct access was not possible so that, if one wished to see the chapel, one had to proceed from the hall around three sides of a building then used as a library and thence to the chapel.  
     
      
    13    When they reached the chapel, they entered it and the Appellant pointed out to the Complainant various features of it, such as lighting and the effects which could be achieved by the lighting and the intended place for various items, such as the cross - when the chapel had been fully fitted out.  
     
      
    14    When that had been done, the Appellant and the Complainant then proceeded to the far end of the chapel where the Appellant opened the door into what the Complainant, in his evidence, described as a room “where the priests get changed into the - into the garments” - this I take to be a reference to the priests’ vestments. Although not further identified, it seems probable that the room in question was that described by the Appellant in his record of interview as the storage area. The Complainant walked in, followed by the Appellant. Although the room was not lighted the door was then closed by the Appellant. The Appellant then held the Complainant’s arms near his shoulders and said something about right or wrong. He then bent over and kissed the Complainant on the mouth. The Complainant could feel the Appellant’s tongue on his lips and could smell alcohol on his breath. The kiss lasted no more than a minute. When the Appellant stopped he said “This is wrong” and they walked back out of the room. The Complainant did not consent to the Appellant kissing him. This incident was the subject of the first charge in the indictment. 
     
      
    15    After they had left the chapel, the Complainant and the Appellant walked alongside one wall of the library building before turning right to pass along what appears to have been the front wall of the library building before turning right again in order to walk back to the hall. As they did so, the Appellant had his hand on the Complainant’s shoulder. While they were walking along the front of the library building, they were passed by another teacher - either a Mr. Mc or a Mr. D, the Complainant could not remember which - walking in the opposite direction. 
     
      
    16    After they had passed the other teacher, instead of turning right at the end of the library building, the Appellant guided the Complainant towards the front gate of the school, using his hand on the Complainant’s shoulder to do so. When they reached the entrance of a building described as the Year 12 block, they entered and went up a staircase stopping on a landing. The block was closed that night and it was dark.  
     
      
    17    When they reached the landing, the Appellant started to kiss the Complainant again. The Complainant may have said something about wanting to go back to the hall. The Appellant said “Don’t worry this won’t take long”. As the Appellant kissed him, he (the Appellant) rubbed the area of the Complainant’s penis on the outside of his clothes. The Complainant had an erection. The Appellant unzipped the Complainant’s trousers and put his hand on the inside of the Complainant’s underpants and began rubbing the Complainant’s penis. The Complainant did not consent to the Appellant kissing him on this occasion or touching his penis. This incident was the subject of the second charge in the indictment. 
     
      
    18    The Appellant then unzipped his own trousers and began masturbating himself. The Appellant was touching his own penis with one hand and the Complainant’s penis with the other. The Appellant then took the Complainant’s hand and placed it on the Appellant’s penis and started moving his body in a thrusting motion. At this point the Complainant noticed that the Appellant was circumcised. The Appellant pushed the Complainant’s head down towards his penis. The Complainant moved back and the Appellant started touching himself again until he ejaculated. The Complainant could see a white spot on the ground. The Complainant did not consent to the Appellant touching his penis or to the Appellant putting his (the Complainant’s) hand on the Appellant’s penis. This incident was the subject of the third charge in the indictment. 
     
      
    19    The Appellant then zipped his trousers up and apologised. They then left the Year 12 building, turned left to walk back towards the hall which they entered. The Complainant did not tell anyone at the hall what had happened. He said he wanted to forget it, he was confused, and could not make sense of it.  
     
      
    20    The following year the Complainant continued to attend the school as a pupil in Year 11. During the year he saw the Appellant occasionally but never in private. In 1997 the Complainant, for reasons which do not bear on the present matter, changed school and moved out of his parent’s home. When he did so, he stayed in various crisis centres, staying in the third such centre for most of the year 1997.  
     
      
    21    Shortly after he went to live in the third centre he disclosed to his case worker Ms. B. what had happened to him in Year 10.  
     
      
    22    Ms. B. gave evidence that, in March 1997 she was a youth worker at the third of the centres where the Complainant lived in 1997. According to the records of that centre, the Complainant arrived there on 10 March 1997. On 15 March 1997 the Complainant disclosed to her what had happened to him at school. Ms. B. made notes about the conversation with the Complainant on the following morning and made an entry in the communications book which was kept at the centre. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to record in any detail what was the evidence given by Ms. B. as to what the Complainant told her in March 1997.  
     
      
    23    Detective Senior Constable Fileman attached to the Child Protection and Enforcement Agency was officer in charge of the case. He gave evidence of having spoken to the Appellant on 20 May 1997 and informed him that he had received a complaint from the Complainant, which complaint the Appellant said he rejected. The Appellant was taken to the Police Station and interviewed by way of ERISP in the course of which interview the Appellant denied the allegations which were put to him. However, while he said he was not sure whether he showed the Complainant the chapel he said that he may have done so, and that, while he could not recall giving the Complainant a glass of wine, it was possible that he did so. Detective Fileman attended the school with the Complainant during June 1997 and took some photographs. He checked a diary entry which identified the evening in question as having been on 6 December 1995. 
     
      
    24    Each of Mr. Mc. and Mr. D. was called to give evidence, the former giving evidence that he attended the function in question and recalled the Complainant and the Appellant being present but did not recall crossing paths with anyone when he walked from the hall to his car that evening, and the latter giving evidence that he attended the function in question but could not recall whether the Complainant or the Appellant was present nor did he recall seeing the Complainant in company with the Appellant that night.  
     
      
    25    Having summarised the case which the Crown sought to put forward, it is convenient here to pause to record the particular aspect of that case which provides the basis for the first ground of appeal taken on behalf of the Appellant.  
     
      
    26    After the Appellant had been arraigned, his pleas entered and the jury empanelled, P. J. O’Donnell, who then appeared, as he did on the hearing of this appeal, for the Appellant, in the absence of the jury sought to have Backhouse DCJ rule that the evidence of complaint which it was anticipated would be led from the Complainant and from Ms. B. was inadmissible. Although the transcript record (T. 17/8/98 p. 2) does not record the discussion which then occurred, the detailed written reasons which Backhouse DCJ was later to provide - they are dated 16 December 1998 - would indicate that Mr. O’Donnell’s application was advanced on two bases: 
     
      
       
      1. that given the sixteen months which had passed since the evening in question, the complaint made by the Complainant to Ms. B. in March 1997 was not “fresh in the memory of (the Complainant)” with the meaning of s. 66(2) of the Evidence Act 1995; and 
       
       
      2. that, even if the evidence of complaint were admissible under s. 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, the manner in which it was intended that the evidence of Ms. B. would be led would lead to unfair prejudice to the Appellant and, thus, that evidence ought not to be admitted (Evidence Act 1995 s. 137). 
       
      
    27    At the commencement of the second day of the hearing and before any evidence was tendered in the Crown case Backhouse DCJ formally recorded her rulings, first, that the evidence of the complaint was admissible and, second, that any prejudice to the Appellant arising from the editing of the evidence of Ms. B. did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence. At the same time her Honour indicated that she would reduce her reasons for so ruling to writing.  
     
      
    28    It is clear from her written reasons - which, as I have earlier noted, were dated 16 December 1998 - that, in ruling that the evidence of the complaint was admissible under s.66 of the Evidence Act 1995, Backhouse DCJ had relied upon the decision of this Court (Newman, Levine and Barr JJ) in R. v. Graham  2 December 1997 (unreported) an appeal from the decision in which had been heard, and upheld, by the High Court on 6 August 1998 although the Judgment of the High Court in which was not delivered until 30 September 1998. In the circumstances, the Crown now concedes that the evidence of the Complainant’s complaint to Ms. B. was not admissible under s.66 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    29    Since the delivery of the High Court’s Judgment in Graham v. The Queen  [1998] HCA 61; 72 ALJR 1491; 157 ALR 404 similar issues have been examined in this Court on a number of occasions, as, for example, R. v. Gillard  [1999] NSWCCA 21 in which case the period between occurrence and complaint was twelve months, R. v. Dwyer  [1999] NSWCCA 47 in which case the periods between occurrence and complaint ranged between six to ten years, and R. v. Whitmore  [1999] NSWCCA 247 in which case the period between occurrence and complaint was about three years. In each case, this Court held that the evidence of complaint was not admissible under s. 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, quashed the convictions and directed new trials.  
     
      
    30    In the circumstances, as I have already noted, the Crown concedes that the evidence of complaint to Ms. B. was inadmissible but, as I will later record, submits that no miscarriage of justice has occurred as - so it is submitted - in the circumstances, if sought, leave to adduce the evidence would have been granted pursuant to the provisions of s.108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
    31    At the end of the Crown case and, in the absence of the jury, Mr. O’Donnell sought from Backhouse DCJ what has come to be known as “a Prasad direction” (R. v. Prasad  (1979) 23 SASR 161) the bases upon which he advanced his application being, first, that the Crown case ultimately depended upon the acceptability of the Complainant as a witness of truth, there being no corroboration of that evidence either by way of independent evidence or by admission on the part of the Appellant and, the delay in making the complaint, which delay, so he submitted, was a significant factor to be borne in mind when assessing the credit of the Complainant. However, her Honour declined to give the direction which was sought (T. 19/8/98 pp. 31-32). 
     
      
    32    I record, in summary form, the case which the Appellant sought to advance on the hearing. 
     
      
    33    The Appellant gave evidence that he had been a school teacher for twenty-eight years and that apart from matters then under consideration he had been never charged with, or convicted of, any criminal offence. 
     
      
    34    It was the Appellant’s duty to co-ordinate the catering for the evening in question. The evening was a means of thanking employers who had given time and effort to make the work experience programme a success. It was a chance for them to see the work of the students. It was a general “PR exercise” for the school.  
     
      
    35    The Complainant was a student at the school and was present at the awards night function. During the night there was some talk among the students about trying to get some wine. The Complainant asked him for some wine. The Appellant said that as a joke he obtained a small plastic party glass of wine and gave it to the Complainant in front of some other people. The Complainant took a sip and said “Oh that’s revolting” and gave it back to the Appellant. The Appellant said that they all laughed. 
     
      
    36    The Appellant had a conversation with the Complainant about the chapel during which the Complainant asked if he could see the lighting in the chapel. The Appellant can recall saying to someone “I’m just going to show (the Complainant) the lighting”. The Appellant and the Complainant left the hall. At the chapel, the entrance doors were open and the lights were on. The Appellant switched some of the lights up and down and the Complainant used the lights to get different effects. The Appellant then said “We’d best go”. At no time did the Appellant enter the small rooms near the altar with the Complainant on that evening. Earlier that afternoon the Appellant did go into one of the rooms to prepare the chapel. At no stage whilst in the chapel did the Appellant kiss the Complainant or touch him on the shoulders. 
     
      
    37    They then walked back along the driveway between the Year 12 block and the library. At the first logical point they turned right and walked down past the library and back in the double doors of the hall. At no time that evening did he go to the Year 12 stairwell with the Complainant. At no time did he touch the Complainant in a sexual way or have the Complainant touch him in a sexual way. They returned to the hall and the Appellant spoke to another teacher Mr. R. He saw the Complainant accompany Mr. R. to a table with several others.  
     
      
    38    The Appellant left prior to the end of the evening function because of the condition - sleep apnoea - from which he suffers and which renders him unable to stay awake beyond late evening. He had been working at the function all day and was exhausted. He left quietly, saying goodbye to only a few people.  
     
      
    39    On the day that the Appellant was interviewed by police he was particularly unwell. During the police questioning he felt totally exhausted. He asked both Detective Fileman and Officer Sanders for medication but did not discuss with the officers his ailment.  
     
      
    40    Mr. R. gave evidence that he was a secondary English teacher formerly teaching at the school. A fellow teacher and colleague while he was at the school was the Appellant. Mr. R. can recall the Appellant and the Complainant being present at the function. He observed the Appellant leaving the hall on several occasions during the night to show different groups of people the chapel. He also recalls seeing the Appellant and the Complainant leaving the hall together. The Appellant said to him “I’m just showing (the Complainant) down to the chapel, I’ll be back soon.” Shortly afterwards Mr. R. left the hall to go to his car to find some headache tablets.  
     
      
    41    Mr. R’s car was parked at the end of what was described as F block opposite the library. While he was there, he observed the Appellant and the Complainant walking from the chapel area around the library. From what he could see the Appellant was not touching the Complainant. He saw them walk along the staff car park area which runs parallel to the Year 12 block towards the hall. He was standing at his car when he observed this. 
     
      
    42    Mr. R eventually closed the car door having found no headache tablets. On his walk back to the hall he did not lose sight of the Complainant and the Appellant. From his perspective they could not have gone straight ahead past the library and into the Year 12 block. Upon entering the hall Mr. R spoke to some staff and senior students. He asked the Appellant about getting some headache tablets. He later sat down with the Complainant and his brother and had dinner with them. 
     
      
    43    A Ms. V gave evidence that she was a teacher and in 1995 taught at the school. She did not attend the function on the evening in question. She had been in the Year 12 stairwell after sunset in December. It is very dark. If she was standing on the landing with the internal light fixtures extinguished she would not be able to see the ground. There is a window above the stairwell but it is covered in a thick mesh and is very dirty. 
     
      
    44    A Mr. L gave evidence that he is a teacher and colleague of the Appellant at the school. In December 1997 at about 9.30 in the evening Mr. L had to go into the stairwell area of the Year 12 block. It was extremely dark and he had to hold onto the stair rail even though he was familiar with the building. 
     
      
    45    In addition to the evidence of those witnesses, there were two witnesses who gave evidence as to the good character of the Appellant, one of those, a former student of the Appellant and, at the time, a family friend, also giving evidence that the Appellant’s behaviour in the company of children and adults was one of integrity. Further, some of those who treated the Appellant for his condition of sleep apnoea gave evidence as to the effect which that condition can have on a person affected by it.  
     
      
    46    At the commencement of her summing-up, Backhouse DCJ gave what one might call the expected directions as to the respective roles of the jury and herself; as to the onus of proof and the standard of proof, emphasising that the onus of proof remained throughout on the Crown, there being no onus of proof on the accused at all, and emphasising as well that it was for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt each ingredient in each charge.  
     
      
    47    Having done so, her Honour proceeded (p. 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case there is one witness who is essential to the proof of the Crown case, and that is (the Complainant) and you should therefore examine, and scrutinise, his evidence with great care before you decide that a verdict of guilty should be brought in, if at all, and you should only find the accused guilty if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the truth of the evidence of that witness. Now the fact that I have given you that warning does not mean that I have formed any view as to the honesty or reliability of that witness, it is a warning that would be given in any case where the Crown case depended on the evidence of one witness.” 
        
       
       
      
    48    Having done so, her Honour then reminded the jury of the three charges which were before them, identified the essential facts which the Crown had to establish in respect of those charges and then gave the jury directions as to the meaning in law of the word “assault”, of the phrase “an act of indecency” and as to the necessity for the Complainant being under the authority of the Appellant, which fact had not been challenged during the hearing on behalf of the Appellant. 
     
      
    49    Having done so, her Honour then proceeded to deal in an extended fashion with the evidence which had been tendered on behalf of both the Crown and the Appellant, as she did so drawing the jury’s attention to the various matters upon which either the Crown Prosecutor or Mr. O’Donnell had sought to place emphasis during the course of their submissions. 
     
      
    50    Her Honour then proceeded to discuss with the jury how they might go about their task of fact finding. In the course of doing so, her Honour said (pp. 34-36): 
     
      
       
        
        “The next direction of law that I give you relates to what is called complaint evidence. The evidence which is described as complaint evidence is the evidence from (sic) which you have heard from (Ms. B). You have heard evidence from the complainant that he, at the refuge, met - I think he was only there for a matter of perhaps a few days, up to a week - when apparently he had this conversation at the refuge with (Ms. B), who was then his case worker. You have heard the evidence from (Ms. B) herself as to what she said happened on that occasion. The first matter which I direct you about is that the evidence of (Ms. B), that it is evidence going to the truth of what it asserts, in other words it is capable of establishing the fact, that is the fact of what she says was said on that occasion. In other words, that if you accept her evidence, that it is capable of assisting you in your assessing the guilt, or otherwise, of the accused in this trial. That is, it is evidence of the truth of what it asserts, that is what was said. 
        
       
       
        
        I will, at this point of time, direct you, as I am obliged to under the law, with respect to the evidence of (Ms. B). I am obliged to warn you that the evidence of (Ms. B) may be unreliable because her evidence, in effect, emanates from the complainant himself, and therefore depends, in turn, upon whether you accept the complainant as a credible witness, and what he has told you in his evidence. The fact is, the evidence which she is giving is a repeated assertion to her, and that being so, it does not enhance a basic lack of reliability - if you find that to be the case - in other words if you do not accept the complainant, the evidence of (Ms. B) cannot improve the veracity of his evidence. It is because of that that I am required to warn you of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of (Ms. B) and the weight to be given to it by you.  
        
       
       
        
        The next matter is a direction, having in mind the aspect of delay in the making of the complaint by the complainant. Firstly, I am required to warn you that delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence committed was false. I am also required to inform you that there may be good reason why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault. You may think that that is perfectly obvious. There may, of course, be good reasons for delay. The question for you to consider is whether, in this case, the complaint and the circumstances in which it was made are consistent with the allegations, or whether they throw doubt upon them.  
        
       
       
        
        The next matter which I must direct you about in relation to this question of delay is that in evaluating the evidence of the complainant, and in determining whether to believe him, you may take into account his failure to make a complaint at the earliest reasonable opportunity, as reducing his credibility. Finally in relation to this question of delay by the complainant in making his complaint, I direct you that delay by the complainant in making his complaint in this case, has created difficulty for the accused in meeting the allegations, because of the absence of any opportunity to investigate the circumstances in which the events were alleged to have taken place.” 
        
       
       
      
    51    Except for the matter to which I next refer, there is no other aspect of her Honour’s summing-up which need be recorded.  
     
      
    52    The transcript (T. 18/8/98 p.27) records the following in the course of the Complainant’s cross-examination after Mr. O’Donnell had pointed out to the Complainant what appeared to be differences between the evidence which he had given in chief and the statement which he had made to the police in 1997: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Which version is incorrect, that is, what is in your statement or what you think you remember in the witness box today? A. I think the statement would be more accurate because I wasn’t feeling so nervous when I made it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were more relaxed when you made the police statement? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I suggest the reason for the difference is that (the Appellant) never took you into that room at all, what do you say about that? A. I say that is not true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. See, what I am suggesting to you is that you falsely accused him of being in that room with you, what do you say about that? A. There was no reason for me to falsely accuse him of anything, out of all the teachers I admired him most. I have nothing - besides that I have nothing against him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I suggest to you that the reason why there is a difference is that it never happened and you are having trouble remembering what you said previously? A. I might forget the order in who walked in that room first, but what I said did happen.” 
        
       
       
      
    53    At the conclusion of the final addresses of the Crown Prosecutor and Mr. O’Donnell, there followed, in the absence of the jury, a considerable debate as to the directions which her Honour should give in her summing-up to the jury. The transcript (T. 20/8/99 pp. 49-50) records the following (inter alia) at the commencement of that debate: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour the second complaint is this. In cross-examination the complainant in answer to a suggestion by me that he had made it up, said there was no reason by me to falsely accuse the accused of anything, and I think he went on to say, ‘I idolised him’. That answer of course was not responsive to the question. In other words he introduced the additional consideration that he had no motive to fabricate the allegation against the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        I formed the opinion at that stage your Honour that it was - although it wasn’t strictly admissible, it was best left alone in that if it were excluded from the evidence it would only highlight the jury’s appreciation of it. My friend decided to incorporate that evidence into her address to the jury. Your Honour there is now a long line of authority culminating in the decision of  
        Jovanovic 
         that’s reported in 1997 42 NSWLR 520, where the advancing of that submission by the Crown or the reference to that line of logic by the trial judge in summing-up is a serious miscarriage. It amounts your Honour to the assertion why would the complainant rely, which of course is the prohibited logic that the courts have been anxious to stamp out in this type of litigation. That is my second complaint your Honour.” 
        
       
       
      
    54    The debate as to directions continued for some considerable time, at the conclusion of which her Honour indicated, albeit with some reluctance, that she proposed to give “a Jovanovic direction” in order to avoid the possibility of the trial miscarrying. 
     
      
    55    Accordingly, at the conclusion of her summing-up, her Honour said (pp. 47-48): 
     
      
       
        
        “The final matter of which I give you a direction about is that it would be natural to ask yourselves why the complainant … would make up such serious allegations against the accused. I give you the following directions about that question.  
        
       
       
        
        As you have been told, the essential elements of the Crown case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, or the accused must be acquitted. The case turns on the evidence of (the complainant) you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that (the complainant) has told the truth. As you have been told, it is your duty to decide whether you accept the evidence of a witness in whole or in part, (the complainant) is no exception to that. It would be wrong to conclude that (the complainant) is telling the truth because there is no reason, in your view, for (the complainant) to lie. People lie for all sorts of reasons, sometimes it is apparent, sometimes it is not. Sometimes the reason is discovered, sometimes it is not. You cannot be satisfied that (the complainant) is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for (the complainant) to have made up these allegations. There might be a reason for (the complainant) to be untruthful that nobody knows about.” 
        
       
       
      
    56    As I have earlier recorded, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to each of the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    57    The Appellant sought to appeal against his convictions upon two grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. that Backhouse DCJ erred in allowing evidence of complaint under s. 66 of the Evidence Act 1995; and 
       
       
      2. that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory - on the hearing of the appeal this ground was by consent amended so as to read “the convictions were unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence”. ( 
      Fleming v. R. 
        
       [1998] HCA 68; 73 ALJR 1; 158 ALR 379 
      ). 
       
      
    58    As I have earlier noted, Mr. P.J. O’Donnell appeared for the Appellant on the hearing of the appeal, while Mr. C.K. Maxwell QC appeared for the Crown.  
     
      
    59    Mr. O’Donnell sought to argue the second ground of appeal first upon the basis that, if that ground were to succeed, it would be unnecessary to consider the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
    60    At the outset, Mr. O’Donnell accepted that, notwithstanding the change in terminology, the principles to be applied in determining this ground were those laid down by the High Court in M. v. The Queen  (1994) 181 CLR 487. Having done so, Mr. O’Donnell identified as matters which ought to lead the Court to conclude that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offences charged:  
     
      
       
      (a) there was no immediate complaint; 
       
       
      (b) the evidence of Mr. R cast a significant doubt on the Complainant’s assertion that he was taken into the stairwell of the Year 12 block where he stated that the incidents the subject of counts 2 and 3 occurred; 
       
       
      (c) the Complainant admitted giving false information to a refuge worker in March 1997; 
       
       
      (d) the Complainant reversed the order in which he and the Appellant entered the chapel when his evidence was compared with his police statement; 
       
       
      (e) in his evidence, the Complainant failed to recall a second separate incident of kissing to which he had referred in his police statement; 
       
       
      (f) the evidence of Ms. V and Mr. L as to the lighting conditions in the stairwell in the Year 12 building cast extreme doubt upon the ability of the Complainant - as he claimed - to have seen semen on the floor of the stairwell in the Year 12 building after the Appellant ejaculated; 
       
       
      (g) the Complainant omitted from his police statement an allegation which he made in evidence that the Appellant pushed his head towards his penis; and 
       
       
      (h) the Appellant made no admissions to the police and gave sworn evidence denying the allegations. 
       
      
    61    Of these matters, Mr. O’Donnell appeared to place the greatest stress upon (b), (f) and (g). 
     
      
    62    In the leading Judgment in M v. The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ wrote  supra at 493-495: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.  
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        … In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lack probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the positions in the form in which they are set out above.” 
        
       
       
      
    63    Having read the whole of the evidence which was tendered at the trial, I have concluded that, notwithstanding the various matters upon which Mr. O’Donnell has sought to rely, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although - unless the evidence of complaint to Ms B were available to provide it - there was no evidence corroborative of the evidence of the Complainant, it is not without point to recall that the Complainant’s evidence was that, during the course of the incident the subject of the third charge in the indictment, he noticed that - as the Appellant was later to concede - that the Appellant was circumcised. This, one would think, was a fact of which the Complainant would not have been aware if he had not seen the Appellant in a state of undress. Further, the evidence which the Appellant gave at the hearing differed in a number of respects - which the jury might have thought to be of some significance - from the answers given by him and recorded in the ERISP. Nor, if I may say so, need the jury have placed upon the evidence of Mr. R, Ms. V and Mr. L the weight which Mr. O’Donnell would seek to have put on it - indeed, it seems to me, that the evidence of Mr. R had an air of unreality about it.  
     
      
    64    In the result, I conclude that this ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
    65    As I have previously recorded, the Crown, while conceding that the evidence of complaint to Ms. B was not admissible under s. 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, nonetheless submitted that no miscarriage of justice had occurred as - so it was submitted - in the circumstances, if sought, leave to adduce the evidence would have been granted pursuant to the provisions of s.108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    66    I am by no means persuaded that, if Backhouse DCJ had acceded to Mr. O’Donnell’s submission that the complaint to Ms. B was not made at a time when the matters the subject of that complaint were fresh in the memory of the Complainant, she would then, on application made pursuant to the provisions of s. 108 of the Evidence Act 1995, have been disposed to grant leave to adduce evidence of the complaint.  
     
      
    67    While it may be that the Appellant’s denial, both at the time of his being interviewed by Detective Fileman and in the course of the ERISP, of the matters complained of by the Complainant, coupled with the suggestion, in the course of cross-examination, to which I have earlier (see para. 52 (above)) referred, that the Complainant had falsely accused the Appellant of being in the room off the chapel, could well have amounted to a suggestion that the evidence of the Complainant had been “fabricated”, which suggestion might have enlivened the discretion in s. 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995, the questions which would need to be asked are, first, whether, and to what extent, allowing the evidence of complaint would assist the jury in resolving the question whether or not the Complainant had fabricated his evidence, and, second, whether allowing the evidence of the complaint would be productive of unfair prejudice to the Appellant so that the evidence should be rejected pursuant to the provisions of s.137 of the Evidence Act 1995. Furthermore, it may well be that the cross-examination may not have taken the course it did but for the earlier ruling of her Honour. 
     
      
    68    So far as the first of those questions is concerned, the observations of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Graham v. The Queen  ALJR at p. 1493; ALR at p.406 are instructive. In paras. 8-9 of their joint Judgment, their Honours say: 
     
      
       
        
        “In exercising the discretion under s. 108(3) to permit the adducing of evidence of a prior consistent statement, it is important to bear two matters in mind. First, s. 108 creates an exception to the ‘credibility rule’ - the rule that evidence that is relevant  
        only 
         to a witness’ credibility is not admissible. Second, it is important to identify how the evidence relates to the statutory premise for its admission. Whether, if admissible, a complaint becomes evidence of the truth of what is asserted is not relevant to the exercise of the discretion to give leave under s.108. The exercise of the discretion under s. 108 depends upon the effect of the evidence upon the witness’ credibility: here the suggestion of fabrication.  
        
       
       
        
        How does the making of a complaint six years after the events bear upon that question? Unless the making of the complaint can be said to assist the resolution of that question, the evidence of a complaint is not important and would do nothing except add to the length of the hearing. And in this case, it is by no means clear that the making of a complaint six years after the event does assist deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her evidence. Although trial counsel for the appellant suggested to the complainant, by his last question in cross-examination, that she was ‘making it all up’, the allegation of fabrication of evidence did not loom large in the trial. No question was put, and no answer was given, from which the time of alleged fabrication could be identified. The complaint having been made in 1994, and it having led at once to the start of police investigations, it may be doubted that a jury would gain assistance from its making in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her story.” 
        
       
       
      
    69    So far as the second question is concerned, I note that, if - a question which Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ left open in the course of their Judgment in Graham v. The Queen - the effect of the joint operation of ss. 60, 66 of the Evidence Act 1995 is that, if evidence of complaint admitted pursuant to the provisions of s.108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 were to become evidence not merely of the complainant’s complaint, but evidence also of the facts related in the complaint, it might be open to a court to conclude that to admit the evidence of complaint would be productive of unfair prejudice to an accused. 
     
      
    70    In the present case, as I have earlier recorded, Backhouse DCJ instructed the jury that the evidence of Ms. B as to the complaint made to her by the Complainant was evidence of the truth of what she was told. Because the admission of the evidence of that complaint was not justified under s.66 of the Evidence Act 1995, and its admission was not inevitable pursuant to s.108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995, and because of the direction given by Backhouse DCJ to the jury in respect of the evidence of the complaint, I am unable to conclude that the Appellant did not lose a significant chance of an acquittal, it following, in my view, that the appeal should be allowed on this ground.  
     
      
    71    The formal Orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1.  
      ORDER 
       that the appeal be allowed. 
       
       
      2.  
      ORDER 
       that the convictions and sentences be quashed. 
       
       
      3.  
      ORDER 
       that there be a new trial. 
       
       
      
    72    HULME J:  I agree with Powell JA. 
     
      
       
      
    73    DOWD J: I have read the judgment in draft form of Powell JA. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour’s reasons for those orders.

      Regina v Dale Wesley BARRY 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    STEIN JA:  The applicant, Dale Wesley Barry, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on him by Newman J on 18 June 1999. The applicant had pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife and to maliciously wounding his step-daughter, Tara, with intent to do her grievous bodily harm. He was found guilty of both offences by a jury on 11 June 1999. The offences occurred on 9 December 1997 at Albury. 
    2    His Honour imposed a minimum term of 18 years and an additional term of 6 years, for the murder. With respect to the wounding of the stepdaughter, his Honour fixed a term of 12 years, to be served concurrently. Both sentences were to be calculated to run from 9 December 1997. 
    3    The applicant did not deny killing his wife. Rather he admitted that he had acted either with an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, but raised a defence of diminished responsibility. 
    4    The applicant and his wife were married on 19 September 1992. They had associated prior to the marriage, such association, according to his Honour’s judgment on sentence, was attended by violence. Indeed, he had been found guilty of assault on her on 1 July 1992 and placed on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 2 years. Quite remarkably the applicant assaulted his wife on their wedding night resulting in a further conviction on 16 November 1992 and a community service order.  
    5    Between the date of marriage and November 1996 there was evidence of violent episodes on the applicant’s part. In early November 1996 the applicant assaulted the deceased again. This resulted in an apprehended violence order (AVO) being made against the applicant, which was initially for a period of 12 months but extended to 28 November 1997. During extended periods of separation the applicant had access to the two children of the marriage and to the children of the deceased, including Tara. 
    6    It seems that the applicant joined his family for a holiday at Bateman’s Bay in Easter 1997 and thereafter cohabitation resumed. Cohabitation apparently continued until October 1997 when the applicant was involved in violence towards his stepson, Benjamin. As a result of this the deceased took herself and her children to a women’s refuge. According to his Honour, a further AVO was taken out against the applicant. The deceased then returned to the family home with the children. There was no subsequent cohabitation but the applicant sought access to the children. On 6 December 1997 the deceased told the applicant that he no longer could have access to the children. 
    7    According to the evidence, in November 1997 the applicant told Mr Milgate, with whom he was living at the time, that he intended to kill his wife. Prior to this the applicant had admitted himself to Nolan House for treatment for alcoholism. 
    8    On the night of 8 December 1997 the applicant was drinking at an Albury hotel and was seen by a hotel supervisor in the car parking area at about 12.30 am. Later he went to the former family home in the Albury suburbs, arriving there around 2 am. It does not appear that he forced entry into the house although it is unclear how access was gained. His Honour accepted that an argument developed between the deceased and the applicant, probably over access to the children.9    The only direct evidence as to the incident giving rise to the charges came from Tara, since the applicant claimed to be suffering from amnesia in respect of all of the significant events. 
    10    Adopting the evidence given by Tara, his Honour found that: 
     
      
       
       … the prisoner and the deceased were observed by Tara Barry to be in the main bedroom of the house on the bed within that room - the prisoner being on top of the deceased. Following the making of this observation Tara Barry returned to her bedroom which was described during the proceedings as bedroom two. There she stood in the doorway of that bedroom which was situated on a hallway which gave access to all four bedrooms in the house. While standing at the doorway facing into the hallway she saw the prisoner walk down the hallway away from the main bedroom heading in the direction of the kitchen of the house. When the prisoner reached the point at which Tara Barry was standing he turned, faced her and stabbed her in the upper abdomen causing a wound of approximately 2-3cm on her skin and penetrating some 6-7cm into her body penetrating the right lobe of her liver and dividing the hepatic artery and portal vein. 
       
      
    11    His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       Soon thereafter the prisoner directed both Tara Barry and the deceased into the kitchen. He forced his wife to the floor and as I understand the evidence, directed Tara Barry to also lie on the floor. He then proceeded to stab the deceased at least four times, three of the stab wounds being inflicted to her right breast and one on her upper right upper arm. The principal wound thus inflicted was in the medical right breast which caused a wound 17 mm long on her skin and extended some 160 cms into her body, penetrating a major vessel within her lungs. This wound was categorised by Dr Lawrence, forensic pathologist, as being the lethal injury. Lethal because it would cause death due to blood loss.  
       
      
      
     and 
      
       
      
      The prisoner then left the kitchen. Tara Barry was still on the floor, as was the deceased, both bleeding from the wounds inflicted by the prisoner. It seems the prisoner went to attend to the young children at this stage. 
      
      
      He then returned to the kitchen and picked up a padded stool and began to beat the deceased around the face with it. Dr Lawrence, pathologist, found no less than five wounds which he felt were probably the result of the application of blunt force to the deceased’s face, nose and cheek area involving the breaking of the skin and fractures.  
      
    12    The applicant, by his counsel Mr Pappas, submits that his Honour should not have accepted beyond reasonable doubt the sequence of events deposed by Tara. By doing so, it is submitted that his Honour denied the defence hypothesis of a very different sequence of events. This was, a frenzied and swift attack on the deceased, wounding Tara in the course of that attack. It is submitted that his Honour failed to appreciate the possibility that the murder occurred in a way inconsistent with the evidence of Tara, who was aged 12 years at the time and 14 years at the time of trial. Support for the defence hypothesis is said to arise from police evidence, from Detective Callister and the evidence of the neighbours. Inconsistencies in Tara’s evidence is also relied on in support of the submission. 
    13    As the Crown points out in its written submissions, the underlying thread of the submission is that it was not reasonably open to his Honour to accept beyond reasonable doubt the sequence of events deposed by Tara. It may be observed that there was nothing in Tara’s evidence of the sequence of events which is inconsistent with the verdict of the jury.  
    14    Further, there is no requirement to find facts which are the most favourable to a prisoner, R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, see also R v Harris [1961] VR 236. Not every alternative hypothesis has to be excluded, only a reasonable hypothesis, Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619; Queen v Puckeridge (1999) 168 ALR 4. 
    15    Tara was the only eye witness who could give evidence. She was cross-examined at length. However, she was not directly challenged on the sequence of events, or whereabouts in the house she said she was stabbed, nor about the demeanour and conduct that she attributed to the applicant. Nor did the police evidence directly contradict Tara’s evidence to any appreciable extent. 
    16    His Honour was in a position to assess Tara’s credibility and, it seems, accepted her to be credible and plausible. It was open to him to do so. It was also open to his Honour not to accept the hypothesis of the defence was not a reasonable possibility such as to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to Tara’s evidence. 
    17    The remaining grounds of appeal are that his Honour gave undue weight to retribution and deterrence, too little to rehabilitation, and the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
    18    In particular, it is submitted that his Honour erred in failing to take the applicant’s abnormality of mind into account in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences. However, a reading of his Honour’s remarks on sentence make it clear that he did treat the applicant’s abnormality of mind as diminishing the culpability of his actions. In particular, Newman J found that it was sufficient to take the case out of the category of the worst type of case which could give rise to a possible life sentence. 
    19    His Honour said that the objective facts indicated a breach of the law of the highest order. He referred to the pathology evidence as indicative of the vehemence of the attack and the police photographs which underscored it. We have examined the photographs today. Further, his Honour referred to the very serious stab wound upon Tara, which was life threatening, and to its consequences for Tara. 
    20    In considering the mitigating factors, his Honour referred to the evidence of the applicant’s mental condition at the time of the commission of the crimes. He referred to the psychiatric evidence of depression, (Dr Jolly and Professor Mullen). Professor Mullen was also of the opinion that the applicant was suffering from mood and personality disorders. His Honour referred to the evidence of the applicant’s childhood as being one of ‘disorganisation, distress, intimidation and violence’. Nonetheless, according to the Professor, alcoholism was the applicant’s main problem. His Honour noted the applicant’s excellent work record and his expression of contrition. He said: 
     
      
       
       The court is thus presented with a forty one year old man with a history of alcoholism, minor drug abuse and a childhood of privation who has been a good worker all his adult life. I have no doubt that he regards his natural children with affection but in view of the attack upon Tara Barry and the past history of some further violence towards her which was given in evidence and also the violence exhibited towards his stepson Benjamin is such that his affection is muted as far as those latter children are concerned.  
        
       
      
    21    His Honour sentenced the applicant on the basis of the principle of totality since both offences were committed as a consequence of the one episode. It was in this context that he referred to R v Twala (Court of Criminal Appeal, 4 November 1994, unreported). As in Twala, his Honour was of the view that the objective circumstances were such as to call for a sentence at the higher end of the range. However, unlike Twala, the additional serious crime of the attack on Tara had to be taken into account. 
    22    It is correct to say that the sentence imposed by his Honour was a very high one. However, his Honour was right to describe the crimes as brutal and horrific. Indeed, they were. The objective seriousness was very high. His Honour had to have regard to the totality of criminality involved in the two offences. He also had to have regard to the applicant’s history of violence directed to the deceased. At the time of the fatal attack, the applicant was subject to an apprehended violence order and was on a bond from a conviction of assault on the deceased. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the subjective circumstances. While the sentence is a very high one, I do not see that it can be said to be manifestly excessive. 
    23    Even assuming everything in favour of the applicant’s alternative scenario mentioned earlier, and were this Court to re-sentence the applicant, no lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour would, in my opinion, be appropriate. 
    24    I would grant the applicant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
    25    DUNFORD J: I agree. 
    26    SPERLING J: I agree. 
    27    STEIN JA: The orders of the Court are that the applicant be granted leave to appeal against the sentence and the appeal is dismissed.

     REGINA v Jerry Leslie HANSELL 
      
     JUDGMENT:  
    1   PRIESTLEY J: Mr Justice Smart will give the reasons. 
    2   SMART AJ: Jerry Leslie Hansell appeals against his conviction on two counts of armed robbery and seeks leave to appeal against the severity of concurrent sentences each comprising a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. 
    3   The only issue in the trial was the identification of the appellant as the armed robber. The Crown case depended very substantially on the evidence of Ms Crystal Pescud. She said that about 8.45pm on 26 February 1998 as she and her friend, Mrs Betty Potter, walked from the Mingara Recreation Club to Mrs Potter’s vehicle in the car park, she saw a white Ford Falcon being reversed and driven around to the row in which Mrs Potter had parked her vehicle. The Falcon was parked two spaces away. Ms Pescud identified the car because “it's exactly like my father owned”. Ms Pescud said that when she got to Mrs Potter’s vehicle she put the shopping bags of groceries which she was carrying down on the ground. Mrs Potter was unlocking the passenger’s side front door of her vehicle. 
    4   A male passenger got out of the Falcon, walked over and stood beside Ms Pescud. He was about half a metre away. The area was well lit. The light on a nearby lamp post was on as were the lights on the Falcon. The male, later identified as the appellant said, according to her, “Give us your bag”. She turned and looked at him and down at the knife he was holding. He said, “Give us your bag or I'll stab you in the stomach.” She took her bag, (a backpack)off and put it on the ground. The blade of the knife was pointing forwards. It had a red handle and the blade had a straight edge with the tip being broken off. The blade was roughly about 10 cms long.  
    5   The appellant picked up the bag. She next recalls seeing him standing over Mrs Potter who was sitting in the passenger side of the car, leaning backwards with her legs out of the car. The appellant said to Mrs Potter, “Give us your bag”. Mrs Potter refused. The appellant cut the straps off the bag and took it. She was trying to sound the horn of her car. The male drove off in his white Ford Falcon. 
    6   Ms Pescud memorised the registration number of the Ford Falcon and told the lady in the club and a security guard. The police were contacted and Ms Pescud repeated the number to a police officer when he arrived.  
    7   Ms Pescud said that she looked at the face of the male for “roughly about five seconds, maybe a bit longer”. She described him as having, “Sort of shoulder length curly brown hair. He was wearing a short sleeved shirt...it was a dark colour. Track suit pants”. She thought that they were black. She thought that the male was about twenty eight years of age. She said that he was a bit taller than her and that she was about five foot six inches. She did not recall any tattoos on his arms. There were some.  
    8   She said that about a week later - in fact it was five - she went to Wyong Police Station where she was shown a video containing pictures of thirteen males (it may have been twelve). She identified picture number 5 as being a picture of the armed robber. It was a picture of the appellant. She watched the video three times at the direction of Detective Norris. She said that she identified the appellant on the first occasion the tape was played. She said nothing at this stage but announced her identification on the second playing of the tape.  
    9   Mrs Potter could not identify the male who robbed her. She explained that it was “so dark that night”. When shown the video she was inclined to select pictures 10 and 12. The police ascertained that the white Ford Falcon, whose number had been memorised by Ms Pescud was registered in the name of the appellant. 
    10   The police attended his unit about 10.30pm and midnight that night but the appellant was not at home. About 1.15am Senior Constable Hughes found the Falcon in the lower visitor’s car park of the units. The car was secured with a chain and padlock around the steering wheel. The engine was still warm. The appellant denied being involved in the robberies. He admitted ownership of the vehicle but said that it had been stolen on the night.  
    11   He contended his vehicle had been stolen on five or six occasions previously and that he had reported that to the police on about three occasions. He said that he had not reported the vehicle missing on the other occasions because when he had reported it stolen the vehicle was located twice in a row just around the block. Therefore he “just went out and searched for it …knowing it’d probably be around the block again”. The appellant said the damage to the driver’s side locking mechanism occurred on a previous occasion but that he had chased the thieves before they gained access to the vehicle.  
    12   He said that on the night of the robberies the lock had been “picked out properly to gain access to the vehicle”. The appellant said that he noticed the vehicle missing about 8pm on the evening of 26 February 1998 when he went downstairs to secure it. He and his wife then went looking for the vehicle on foot and located it around 10.30pm that evening at Shelley Beach Car Park. He then returned home and secured the vehicle with a chain and padlock. 
    13   The appellant said that he was six feet one inch in height and weighed about sixteen stone. He often went as high as eighteen stone. His physical appearance was the same as on the night of 26 February 1998 but that he may not have had a goatee. His hair would have been the same length but he usually combed it back. The appellant agreed that he did not have a goatee and moustache or wear his hair combed back in the video of 7 April 1998. That was when he was interviewed. 
    14   The trial judge gave extensive directions as to identification and he pointed out the deficiencies or possible deficiencies in the identification evidence led by the Crown. The judge summarised the defence case fully.  
    15   The appellant relied on these deficiencies in the identification evidence:  
     
      
       
       (i) Five weeks elapsed from Ms Pescud allegedly seeing him on 26 February 1998 and viewing the video on 31 March 1998. 
        
       (ii) Ms Pescud failed to observe the very distinct tattoos on his forearm. 
        
       (iii) Ms Pescud described the appellant as being a slightly built man and only a bit taller than her. He was six feet one inch tall and sixteen to eighteen stone.  
        
       (iv) Ms Pescud informed Senior Constable Hampton (the first police officer to whom she spoke) that the armed robber spoke with an English accent. The appellant was born and raised in Sydney and had never visited the United Kingdom.  
       
      
    16   These were only some of the deficiencies to which the judge referred to in his summing up. Additionally, the judge referred to Mrs Potter saying that it was quite dark and her estimate that the appellant was about three inches taller than her, she being five feet two inches tall. The judge also reminded the jury that Ms Pescud’s recollection of the events was an incomplete one. 
    17   Having studied the evidence I am of the view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt based on the evidence of Ms Pescud as to the type of car driven by the armed robber, its registration number and her visual observation of the robber and identification from the video. The vehicle was registered in the appellant’s name. His story as to the vehicle, and the vehicle’s movements on 26 February 1998, was one that was not credible.  
    18   There was no sufficient basis to refuse to admit Ms Pescud's evidence, nor to take the case from the jury. The evidence sufficiently supported the verdict. Essentially there was ample material for the jury to reach the verdict which it did. I would propose that the appeal against the conviction be dismissed.  
     
      
     SENTENCE:  
      
    19   After narrating the circumstances of the offence the judge correctly characterised the offence of armed robbery as extremely serious. He noted the absence of a plea of guilty, any subsequent contrition and the appellant's poor record. It stretched back to 1984 and included robbery with striking in 1987 and dishonesty offences in 1988. For both groups of offences the appellant received substantial sentences. However, from 1988 until the present offences in 1998 there were some relatively minor offences in 1992 but nothing else. Thus, for about ten years he has kept out of any serious trouble. 
    20   The judge considered the appellant's personal circumstances. These included: 
     
      
       
       (a) The appellant suffered severe emotional disturbance with the death of his young son, a quadriplegic. Amongst the effects was consequent depression. 
        
       (b) The appellant had engaged in charitable work to help young people, the disabled and the needy.  
        
       (c) The appellant suffers a degree of disability arising from his back condition. 
       
      
    21   I have had regard to the guidelines in this court's judgment in Henry. This case differs somewhat from the type of case that was being dealt with in Henry. In all the circumstances I have come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offences, the head sentence of six years was excessive and that the minimum term imposed was excessive. In my opinion the appropriate sentence was a head sentence of five years and a minimum term of three years nine months. Because we now have to consider the regime created under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I would propose that counsel be invited to address the form of the court order but my present provisional view is that there should be a head sentence of five years with a non parole period of three years nine months, the sentences to date from 8 June 1999. 
    22   PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with what has been proposed by Justice Smart and also with his reasons. 
    23   FOSTER AJA: I likewise agree. 
    24   PRIESTLEY JA: The court dismisses the appeal against conviction, grants leave to appeal against sentence and upholds the appeal and instead imposes a sentence in accordance with the terms stated by Mr Justice Smart. Perhaps for clarity sake, since the appellant is in person, we should repeat those.  
    25   SMART AJ: The total sentence is one of five years starting on 8 June 1999 with a non parole period of three years and nine months which expires on 7 March 2003. The effect of what has happened is that the head sentence has been reduced by one year and the non parole period by nine months. 
    26   PRIESTLEY JA: They are the orders of the court.

     REGINA v Kenneth William WATKINS 
     
     
     REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: This appeal was heard on 16 March 2000. At the end of the argument, the Court made orders allowing the appeal and quashing the convictions and directed that a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered in respect of each count in the indictment. 
     
      
    2    The appellant was indicted on six counts under s61D of the Crimes Act 1900 of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 years without her consent knowing she was not consenting thereto. In respect of each charge the complainant was the same person. The offences were charged in the indictment as having occurred between 1 May 1983 and 31 October 1984 when the complainant was aged between 10 and 12. The appellant was tried before Latham DCJ and a jury of twelve at Mudgee District Court. The trial began on 24 March 1999. On 25 March the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all six counts. On 23 July 1999, Judge Latham sentenced the appellant on each count to a concurrent sentence of two years penal servitude comprising a minimum term of 18 months and an additional term of six months. The minimum term began on 23 July 1999. The appellant has been in continuous custody since that date. 
     
      
    3    The appellant appealed against all six convictions. The ground of appeal was that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    4    The test to be applied by this Court in determining this appeal on the ground relied on is whether the Court thinks, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty; see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-4 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450.  
     
      
    5    To that statement of principle the High Court has added in those cases important pre-requisites. The question posed is not to be answered “merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits” (Jones at 451). The Court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and innocence or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the Court must pay full regard to those considerations. In Jones at 451 reference was made to M v The Queen at 494 and the explanation given of the test: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    6    Not surprisingly the Crown’s only witness of the commission of the offences was the complainant. She described the move her family, which consisted of her mother, a brother and a sister, made from Narrabri to Mudgee in 1983. In her evidence in chief, given nearly 16 years after the event, she said that the move took place in about May. The family went to live in a flat in Horatio Street. A few weeks after the move, the complainant was enrolled at Mudgee Public School in year 5. The Crown evidence established beyond any doubt from school records that the complainant first attended at Mudgee Public School on 15 August 1983.  
     
      
    7    Once at the school, the complainant made friends with Michelle Watkins, the daughter of the appellant. As well he had two sons. The appellant and his family lived in a house directly across Horatio Street from the flat in which the complainant and her family lived. According to the complainant, the friendship was formed within a few days of her starting at Mudgee Public School. About a month later, she stayed over night at the Watkins’ house and came to know Michelle’s parents, the appellant and his wife. Thereafter she stayed on more than six occasions. 
     
      
    8    When she stayed at the Watkins’ house, she slept in the same bedroom as Michelle which was next to Mr and Mrs Watkins’ bedroom. In Michelle’s bedroom were double bunks. Michelle occupied the lower bunk, the complainant the upper bunk, which was at right angles to Michelle’s. 
     
      
    9    The complainant gave evidence about the occasion of the first offence charged as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You say you stayed there for the first time about a month after you started school, is that right? A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you stay there on another occasion after that? A. A couple of weeks later I stayed. We were going to soccer, it was a Friday night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now could you just tell the court what you remember about your visit on that second occasion? A. On the second occasion? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? A. It was a Friday night. I remember this because we go to soccer on the Saturdays with the Watkins family. We had - we just did normal things, we had dinner, watched TV, went to Michelle’s room. Mrs Watkins would come in about 8.30, 9 o’clock, we’d have to turn the light off, it was bedtime. During the middle of the night - do you want --? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, just tell us what happened? A. During the middle of the night Mr Watkins came in. I guess it’s the middle of the night because I’d been asleep. Now, the room was dimly lit, we think it was a street light because there was no light in the room so I could see the outline of his face, he’s got a - he had beard which you could see the outline of, he smelled of very strong tobacco smoke. I woke up because he had - I woke up with his - had his hand down the front of my flannelette pyjama pants, he was rubbing my vagina. He then told me to be quiet or he’d hurt me which he told me over and over. He put one or two fingers in my vagina which hurt. It seemed to go on for about 20 minutes or it just seemed like a long time. He then, when he was finished would pull the blankets up around my neck and leave the room and in the mornings he would come into the kitchen and say, on every occasion, he would say ‘I had to come in and pull the blankets up on you last night’ and I guess he just did this.” 
        
       
       
      The complainant said that the following morning she went to the soccer. 
       
      
    10    The complainant then gave evidence about the next two occasions she stayed but in reverse order. The evidence was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you go and stay with Michelle after that? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long after that occasion? A. Sometime later, I can’t - could have been 2 or 3 weeks, it wasn’t that long. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you remember what night it was? A. Saturday night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happened on that occasion? A. We stayed on a Saturday night because we were going goldpanning at Hill End on the Sunday. We just did normal things, we were just kids, we watched TV, we had dinner, we went into Michelle’s room. Her mother came in about half past 8, 9 o’clock and told us - we turned the light off, it was bedtime and during the middle of the night Mr Watkins came in. He - I felt his hand down the front of my flannelette pyjama pants, he was rubbing my vagina, he put one or two fingers inside me which hurt. He frightened me. He told me to be quiet. He told me I couldn’t say anything or he’d hurt me. When he was finished he left. He pulled the blankets up. The next morning he’d come into the kitchen and say ‘I had to pull the blankets up on you last night’. There was always someone in the kitchen. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But in between the second occasion when you stayed there when you went to the soccer and the Hill End visit if I could call it that? A. Mmm mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was there another occasion when you stayed in between those two? A. There was, there was another soccer occasion so it was a Friday night, which very much the same thing happened.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. As you’ve described--? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --on the other two occasions? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Q. I’m sorry, was this in between --? A. The first and the second. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So in between the first time it occurred and the time that you just related when you were going goldpanning at Hill End there was an occasion in between those two was there? A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. And was that in between occasion on a Friday or a Saturday? A. Yes, in between was a Friday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Take your time about the matters. Now if we could go back, you’ve just given some evidence about the weekend that you went goldpanning? A. Goldpanning, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    11    The complainant was then asked about the occasion of a fourth offence after the goldpanning weekend. 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you stay again after that time? A. After goldpanning? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you remember how long after that? A. That’s sometime later. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what makes you remember that, was there a particular activity you were going to do? A. We went to Dubbo because we were going to soccer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you remember whether you stayed over on a Friday or a Saturday on that occasion? A. Friday night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happened on that occasion? A. That occasion, very much the same, we watched TV, we had dinner, we went to bed, it was during the middle of the night, he came in the room, dimly lit. I know it’s - I mean I know it’s him because of his - you could see his face, because I was on the top bunk. He smelt of strong tobacco smoke. I could feel his hand down the front of my pyjama pants. He was rubbing my vagina, he put one or two fingers, he’s threatening to - he hurt me if I told anyone and to be quiet. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long did that incident go on for? A. It seemed like 20 minutes - but it could have been longer and I was very sore inside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did anything happen the following morning? A. The same, he came into the kitchen. He said he had to come and cover me up last night. There was always someone in the kitchen. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you end up going to the soccer in Dubbo on the following day? A. Yes that’s right, I went to the soccer and then went home as usual. I didn’t say anything, I didn’t tell anyone. I thought it was my fault.” 
        
       
      
    12    The complainant described the occasion of the fifth charge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And did you go back and stay with them, Michelle, after that? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when was that? A. It was on a Saturday night. I remember this because we had Sunday lunch. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you know how long that was after the Dubbo soccer? A. A few weeks - it wouldn’t have been - a few weeks, like 2 to 3 weeks. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So this time it was a Saturday night? A. Mmm mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happened on that occasion? A. The same. We had dinner, watched TV, went to Michelle’s room, the lights were turned off at 8.30, 9 o’clock, Mr Watkins came in during the night. I’d been asleep. He had his hand down the front of my pyjama pants and rubbed my vagina, he put his fingers inside me. He told me to be quiet or he’d hurt me and frightened me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did anything happen the following morning? A. The same in the kitchen. He’d come in, told me he had to come and cover me up last night and there was always someone there when he said it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So that was the Sunday lunch incident? A. Mmm mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that the first time you’d been there for Sunday lunch or had you been there before? A. Yes, that I remember, yes. That’s the first time I’d stayed and then had Sunday lunch.” 
        
       
      
    13    The occasion of the sixth offence was described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now, after that, after that Sunday lunch incident, did you go and stay again? A. Yes, I went and stayed on another Saturday night, a few weeks later, for Sunday lunch. Exactly the same happened again. We watched - do you want me to say it again? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, it was in almost identical terms to the previous occasion, is that right? A. Yes, that’s right, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what about the following morning? A. The following morning he came into the kitchen, said he had to come and cover me up last night. There was always someone in the kitchen and that he’d, [sic] why he’d been in to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And in fact on all those occasions that you’ve just given evidence about, did he cover you up with the blankets when he came in? A. I remember him covering me up a couple of times. I don’t - I just - I was probably that frightened that I couldn’t remember him covering me up every time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now on all of those occasions that you’ve given evidence about him touching you in this way, was Michelle there in the bedroom? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And where was she? A. On the bottom bunk. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever speak to her either immediately before or immediately after this happened? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice whether she appeared to be awake or asleep? A. I didn’t look. She slept up the other end of the double bunks. She slept on the bottom, head up this end - I had my head up this end so I didn’t look.” 
        
       
      
    14    According to the complainant’s evidence and using the date she enrolled at Mudgee Public School as the starting point, the first offence was committed in the later part of September 1983, a couple of weeks after the first occasion she stayed in the Watkins’ house, which was about a month after she started school. She said that the third offence on the goldpanning weekend occurred two or three weeks after the first offence. The second offence occurred in between the first and the goldpanning weekend and was another soccer occasion. The fourth offence was “some time later”. The complainant remembered it because there was “a particular activity” she was going to do. They were going to Dubbo to the soccer. The fifth offence occurred “like” two or three weeks “after the Dubbo soccer”, that being the Sunday lunch weekend, and the sixth offence a few weeks after that.  
     
      
    15    The complainant was asked whether after these six specific occasions she had gone to stay at the Watkins again. The complainant gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now, after those specific occasions that you’ve given evidence about, did you go and stay at the Watkins again after that? A. Only, only during the day time, I became very frightened of Mr Watkins. I’d stay in the daytime when Mrs Watkins was home and-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well could I just go back a bit. You’ve given evidence of six specific times when Mr Watkins touched you? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you continue to stay overnight after that for a short period of time? A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Or for any period? A. I did but I can’t give dates and specifics because it all become very much the same after that so yes, I did stay after that until the point where I did get very frightened and not go back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now on these other occasions after that did anything happen with Mr Watkins? A. The same. Exactly the same as what has happened the first six times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And is that on every occasion that you stayed? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now you say there came a point when you stopped going to stay? A. Yes. I was older. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you fix that in terms of a month that it might have occurred or anything that would bring to your recollection? A. I think it was 1984. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Any particular month? A. In the October, because I was 12. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And is there any reason why you remember October? A. My birthday, it’s my birthday. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now, 1984, was that your last year of primary school at Mudgee? A. Yes. Yes, year 6 I was in. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you were still friendly with Michelle were you, at that point? A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you keep friendly with Michelle during High School? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she go to the same High School as you? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And was that in 1985? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever go and stay at Michelle’s place in 1985 when you were in High School? A. No.” 
        
       
       
      The complainant did not tell anyone about the appellant’s conduct until 1996. 
       
      
    16    The evidence was of six specific occasions, which the complainant described as “the first six times”. These six occasions were the occasions of the six offences charged in the indictment beginning in late September 1983 and continuing at intervals described as two or three weeks later or some time later or a few weeks later. The occasions of the first, second and fourth offences were soccer weekends, the first and second at no specified place, the fourth at Dubbo. The time of the fifth occasion was related back to the Dubbo soccer. The evidence was that, after those six specific occasions, on each occasion that the complainant visited the house over night the same thing happened as had happened the first six times until she stopped going to stay there in October 1984. 
     
      
    17    The appellant gave evidence denying the charges and denying sexually interfering with the complainant in any way. The appellant tendered the proposed 1983 competition schedule for Central Orana Junior Soccer according to which the first round was on 26 March and the grand finals on 20 August 1983. He said that 1983 was his first year as coach of Central Orana Junior Soccer at Dubbo. In accordance with the schedule, the competition finished on 20 August 1983 just before the school holidays began. He was involved with a team called the Mudgee Bulldogs in Mudgee which played in the Central Orana Junior Soccer competition. The team used to travel to Dubbo every other weekend and the Dubbo teams travelled to Mudgee every other weekend. The competition was controlled from Dubbo. The appellant gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So by 1984 both your sons were playing soccer, is that right? A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So, the Mudgee Bulldogs? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And they were in the Central Orana Junior soccer competition? A. That’s quite correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And was that similar to the ’83 competition schedule, going from March through to the end of August? A. Sometimes, yeah. Unfortunately, these days, they don’t stick by the winter and summer competition times. In those days winter competition started on 1 April and finished on 31 September and summer started on 1 October and finished on 31 March. Now they do anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now in 1983 and 1984, did you and other members of your family - were you in the habit of going to the soccer quite frequently, every week or thereabouts? A. Well I had to, I was the coach. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did Michelle go along as well? A. Not in 1983. Michelle played netball in 1983. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time of day were the soccer matches in 1983? A. The soccer was always played at 1 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Q. Mr Watkins, can I just clarify something. A minute ago you said the winter competition was between 1 April and 31 September, is that right? A. Yes, that’s what it used to be. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And there was a summer competition as well? A. No, no. The summer sport, which was cricket, started on 1 October and went through to 31 March. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I see, what, so did your sons play cricket did they, in the summer? A. No, no, no. They went swimming. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you’re just saying that there was some other summer sport? A. Well I’m just saying as the year used to be split up. Now they play football at Christmas time and all the rest of it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I just thought you said that it was a summer competition. I thought you were talking about soccer but you weren’t talking about soccer? A. No no, just as the years split up your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    18    At no stage did the prosecution suggest to Mr Watkins or to any other witness that his family took part in soccer either as players or spectators after the competition finished on 20 August 1983 and before it resumed after March 1984. 
     
      
    19    As well as giving evidence himself, the appellant called as witnesses his wife, Mary Watkins, and his daughter, married by the time of the trial, Michelle Roberts. They gave evidence that Michelle was a “light sleeper”. Mrs Watkins said that she did not sleep much at all at night because she was a chronic asthmatic: “…..when I’m on prednisone you can’t sleep.” She gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Was a medication that you were taking to assist you in the treatment --? A. --- One of the medications, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And accordingly you didn’t sleep very well? A. No, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now Michelle’s room was next door to your room? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And could you hear, for instance, Michelle walking in her room at night? A. Yes, it’s floorboards, wood. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what sort of wall between you and her room? A. I’ve forgotten the name of it, it’s like that chalky stuff. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Gyprock? A. Gyprock, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well, in 1983 and 1984, did you hear anything - any strange noises emanating from your daughter’s room? A. No.” 
        
       
      
    20    As counsel for the appellant, Mr Washington, pointed out in his submissions, three of the occasions on which the complainant said an offence was committed were linked by her to soccer the next day, on one occasion at Dubbo. Pressed in cross-examination about this, the complainant said that she knew the sexual assaults took place between 1983 and 1984. “I can’t remember a month, that was what I thought it was, so yes, I remember incidents rather than dates” and later in cross-examination “I don’t have any trouble recalling details of what he did. I have trouble with what month it was.”  
     
      
    21    In the indictment, each of the six offences charged was alleged to have occurred between 1 May 1983 and 31 October 1984. The complainant, when she first gave evidence, linked all the offences to May 1983 when she said the family had moved to Mudgee shortly after which she had started at Mudgee Public School. When she gave evidence, the complainant’s mother, who said the move to Mudgee was in July or August 1983, confirmed that the complainant had started school “fairly shortly” after they arrived in Mudgee. The complainant, from the starting point in May 1983, gave her evidence about the occasions of the six offences charged. Had that remained her evidence, it was consistent with the evidence about the Central Orana Junior Soccer competition season for 1983. On the weekends of three of these occasions, members of the Watkins’ family could have been taking part as coach, player, or supporters. But once it was incontrovertibly established that the complainant did not start school in Mudgee until 15 August 1983, there was no reason to suppose that, on the occasions that she described, any member of the Watkins family would have been so engaged. The complainant’s evidence was shown to be wrong not only as to the time of year when the offences were committed, but also as to a significant feature of the occasion as she remembered it.  
     
      
    22    Moreover, the way the prosecution case was presented resulted in confusion which, no doubt, led the trial Judge, when sentencing, to say:  
     
      
       
        
        “There was some confusion as to the dates upon which these incidents were said to have occurred. On the complainant’s evidence, the first incident after which she attended the soccer match with the Watkins family would have occurred about six weeks after she started school. This would be some time around the middle of October 1983. However, there was clear evidence that the final soccer match for 1983 in the Central Orana Junior Soccer competition, the competition in which the prisoner’s sons participated, was played on 20 August 1983. … 
        
       
       
        
        I can only conclude that the jury accepted that the incidents prior to soccer the next morning occurred within the scope of the dates encompassed by the indictment, but not at the time identified by the complainant. To put it another way, the jury must have accepted that the incidents prior to soccer attendance occurred some time after March 1984 when the new competition had started, but before 31 October 1984.” 
        
       
      
    23    I would comment that on the evidence the first incident would have been late September 1983 rather than mid-October but that does not detract from the significance of what the Judge said. 
     
      
    24    The complainant gave evidence of the six offences charged in chronological order. That was the Crown case on the evidence. If the jury convicted the appellant on the first charge for an offence committed, not when the complainant said the offence charged occurred, that is, when members of the Watkins family were taking part in soccer at the weekends and within a matter of some six weeks after the complainant started at Mudgee Public School, but on some other occasion after March 1984 and presumably after, or possibly after, other offences, such as those on the goldpanning weekend and the Sunday lunch weekend, this could only be on the basis that the jury entirely rejected the complainant’s evidence about when the first offence charged was committed. The same can be said of the three other offences which the complainant related temporally to soccer. 
     
      
    25    The trial Judge gave no assistance to the jury in summing up about these possibilities. Her Honour said this about the six counts in summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I remind you that there are six counts in the indictment and that you must consider each count separately. You will recall that at the beginning of the trial I said that if you should find the accused guilty of one count it did not necessarily follow that you would find him guilty of all counts and vice-versa. However, it is clear that the Crown case relies entirely upon your acceptance of the complainant as a witness of truth so that I would suggest that if you were to reach a particular verdict on one count your verdicts would be the same on every count. I say that because there is nothing to distinguish one count from another in that there is nothing independent of the complainant’s evidence in respect of each count so as I said you might think that the Crown case stands or falls, that is the whole of the Crown case as to the six offences, stands or falls on your assessment of the complainant as a witness of truth.” 
        
       
      
    26    Later in the summing up, Judge Latham said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before I leave that just let me say something about the time and the place. Each count in the indictment is expressed to be between 1 May 1983 and 31 October 1984 at Mudgee. Now I know that Mr Dalton has said certain things to you about the span of dates in the indictment but what I would suggest to you is that the accused’s case here is, ‘well look this did not happen at all, it just never happened.’ It is not really a matter of any great moment that it occurred, according to the Crown, between 1 May 1983 and 31 October 1984 at Mudgee. We know it was at Mudgee but as to the dates the accused is simply saying ‘well look it just didn’t happen at all’.” 
        
       
      
    27    Her Honour did not mention that the complainant’s evidence that the offences charged were committed some weeks after her arrival in Mudgee in May 1983 was incontrovertibly shown to be wrong, and that even if the time frame was changed to a date beginning in August 1983, there was uncontested and compelling evidence that the complainant was wrong when she said that on three of the occasions she identified, she and members of the Watkins family went to the soccer. Bearing in mind the degree to which the complainant’s evidence of the offences was linked to weekend soccer, that threw doubt on her account of the commission of those three offences and the offence next after the Dubbo soccer weekend. Yet the trial Judge suggested to the jury that if they reached a particular verdict on one count, their verdicts would be the same on every count.  
     
      
    28    Nor did her Honour’s instruction to the jury direct attention to the legal requirement that each count could only relate to one specified event. However that event was described, it had to be identifiable as separate from the other occasions on which the complainant alleged sexual misconduct by the appellant. No particulars as such of the various charges seem to have been supplied but the complainant’s evidence that the occasions she described as “two or three” or a “few” weeks or “sometime” apart were “the first six times” was sufficient particularisation to satisfy this legal requirement.29    However, the complainant’s evidence of occasions when soccer was played the next day was not, on the evidence, of these incidents. Furthermore, to take the first charge by way of example, there was nothing in her Honour’s directions to preclude some jurors accepting the complainant’s evidence to the effect that this event had occurred at about the end of September 1983 and rejecting her evidence that it was on a night before soccer and other jurors accepting that it occurred on a night before soccer and thus rejecting the complainant’s evidence to the effect that it occurred at about the end of September 1983.30    Indeed given that her Honour’s directions did not advert to the matter, all the jurors may have convicted the appellant on the latter basis. As the passage I have quoted from the trial Judge’s remarks on sentence makes clear, this seems to have been her Honour’s view. If the jury did adopt this approach, the appellant was convicted on the first count on a matter with which he was not charged. Both this possibility and that adverted to in the immediately preceding paragraph are unacceptable in law 
     
      
    31    At the conclusion of the summing up, no re-direction was sought by counsel for the appellant or by the Crown prosecutor. However, in my opinion, the trial Judge was bound, in summing up, to point out to the jury that the Crown case was of six offences which occurred sequentially, the first some six weeks after the complainant started at Mudgee Public School which was shown to have been on 15 August 1983. What the complainant remembered about the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences differed. Notably it differed because on three of the weekends and not on the others she referred to going to the soccer. There was uncontested and compelling evidence that there would have been no soccer to go to on those occasions. That threw doubt upon her evidence about those occasions. Even more doubt was thrown upon her account if it was open to say that the first occasion, for example, did not occur some six weeks after she started at school but some time after March 1984. The jury was given no guidance about this and in the result, in my opinion, there was a risk of significant confusion leading to a serious miscarriage of justice, the substance of which was acknowledged in her Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    32    Initially, the complainant’s evidence was not expressed temporally in general terms namely that over the period of time stated in the indictment she remembered six individual occasions when the appellant had sexual intercourse with her in the manner she described. She gave her evidence about times with some particularity and related the offences to particular events. It may be that this was a process of reconstruction consequent upon her original recollection that she moved to Mudgee in May 1983. But that explanation does not make her evidence any more credible. Her evidence was about the first six occasions on which she alleges she was sexually abused by the appellant. The time frame for all six is linked with the three soccer weekends. It follows that there must have been considerable doubt about the complainant’s account of what happened on each occasion of an alleged offence. That doubt was not resolved by Judge Latham’s suggestion that, since the appellant’s defence was a denial, it was not a matter of any great moment when the offences were alleged to have occurred. This came close to shifting the onus to the appellant when the onus remained with the prosecution to prove the six offences charged beyond reasonable doubt. In my opinion, the prosecution’s presentation of the case and the lack of any appropriate summing up about the complainant’s evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Further, to my mind, it was not open to the jury, properly instructed, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of any of the offences charged.  
     
      
    33    There are other considerations which go to this question. First, the difficulty for the appellant in meeting the charges caused by the delay between the date of the alleged offences in 1983, the first complaint in 1996 and the date of the trial in 1999, becomes particularly significant. Secondly, the offences were alleged to have been committed by a man whom the complainant had recently met, in a bedroom in which the complainant said his daughter was sleeping at the time. Thirdly, the offences were alleged to have been committed in a room which the complainant said was next to Mr and Mrs Watkins’ bedroom in which, at the time, presumably the offender’s wife was sleeping. Fourthly, the appellant, his wife and his daughter all gave evidence which, if accepted, was consistent with the appellant’s denial. But the decisive considerations, separate from any of these other matters, are the way in which the prosecution case was presented and dealt with in the summing up and the doubt about the credibility of the complainant’s evidence of the six offences charged. 
     
      
    34    At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the Court made the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed; 
         
        2. Sentences quashed; 
         
        3. Direct that a judgment and verdict of acquittal be entered in respect of each count of the indictment. 
        
       
      
    35    HULME J: I agree with the reasons of Sheller JA. 
     
      
    36    DOWD J: I concur with the reasons given by Sheller JA for the orders made by the Court on 16 March 2000.

    THE SUPREME COURT REVISEDOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 31 March 200070215/98 - REGINA v Martin Francis STRAHANJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: Martin Francis Strahan has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact of the manslaughter by Brian John Robson of Ronald Charles Brotherton. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    2   The deceased, Ronald Charles Brotherton, was living in the Moruya area. He was out of a job and addicted to alcohol and illegal drugs. Mr and Mrs Brian Robson, who lived in the town of Moruya, took pity on him and invited him to stay with them and their seven children. 
     
      
    3   During the few months that he lived with the Robsons the deceased used heroin. That fact became known to the principal of the school attended by the Robson children and to other local authorities. The Department of Community Services threatened to remove the children from the household, asserting that they were not being properly looked after. That caused Mr and Mrs Robson to require the deceased to leave their house, and he did. 
     
      
    4   The deceased then presumed upon the offender and his de facto partner, Ms Leanne Elizabeth Holmes, to allow him to live with them. 
     
      
    5   The Robsons were not well off. In September 1997 they were preparing to move to Nowra and purchased a motor vehicle for that purpose for $300. They had spent several months working on it at a cost of at least $1,200 and the car was ready for registration by the end of September. 
     
      
    6   The deceased came to their house while the Robsons were away, stole the car, drove it off the road and badly damaged it. It was a write-off. He told them that he would pay for the repairs but nobody expected him to keep that promise. He had never repaid the kindnesses the Robsons and others had allowed him. 
     
      
    7   The offender and Ms Holmes were friends of the Robsons and were upset about what had happened. They in turn asked the deceased to leave, and he moved into the house of a man called Shipley about ten kilometres away. 
     
      
    8   One day, Mr Robson and the offender were at the Robsons’ house talking about the deceased. Mr Robson asked the offender to give him a lift to Mr Shipley’s house to see the deceased. Mr Robson was intending to give the deceased a beating. The offender knew what Mr Robson was intending to do. The two men drove to the Shipley house, leaving Mrs Robson and Ms Holmes at the Robsons’ house. 
     
      
    9   Mr Robson encountered the deceased at the Shipley house and an argument and then a fight arose. Mr Robson dealt the deceased a number of savage blows with his fists and kicked him in the head. The deceased died. Although the offender was present, he took no part in the assault. 
     
      
    10   When the offender realised that Mr Robson had killed the deceased, he telephoned Ms Holmes and asked her to bring a tarpaulin to the house and that may have been, to some degree at least, born out of panic. Ms Holmes did so. The offender and Mr Robson wrapped the body of the deceased in the tarpaulin, put it into Ms Holmes’ car, took it into the bush and dumped it. They then returned to where they had left Ms Holmes, collected her and went home. 
     
      
    11   Later on, the offender and Mr Robson returned to the Shipley house and burned a lounge chair and Mr Robson’s clothes and shoes, which bore the blood of the deceased. 
     
      
    12   The killing remained undetected for six months. On 20 March 1998 the offender was interviewed by the police and gave the account which I have summarised. 
     
      
    13   Like Mr Robson, he was charged with murder and with being an accessory after the fact of murder. Later on, Mr Robson pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased and the Crown accepted that plea in discharge of the indictment. That led to a reduction in the charges against the offender and when he was arraigned on 16 March 2000 on charges of manslaughter and alternatively accessory after the fact of manslaughter, his plea of guilty to the alternative charge was accepted by the Crown in discharge of the indictment against him. He is therefore to be regarded as having offered his plea of guilty as soon as the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he was prepared to so accept it. 
     
      
    14   The offender is now twenty-five years old. He has lived in the Moruya area for a substantial part of his life, if not all of it. The Court has been told nothing about his childhood but he appears to have stayed out of trouble until 1995 when he was sentenced to four concurrent terms of three months’ imprisonment on stealing charges. Then in November 1997 he was sentenced to a number of terms of imprisonment, the effective length of which was a term of one year comprising a minimum term of nine months and a fixed term of three months. The offences were committed before the offence for which the offender now has to be dealt and comprise being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, possessing a shortened firearm being designed in some criminal manner, cultivating, possessing and using drugs. 
     
      
    15   The offender and his partner have a young child two and a half years of age. The offender’s father, whom I accept as a reliable witness, gave evidence at this hearing and he says that the offender has settled down since the birth of the child, and I think that there are signs that he is now facing up to his responsibilities. He has been in no trouble now for more than two years and there is nothing against him since the matter for which I am obliged to sentence him. Notwithstanding the position in 1995 and 1997, when the offender appears by his record to have been involved with illegal drugs, he does not now seem to be involved with such drugs. He has been working satisfactorily for his father and the prospects seem reasonable that he will shoulder his responsibilities and continue to effect his own rehabilitation, which is what I believe is happening. 
     
      
    16   The offender pleaded guilty in the circumstances that I have described and that is some evidence of his remorse. So is the full and forthright account he gave to the police when he was asked about that. I accept the evidence of the offender’s father that the offender is sorry for what he did. 
     
      
    17   The offence committed by the offender is a very serious one. It involved hiding a body and destroying other evidence. One effect was that the offence went unrealised and undetected for a long time. 
     
      
    18   It was submitted by Mr Terracini that I could properly impose a sentence of periodic detention and the Crown has put nothing against that submission. The offender has been assessed as suitable to serve a sentence of periodic detention. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence I think, in view of the substantial rehabilitation the offender has already achieved and is likely to continue to achieve, that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of less than full-time custody and I propose to sentence the offender to periodic detention for three years. 
     
      
    19   Martin Francis Strahan, I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years to be served by way of periodic detention. That sentence will commence on 14 April 2000 and expire on 13 April 2002. I direct you to report to the Unanderra Periodic Detention Centre no later than 4pm on Friday, 14 April 2000.

     REGINA v GLC 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   THE COURT: GLC seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as amended, against an interlocutory judgment of his Honour Judge Garling delivered at the Nowra District Court on 18 June 1999, refusing an application for separate trials. 
    2   The applicant was charged upon an indictment containing three counts. The first two counts charged that between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1988 at St George’s Basin, in this State, he did have sexual intercourse with TH a person then between the age of 10 years and 16 years. The third count charged that between 10 August 1992 and 30 April 1993 at Old Erowal Bay, in this State, he did assault CVG and, at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency on CVG, a person under the age of 16 years, namely nine years.  
    3   The trial was listed for hearing at the Nowra District Court commencing on 31 May 1999. Some three weeks prior to the trial, the prosecution gave notice to the solicitors for the applicant to the effect that at the trial the Crown would rely upon the provisions of ss97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995, to adduce evidence of alleged sexual misconduct by the applicant towards CVG in the case against the applicant under counts 1 and 2, and the evidence of alleged sexual misconduct by the applicant against TH in the case against the applicant under count 3. In other words, the prosecution would seek to lead evidence of both complainants in relation to all counts in the indictment. 
    4   On 26 May 1999 the solicitors for the applicant filed a notice of motion in the District Court at Nowra seeking, firstly, an order that the trial date of 31 May 1999 be vacated and the trial be relisted at the next sittings of the Nowra District Court; secondly, that “The proposed indictment should not be heard in its current form (as one trial); and thirdly “The proposed indictment should be divided to form a separate indictment for the charge relating to CG and another separate indictment for the two charges relating to TH”. Finally, an order was sought that “A Trial should be heard (sic) for each Indictment”. This may be taken, for present purposes, to be simply an application for separate trials.  
    5   When the matter came before Judge Garling at the Nowra District Court on 31 May 1999, the applicant was present and represented by Counsel. No plea was taken to the indictment. Counsel for the applicant informed the Court that by agreement the notice of motion should be heard and “there may be a need for a voir dire”. The notice of motion was then stood over to the following day.  
    6   Upon the hearing of the notice of motion, the Crown prosecutor tendered the Crown briefs in relation to each complainant, which briefs contained the relevant statements of evidence of the prospective witnesses, together with a statement of facts prepared by the police officer in charge of the case. The matters which were ventilated at the outset of the hearing of the notice of motion included the question whether the proposed reliance by the Crown upon the evidence of both complainants on all counts against the applicant would be so unfair to the applicant that its probative value would thereby be substantially outweighed by the prejudice. Reference may be made here to s101(2) of the Evidence Act. Another matter which was ventilated was whether there was any potential evidence of possible concoction by the complainants as explained by the High Court in Hoch v The Queen. (1988) 165 CLR 292. 
    7   Early in the proceedings, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour, as follows: 
     
      
       
       I am in a position to call some hearsay evidence that both of the complainants have been contacted and spoken to by telephone by an officer of the office of the Solicitor for Public Prosecutions and each of the complainants says that she had and has no knowledge of the other complainant either personally or the circumstances of what is alleged.” 
       
      
    8   This remark drew the following response from counsel for the applicant: 
     
      
       
       “I’m not content to accept a mere submission from the bar table about the possibility of concoction based upon some telephone call with the alleged victims, there will be need for a voir dire for the exploration of that if your Honour is against me in relation to the balance of the application.” 
       
      
    9   His Honour then heard argument from the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the applicant in relation to the question whether the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Crown under s97 (the Tendency Rule), and s98 (the Coincidence Rule), would or would not survive the threshold prejudice test contained in s101(2), to which reference has already been made.  
    10   Reference was also made to the leading cases in the High Court and this Court in relation to the common law principles applicable to tendency and similar fact evidence. The matter was stood over to 2 June 1999, part heard, on which date the Crown called the complainant TH, whose evidence was said to be taken on the voir dire. The evidence in-chief and the cross-examination were solely directed to whether there was any family or other connection between the witness and CVG. The witness denied knowing the other complainant. There was evidence however that the witness’ father had some acquaintance with CVG’s step-father. It also emerged that the witness knew CVG’s step-father’s niece from her school days.  
    11   The other complainant resides interstate and was not available to be called in this proceeding. However, the Crown prosecutor submitted that to the extent that there was evidence of some common family acquaintanceship it could not possibly provide any basis for a suspicion of collaboration or concoction involving the complainants. Counsel for the applicant did not challenge that submission on the basis of the evidence thus adduced. However he contended that it was not possible for the judge to make a final decision on the matter until evidence had been led on the voir dire from CVG.  
    12   Counsel for the applicant submitted that the appropriate course to follow was for his Honour to decide the ss 97 and 98 questions and if they were resolved against the applicant, then the question of potential concoction could be pursued further at a later date. His Honour then reserved his judgment on the notice of motion and stood the trial over to the next sittings with a priority listing.  
    13   Judge Garling delivered the interlocutory judgment which is the subject of the present application on 18 June 1999. At an early stage in the judgment, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “I am proceeding on the basis at this stage that there is no evidence that the two girls knew each other or in fact even now know each other nor that there was any opportunity for concoction of their stories, although that may be a matter which will have to be disposed of at a later time. But for the purpose of this motion, I have proceeded on that basis.” 
       
      
    14   His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
       “From what I have seen of the proposed evidence in this case, it leads me to conclude that what is alleged is that the accused indecently dealt with two young girls of a similar , though not an exact age, in a similar, and not an exact manner, that there is considerable probative value in the Crown leading that evidence, that by allowing them to lead that evidence, it would be prejudicial to the accused and therefore what I have to consider, as the High Court has set out in  
       Pfennig 
        is whether it falls into that special class of circumstantial evidence which does have a prejudicial capacity of a high order. 
       
      
      
       
       When I apply that test I have concluded, on what is before me, that it is evidence that I would have admitted and therefore I am not prepared to make the orders, order 2, or 3 as set in the notice of motion.” 
       
      
    15   In this Court Mr Buddin SC, the learned Crown Advocate, appeared for the respondent Crown. Mr Buddin (rightly in our view), conceded that the evidence sought to be led under ss 97 and 98 by the Crown could not satisfy the requirements of either of those sections. See Lockyer; (1996) 89 ACrimR 457;  Lock (1997) 91 ACrimR 356. and AH. (1997) 42 NSWLR 702. 
    16   Without attempting to be exhaustive in this regard, three factors which militated against the evidence satisfying the abovementioned sections are that the events involving the two complainants occurred some four or five years apart, that the alleged sexual misconduct against the two complainants could not be classified as bearing striking similarities, and the five year age difference between the complainants. It could not be said that the probative value of the evidence (to the extent that it existed) substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect, within the meaning of s101(2) of the Evidence Act.  
    17   After some discussion the Court briefly adjourned to allow the Crown Advocate to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions. Having thus consulted, the Crown Advocate formally informed the Court that the Director, having considered the future conduct of these proceedings, has concluded that the proper course would be to present separate indictments and that is the course he proposes to follow. He has also come to the view that in the respective trials it would not be appropriate for the Crown to seek to have the evidence of one complainant led in the trial involving the other complainant.  
    18   In those circumstances it appeared to this Court that the appropriate course would be to dismiss the appeal. However at the request of Mr Ramage QC for the applicant, we deferred making a final order to allow him to consider whether that course might result in some possible disadvantage to the applicant in relation to costs. Accordingly the Court reserved its judgment and gave counsel for the applicant 24 hours in which to file submissions, if he were minded to do so, in relation to the question of costs and the Crown Advocate was granted a further 24 hours to file any submissions in reply, if he were minded to do so. No such submissions have been filed with the Court. In the circumstances, therefore, the order of the Court must be that the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal dismissed, because there is now no issue between the parties insofar as separate trials are concerned.  
    19   Before leaving this matter, however, reference should be made to some brief discussion during the course of argument as to the procedure adopted before Judge Garling to resolve the notice of motion including, in particular, the calling of the complainant TH on the voir dire.  
    20   Although it is not completely clear, it would appear from the discussion before this Court, that the District Court was purporting to deal with the notice of motion, insofar as it related to the admissibility of evidence, in reliance upon r11 of Pt53 - Criminal Procedure Rules - of the District Court Rules.  
    21   Insofar as it is relevant, r 11 provides: 
     
      
       
       “(1) The Court may order that an inquiry by way of a voir dire into the admissibility of any evidence or as to the capacity of a witness to give evidence be had, before the trial Judge, at any stage of any proceedings whether before or after the jury is empanelled.  
       
      
      
       
       (2) Before commencing any inquiry ordered under subrule (1) the Court shall require the accused person, if he has not already pleaded to the charge against him, to so plead”. 
       
      
    22   If it were intended, in the instant case, that the question of admissibility of the proposed evidence was being dealt with under r11, then of course there was an irregularity in that the applicant had not been arraigned and required to plead to the indictment. Of course, that is perfectly understandable because it was his application that the counts be severed and that there be separate trials. A plea would, therefore, have been inappropriate. However, it was inappropriate for the Court to have taken evidence on the voir dire in these circumstances. 
    23   Although in the events which have happened, it has become a matter of no consequence in this particular case, it was, in our view, inappropriate for the question of possible concoction between the complainants to be heard concurrently with the motion for separate trials. Except in special circumstances (which do not exist in this case) the question of possible concoction should be dealt with by the trial judge before whom the accused is arraigned and enters a plea.  
    24   In the District Court, r11 provides an appropriate procedural vehicle for such questions of possible concoction to be resolved by the trial judge. It must be remembered that it is the trial judge by whom all questions of admissibility or otherwise of evidence are to be resolved.  
    25   The point should also be made that before the District Court orders an inquiry under r11, there should be sufficient justification for so doing. In other words “fishing expeditions” should be discouraged. 
    26   The order of the Court is that the application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

     FITZGERALD JA ABADEE J BARR J Friday, 31 March 2000 
     
     REGINA v Sonny QUANSAH 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    3   BARR J: This is a Crown appeal against what is said to be the inadequacy of a sentence imposed on the respondent in the District Court. On 23 July 1999 the respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of importing into Australia not less than the trafficable quantity of cocaine. On 28 September 1999 Williams DCJ sentenced him to four years and eight months’ imprisonment, commencing on 10 June 1999, the day of his arrest, and fixed a non-parole period of two years six months. 
     
      
    4   The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty-five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to $100,000 or both. 
     
      
    5   On 10 June 1999 the respondent arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport on a flight from Tahiti. In his luggage was a wooden statue containing 2.985 kilograms of a cocaine mixture, the equivalent of 643.7 grams of pure cocaine. 
     
      
    6   The respondent was taken into police custody and admitted that the statue contained narcotics but declined to specify what sort. He denied concealing the drug. He said that he had purchased the statue near Santiago with the drugs already packed and hidden within it. He said the drugs were solely for his own use. Later on he admitted that the contents were cocaine and said that he had paid $2,000 for the statue and had been told at the time of purchase that it contained one to one and a half kilograms. He repeated that it was for his own use. 
     
      
    7   He had on him a business card which bore what was apparently the name of an organisation, Seguel Holdings. It contained his name and a description as sales director together with a Maroubra post office box number and a mobile telephone number. 
     
      
    8   The respondent also possessed a Commonwealth Bank keycard issued in the name of Mr D Seguel. 
     
      
    9   Police officers were unable to find a listing of Seguel Holdings as a company or a business name or to identify any business actually trading under that name. They searched the respondent’s apartment in Sydney and found among other things a piece of paper bearing the name Dario Seguel and an address in Santiago, Chile. There was also an address book with an entry in the name Marie and Dario and a business card styled “Seguel Holdings - Marie A Christia - Director. 
     
      
    10   The post office box listed on the card found on the respondent turned out to be leased in the name of Marie A Christia. 
     
      
    11   Further inquiries showed that the respondent had travelled from Sydney to Chile four times between October 1998 and January 1999, staying two or three weeks on each occasion. 
     
      
    12   The respondent gave evidence before the sentencing judge. He said that he had begun using cocaine about two years previously. It was not long before he came to depend on its use. He met a man called Dario Seguel and his fiancée Marie Christia in Sydney and they became good friends. Eventually he found that they had business interests. One was to run an hotel in Miami. Another was to build an Australia theme pub in Santiago, Chile. They also intended to open up bottle shops in South America. 
     
      
    13   He began to work for them and that explained how he came to travel to South America for the periods that I have mentioned. On an occasion or occasions he took with him samples of Australian beer and wine. Seguel Holdings paid for his fares, accommodation and incidentals and supplied him with the keycard that was found. 
     
      
    14   He said that Mr Seguel ordinarily lived in Maroubra. 
     
      
    15   The visit from which he was returning when he was arrested was undertaken to finalise some licences. By that time he was using between five and ten grams of cocaine per week. He was borrowing in order to purchase it and was in financial trouble. Whilst he was in a town in Chile whose name he could not remember he was introduced to a man in a nightclub. That led to his introduction to persons who were prepared to sell him cocaine, which he was attempting to buy for his own use. He asked for one kilogram and they said that it would cost $2,000. When he went to collect the drug they told him that they had given him a little bit more than one kilogram. The cocaine was already wrapped and packed inside the statue and he had no practical means of examining it. He always believed that he had about a kilogram or a kilogram and a half and he always intended to use it all himself. 
     
      
    16   Ms Marie Christia gave evidence. She said that she was the fiancée of Dario Seguel. He had a business called Seguel Holdings. That organisation carried on business in South America but not in Australia. She was not a director of the business in Australia. Mr Seguel ordinarily lived in Sydney but at the time of sentence was absent in South America for an extended period. The respondent had worked for the business and had travelled to South America for the business. Seguel Holdings had paid his fares and expenses. It was not concerned in the importation of cocaine. 
     
      
    17   His Honour disbelieved most of the evidence of the respondent and of Ms Christia. He did not accept that the prior visits to South America had taken place for the purposes described by the respondent. He accepted that Mr Seguel existed, but was not satisfied that he funded the respondent’s travels or provided him with a keycard. 
     
      
    18   Although his Honour suspected that persons other than the respondent were involved in the importation of cocaine, the evidence fell short of proof. The evidence of the respondent’s prior visits to South America did nothing to explain the part played by the respondent in the importation of which he was convicted. 
     
      
    19   His Honour rejected the evidence of the respondent that he believed that there was no more than one or one and a half kilograms of cocaine in the statue and that he intended to use it all himself. He accepted, however, that the respondent was addicted to the use of cocaine and that he would have used some of it for himself. 
     
      
    20   In a pre-sentence report which was tendered the respondent is recorded as having told the Probation and Parole officer that the offences (sic) were committed to fund the respondent’s own drug use. 
     
      
    21   Having reviewed his findings about these matters, his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        The findings I have made above and the prisoner’s admissions put him not in the category of a courier but as the principal who organised the importation. Whilst I may suspect that others were also involved there is no direct or believable evidence to satisfy me of that even on the balance of probabilities. 
        
       
      
    22   His Honour went on to deal with other matters and then returned to the subject, saying - 
     
      
       
        
        The difficulty I have with this matter is that where in the hierarchy the prisoner should be placed, bearing in mind that a more serious alleged involvement has not been proved. In my view what can be established is that the prisoner intended to use some of the drug himself but was probably going to sell the rest. 
        
       
      
    23   His Honour referred to certain cases relied on by the Crown and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        None of the comparative verdicts submitted by the Crown are really on point. They basically deal with persons who have admitted they were involved in a chain of supply in one form or another. That is not the case here, either proved by the prosecution or indeed alleged by the defence. 
        
       
      
    24   In R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54 Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ did not accept that the identification of the precise nature of an accused’s involvement in an act of importing a prohibited import is an essential aspect of the sentencing process. Their Honours said [at para 14] - 
     
      
       
        
        It is understandable that, in order to promote consistency in sentencing, appellate courts, when expressing views about sentences for drug offences, have sometimes categorised the role of an offender, where that is known, in a scheme of importation or distribution. Similarly, sentencing judges who are dealing with several co-offenders may consider such categorisation relevant in differentiating between individuals. However, the utility of such an exercise is necessarily limited by the extent to which the material facts are known. What may be a convenient shorthand method of describing the facts of particular cases should not be elevated to an essential task to be undertaken in every case, regardless of whether that is possible or appropriate. 
        
       
      
    25   Their Honours went on to refer to the distinction between couriers and principals and observed that where several persons are charged concerning an importation it will be necessary to identify the relative roles of the actors in order to impose differential sentences in a principled way. That will from time to time lead to the categorisation of some offenders as principals and others as couriers. But the categorisation of an offender as a principal or as a courier must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did. 
     
      
    26   It was submitted on behalf of the Crown in the present appeal that, given his Honour’s findings that the respondent was a principal who organised the importation and that there was insufficient evidence to establish that others were involved, the respondent should be treated as a “sole trader”. I would resist the addition of such an expression to the terminology which already accompanies the sentencing process. In my opinion, the labelling of roles may be useful in assessing the part and criminality of an offender, but it might also divert the Court from its primary duty of describing the part played by the offender as extensively and precisely as the evidence will allow. 
     
      
    27   It is not clear what his Honour meant in his reference to the difficulty of ascertaining where in the hierarchy the respondent should be placed, given that his Honour had already found that the respondent was the principal who organised the importation and that the evidence did not enable a finding that anybody else was involved. In my opinion the respondent fell to be sentenced as one who had organised the purchase of the cocaine in South America, had purchased it and had imported it. The amount that he imported was the amount he intended to import. The pure cocaine content was 643.7 grams. He would have supplied the greater part to others after reserving some for his own use. 
     
      
    28   In R v Wong & Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420 this Court said that ordinarily a bare courier who pleads guilty to importing a quantity of the drug within the range with which we are here concerned should receive a head sentence of between six and nine years, after allowance for the lack of remissions in New South Wales. That range is only a guide, of course, and in appropriate circumstances it may be proper to impose a greater or lesser sentence. 
     
      
    29   The respondent is a thirty-one year old separated man. He has a good work history. He pleaded guilty. His Honour found in his favour that his addiction to the use of cocaine would have made it more difficult to resist the temptation to become involved in the importation. The substantial untruths he told to the sentencing judge explain why his Honour made no finding of remorse. 
     
      
    30   In my opinion the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, particularly the non-parole period of two and a half years. It would have been insufficient to reflect the respondent’s criminality as a bare courier. As it was, his role was more substantial than that. Because this is a Crown appeal, the sentence which I propose is somewhat less than ought to have been imposed at first instance. 
     
      
    31   I propose the following orders - 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed and sentence quashed. 
       
       
      2. In lieu the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for six years commencing on 10 June 1999 and expiring on 9 June 2005. 
       
       
      3. Fix a non-parole period of four years, dating from 10 June 1999. The respondent is eligible for release on parole on 10 June 2003.

     REGINA v Dennis N ROBINSON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   FITZGERALD JA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the judgment of Barr J. I propose to confine my remarks to ground 4. I agree that the appeal should be allowed on that ground. 
     
      
    2   Although there is a tension between the appellant’s conviction on counts 1, 2 and 3 and his acquittal on count 4, I agree with Barr J that the verdicts are not inconsistent in the sense in which that description is used in this context. See MacKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348. 
     
      
    3   I also agree with Barr J that, for the reasons he has given, the verdict acquitting the appellant of count 4 cannot be explained as a “merciful” verdict. MacKenzie v R (1996) 71 ALJR 91, 101. 
     
      
    4   However, in my opinion there is no justification for a conclusion that the mixed verdicts were the result of a compromise by the jurors, with some jurors who otherwise would not have voted to convict the appellant on counts 1 to 3 agreeing to do so, contrary to their legal obligations and oaths, in return for those who would otherwise have voted to convict him on count 4 agreeing to an acquittal. 
     
      
    5   It seems to me more probable that the acquittal verdict on count 4 indicates that the jury considered that the complainant’s uncorroborated testimony on that count lacked sufficient cogency for a conviction. In other words, the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt with the complainant’s evidence on count 4. 
     
      
    6   The question whether, that being so, the appellant’s convictions on counts 1 to 3 are unsafe and unsatisfactory Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 depends on the circumstances. 
     
      
    7   According to the prosecution case, the appellant committed 4 sexual offences on the same complainant in a single period between 28 February and 1 June 1993. The only evidence against the appellant was the uncorroborated testimony of the complainant, who at the time of the alleged offences was a thirteen year old boy and who did not complain for 13 years. The appellant, who was otherwise unknown to the complainant, gave evidence that he did not commit the offences. No attempt was made to suggest that the offences did not occur; the appellant’s case was that he was not the offender. The critical issue for the jury’s decision was the identity of the offender. There was no possible basis for a conclusion that count 4 might have been committed by a different person from the person guilty of counts 1 to 3. 
     
      
    8   In his judgment, Para 60. Barr J has summarised the material directions to the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The jury were directed that they should consider each count separately. They were told that they might accept part of what the witness said and reject part. They were told that witnesses might be mistaken or might lie in some respects but not in others. They were told to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with great care because the Crown depended on his evidence alone. They were told that when assessing the reliability of a witness they were entitled to take account of the demeanour of the witness and the impression made by that witness upon them.” 
        
       
      
    9   Directions to that effect are, of course, common. However, they are not always sufficient. The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts. This was such a case. 
     
      
    10   Although there was no evidence which could appropriately be described as necessarily reliable which was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence that it was the appellant who committed the offences, the jury’s doubt with respect to the cogency of the complainant’s evidence count 4 makes the following passage from the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439, 455. directly apposite. Their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “.. nothing in the complainant’s evidence gave any ground for thinking that the quality of her evidence was higher in respect of the first [second] and third count than it was in respect of the [fourth] count. When the credibility factor is combined with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, the convictions on the first [to] third counts can only be regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
        
       
      
    11   The course adopted by the Court in Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439. is the course which this Court should adopt in the present matter. See also R v R.A.T. 2000 NSWCCA 77 That is to say, the appeal should be allowed and the appellant’s convictions on counts 1, 2 and 3 quashed and, in lieu thereof, verdicts of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60328/98 
     FITZGERALD JA BARR J SMART AJ Friday, 31 March 2000 
     
     REGINA v Dennis Noel ROBINSON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    12   BARR J: The appellant Dennis Noel Robinson appeals against convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentences entered in the District Court. He was charged with two counts of indecent assault and two of sexual intercourse without consent. He was convicted of both counts of indecent assault and of one of the counts of sexual intercourse without consent. He was acquitted of the other. 
     
      
    13   For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent the appellant was sentenced to penal servitude for six years, comprising a minimum term of four years six months and an additional term of one year six months. For each of the offences of indecent assault the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of four years’ penal servitude concurrent with the other sentences. 
     
      
    14   The complainant said that one day in March 1983, when he was thirteen years old, he was using a toilet in a street in Nowra. A man came up behind him, put his hands round him and dragged him into one of the cubicles. He forced the complainant to put his hand on the appellant’s penis. He then inserted his finger and then his penis to the complainant’s anus and his penis into the complainant’s mouth. 
     
      
    15   The man was thirty-five to forty years old and of large build, overweight in the stomach. 
     
      
    16   The touching of the penis was the basis of the first count of indecent assault. The other acts formed the basis of the first count of sexual intercourse without consent. The appellant was convicted of both those charges. 
     
      
    17   The complainant next saw the man in the street in Nowra about two weeks later, but there was no communication between them. He had no difficulty of recognising him as his attacker. 
     
      
    18   About a week later he saw the same man walking towards him on his side of the street. He ran into the same toilet block and stayed inside, hoping that the man would go away. When the complainant tried to leave, the man blocked his way, forced him back into the toilet and handled him on the penis. The complainant managed to escape when a third person came into the toilet block. 
     
      
    19   That evidence formed the basis of the second count of indecent assault. The appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    20   The final count was based on events the complainant said took place about a month later. He was riding his bicycle in Nowra when he saw the same man. The complainant spat at him and otherwise registered his disgust and rode away. Some time later on the same day the complainant was in the adjoining town of Bomaderry, riding his bicycle along a walking track. He saw the man standing outside the entrance of a toilet block. The complainant ran into the fence, lost his balance and fell off his bike. Before he could remount and ride off, the man took hold of him from behind and dragged him into a toilet block some ten to fifteen metres away. He put his penis into the complainant’s mouth. That evidence formed the basis of the second count of sexual intercourse without consent. The jury acquitted the appellant on that charge. 
     
      
    21   The complainant said that between 1983 and 1990 or 1991 he saw the same man at least eight to ten times. In 1990 or 1991 he moved to Wollongong to live. He returned to Nowra in 1993. He came to know the man who assaulted him as Dennis Robinson. He said that at the time of trial the appellant was perhaps of smaller build than during the events of 1983. 
     
      
    22   There was no evidence to support that of the complainant. There were no admissions. The complainant told nobody about these matters until he saw a police officer in 1996. 
     
      
    23   The appellant gave sworn evidence and said simply that he was not present on any of the occasions described by the complainant. His case was that the complainant had wrongly identified him as his attacker. 
     
      
    24   He said that in 1983 he left the Navy after twenty years’ service. He then weighed thirteen to thirteen and a half stone, was five feet eight and a half inches tall and had short black hair and a black, cropped beard. By the time of the trial he weighed twenty-one stone and had lost a lot of head hair. His beard had grown longer and turned grey. 
     
      
    25   He said that in 1983, and for perhaps three years before leaving the Navy, he could not achieve an erection. He had suffered a fever during the last part of his service in the Navy and continued to suffer from high blood pressure. He was under medical care. He convalesced at home before going to work with the Department of Social Security in 1994. 
     
      
    26   Evidence was called from the appellant’s wife, who said that from about 1980 onwards the appellant had never been able to get an erection. 
     
      
    27   Evidence was also called from Dr Dipold, who met the appellant in 1981 and became his medical adviser in November 1984. She said that he was always grossly overweight, at least twenty stone in 1981. She could not remember any time when he was less than about twenty stone. 
     
      
    28   Dr Dipold specialised in family planning and knew that the appellant and his wife wanted to have children but could not. The appellant never directly told her that he could not get an erection. Following an illness in 1993 Dr Dipold referred him to a psychiatrist, who reported in May 1994 that the appellant and his wife had not had any sexual relations for more than ten years because of the appellant’s depression, diabetes and gross weight. 
     
      
    29   Dr Dipold said that a drug the appellant was taking for hypertension could decrease his ability to have an erection, though it might not always do so. She thought it probable that the appellant suffered a decrease in libido and unlikely that he could have an erection, though she thought that that was possible. 
     
      
    30   The appellant gave evidence of his membership at relevant times of the committee of the Shoalhaven Youth Centre, an aboriginal welfare organisation. He said that other members of the committee were opposed to him and disputed his status as an aborigine and his outspoken views on a number of topics. The complainant was not a member of the committee but the appellant saw him at the Centre a few times. The complainant spoke to the appellant on an occasion when he drove the Centre bus, having taken over for the day from the regular driver. 
     
      
    31   The purpose of that evidence appears to have been to show that the complainant must have become familiar with the appellant’s face and name and might have been influenced by what he knew of him to identify him mistakenly as his attacker. It was not suggested to the complainant that he had deliberately identified a person whom he did not believe was his attacker. 
     
      
    32   It is clear from the verdicts that the jury were not impressed with the evidence about the appellant’s inability to have an erection and about any change in his appearance as throwing doubt on the complainant’s identification of him. 
     
      
    33   The first ground of appeal complains that the trial judge erred in rejecting cross-examination of the complainant about his criminal record. The ground was not formally abandoned, but nothing was said in support of it during oral submissions before this Court. It appears that defence counsel wished to put to the complainant that certain convictions had been recorded against him at a certain time, though the purpose in doing so was never entirely clear. Objection was taken by the Crown prosecutor and legal argument followed in the absence of the jury, at the conclusion of which it appeared that the Crown had withdrawn its objection to the cross-examination. Accordingly the defence counsel cross-examined the complainant in the manner desired. 
     
      
    34   In my opinion there is no substance in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    35   The second ground of appeal complained that the trial judge erred in refusing to give a ruling about what material might be led by the Crown if the appellant raised his good character. 
     
      
    36   During the Crown case defence counsel let it be known that he wished to raise the appellant’s good character. It is apparent that counsel was aware of material that might possibly be brought into evidence by the Crown, if permitted, if good character were raised. Defence counsel wished to know what adverse effects, if any, might flow if good character were raised. In response, the Crown prosecutor submitted that defence counsel was asking the Court to make a ruling that it had no power to make. Thereafter, defence counsel appears to have been under the impression that what the Crown prosecutor had said was correct. 
     
      
    37   Later on, defence counsel announced the intention not to raise good character, but it does not appear whether that decision was made after consideration of any material available to the Crown or because of counsel’s misunderstanding. 
     
      
    38   Defence counsel had the responsibility of deciding whether to raise good character, and if so whether to do so generally or in a particular respect. If he decided to do either, he might expose the appellant to an attack by the Crown by cross-examination or other tender of evidence tending to show that he was a person of bad character generally or in the relevant particular respect. See Evidence Act ss 110, 112. R v PKS, Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 October 1998, unreported. 
     
      
    39   Defence counsel never made clear precisely what his intention was. 
     
      
    40   Counsel could have required the Crown to reveal precisely what evidence it might seek leave to adduce if good character were raised generally or particularly. R v Hamilton (1993) 68 A Crim R 298. There was no attempt to do so. 
     
      
    41   The Crown prosecutor was wrong to submit that the Court had no power to make an advance ruling. R v PKS. 
     
      
    42   If defence counsel had put forward a properly formulated proposal to raise good character in general or in the particular respect, for example that the appellant was not guilty of sexual misconduct against young children, and the Crown had been required to make available or make known what material it would wish to bring forward, the trial judge would have been obliged to indicate what evidence if any the Crown might be permitted to adduce. That stage was never reached and the trial judge was not in error. 
     
      
    43   It would appear from what this Court has been told that at the time of trial a number of allegations of sexual assaults upon other complainants were outstanding against the appellant. It seems highly probable, therefore, that if the appellant had put forward good character in general or in the particular sexual respect I have mentioned, the Crown would have been permitted to prove his sexual assaults on other children. To have conducted the trial otherwise would have allowed the appellant to be presented to the jury falsely as a man of unblemished character in the relevant respect. 
     
      
    44   Accordingly, I think that the appellant lost nothing from the lack of the ruling sought by defence counsel. I think that this ground of appeal should fail. 
     
      
    45   As with the first ground of appeal, the third ground of appeal, while not formally abandoned, was not pressed in oral argument. The identification of the appellant as the attacker was the single most important issue at the trial. Accordingly, the learned trial judge gave comprehensive directions about the caution with which such evidence should be approached and about the need to scrutinise it. This ground complains that her Honour did not direct the attention of the jury to specific weaknesses in the identification. It was submitted, for example, that the jury ought to have been reminded that the identification was of a person who was initially a stranger to the complainant and that a long time went by between the time of the alleged assaults and the complainant’s identification of the appellant as his attacker, and that her Honour failed in not directing the jury that there have been miscarriages of justice because of mistaken identification evidence. 
     
      
    46   The trial judge delivered a detailed and careful directions, cautioning the jury that evidence of identification or recognition could be wrong, even though the person giving it believed it to be true. The jury were told to scrutinise the evidence closely. They were told that witnesses are capable of making mistakes in relation to recognising people, particularly where a long period of time intervenes between the event and the recognition. They were told to look very closely at the evidence of the complainant in relation to his recognition and the surrounding evidence to see whether they should rely on it before convicting the appellant. They were also told why such caution was necessary. They were told to consider the opportunity the complainant had to see his attacker, the possibility of there being a change in the appearance of the appellant from time to time and that the complainant’s first opportunity for close contact or recognition was early in 1996. 
     
      
    47   In my opinion the directions were proper and lacked nothing that ought to have been said. The jury did not need to be told that the complainant and the appellant were strangers. The whole case was conducted on that understanding. Her Honour did refer to the passage of time. There was no need for her Honour to inform the jury that miscarriages of justice have occurred because of mistaken identification evidence. No application for further directions was made to the trial judge. I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    48   By the fourth ground of appeal it was asserted that the verdicts were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. The first submission under the ground was that the following factors in combination led to the conclusion that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant on all counts, namely -  
     
      
       
      1. The sole evidence implicating the appellant was that of the complainant; 
       
       
      2. The complainant did not complain for thirteen years; 
       
       
      3. In view of the delay, there was a great risk of mistaken identification; 
       
       
      4. The delay made it difficult for the appellant properly to defend the charges; 
       
       
      5. There was an inherent unlikelihood in the complainant’s count of the second incident in that he ran into the toilet block that was the scene of the first incident; and 
       
       
      6. The matters raised in the first three grounds of appeal. 
       
      
    49   I have read the transcript of evidence of the complainant. His evidence on the first, second and third counts was given in an apparently clear manner and was sufficient to make out the offences if believed. The reasons he gave for delaying his complaint, namely that he was ashamed of what had happened and afraid of the way his family might react if told, is understandable. 
     
      
    50   This was not a case of a simple thirteen year delay in identification, with nothing significant happening in the meantime. The complainant saw the man he eventually identified as his attacker in the streets of Nowra at least eight or ten times between 1983 and 1990 or 1991, when he went to live in Wollongong. He had the opportunity to become familiar with the appearance of his attacker during the sexual assaults and had the opportunity of seeing his attacker on repeated occasions over the years before he eventually complained. 
     
      
    51   It does not appear to me to be inherently unlikely that a person should attack a boy twice in the same place, especially when that place is a toilet block and the attack is sexual. 
     
      
    52   The thirteen year delay did not really make it any more difficult for the appellant to defend the charges. It is not as though if brought to trial earlier he could have obtained witnesses. His case was that he was not there. Although, according to the complainant, another person came into the toilet block on the occasion of the second attack, so enabling him to escape, there is no reason to believe that that person saw anything untoward happening between the attacker and the complainant. On that occasion the complainant’s clothing was not removed. All that happened was a touching of the penis outside the clothes. 
     
      
    53   In my opinion it cannot be said that, because of the circumstances relied on by the appellant, the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about his guilt on the first three charges. 
     
      
    54   The second submission under this ground was that the verdicts of guilty on the first three counts could not stand together with the verdict of not guilty on the fourth count. The argument was put in two ways. It was submitted first that there was no reason for thinking that the complainant had made a mistake in his identification of the appellant as his attacker on the fourth ground though he had correctly identified him in relation to the other grounds. There was no suggestion of consent and no possibility, given the complainant’s version of what happened, that the appellant could have believed that he was consenting. The only evidence capable of convicting the appellant came from the complainant and it was all susceptible to the same criticism, for example, about delay and the dangers of identification, no matter which count it referred to. Nothing in the evidence justified a different approach on the fourth count from the approaches taken on the other counts. Since the jury had a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the evidence of the complainant on the fourth count, and since there was in all the circumstances nothing to distinguish the counts from each other in any relevant way, the Court should conclude that the jury ought also to have had a reasonable doubt about his reliability on the remaining counts. M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. 
     
      
    55   Alternatively, it was submitted that the verdicts did not represent the unanimous opinion of the jurors but were a compromise. 
     
      
    56   It was submitted for the Crown that the verdicts should be regarded as the unanimous verdicts of the jury and that there might be reasons which carried weight with the jury, but which were not apparent from a reading of the transcript, why they distinguished between the fourth and the remaining counts. 
     
      
    57   It was submitted alternatively that even if there were no such ground for discrimination, the Court should conclude that the jury had returned a “merciful” verdict on the fourth count. 
     
      
    58   Although there is no legal or factual inconsistency between the verdicts on the fourth and the remaining counts, the difference between them, for the reasons put forward by the appellant, is striking. They are inconsistent in a practical sense and call for explanation. Some means of reconciling them must be found. 
     
      
    59   When considering verdicts attacked as inconsistent the Court ordinarily assumes that the jury performed their functions according to their oath. In MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby said at 367 - 
     
      
       
        
        Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. 
        
       
      
    60   The two possible “proper” ways of reconciling the verdicts are those contended for by the Crown. It was conceded on behalf of the Crown that nothing that appears in the transcript explains the jury’s differential verdicts, but it was submitted that it was likely that there was nevertheless some legitimate point of distinction. The jury were directed that they should consider each count separately. They were told that they might accept part of what a witness said and reject part. They were told that witnesses might be mistaken or might lie in some respects but not in others. They were told to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with great care because the Crown depended on his evidence alone. They were told that when assessing the reliability of a witness they were entitled to take account of the demeanour of the witness and the impression made by that witness upon them. 
     
      
    61   It was submitted that the complainant might, by the way he gave his evidence rather than by what he said, had given the jury an impression of reliability on the counts on which they convicted but not on the fourth count. He might in part have seemed tentative to them. He might even have appeared untruthful. Proper respect must be paid to the function of the jury and the advantage they have over an appellate court in seeing and hearing the witnesses. M v The Queen. 
     
      
    62   It seems to me not impossible that the jury discriminated for any such reason but, for reasons that I shall shortly explain, I think it improbable because there is a much more likely explanation for the verdicts. 
     
      
    63   The alternative explanation contended for by the Crown is that the jury took a “merciful” view of the facts on the fourth count but not on the remaining counts. Such a function is often exercised by juries. R v Hunt [1968] 2 QB 433; MacKenzie v The Queen; R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. 
     
      
    64   It seems quite unlikely that the jury made their distinction on that basis. These were very serious offences against a young boy. The fourth count concerned one of only two offences of sexual intercourse without consent, which the jury would have realised were more serious than the other two charges. The appellant adduced no evidence of good character and there is no reason to believe that the jury would have felt especially sympathetic towards him. 
     
      
    65   Even if the jury had wished to afford him some relief, it is much more likely that they would have done so, for example, by convicting of one only of the two counts arising from the first incident or some but not all of the counts arising from the incident in the first toilet block. 
     
      
    66   I think that the verdicts were compromised and that the evidence for that conclusion is overwhelming. 
     
      
    67   The trial began on the morning of Monday 9 February 1998. The appellant was arraigned before the jury. The trial judge made some preliminary remarks during which the jury were told that the case would take two days and might possibly run into Wednesday. The Crown prosecutor opened the case after lunch and it became necessary almost immediately for the trial judge to entertain an application, in the absence of the jury, for the exclusion of certain evidence. That took the rest of the day and the evidence did not begin before the jury until 11.10am on the Tuesday. The Crown case closed towards the end of that day. 
     
      
    68   The defence case took up Wednesday and Thursday and was closed early on the Friday morning. Counsel addressed and the trial judge summed up, ending just before 4pm. The trial judge said this - 
     
      
       
        
        I am conscious that it is just before 4 o’clock on a Friday afternoon. I would like it if you could commence considering your verdict this afternoon. I do not know how you all feel. Is that what you want to do, start now and see how you go? 
        
       
      
    69   There may then have been some unspoken, or at least unrecorded, communication between the jury and the trial judge, who then said - 
     
      
       
        
        I think we will do that and let us know how you go during the course of the afternoon. We are not going to make you stay here for ever tonight but just see how we go when you start considering your verdicts and doing all those things that we have already referred to. 
        
       
      
    70   The jury retired at 4pm. After counsel had made application, the jury were brought back into court at 4.15pm for further directions. They retired again at 4.17pm. 
     
      
    71   At 4.40pm the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking to be allowed to see the complainant’s statement. They were brought into court to be told that the statement was not in evidence, and that precipitated a remark by the foreperson to the effect that two of the jurors would like to hear again the evidence about the times that the complainant had seen the appellant. It took some time for counsel to identify every piece of relevant evidence and it was not until 5.10pm that the jury were reminded of the evidence of each relevant occasion. The jury finally retired at 5.15pm. 
     
      
    72   The jury returned with their verdicts at 8.45pm. 
     
      
    73   The facts were simple and the issues straightforward. The evidence of the complainant was enough, if believed, to prove each charge. It was never suggested to the complainant that he had not been sexually assaulted and the practical question was whether it was the appellant who had assaulted him. The evidence about the appellant’s appearance and his sexual ability was simple. So was the ultimate issue, namely whether the complainant might have been mistaken in his identification or recognition of the appellant as the man who attacked him. 
     
      
    74   Even assuming that the jury did not begin to deliberate until they retired at 4pm, they had almost five hours in which to consider these matters. It seems reasonable to suppose, however, that they must have begun at least to discuss them well before their retirement. 
     
      
    75   There was no communication from the jury after 5.15pm to show what, if any, particular difficulty they were having. It seems to me, however, in view of what they had originally been told about the likely length of the trial, the lateness of the hour, and the time that they had taken since retirement, they must have been under substantial pressure to reach their verdicts. It must have appeared to one or more of them that if they could not agree they faced the prospect of coming back to court on the following week. That was unlikely to have been a welcome prospect. 
     
      
    76   No occasion had arisen for them to be given a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44 which would have reminded individual jurors not to join in any verdict with which they did not agree. 
     
      
    77   These circumstances make it appear highly probable that, notwithstanding the oath they had taken, the individual members of the jury made a compromise in order to bring matters to an end and obviate the need to continue even later into the night or disrupt the business of the following week. 
     
      
    78   Since none of the verdicts represented the opinion of all the members of the jury, they should not be allowed to stand. I would quash the convictions and order a retrial of those counts. R v Hauke, Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 March 1995, unreported; R v Crisologo (1997) 99 A Crim R 178. 
     
      
    79   I propose the following orders - 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed and convictions on the first, second and third counts quashed. 
       
       
      2. New trial ordered on those counts. 
       
      
    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60328/98 
     FITZGERALD JA BARR J SMART AJ Friday, 31 March 2000 
     
      
     
     
     REGINA v. DENNIS NOEL ROBINSON 
     
     
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    80   SMART AJ: Dennis Noel Robinson appeals against his conviction on two counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The jury acquitted him of a further count of sexual intercourse without consent (count 4). Mr. Robinson also seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentences. On the count of sexual intercourse without consent, his sentence comprised a minimum term of 4½ years and an additional term of 1½ years. He received concurrent sentences of fixed terms of 4 years. 
     
      
    81   The principal challenge to the convictions was that, having regard to the acquittal on count 4, the verdicts of guilty on the other counts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The Crown case depended on the evidence of the complainant. The other grounds of appeal related to rulings by the judge in the course of the trial and her directions as to identification. 
     
      
    82   Because of the principal challenge, it is necessary to refer to the evidence in some detail and particularly the cross examination of the complainant and the appellant. 
     
      
    83   The complainant said that shortly after he turned 13 and on a day in about March, 1983, he had just finished urinating at a trough in a public toilet block next to the School of Arts in Berry Street, Nowra. It was about 4.30 p.m. As he was about to leave a man (subsequently identified as the appellant) came up behind him, put his arms around his chest and grabbed him. The complainant struggled. The man dragged him back into one of the cubicles in the men’s toilet. The complainant said that he attempted to push past the appellant but the appellant pushed him back quite firmly into the cubicle. The man shut the door. 
     
      
    84   The appellant dropped his pants and began to fondle himself. He told the complainant to touch the appellant’s penis. The complainant did not act or say anything. The appellant forced the complaint’s hand on to the appellant’s penis which was erect and circumcised. The appellant was circumcised. These events were the subject of the first count of indecent assault. 
     
      
    85   The appellant told the complainant to bend over. The appellant forcibly turned the complainant around and pushed the upper part of his body downwards towards the toilet bowl. After touching the complainant’s bottom, the appellant inserted his finger in the complainant’s anus. Next the appellant forcibly pushed his penis into the complainant’s anus. He complained that it was hurting and told the appellant to stop. The appellant continued for a period estimated by the complainant to be about ten minutes. Next the appellant forced the complainant to have oral sex by forcing the complainant’s mouth over the appellant’s penis. The appellant ejaculated in the complainant’s mouth. The appellant pulled up his pants and left. These events were the subject of the second count of having sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the complainant was not consenting, and the complainant being under the age of 16 years, namely 13 years. 
     
      
    86   The complainant described the appellant as “a large built man, overweight in the stomach, considerably larger than me”. 
     
      
    87   The complainant said that roughly 2 weeks later he saw the appellant walking down the main street of Nowra on the opposite side to that of the complainant. 
     
      
    88   The complainant said that about a week later he saw the appellant walking along the same side of the main street towards him. He again recognised him as the man who had assaulted him. The complainant turned around and walked briskly away and then ran to the toilet block next to the School of Arts in Berry Street. The complainant said that he panicked. His parents were some distance away and he did not want to go to the police as he was ashamed and scared. He wanted to hide from the appellant. On arriving at the toilet block the complainant locked himself in one of the cubicles. A short time later he heard a person enter the toilet. That person knocked on the door but the complainant remained silent. The person knocked again and said “I know you’re in there.” It sounded like the man who had previously assaulted him. The complainant remained silent. He stayed in the cubicle for some minutes. He thought that the appellant had left. On leaving the cubicle the complainant encountered the appellant in the entrance way to the block. The appellant said “I’ve been looking for you.” The complainant tried to push past. The appellant put his arms around the complainant “in a bear like sort of hold” and started to force the complainant back into the toilet block. The appellant started to fondle the complainant’s penis over his shorts. Another male entered the toilet block, the appellant released the complainant, who pushed past and ran out of the toilet block and away. These events were the subject of the third count. 
     
      
    89   The complainant said that he saw the appellant about a month later. He was riding his pushbike along Kinghorn Street, Nowra when he saw the appellant. He rode past at a reasonable speed on the footpath and called the appellant ""a fat s-"" and spat at him. The complainant said that he was very angry with the appellant and “wanted to get back at him in some way.” The complainant said that he rode over towards Bomaderry along the walking track. It took about 15 minutes to ride from the township of Nowra to the area where he went at Bombaderry. He sat beside Bombaderry Creek, not far from the boat ramp. He found it a peaceful and pleasurable place to go. After a period there he rode his pushbike back along the walking track. He saw the appellant standing outside the entrance of the toilet block at the nearby Artie Smith Oval. By the phrase “walking track” the complainant included the cycle way and/or footpath. The cycle way went past the oval and within 15 to 20 metres of the toilet block. As the complainant was riding by the appellant yelled something out which the complainant did not hear. He lost his balance, brushed the fence with the pushbike and fell off. The appellant came over and grabbed him from behind and proceeded to drag him away, thwarting his attempt to get back on his pushbike. The appellant dragged the complainant over to and into the toilet block. The cycle way or footpath was on the outside of the fence and the toilet block was inside the fence. There was an opening in the fence near the toilet block. 
     
      
    90   It was about 5 p.m. and late April, 1983. The complainant said that he was yelling and trying to break free. The appellant dragged and pushed him into one of the cubicles. The appellant shut the door, took his pants down and proceeded to pull down the complainant’s pants despite his protests. Thereafter the appellant forced the complainant to receive the appellant’s penis in his mouth and moved the complainant’s head backwards and forwards. After a period the appellant ejaculated in the complainant’s mouth. The appellant withdrew his penis, remarked that that was fun and left. 
     
      
    91   The complainant stated that he had seen the appellant at least 8 to 10 times between 1983 and 1990/1991 in the public areas of Nowra. He said there had been no conversation or close contact. 
     
      
    92   In late 1995 the complainant was employed at the Youth Centre in Nowra. He saw the appellant attend committee meetings there of an organisation called SCAIMAC. On a couple of occasions they spoke but the conversation was of no moment and short. On another occasion the complainant was on a bus driven by the appellant. 
     
      
    93   The appellant gave explanations for not reporting any of the 1983 incidents to the police until 1996. Basically he claimed that he was ashamed, scared and frightened that the appellant might come after him. Further he was concerned that he had not reported the earlier incidents. 
     
      
    94   The cross examination of the complainant elicited that he had a minor criminal record for 2 offences of dishonesty in about 1991 for which he was fined $50 and placed on a bond. It tried to establish that the complainant had blamed the wrong man but he did not agree. As to the Bombaderry incident it emerged: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) There was traffic on the Nowra Road which passed within about 20 metres of the toilet block which was clearly visible from the road as was the area in front of it across which the complainant was allegedly dragged. He recalled one or two cars passing. No vehicle stopped and no assistance was offered. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) When the complainant abused the appellant in Nowra, he did not tell him he was going to the Artie Smith Oval (or the area near the boat ramp_) 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The complainant was not expecting the appellant to turn up at the oval; the complainant had not planned to go to the oval. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) There were shops some 50 or 60 metres away; he did not know if the shops were open. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) After he abused the appellant in Kinghorn Street, he did not look back to see if the appellant was following.  
        
       
       
       (f) The incident allegedly happened in daylight. 
       
       
       
      Underlying the cross examination was the theme that there were improbable features about the incident of late April, that it did not happen or, at least, that there was a reasonable doubt about this incident happening. 
       
      
    95   As to the incidents in the toilet block near the School of Arts, it was elicited in cross examination that it was in a busy part of Nowra and close to a grassed area which was steep and so not normally walked upon. The complainant said that there were not a lot of people around that toilet block when he entered on the first occasion. Nor did anyone other than the appellant come into that toilet block on that occasion. The complainant did not recall whether it was busy outside that toilet block on the second occasion. 
     
      
    96   There was virtually no cross examination of the complainant in relation to the incidents in the toilet block near the School of Arts. There was no testing of his evidence as to these. This may have been due to the appellant’s assertion that he was not the man who assaulted the complainant. As to the Bombaderry incident, the appellant sought to raise a doubt out of the circumstance in which the incident allegedly occurred. 
     
      
    97   During the complainant’s cross examination, it was suggested to him that he had been influenced to make the complaint by those who used the Shoalhaven Youth Centre, the appellant having had differences with other members of SCAIMAC. The complainant did not agree. 
     
      
    98   The appellant denied that he had ever assaulted Mr. Eastment. He asserted that he was not involved in any of the incidents alleged. 
     
      
    99   One of the issues at the trial was the appearance and weight of the appellant. His obesity was one of the factors which helped to identify him. The appellant stated that he was a heavy boned man and 5 feet 8½ inches tall. He asserted that in 1983 he was 13½ stone and that at the time of the trial he was 21 stone. In cross examination he denied that he had a bit of a stomach back in 1983. He described himself as “slightly overweight”, and “probably one and a half stone overweight."" In re-examination he said that he had reflected on his weight in 1983 and that on reflection his weight in 1983 was about 16½ stone. That re-examination occurred after Dr. Dipold had first attended at Court but before she gave evidence. 
     
      
    100   Dr. A. Dipold first met the appellant in 1981 in a social context. He became a patient in 1984. She said of the appellant: “He’s been grossly overweight ever since I have known him.” . She described him as “overweight everywhere”. She thought he was at least 20 stone in 1981 and she could not remember any time when he was less than around 20 stone. She did not accept that he was only 16 stone in 1983. In November, 1984, the appellant was 22½ stone. The appellant’s obesity made him distinctive and easily identifiable. It gave added point to the complainant’s evidence of a “bear hug”. The complainant was a slender 13 year old lad. 
     
      
    101   To assist his case on the issue of his size, the appellant tendered a family photograph of himself and his wife which he stated was taken in about 1982. While he appears overweight in that photograph, he was not grossly so. His wife thought that the photograph was taken “somewhere in the late 70’s or early 80’s”. 
     
      
    102   The doctor said that the appellant suffered from obesity, high blood pressure (hypertension) and developing diabetes. He took Tenomin for the high blood pressure. She said that as the appellant’s diabetes got worse, his libido and sexual ability (gaining an erection) would gradually decrease. The drugs had an adverse effect on his ability to obtain and maintain an erection. While it was possible that a person with the problems of gross overweight, diabetes and hypertension might obtain an erection, it was not her experience that this would happen. 
     
      
    103   A psychiatric report which she received in 1994 recorded that the appellant had had no marital relations for over 10 years. The psychiatrist had found that the appellant was depressed and that the lack of marital relations was due to depression and the appellant’s physical condition. 
     
      
    104   The appellant stated that in 1983 he had no libido at all and could not achieve an erection. The appellant said that he started taking tablets for his diabetes in late 1983/1984. While he could not achieve an erection before this, this extra medication made his position even worse. The appellant’s wife said that from the 1970’s until around 1980 the appellant was able to achieve an erection. In the early 1980’s she sought assistance in having a child. 
     
      
    105   The appellant put in issue that over the years the complainant had seen him on occasions in the streets of the Nowra business district. The appellant asserted that he was “rarely” in those streets and would not concede that it was possible that he had been seen by the complainant in those streets. The appellant lived in Nowra but in some of those years he had been away working and living in Sydney during the week (Sunday afternoon to Friday night). The appellant’s evidence on this matter was strained and lacking in credibility. The evidence of his wife was that he would have gone into Nowra “possibly, only occasionally on the weekends.” 
     
      
    106   There are indications in the transcript that the demeanour of the complainant and the appellant was of some importance. During his examination in chief, the complainant had to be asked to keep up his voice. This occurred five times in the first 4 pages of his evidence. He also needed a glass of water. He dropped his voice again subsequently. Much of the dropping of the voice happened while giving evidence of the first incident. He did not seem to experience this difficulty when describing the second and third incidents (counts 3 and 4). After being cross examined directly on each of the incidents (but not at great length) the appellant was seen by paramedics and taken to hospital during the lunch hour. The trial was adjourned until the following day. The appellant did not want to return to the witness box even for re-examination. The judge allowed him to be further cross-examined on one point. The re-examination was minimal. 
     
      
    107   The appellant submitted that as the jury’s verdicts indicated that they had not accepted the appellant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt as to the Bombaderry incident, the jury should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt on counts 1 to 3. The appellant’s credibility had been found wanting and there was no sufficient difference in the evidence to justify the different verdicts. 
     
      
    108   I disagree. There is a substantial difference between the first and second incidents giving rise to counts 1 to 3 and the third incident giving rise to count 4. The earlier incidents took place within the toilet block and are of a type encountered, albeit distastefully and wrongly, on occasions. Such incidents are not usually advertised and often end quite abruptly with the arrival of others in the toilet. The Bombaderry incident was extraordinary. It involved dragging the complainant 15 to 20 metres across an area to which the public had access and which was in full view of those using the sporting area and the Nowra road. I doubt if passing motorists would have seen sufficient to stop. However, people could have arrived at the area at any time. It was an odd coincidence that the appellant and the complainant arrived at the same general area, even if by different paths. 
     
      
    109   The complainant’s evidence was substantial. The appellant’s evidence was not such as to raise a reasonable doubt. I can well understand a jury having no reservations about the incidents in the toilet block near the School of Arts but not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to that in the toilet at Bombaderry. Further, while the cross examination as to the Bombaderry incident constituted a real challenge to the complainant’s version, that as to the other incidents, did not. 
     
      
    110   The judge finished her summing up about 4 p.m. on Friday, 13 February, 1999 and the jury retired to consider their verdicts. This was a trial in which quite a lot of time was lost due to various applications, the non-availability of functioning equipment and the appellant’s spell in hospital. The judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       “I would like it if you could commence considering your verdict this afternoon. I do not know how you all feel. Is that what you want to do, start now and see how you go? 
       
       
       I think we will do that and let us know how you go during the course of the afternoon. We are not going to make you stay here for ever tonight but just see how we go when you start considering your verdicts and doing all those things that we have already referred to. 
       
       
       If you have got any questions or those matters that I raised that need to be clarified, just get a note to one of the officers. We will re-assemble the Court and deal with it as soon as possible after getting the note.” 
       
      
    111   At 4.15 p.m. the judge had the jury return to Court and she corrected a matter in her summing up. The jury retired to further consider their verdict at 4.17 p.m. At 4.40 p.m. the jury asked to see the complainant’s statement to the police. At 4.55 p.m. the judge explained to the jury that the statement was not available as it had not been tendered in evidence. The foreman of the jury stated that a couple of the jurors would like to hear again how many times the complainant had seen the appellant over the years. The jury retired. At 5.10 p.m. the judge summarised the evidence on this point for the jury. They retired to further consider their verdict at 5.15 p.m. 
     
      
    112   Shortly before 8.45 p.m. the jury returned their verdicts. While the jury considered their verdicts on Friday afternoon and evening no pressure was placed on the jury. They did not ask to return on the Saturday or Monday. The judge, while expressing her own preference that they begin to consider their verdicts, left it open to them to decide what they would like to do. There were considerable advantages in deciding the matter while everything was fresh in their minds especially as there was no transcript available. I do not think that the jury were placed under pressure. The trial had lasted five days and the jurors may well have had other commitments in the following week. It was not a complex case. The jury would have been given an evening meal and could at any stage have asked to suspend their deliberations. Neither counsel made any application to the judge. Those present at the trial felt no difficulty in continuing. My own experience is that some juries find it better to continue into the evening and some juries sit to even later hours. The jury spent over four hours considering this matter. That was ample and does not suggest any rushed consideration. I think that the different verdicts were readily understandable. 
     
      
    113   The appellant relied upon Jones v The Queen 191 CLR 439. At 450-452 the majority re-affirmed what the majority judges said in M v The Queen 181 CLR 487. The test was whether the court thinks upon the whole of the evidence it was ""open to the jury"" to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. At 451 the majority in Jones with reference to M said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ""In answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The majority judges explained the application of the test as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    114   In Jones the majority High Court of Australia took the view that the jury's finding of not guilty on one count damaged the credibility of the complainant on the remaining counts. They thought that there was nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gave any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts on which the accused was convicted than that count on which he was acquitted. 
     
      
    115   In the present case the different circumstances regarding the Berry Street toilet block incidents and the Bomaderry incident are significant. Those surrounding the latter are sufficiently unusual to require some other supporting evidence prior to conviction. 
     
      
    116   I agree with what Barr J has written on the other grounds of appeal. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. The application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence remains outstanding. 
     
      
    117   I am conscious of the contrary views of my brothers on the substantive ground argued and the different orders which they propose. To achieve a result I withdraw my reasons for judgment and concur in the orders proposed by Barr J.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 16 March 200070211/98 - REGINA v Leanne Elizabeth HOLMESJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: Leanne Elizabeth Holmes has pleaded guilty to concealing a serious offence, namely the manslaughter of Ronald Charles Brotherton at the hands of Brian John Robson. 
     
      
    2   The deceased, Ronald Charles Brotherton, was living in the Moruya area. He was out of a job and he was addicted to alcohol and illegal drugs. 
     
      
    3   Mr and Mrs Brian Robson, who lived in the town of Moruya, took pity on him and invited him to stay with them and their seven children. During the few months that he lived with the Robsons the deceased used heroin. That fact became known to the principal of the school attended by the Robson children and to other local authorities. 
     
      
    4   The department of Community Services threatened to remove the children from the household, asserting that they were not being properly looked after. That caused Mr and Mrs Robson to require the deceased to leave their house, and he did. 
     
      
    5   The deceased then presumed upon Ms Holmes and her de facto partner, Mr Martin Francis Strahan, to allow him to live with them. 
     
      
    6   The Robsons were not well off. In September 1997 they were preparing to move to Nowra and purchased a motor vehicle for that purpose for $300. They had spent several months working on it at a cost of at least $1200 and the car was ready for registration by the end of September. 
     
      
    7   The deceased came to their house while the Robsons were away, stole the car, drove it off the road and badly damaged it. It was a write-off. He told them that he would pay for the repairs, but nobody expected him to keep that promise. He had never repaid the kindnesses the Robsons and others had allowed him. 
     
      
    8   Mr Strahan and Ms Holmes were friends of the Robsons and were upset at about what had happened. They in turn asked the deceased to leave, and he moved into the home of a man called Shipley about ten kilometres away. 
     
      
    9   One day, Mr Robson and Mr Strahan were at the Robsons house talking about the deceased. Mr Robson asked Mr Strahan whether he would give him a lift to Mr Shipley’s house to see the deceased. Mr Robson was intending to give the deceased a beating. Mr Strahan had a good idea about that and so had Ms Holmes. The two men left the house and Mrs Robson and Ms Holmes remained. 
     
      
    10   While they were there, Ms Holmes received a phone call from Mr Robson, asking her to take a tarpaulin to the Shipley house. She did so. When she arrived she handed the tarpaulin to Mr Robson. From a distance of about 200 metres she saw Mr Robson and Mr Strahan wrap a body in it. The two men put the body into a car and drove off. After about thirty minutes they returned without the body and returned to Moruya with Ms Holmes. 
     
      
    11   Ms Holmes heard Mr Robson saying that he did not mean to do it and that he had gone too far. She knew that Mr Robson had killed the deceased and that he and Mr Strahan had got rid of the body. She helped clean specks of blood from the boot of the car that had been used. 
     
      
    12   Of course, Ms Holmes is not convicted of playing any part in the killing, or being in any way an accessory to it. Evidence of what she did is relevant only to her knowledge of what had happened. 
     
      
    13   The offence of which she has pleaded guilty is commonly called concealing a serious offence, but the substance of it is the failure, without reasonable excuse, to bring to the relevant authorities the knowledge that the person has about the commission of a serious offence. Manslaughter is a serious offence for these purposes. The maximum penalty prescribed by the legislation is imprisonment for two years. 
     
      
    14   Ms Holmes is a woman of average intelligence and was at the time of these events nineteen years old and of necessarily limited experience of life. She was a person of good character. The things that confronted her were entirely outside her experience. 
     
      
    15   Her relationship with Mr Strahan was of some standing. She had been with him since 1996 at the latest, for in that year she was pregnant to him. During a routine test the foetus was found to be anencephalic and had to be aborted. That had a serious effect upon Ms Holmes, as one might easily expect. 
     
      
    16   The killing of the deceased took place in October 1997. Some four months before that time Ms Holmes found herself pregnant again. She began to be very anxious about the fate of the foetus. She was worried that there might be some genetic or other reason why this second child might suffer the same fate as the first. 
     
      
    17   She attended upon medical experts on many occasions for tests, then she unintentionally and unexpectedly came by the knowledge of the killing of the deceased. These things combined to weigh down on her, and made her become quiet, withdrawn and despondent. 
     
      
    18   When the matter came to light in March 1998, she was asked why she had not told the police what she knew. She said that she was worried, having been involved with the car and everything. She thought if she said something she herself would be blamed. Her mistaken belief that she was criminally involved in the killing, in my opinion, mitigated her criminality in not telling the police what had happened. So, I think, does her depressed state of mind concerning the state of health of the child that she was then carrying. 
     
      
    19   I accept the submissions of Mr Cook, counsel for Ms Holmes, that in all the circumstances her criminality was low. 
     
      
    20   The applicant had no criminal record and has not offended since these events. She is a person of excellent character, as appears from evidence from her mother and her friend who was at court with her, and from letters of friends which have come into evidence. I accept that she is remorseful. That is proved in part by the lightening of her spirit which her friends noticed when the truth finally came out. I think that there is no risk that she will re-offend. 
     
      
    21   The Crown has very properly conceded that a sentence less than a custodial sentence lies within the range of sentencing discretion of this Court in this case. I have come to the view in all the circumstances that it is not necessary to impose a custodial sentence, and I think that justice will be done if I defer passing sentence. 
     
      
    22   The prisoner is convicted of the offence of which she has pleaded guilty. I defer passing sentence pursuant to the provisions of section 558 of the Crimes Act upon the prisoner’s entering into a recognisance without security in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour of three years and to come up for sentence if called upon within that period. 
     
      
    23   The recognisance may be entered before a Magistrate or a Justice of the Peace.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is a Crown appeal against the alleged inadequacy of a sentence. 
     
      
    2    On 11 February 1999 the Respondent pleaded guilty before her Honour Judge Payne in the Penrith District Court to one count of malicious damage by means of fire, contrary to s195(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    3    The maximum penalty for the offence is ten years. Her Honour imposed upon the Respondent a sentence of a minimum term of three months and an additional term of nine months. Her Honour specified that the sentence would commence on 6 November 2000, being the day after the expiry of a minimum term imposed upon the Respondent for an offence of armed robbery. 
     
      
    4    The offence with which the present proceedings are concerned was committed on 20 February 1997. At that time the Respondent was on bail pending prosecution for the armed robbery offence. 
     
      
    5    The act constituting the offence was the throwing against a garage roller door of what has been referred to in these proceedings as a ""fire bomb"", namely, a glass bottle containing an inflammable substance with a tightly rolled piece of cloth that had been lit prior to the bottle being thrown. 
     
      
    6    The garage adjoined, it appears quite closely, a dwelling at 127 Kildare Road, Blacktown. The dwelling was at the time of the offence occupied by Barbara Gilmore (who was pregnant), David Fleming and their two children. The house was owned by the Department of Housing. 
     
      
    7    The fire was reported to the Police and Fire Brigade services. However, it was extinguished by Mr Fleming prior to their arrival. Property damage amounting to approximately $700 was caused. 
     
      
    8    According to the evidence of Ms Gilmore before her Honour, tension had developed between herself and Ms Baker because the latter had alleged that Ms Gilmore had taken some of the cards in her collection of Marilyn Munro cards, a collection to which she was particularly attached. 
     
      
    9    Four days before the offence the Respondent telephoned Ms Gilmore and said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""You had better watch the yellow Monaro and your Commodore because I am going to fucking fire bomb them."" 
        
       
      
    10    The Crown asserts on this appeal that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and, particularly, that the minimum term imposed was manifestly inadequate. Its submission was that, ""There was no reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the objective gravity of the crime"". Its basic submission was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This would appear to be because her Honour failed to give any sufficient weight to the principle of general deterrence or because she allowed the Respondent's objective features far to outweigh the objective seriousness of the offence"". 
        
       
      
    11    The use of terminology such as ""sufficient weight"" highlights the difficulty for the Crown case. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ""weight"" will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined. 
     
      
    12    This is one of those cases in which the Court is asked to infer a legal error from the mere inadequacy of the sentence. The Appellant's submissions did not direct attention to any part of the conduct of the proceedings, or of her Honour's reasons on sentence, which disclosed any form of legal error. 
     
      
    13    The gravity of the offence, in terms of the use of fire, is recognised in s195 itself. For malicious damage to property the maximum sentence is five years penal servitude but, in the case of destruction or damage caused by fire or explosives, the maximum becomes ten years. 
     
      
    14    The thrust of the submissions on behalf of the Crown was that her Honour failed to give adequate weight to the danger which may have been caused by the act, directed at the garage, but which adjoined a dwelling that was at the time occupied by a family, including two children. 
     
      
    15    It was also submitted, and emphasised in oral submissions, that her Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the circumstances that this offence was committed whilst the Respondent was on conditional liberty, a relevant factor in the sentencing discretion and one to which her Honour referred. 
     
      
    16    It can be accepted that the circumstance of the possible spread of fire is a circumstance entitled to be taken into account by the trial judge in determining the appropriate sentence. Such circumstances are not, however, determinative of the appropriate sentencing range. The weight to be given to the potential consequences of the use of fire depends on all the circumstances of the case. In the present case those circumstances include an express threat to attack the victim's cars and a ""fire bomb"" directed at the garage. 
     
      
    17    In her reasons on sentence her Honour noted a number of factors relevant to determination of sentence, including: 
     
      
    · The Crown case was not an ""overwhelming"" one and accordingly significant weight was entitled to be attached to the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    · Her Honour made express reference to the need for general deterrence in a case of a person ""seeking retribution about what she perceived to be wrong"". 
     
      
    · The subjective considerations included an addiction to heroin, continued ill-health, her victimisation on two subsequent occasions as a victim of a crime herself and a participant in a car accident, which caused the Respondent to suffer two head injuries; and also her Honour took into account the detailed contents of a psychologist's report tendered before her Honour and available to this Court. 
     
      
    18    Her Honour gave two reasons for finding special circumstances within s5(2) of the Sentencing Act. The first was that the very fact that she was accumulating a sentence upon the minimum term of the sentence for armed robbery was itself a ""special circumstance"". It does not appear to me that the mere fact of accumulation is such. However, the consequence of accumulation on a minimum term may be, as indeed it would have been in this case, to significantly attenuate an additional term for the other offence. It is not necessary to finally decide this point. The Crown accepted that there were special circumstances by reason of the second factor on which her Honour relied, namely, the desirability of an extended period of supervision to foster her rehabilitation. 
     
      
    19    In my opinion there is no warrant for this Court to interfere with the sentencing discretion by her Honour. The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified in the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred. 
     
      
    20    In the present case the personal history of the Respondent was entitled to weight as a counterbalance to the objective circumstances of the offence, including the minimal actual damage to property, the potential for greater damage to persons and property and the element of an offender taking the law into her own hands. In my opinion the striking of that balance was not such as to require a sentence higher than that imposed by her Honour. 
     
      
    21    I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    22    GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    23    HIDDEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    24    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order is that the appeal is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act challenging rulings made before trial by Keleman DCJ. In substance, those rulings indicated the intended rejection of evidence of visual identification of the Respondent by a witness named Kazal, and secondly, evidence of a subsequent identification of the Respondent by the same witness from a photographic display shown to him by police about four and a half months later. A preliminary point has been taken as to whether the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to s5F can be enlivened. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The events out of which the Respondent was charged took place shortly after 3am on Sunday morning, 6 April 1997. It suffices for present purposes to give but a brief outline of those facts. 
      
       
      
     3     
     What can be described as a brawl took place in the vicinity of the Criterion Hotel in Park Street, City. Participants were said to include a number of men of Pacific Islander appearance. It can be accepted that the Respondent is a person of that appearance. A number of bystanders attempted to intervene and the group of men of islander appearance moved on into the Hyde Park area. They were apparently joined by further men of similar appearance. They were accosted by, amongst others, a security guard and the man Mr Kazal, whom I have mentioned. The security guard was attacked and rendered unconscious and Mr Kazal was engaged in fisticuffs with one of the men. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Police came into the vicinity and, at about 4am, four men including the Respondent were seen to emerge from streets in the vicinity of William Street, which is, in effect, an extension of Park Street. These men were stopped by police and required to place their hands on the police vehicle. They were searched and then directed to stand nearby with their hands against a shop window. In the meantime, Mr Kazal had been collected in another police vehicle and, no doubt as a result of radio contact, he was brought to the scene. He looked at the four men and in response to an enquiry as to whether any of those were involved in what he had seen earlier, he indicated all four by saying, ""Him, him, him and him"", adding a remark about lack of courage. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The ruling by Keleman DCJ involved application of s114 of the Evidence Act, and in particular reference to s114(2) which provided that evidence would be excluded unless there was reasonable ground for not holding an identification parade. It was not suggested before Keleman DCJ nor before this Court, that what occurred in William Street was an identification parade. As I have indicated, his Honour ruled that he would exclude that evidence. He also ruled that he would exclude the evidence of the subsequent photographic identification in the exercise of his discretion. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The argument before the District Court proceeded upon a basis identified by his Honour in the course of his judgment in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Although the Crown changed its position during the course of the voir dire, it now contends that there is sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the accused in respect of the offences charged, even if the evidence of identification was excluded."" 
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
     7     
     Before this Court the appeal was sought to be sustained by inviting this Court to examine the available evidence, other than the identification evidence, and proceed upon the basis that his Honour's acceptance of the Crown concession was wrong. For my part, I have some difficulty in approaching the matter on that basis, but even assuming that it can be, as I am of a view that the Crown appeal cannot succeed, I will continue. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The jurisdiction vested in this Court pursuant to s5F was considered in 
      R v Steffan 
      (1993) 30 NSWLR 633, where it was held that a ruling on evidence made in advance of trial in the District Court was not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of the Criminal Appeal Act. Nevertheless, it was recognised in that judgment that there may be, what was described as a rare case, where a ruling on evidence, because it forms the basis of a stay of proceedings, could be the principal legal issue to be determined on a s5F appeal. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The matter was progressed by a further judgment in this Court in 
      R v Bozatsis 
      (1997) 97 A Crim R 296. In that case Gleeson CJ, speaking for the Court and dealing with the question of what could be comprehended by the words ""judgment"" or ""order"", noted that ""Rulings also decide questions” raised for decision in particular proceedings but he added, significantly in my view, ""It is the character of the question, and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference"". 
      
       
      
     10     
     The next relevant reference in this Court can be found in 
      R v Lissoff 
      unreported 22 November 1999. In essence, that case held that an appeal under s5F would lie where a ruling in a real and practical sense destroyed any prospect of the Crown presenting the substance of its case. As I understand it, it is that prospect which is relied upon by the Crown in this appeal. Nevertheless, it must be observed that in  
     Lissoff 
      itself, the Court observed that, had it been clear that the Crown case had been weakened but not effectively destroyed by the ruling in the District Court, then “the approach” in 
      Steffan 
      would have been applied. The approach in 
      Steffan 
      would result in holding that the Crown appeal did not lie. 
      
       
      
     11     
     Despite my reservations, I have looked at the evidence available to the Crown as was presented in the voir dire hearing before Keleman DCJ. There is evidence of the clothing worn by the Respondent, being a blue collared shirt and black jeans. There was injury to his hands and, observed by police, an injury to his head. I regard it as not insignificant, given the circumstances which I have sketched, that when first approached by police and asked whether he would speak to them in relation to some incidents which had just occurred in Park Street, he is said to have replied, ""I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know any of these fellas except for James. What happened?"" 
      
       
      
     12     
     Later, at an interview, the Respondent adopted the position that he had indeed been present at the events outside the Criterion Hotel in Park Street but that he had not been a participant. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Given those matters, it is readily perceptible that the source of the concession made before Keleman DCJ by the Crown was well-founded. In my view, it cannot be said that although the identification evidence would no doubt be valuable evidence to the Crown, the Crown has no case in substance without it. The character of the question determined is no more than a discrete ruling on evidence made before trial by a judge of the District Court. In those circumstances, in my view, s5F is not available to the Crown and I propose the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     14     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
      
       
      
     15     
     HIDDEN J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     16     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
    1    MEAGHER JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
     
      
     
     
      
      SIMPSON J 
        
      : 
        
       
      
    2    I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Smart AJ. For the reasons given by his Honour I agree that grounds 2, 5 and 6 are made out and that grounds 7, 9 and 10 should be rejected. Having regard to the orders proposed by Smart AJ with which I agree, and the views which I am about to express, it is unnecessary to determine ground 8, that is whether the judge failed adequately to put to the jury the defence case. I simply wish to express in my own words my reasons for agreeing with his Honour’s conclusions in relation to grounds 1, 4, and 11. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    3    This ground requires a careful analysis of the real issues as they emerged at trial. Since it was necessary for the Crown to prove absence of consent to the particular incidents alleged, consent was, in a sense, relevant in relation to each of those allegations. In another sense, however, consent was not a live issue in relation to those specific allegations, because the appellant denied they had occurred. Consent (or lack thereof) may have been seen as, at most, a peripheral issue. But the position taken by the appellant added a level of complexity to that otherwise simple formulation. His case was that consensual sexual activity had taken place on occasions other than those alleged by C. In order to evaluate that case it was proper for the jury to have evidence of the relationship between the two. The content of the diary, if the jury accepted that it was as described, could have assisted them in that evaluation. Specifically, it was relevant to the defence position. Accordingly, I agree that ground 1 should be upheld. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    4    The true issue in relation to the evidence concerning what (if anything) C told Ms Cotter is whether it was admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995. Debate about whether it is properly characterised as “complaint” evidence is not to the point. 
     
      
    5    All other pre-conditions to admissibility under s 66 having been met, the only remaining question was a factual one, whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in C’s memory at the time of her alleged conversation with Ms Cotter. The conversation took place in about August 1984. The events to which she referred took place in 1983 and 1984. Although his Honour did not make an express finding of fact about recency, the terms of the conversation C alleged suggests that recency, as explained in R v Graham ([1998] HCA 61; (1998) 102 A Crim R 438) would inevitably have been established. The consequence of this is that the direction to the jury was rather more favourable to the appellant than the law demanded. The jury were told that they were not entitled to take the evidence as evidence of the truth of its contents. That is incorrect: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37, 164 ALR 548, 73 ALJR 1274. 
     
      
       
      Ground 11 
       
      
    6    I agree that the evidence in the bald form in which it was given, should, in the exercise of discretion, have been excluded. That is not to say that some more specific description of the appearance of the appellant, if it met the necessary tests, would also have to be excluded.  
     
      
    7    Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Smart AJ. 
     
      
       
      
    8    SMART AJ: Mr Van Dyk appeals against his conviction on 5 counts of having sexual intercourse with C without her consent knowing that she was not consenting, C being under the age of 16 years, namely between 14 and 15 years and on 2 counts of carnal knowledge. The jury was unable to agree on 2 further counts of sexual intercourse without consent. In total, he was sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years penal servitude and an additional term of 1 year. 
     
      
    9    The events alleged occurred in 1983 and 1984 when she was 14 and 15 but the trial did not take place until October 1998. She did not report the matter to the Police until September 1996 when she was aged 26 and in her third year of a primary school teaching course at university and studying a subject called ‘Children at Risk’. However on 26 September 1984 when she was 16 weeks pregnant C underwent an abortion.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    10    C was born on 14 October 1968. She loved horses. When she was 13 years old and towards the end of 1981 her mother purchased a horse for her from the appellant. The horse was agisted at the R and M Ranch at Kellyville from 1981 until the horse was sold in 1984. About 1983 she (or her mother on her behalf) leased another horse which was also kept at the ranch. During this period the appellant boarded in the house at the ranch with the owner. He helped the owner, worked his own horses, bought and sold horses and took them to shows. During 1983-1984 he was working for a bricklaying company five to six days per week from about 7am to 3.20pm. He was nine years her senior and physically quite a tall, strong looking man. C spent considerable time at the ranch and often helped the appellant with his horses. He gave advice and help in relation to her horses. Quite a number of people had horses on agistment at the ranch and they called to tend them. 
     
      
    11    C stated that about 12 months after her association with the appellant began he made remarks on occasions about her breasts and her backside. About halfway through 1983 he touched her on the outside of her clothing, on her breasts and between her legs. There were instances, where she found that she was alone with him as a result of a job which he had asked her to do. In about June 1983 C ran away from home. She had lost her father and her uncle and was unhappy at home. Her mother had remarried. C walked from her home at North Rocks to the ranch at Kellyville to obtain her horse. She arrived after dark and found her horse had not been shod and therefore could not be ridden away. She spent the night lying on some hay in a shed. She encountered the appellant early the following morning and he helped her to hide during the following day and allowed her to use his horse float. It contained an area that could be used as a bunk. On the third day he explained to her that as the police were looking for her she would have to walk up to the house, allow the police and her mother to be notified and return home. She was not to mention having met him and his assistance. 
     
      
    12    She stated that about one or two weeks later, about June/July 1983 the appellant signalled her to come into the feed shed, led her behind some 44 gallon drums, put his hands inside her pants and inserted his fingers into her vagina. She said that she froze. He then placed her hand on his penis and moved her hand up and down for a few minutes. He looked outside and motioned to her that she could safely leave. This incident was the subject of the first count of sexual assault without consent. The jury were unable to agree. 
     
      
    13    She said that within 4 to 6 weeks of that incident the appellant called her over to his horse float and motioned for her to get inside with him closing the door after her. He pulled her close to him and touched her. He pushed her onto her knees by placing his hands upon her shoulders. He pulled down the top of his shorts and released his erect penis which he placed into her mouth. This was the subject of count two. She pulled back but he took hold of her head, moving it back and forwards and eventually ejaculated into her mouth. He told her to suck harder or faster. She felt she had no choice. The jury were unable to agree on this count. 
     
      
    14    She stated that later in the winter of 1983 the appellant asked her to carry some feed buckets down to the stables to feed his horses. As she was tipping the buckets out the appellant came up behind her, put his arms around her and turned her around so that she was facing him. He placed his hands down her pants and onto her buttocks. She tried to push away but he held her tight. He placed his hands on her vagina from behind her. He pulled his hands out and brought them around to the front of her pants. He inserted his fingers into her vagina. She froze. It hurt but she did not cry. He next guided her hand to his penis to masturbate him. This was the subject of count three and the jury convicted the appellant. 
     
      
    15    The next incident occurred in the summer of 1983/1984 probably during the school holidays. The appellant signalled for the complainant to go into the feed shed. He pushed a 44 gallon drum over and pulled the complainant’s jodhpurs and pants down and forced her to sit on the drum. She said that she was very distressed and crying. He knelt down in front of her and inserted his fingers into her vagina. She tried unsuccessfully to close her knees together but he pushed them apart. He then placed his mouth and tongue in and around her vagina and performed cunnilingus. She started to cry and kept saying “no” to which he replied “That’s okay. You’re only crying because you’re enjoying it so much.” This incident was the subject of the 4th count. The jury convicted the appellant. 
     
      
    16    In 1984 between about January and June 1984 C was riding her horse in the back paddock. The appellant rode up and rode for a few minutes. He stopped, got off his horse and called her over. He took her and the horses into the brush and scrub, tying the horses up to a tree. He stood her in front of him and pulled her jodhpurs down. He pushed her down and then back so she was lying on the ground. He inserted his fingers into her vagina. After re-adjusting her position he performed cunnilingus for a few minutes. As she was trying to pull up her jodhpurs and get up he held her down, laughed and said, “You can’t go and leave me like this.” He pulled his erect penis out, inserted it in her mouth and moved her head backwards and forwards until he ejaculated. He told her “This is okay to happen between us but nobody else is allowed to know because they wouldn’t understand.” Her mother was quite ill with cancer. He remarked that if her mother ever found out it would kill her. This incident was the subject of the 5th count. The jury convicted the appellant. 
     
      
    17    In about May 1984 she went to the house to use the toilet. She believed nobody was there. After using the toilet/bathroom she opened the door and found the appellant standing outside the door. He took her by her shoulders and walked her into the lounge room. He stopped her leaving the house by the kitchen. He folded a towel, placed it on the floor and told her to lie down. She sat down and he pushed her so she was lying down. He pulled her pants down and positioned her on the towel. He placed his fingers into her vagina. Then he lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. He moved his penis in and out and did a lot of pushing. She had difficulty breathing. This seemed to go on for a long time. When he stopped he laughed and said she must have really enjoyed it. He removed the towel and wiped himself. He had ejaculated inside her. She noticed blood and semen. He told her to hurry outside because her mother would be looking for her. This incident was the subject of count 6. The jury convicted the appellant of sexual assault without consent. 
     
      
    18    A couple of weeks later (about June 1984) the appellant asked C to take feed down to his horses in the stables. She did so. He walked into the stables, put a rug on the floor and told her to lie down. He took her jodhpurs completely off, lay on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina. He ejaculated inside her. This was the subject of count 7. The jury acquitted the appellant of the charge of sexual assault without consent but convicted him of carnal knowledge. 
     
      
    19    The next incident occurred soon after (about July 1984). C went into the house to use the toilet. She latched the door. She could hear someone turning the door handle and pushing the door, trying to come in. She called out that she would be “finished in a minute.” The person did not say anything. She then thought it could be the appellant so she slowed down and waited for a few minutes before opening the door. The appellant walked straight in pushing her back inside the toilet. He closed and latched the door. He turned her around so she had her back towards him and pulled down her jodhpurs and her pants. He insisted that she remain in that position and held her there. When she tried to turn back around to face him he told her to bend over and pushed her into that position. He instructed her to put her hands on his knees. He moved her legs apart. He leant over her. He inserted his penis between her legs and finally into her vagina. This hurt. He moved back and forward a number of times and ejaculated. He withdrew his penis. She found it very difficult to stand up again and was very sore. She had semen running down through her legs. He said that she must really be enjoying things like this. She pulled her pants up as quickly as she could and left the bathroom/toilet. This incident was the subject of the eighth count. The jury convicted the appellant of sexual assault without consent. 
     
      
    20    The next incident occurred soon after the one just mentioned, probably about July/August 1984. She said that she had been in the wash bay area. He called her into the feed area. He checked to see if anyone else was there. He led her behind some 44 gallon drums and made her lie down on some hay. He pulled her jodhpurs down below her knees, lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. He ejaculated inside her and withdrew his penis. The incident was the subject of count 9. The appellant was acquitted of sexual assault without consent but convicted of carnal knowledge. 
     
      
    21    During the winter of 1984 C had not been well. Amongst other things she had been diagnosed as suffering from glandular fever. This was in July 1984. There was fatigue, headaches, feverishness and sore throats. In the course of a general review and examination on 19 September 1984 Dr Hutton found that C was about 16 weeks pregnant. She was unaware of this until told by the doctor. After counselling both C and her mother, a termination was arranged and this took place on 26 September 1984. The doctor did not explore with C the circumstances which led to her becoming pregnant. 
     
      
    22    Dr Hutton advised that the practice records showed her father had died in 1980 of a melanoma. Her mother had suffered from lymphoma in 1983, a potentially life-threatening blood cancer of the lymph glands. There were some tensions in the home but probably no more than the normal ones with strong willed teenage children. 
     
      
    23    The first time she spoke to someone about what had happened was about the end of August 1984 when she said to her friend and fellow horse enthusiast, Joanne Cotter, who also had horses at the ranch, “I think there’s something going on between Shane and me.” Ms Cotter replied “What?” C said “Well I don’t know.” Ms Cotter responded, “Well there’s something going on between Shane and me as well.” According to C they promised to tell each other everything from then on. C said that they used to talk about the things that the appellant was doing to her and Ms J Cotter. C said that after the doctor told her that she was pregnant she telephoned Ms J Cotter and told her what the doctor had said. Ms Cotter insisted that C tell the appellant. C did so and told him “I’ve just found out that I am pregnant.” C said that he responded, “As far as I am concerned it’s got nothing to do with me.” C stated “Well, I am probably going to have to get an abortion.” The appellant did not really respond. C continued to go to the ranch until her horse was sold in late 1984 but they had no contact. He ignored her. 
     
      
    24    In cross examination this passage appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q What I’m asking you is what you told her [J Cotter] Shane was doing to you? 
        
       
       
        
         A That he had been touching me, that he had had sex with me. I really. I can’t recall the specifics of that conversation at all.” 
        
       
      
    25    The Crown called Ms J Cotter but she could not remember any conversation with C as to the appellant during 1983 or 1984. She denied that anything ever went on between herself and the appellant. She could not remember having had a conversation with C about her being pregnant. Ms Cotter could not remember anything specific and was inclined to think that they did not occur. The evidence of Ms Cotter revealed that C had ended their friendship and that Ms Cotter was still on friendly terms with the appellant. 
     
      
    26    C’s mother gave evidence that her daughter regularly attended at the ranch. She saw her daughter in company with the appellant and that he always seemed to be around the girls. She said “I used to see the look in his face when he looked at any of the girls.” She described it as “a look of wanting”. She was aware that the girls used to go down to a big shed at the front of the ranch where the appellant kept his horses and feed. 
     
      
    27    The Crown also called Mr D I MacAlister, a family friend of C and her family. He kept his horses at the R & M Ranch and was aware that C did likewise. He knew the appellant who lived at the ranch and had his horses there. He did not see C and the appellant together alone at the ranch. There were always people around. Very occasionally he may have seen them riding together in the front paddock. He turned 15 years of age in May 1983. She never mentioned any unease about going to the ranch. She wanted to go there to work and feed her horses. He was not aware of her being ill at ease; she appeared to be relaxed, happy and comfortable at the ranch. He had not seen her and the appellant in any compromising situation. She never made any complaint to him. 
     
      
    28    C said in cross examination that until she heard the definition of “sexual assault” or “child sexual assault” in the course “Children At Risk” and understood that it was a sexual relationship or an older or bigger person getting sexual gratification out of a younger or smaller person she felt that what happened was her fault and that she was to blame. Then in 1996 she knew that she didn’t have a choice and was powerless. She became stressed about what had happened to her. At long last she was able to put a name to what he had done. 
     
      
    29    In cross examination she said that when she first obtained her horse she felt a sense of loss with the death of her father and her uncle and her mother’s illness. The appellant befriended her and she trusted him. He was an experienced rider and she looked up to him. She thought the appellant cared for her. She insisted that she was not a willing participant in his sexual advances. She said that she did not understand that what was happening to her was child sexual assault. Sex was not talked about in her household. At one stage in cross examination this exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q …do you accept or not accept that you participated because first of all you thought that he cared for you? 
        
       
       
        
         A Possibly yes 
        
       
       
        
         Q …you were looking for some reassurance that what was happening was correct between you and him? 
        
       
       
        
         A Well Shane was telling me that it was okay and I was telling myself well it must be okay because he’s saying it’s okay.” 
        
       
       
      Her overriding desire was to ride well and learn as much as she could about horses. 
       
      
    30    She said in cross examination that she was very unhappy about what the appellant was doing to her and very uneasy about going to the R & M Ranch. However she was unhappy at home and wanted to go to the ranch. She said that on many occasions she did not wear a brassiere because the appellant had told her not to. This was probably in 1983. She agreed that she did try to please the appellant. She denied that she was the instigator of sexual intercourse with the appellant. She could not recall asking the appellant if he would pay for the abortion. C said that she told a girlfriend, Ms M Carter, in 1985 or 1986 at her holiday house on a weekend that she had become pregnant to someone at the R & M Ranch. The appellant said that she kept in touch with Jo Cotter who was a bridesmaid at her wedding in 1990. Then their paths diverged. 
     
      
    31    C said in cross examination that she had an old exercise book in which she would write things from time to time. Possibly in 1983/1984 she kept it in her room. She probably made references in it to her attendances at the ranch. She no longer had the book. She did not recall writing in it “Shane is a spunk, I wouldn’t mind being screwed by him.” It is possible that she made such an entry. She agreed that when she was 13 or 14 years of age she used the word “spunk” and possibly thought that he was a spunk. When she first got her horse she thought that the appellant was great. 
     
      
    32    It emerged in cross examination that despite the prior experiences of C in the stables and the feed shed she again, as to count 7, agreed to take feed down to the stables when asked by the appellant. She could not recall whether the incident occurred on a weekend or a weekday. As to count 9 she recalled going to the feed shed. She kept the feed for her horses there. Most other people did not keep their feed where she kept the feed for her horses. She could not recall any particular details about this incident. She could not remember this last incident as clearly as she could remember the other incidents. She could not remember exactly what happened. Having regard to the evidence it is understandable that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the charges of sexual assault without consent but were satisfied of carnal knowledge. 
     
      
    33    Very close to the end of C’s cross examination and in the absence of the jury the judge queried the approach of the cross examiner as to counts 3 and 8, the judge remarking that the two incidents which the appellant admitted seemed to correspond broadly with these counts. Counsel pointed out that the first incident admitted did not take place at the time covered by count 3; the incident taking place over one year later than the matters alleged in count 3. Apart from the time difference there was a broad similarity. As to the second incident, namely, that in the toilet, counsel pointed out that he had not challenged that an incident took place but rather that the incident (being the subject of count 8) did not occur as she had alleged but in a quite different way. Of critical importance on the appellant’s version was that she consented. The jury did not accept the appellant’s version. 
     
      
       
      The Record of Interview 
       
      
    34    In his record of interview on 3 June 1997 the appellant said that when he first met C she was about 14, 15. She was in third form at school. He was taken through all of the incidents. He insisted that there were only two incidents involving wrongful conduct on his part. She consented on both occasions to what occurred. Indeed she was willing. However, he was aware that she was under 16 years of age at the time. As to the first incident, this happened down at the stables. She had been coming down to the stables and behaving in an over friendly way. He started kissing her there one day. He rubbed her on her breasts. He put his hand down inside her pants and put his finger in her vagina. He estimated that the incident lasted about ten minutes with the finger episode taking about five minutes. He denied any other misconduct. He was not sure of the times. This incident could have corresponded with the allegations in a number of the counts. The appellant was adamant that there was no forcing or compulsion on his part. 
     
      
    35    The appellant said that the second incident happened within one to three weeks of the first incident. He thought that he had finished working one horse and put it away. He went to have a cup of coffee before riding another horse. He went down to the house and while he was going into the kitchen she followed him down to the house and entered. He walked around towards the bathroom (toilet) and she “more or less” followed him around. He asked her if she wished to come in. She came in and they shut the door. He started kissing her. It was a spur of the moment encounter. He said that he undid her jeans, undid her zipper and pulled her pants down a bit. She did not take them off. At one stage he thought that she might have lowered her pants. She lay down on the floor. He inserted his finger in her vagina and was using it. She asked “Can you, will you do it” (or words to that effect). Then he penetrated her with his penis. No contraceptive measures were taken. He withdrew on the point of ejaculation. Each got up and dressed. He said that she described the experience as “good” and “great”. He said that the intercourse was rushed. The occupier of the ranch, Mr Murray was in another room and other people came in to use that toilet. He estimated that the episode in the toilet took about ten minutes. He denied that he used any form of compulsion or pressure. He claimed that the intercourse took place because she was so willing. After the incident she went outside and resumed what she was doing. He said that for a week or so after the incident she did not come to the ranch. Within a short period she ceased coming to the ranch. 
     
      
    36    The appellant denied all the other acts of criminal sexual misconduct alleged against him. The appellant relied heavily on the number of people around the ranch and the absence of any protests or complaints to others. The appellant stated that he had kissed C a number of times. He was not sure of the number but he gave an estimate of about a dozen times. He said that he kissed her during the incident at the stables, on another 1 or 2 occasions shortly thereafter and during the incident in the bathroom. The appellant explained that his wrongful conduct occurred when he had fallen out with his girl friend. 
     
      
    37    The appellant denied that he had assisted C when she ran away from home and allowed her to stay in his horse truck. He said that she never stayed in the horse truck as there was nothing in there. 
     
      
    38    The appellant said that about a week or some weeks after their intercourse in the toilet she telephoned and told him that she was at her grandmother’s (godmother’s) place and that she needed $200 because she felt that she was pregnant and wanted to get an abortion. He said that he told her that if she was sure she was pregnant he would give her the money. He told her to find out for sure but he never heard from her again about that matter. He was wary because she said that she had not told her mother. After this telephone call he subsequently saw C at the ranch but the matter was not raised by her and he did not ask. He said that a few years later he saw her at a hotel with a male. She waved and greeted him. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
      
    39    The appellant’s evidence was that none of the incidents happened in the way she alleged, that only two incidents occurred, that they occurred within a month of each other in about July/August 1984 and that she consented to all that occurred. On his approach the appellant should have been acquitted on counts 1 to 7 and 9. He should also have been acquitted of sexual assault without consent on count 8. It is difficult to see how, on his own story, he could escape being convicted of carnal knowledge on count 8. 
     
      
    40    In his evidence the appellant emphasised that the feed sheds and wash bays were open fronted and looked onto a large open area and that there were usually people around attending to their horses kept at the ranch. The number of horses agisted at the ranch varied from 50 to 80. The appellant denied that various incidents had occurred over about 14 months and asserted that the incidents he admitted happened over three to four weeks. He denied that in about the winter of 1984 there were four acts of sexual intercourse. There was only one such act and it occurred in the bathroom. He said that there was one incident of kissing in the stable and no more. He confirmed what he had said in his record of interview. On those occasions where there was some sexual activity between them she was a very willing participant. 
     
      
    41    The appellant’s cross examination was illuminating. Amongst other things, the appellant agreed that there was plenty of opportunity to carry on a sexual relationship at the ranch. A lot of teenage boys and girls used the ranch. He would have been thrown off the ranch if there had been any hint of him having an affair with one of the girls using the ranch. This meant, in effect, that he had to be discreet both as to the girl with whom he had intercourse and where he had it. He had to ensure that there was no complaint and no witnesses who would report it. 
     
      
    42    The appellant denied that he ever put his hands down the back of her pants, put his fingers between the cheeks of her buttocks and inserted his finger into vagina from behind. He said that the only time he ever placed his fingers into her vagina was from down the front of her pants. That occurred in one of his stables. He gave this description: 
     
      
       
        
        “We’ve gone down there, she was down there or she followed me to come down with me to help me feed the horses. One of us might have been taking a horse - leading a horse down or something and basically I suppose we turned to each other, we looked at each other, the next minute we’re kissing each other and then there was a bit of fondling and that was basically it for that time.” 
        
       
      
    43    By a bit of fondling he meant touching her breasts and her vagina with his hands first on the outside of her clothes and then on the inside. He agreed that he undid the button on her jodhpurs and then her zipper and placed his hands inside her underpants into her vagina. Their kissing was spontaneous as they stood and looked at each other. 
     
      
    44    He had kissed her previously. She had always been overly friendly but she had never made a sexual pass at him. She was obsessed with horses and looked up to him as a person who knew horses well. He was aware she was under 16. He estimated the incident lasted 10 to 15 minutes. He agreed that someone could have walked into the stables at any time. 
     
      
    45    The appellant said that between this incident and the one in the bathroom a couple of weeks later they had no conversation of a sexual nature. They did not discuss what had happened in the stable. 
     
      
    46    As to the bathroom incident the appellant was unable to say why C followed him down to the house. He did not ask the question. This passage appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Just happened to be there? 
        
       
       
        
         A Well she followed me down yes, or follow - I didn’t know if she was coming down to get a drink or just getting - wanted to use the bathroom, I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
         Q So you’re down there making a cup of coffee, putting the jug on, she just happened to be - you’ve turned around and she happened to be there. She followed you in and you just said ‘How about going into the bathroom?’? 
        
       
       
        
         A Yeah 
        
       
       
        
         Q What was your purpose in saying ‘How about going into the bathroom?’? 
        
       
       
        
         A Well obviously to make advances to her I suppose” 
        
       
      
    47    The appellant said that the incident just happened notwithstanding that Mr Ray Murray was in the house and others may have entered the house to use the bathroom. If he had been discovered he would have been thrown off the property. The appellant said that he simply decided there and then in the house to invite C into the bathroom for the purpose of making advances. He was pretty sure that C knew his intent. After shutting the door they kissed and she asked him to make love to her or to have sex with her. She instigated the situation. He said that she took part in penile intercourse. He agreed that he undid the button on her jodhpurs. Either she pulled her pants down or he did. He believed they went down below her knees to her ankles. Then he undid his shorts and probably dropped them below his knees. They laid down on the floor. He put his fingers in her vagina and touched her. He did not think about the lino floor being cold. He then lay on top of her and had penile intercourse with her. He withdrew at the point of ejaculation, not ejaculating inside her but outside. They kissed for a couple of minutes. She said, “That was great.” 
     
      
    48    A reading of the cross examination as to the circumstances in which the intercourse took place makes it hard to accept that this was consensual intercourse. There was virtually no foreplay, the place was on a cold bathroom floor, probably covered with lino, it was winter and on his version he had to squeeze in between her legs while she had a pair of jodhpurs, which were reasonably tight fitting, around her ankles or lower legs. He estimated that the intercourse might have lasted for three minutes. 
     
      
    49    The appellant stated in cross examination that C’s telephone call about being pregnant came within a couple of weeks of the second incident. He thought the incidents happened about June/July 1984. While he was not 100% sure that the baby was his he was frightened about being blamed for the pregnancy of a 15 year old girl. After that he had nothing to do with her. 
     
      
    50    Mrs L Cotter agisted two horses at the ranch from about 1981-1991. Her daughter, Johanna, also had horses there. Mrs Cotter said that in 1983 she went to the ranch every night. She said that it was like a community and that there was always a lot of people there. She described C as “just one of the kids there.” She knew C as a friend of her daughter. C was friendly but troubled by her mother’s illness. Mrs Cotter said that the appellant did not have a look of wanting. The judge refused to allow her to be asked whether C ever appeared to be scared or uneasy upon the ground that it went only to her credit. 
     
      
    51    The evidence of Stephanie Smith, a sister of C, sought to be adduced by the appellant was ruled to be inadmissible by the judge. 
     
      
       
        
       
      Appeal Ground 1: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in excluding evidence of the contents of C’s diary. 
        
       
      
      
    52    As earlier appears C was asked in cross examination whether she ever remembered an entry in her “diary” (or exercise book) such as “Shane is a spunk. I wouldn’t mind being screwed by him.” She said that she did not recall it although it was possible. She was “not saying that yes I definitely wrote that.” “Spunk” was a word she used. 
     
      
    53    Defence counsel sought to adduce evidence from Mrs Lily McAlister that C did write the words in question in her “diary”. A copy of her statement was placed before the judge. That statement contained some general observations about C and her physical development. Inter alia, the statement read: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was a close friend of Helen, C’s mother up until about two years ago when C made the complaint about Shane. 
        
        
        … 
         
         
        One day Helen came to my home. She was very upset. She said “I’ve found C’s diary and cigarettes in her school bag. I feel really guilty about reading it.” I took the diary from Helen and read some of its contents. 
        
       
       
        
        I recall reading words to the effect of ‘Shane is a spunk. I wouldn’t mind being screwed by him.’  
        
       
      
    54    C had agreed that she had an old exercise book in which she wrote things from time to time. C’s mother would obviously know her daughter’s exercise book and her writing. The mother produced the exercise book to Mrs McAlister as that of C. Mrs McAlister then saw what C had written in her exercise book. Mrs McAlister was able to give evidence of what she saw - s.66 (2)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995. The exercise book was missing. Neither C nor her mother had it. It was not suggested that anyone else had it. The best available evidence of the contents of the exercise book had to come from those who had seen it. Under s. 72 the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation about the person’s feelings, intention or state of mind. At common law evidence of C’s state of mind, namely, her desire to have penile intercourse with the appellant would have been admissible as bearing upon the probabilities that the intercourse which allegedly occurred was without her consent. 
     
      
    55    Counsel for the appellant at the trial while conceding that the evidence went to C’s credit submitted that the evidence was not limited to that point. However, it was not explained to the judge clearly to what other issue or issues the evidence went.  
     
      
    56    The judge ruled: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the proposed evidence…from Mrs McAlister on behalf of the accused goes to the credit of the complainant and does not go to any substantive issue other than credit. 
        
       
       
        
        In those circumstances the collateral evidence [rule] would preclude that evidence being called and I will not … allow any evidence to be called on behalf of the accused in respect of the diary entry.” 
        
       
      
    57    The judge was incorrect to rule that the evidence went only to credit and not to any substantive issue. The evidence of Mrs McAlister was admissible and should not have been excluded. Appeal Ground 1 has been established. The Crown contended that the exclusion of this evidence had no practical effect. She had not denied writing the words in question and Mrs McAlister was relying on what she had seen (or claimed to have seen about 16 years previously). The matter had a reasonably prominent place at the trial. After dealing with the Crown case and giving a number of directions of law, the judge told the jury the substance of the defence case: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The accused says that none of the nine alleged acts of sexual intercourse ever took place and that the complainant was simply lying to you. He says, however, that two other acts of sexual intercourse, not alleged in the crown case, did occur, one in the stables and one in the toilet. He says that you should accept him as an honest witness, but not the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        He says, in particular, that you should pay careful attention to the complainant’s admission in evidence that although she could not recall it, it was possible that there may have been an entry by her in an old exercise book that ‘Shane is a spunk. I wouldn’t mind being screwed by him’. 
        
       
       
        
        No such exercise book was ever produced at the trial, so you have not been able to look at it for yourselves. The complainant said she did not know the whereabouts of any such book and, probably, no criticism can be made of that. I think there was evidence that no-one knew where it was any more. The complainant said in cross-examination that she did not remember writing that. She did say that she probably regarded the accused as a spunk at the time when she got her horse. She was given the horse by her mother in 1981 or 1982. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused said that both of those admitted sexual encounters were with the complainant’s consent.” 
        
       
      
    58    The judge referred to the entry in the exercise book and the evidence as to it later in the summing up when he was summarising the appellant’s arguments. The point was clearly made. 
     
      
    59    It is not often that an accused contends that none of the alleged acts of intercourse happened and that anything which did happen was with the accused’s consent. The jury may not have found such an approach easy to accept, especially if they thought the appellant’s version of what happened in the bathroom was incorrect and that C’s version was correct and was the subject of count 8. It is not possible to say that the evidence of Mrs McAlister may not have affected one or some of the verdicts of sexual assault without consent 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 2:  
       
       
        
        The judge erred in excluding evidence as to C’s demeanour and behaviour towards the appellant and attitude towards coming into proximity with him. 
        
       
      
    60    This complaint applies to the exclusion of the evidence of Mrs L Cotter that C never appeared to be scared or uneasy at the ranch and that of Mrs S Smith. She said that C had very strong objections if there was no one to take her to the ranch, causing a scene over it. She wanted to go to the ranch. Mrs Smith was present at the ranch on many occasions with C. Mrs Smith also saw the appellant there. He was always around. C never expressed any unease about going to the ranch or being in the appellant’s presence. Mrs Smith never observed any actions or conduct by C which would be consistent with her being ill at ease at the ranch. 
     
      
    61    Counsel for the appellant at the trial submitted to the judge that as a result of C’s evidence there was an issue about whether C felt uneasy at the ranch. In his reasons the judge recorded that counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence of Mrs Cotter went to the surrounding circumstances relevant to whether C consented to sexual intercourse and whether C was molested by the appellant. The judge held that the evidence of Mrs Cotter “really went to credit and that pursuant to the collateral evidence rule it was inadmissible. … it was calling evidence to rebut what was the evidence of the complainant as to matters relevant to her credit.” The judge continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “…In terms of the new Evidence Act that evidence is excluded by me on the basis that it was not substantially probative in terms of Section 103 of the Evidence Act. In terms of the new Evidence Act that is also the basis on which evidence of the contents of the exercise book style diary which was referred to in cross-examination of the complainant was excluded insofar as Mrs McAlister sought to deal with that subject in examination in chief on behalf of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In any event, how can the witness Mrs Cotter give any evidence of observations relevant to whether or not the complainant consented to sexual intercourse with the accused and to what sexual intercourse, since he, the accused, denies that any sexual intercourse at all occurred as alleged by the complainant? On the accused’s case consent is irrelevant. 
        
       
       
        
        Insofar as the accused’s admitted different and separate two acts of sexual intercourse are concerned, they have not been charged by the crown and are therefore irrelevant to proof of the crown case. Quite apart from that, again, how can the evidence of this witness, Mrs Cotter, of how the complainant appeared to her, in general terms, when the complainant was at the ranch and the witness was close enough to observe her be probative of whether or not, on other occasions, when the witness was not there, the complainant consented to sexual intercourse or was or was not otherwise molested by the accused? 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion the proposed evidence is too remote to have probative value and is therefore irrelevant and inadmissible in terms of Sections 55 and 56 of the Evidence Act. Those, then, are the reasons why the subject evidence has been excluded.” 
        
       
      
    62    I am unable to agree with the judge that C’s consent was irrelevant. Her lack of consent is an essential element to be proved on a charge of sexual assault without consent. It is unusual for an accused to raise the issue of no intercourse and assert that in any event all that happened was done with her consent but he is entitled to do so. I also disagree with the judge that the evidence did not bear upon the issues of consent and sexual molestation. Its weight was another matter. C’s evidence revealed her returning to the ranch despite the unwelcome acts of sexual molestation. The appellant was entitled to submit to the jury that she would not have gone to the ranch if the appellant’s attentions and activities towards her were unwelcome. 
     
      
    63    The judge ruled that the whole of the proposed evidence of Mrs S Smith was inadmissible. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It also has been tendered so far only on the voir dire on the basis that it is relevant to surrounding circumstances constituted by this proposed witness’s observations of her sister as going to the issue of consent and/or whether the accused molested the complainant on any of the occasions as alleged under the nine counts in the indictment. In my opinion, the proposed evidence cannot rationally affect those issues in the context of this trial - it is too remote and too general and therefore is not admissible in terms of Sections 56 and 55 of the Evidence Act.”  
        
       
      
    64    I am unable to agree with these reasons. The Crown case was that C was being sexually assaulted quite frequently. Evidence that C never appeared scared or uneasy would be relevant to the issue of consent and whether the incidents happened. Mrs Smith, who was 2 years younger than C, was aged 12 in 1983. It is not surprising that she noticed no uneasiness in C and that C did not tell her what was allegedly happening. Nevertheless, this is a matter for the jury to assess.  
     
      
    65    As the evidence of Mrs Cotter and Mrs Smith was capable of bearing upon the issue of lack of consent and whether the incidents happened such evidence was admissible. Appeal Ground 2 has been established. On its own the exclusion of this evidence would not warrant upholding the appeal. By way of contrast, the evidence of the mother that the appellant had a look of wanting was admitted. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 3: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in leaving the alternative verdicts of carnal knowledge to the jury. 
        
       
      
    66    The judge left such alternative verdicts as to counts 6 to 9 each of which involved penile vaginal intercourse. The appellant contended that the alternative verdicts of carnal knowledge were precluded by s. 78 of the Crimes Act 1900 which was in these terms between 14 July 1981 and 23 March 1986: 
     
      
       
        
        “78. No prosecution in respect of any offence under section 61E (1), 71 or 72 or under section 76 as in force at any time before the commencement of Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981, shall if the person upon whom the offence is alleged to have been committed was at the time of the alleged offence over the age of fourteen years and under the age of sixteen years, be commenced after the expiration of twelve months from the time of the alleged offence.” 
        
       
      
    67    Section 61E(1) dealt with indecent assaults and acts of indecency. Section 71 dealt with unlawfully and carnally knowing a girl of or above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and s.72 with attempts to carnally know such a girl. 
     
      
    68    Section 78 was amended and was in these terms from 23 March 1986 to 3 May 1992: 
     
      
       
        
        “78. No prosecution in respect of any offence under s. 61E (1), 66C (1), 66D, 71, 72 or 76 shall if the person upon whom the offence is alleged to have been committed was at the time of the alleged offence over the age of fourteen years and under the age of sixteen years, be commenced after the expiration of twelve months from the time of the alleged offence.” 
        
       
       
      Section 61E (1) dealt with indecent assaults and acts of indecency, s.66C (1) with a person having sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16 and s.66D with attempting, or assaulting with intent, to have sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 16. Sections 71 and 72, which were mentioned earlier, were repealed from 23 March 1986. Section 76 dealt with indecent assaults upon females. 
       
      
    69    Effectively sections 66C (1) and 66D replaced ss 71 and 72. Consent was no defence to charges under ss.66C(1) and 66D - see s.77. Section 78 was intended to apply to prosecutions for offences under the repealed ss. 71 and 72 and the replacement (but enlarged) ss 66C (1) and 66D. 
     
      
    70    Section 78 was repealed as from 3 May 1992. Sections 66C and 66D remain. 
     
      
    71    Counts 6 to 9 were laid under s.61D (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Between 17 July 1981 and 23 March 1986 that sub-section read: 
     
      
       
        
        “61D (1). Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse shall be liable to penal servitude for 7 years or, if the other person is under the age of 16 years to penal servitude for 10 years.” 
        
       
       
      That sub-section remained in those terms between 23 March 1986 and 21 February 1988. As from the latter date it remained in those terms except that 8 years was substituted for 7 years. Section 61D was repealed as from 17 March 1991. 
       
      
    72    Between 17 July 1981 and 23 March 1986 s.61G(2) read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where on the trial of a person for an offence under section 61D the jury is satisfied that the person upon whom the offence was alleged to have been committed was a girl under the age of 16 years but above the age of 10 years, and that the accused had carnal knowledge of her but is not satisfied that carnal knowledge was had without her consent, it may find the accused not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of an offence under section 71 and the accused shall be liable to punishment accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    73    From 23 March 1986 until the repeal of s.61G on 17 March 1991, s.S61G(2) remained in substantially the same terms with the addition that it applied to offences committed under s.61D up to 23 March 1986. As from 23 March 1986 a new s.61G(2A) applied to offences committed under s.61D(1) after that date. Section 61G(2A) was in substantially the same terms as s.61(2) except that the jury was entitled to find the accused guilty of an offence under s.66C(1). By that time s.71 had been repealed. 
     
      
    74    The appellant submitted that from 1981 until 1992 prosecutions for carnal knowledge when the girl was between 14 and 16 years had to be commenced within 12 months from the time of the alleged offence. Indeed, in its references to s.66D, s 78 had an even wider operation. It was submitted that s.61G had to be read subject to s.78 otherwise defendants could be convicted of carnal knowledge even though no prosecution for that offence had been commenced within 12 months of its commission.. 
     
      
    75    The difficulty with this submission is that s.61G(2) specifically entitles a jury to bring in a verdict of carnal knowledge where it is not satisfied that carnal knowledge was had without her consent. There is no reference to any time limit or to s.78. The prosecution was for offences under s.61(D) (1) to which s.78 does not apply. In such a prosecution the alternative verdict of carnal knowledge is available by virtue of s.61G (2). 
     
      
    76    Appeal Ground 3 fails. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 4: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in the summing up to the jury on evidence of “complaint” 
        
       
      
    77    I have earlier set out the evidence of complaint being remarks made by C to Joanna Cotter and the alleged conversation as to the pregnancy. C gave evidence of these but Ms J Cotter did not recall them. At the trial the appellant’s counsel submitted that the evidence of C as to what she had said to Ms J Cotter was not evidence of complaint. 
     
      
    78    The judge gave these directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “You may choose to regard the complainant’s evidence that she told her friend, Joanna Cotter, that she thought that something was going on between herself and the accused as evidence of complaint about what she has alleged the accused had been doing to her. Mr Heazlewood on behalf of the accused urges you not to regard that statement, if you believe it occurred, as a complaint. Well, that is a matter for your evaluation ladies and gentlemen, but I do need to give you an important direction of law about complaint evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        First of all, you may or may not believe that the complainant did tell her friend Joanna Cotter that she thought that something was going on between the accused and herself. That is a question of fact. Accordingly, it is a question for you yourselves to decide. 
        
       
       
        
        If you believe the evidence of the complainant that she told Joanna Cotter in late August or early September 1984 that she thought that there was something going on between the accused and herself, and shortly afterwards, that she was pregnant, and that Joanna Cotter advised her to tell the accused, you may, depending on what you yourselves think about the matter, regard that as evidence of complaint by the complainant against the accused. It is entirely a matter for you. 
        
       
       
        
        However, you cannot regard that evidence as establishing the truth of the complainant’s out of court suggestion that something was going on between herself and the accused [it] goes to her credit, not the truth of what she is saying. The fact that the complaint, if you choose to regard it as a complaint, was made is not, by itself, any evidence that the complainant was sexually interfered with by the accused without the complainant’s consent. 
        
       
       
        
        The relevance of that evidence, if you accept it and accept it as a complaint, is simply the fact that the complaint was made. That may assist you in determining the weight which you give to the complainant’s evidence here in court as to the nine incidents of sexual assault which she has alleged against the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        In other words, evidence of complaint does not go to the truth of the matter complained of, but to the general credit of the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        So if you accept the evidence of what the complainant told you that she said to Joanna Cotter as a complaint against the accused, that may assist you in your ultimate task of deciding the case because, the crown says, such complaint shows a consistency of conduct by the complainant.” 
        
       
      
    79    The judge next summarised the arguments of the Crown and the accused. After noting Ms Cotter had no memory of the “complaint” and that the appellant said that what was said did not even amount to complaints the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused goes further and says that in reality there was an absence of complaint by the complainant to persons whom she might reasonably have been expected to complain and that this is inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person who has been sexually assaulted as alleged in this case. The accused says that you should therefore regard the complainant’s evidence that he sexually assaulted her as she has alleged as untrue.” 
        
       
      
    80    The appellant submitted that he had admitted that he had had sexual intercourse with C and that the two issues were firstly, the number of acts of intercourse and when they occurred and, secondly, whether they were sexual assaults rather than consensual acts. The appellant submitted that what C said to Ms Cotter could not bear on either issue as she did not hint that there had been non-consensual activity. Not surprisingly C spoke in guarded rather than direct terms. What she indicated was a degree of sexual activity and intercourse. The appellant tried to distinguish between the acts of sexual intercourse which she alleged and he denied and other and different acts of intercourse which he admitted. The appellant complained that the Crown argued and the judge permitted the jury to reason that the evidence could support C’s allegations that she had been sexually assaulted. Much depended on what the jury thought C was conveying. At the very least she was conveying that sexual intercourse had occurred and that all was not well in her relationship with the appellant. The jury was left in no doubt by the judge that the Crown case depended on her evidence and her credibility and that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that C’s version of what happened was true before they could find the appellant guilty. The jury were directed to consider C’s evidence with special care. The extended consideration which the jury gave this case over 4 days indicates that they did just that. I appreciate that where the only witness as to a complaint is the complainant herself there is a strong element of “bootstrap” reasoning. It is not the law that a third person must give evidence of the complaint. Of course, it is usually very much better if that happens. 
     
      
    81    Reading the summing up as a whole, no miscarriage of justice has occurred on this ground. I reject this challenge to the summing up. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 5: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in the summing up to the jury on delay in complaint. 
        
       
      
    82    Specifically the appellant complains that the judge did not deal with the effect of delay in complaint upon him. The judge gave the conventional direction that absence of or delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complainant is untrue. The judge marshalled and set out the reasons given by her for going back to the ranch and not telling anyone about the sexual assaults. 
     
      
    83    The only reference by the judge to the effect of the delay upon the appellant was contained in the judge’s summary of the points made by the appellant’s counsel, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) He submitted that the time lapse between 1983/1984 and September 1996 when the police became involved in the matter has resulted in such a time gap - twelve to thirteen years - that the accused has necessarily had difficulties in meeting her allegations. Mr Heazlewood argued on behalf of the accused that the delay has deprived the accused of the chance of telling you what were his movements on particular days.” 
        
       
      
    84    The appellant’s counsel at the trial asked the judge to give the appropriate directions as to the effect of the delay on the accused and referred the judge to the relevant authorities. The judge did not give the directions sought and gave no reasons for not following the authorities. 
     
      
    85    The appellant submitted that one example of the prejudice caused to the appellant by the delay was that the Crown Prosecutor relied in part on the absence of “critical detail” in his evidence as making it less credible (SU 24.2). The judge said in summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “Do not overlook the force of detail. In evaluating and weighing up facts it is often useful to consider whether matters of detail in description of critical matters properly add up and hang together, and even whether sufficient detail has been given to you. You may be less impressed where matters of detail have not been provided to you.” 
        
       
      
    86    It is not necessary to traverse all the authorities. They have been collected and discussed by Spigelman CJ in R v. Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362. In the present case what was required from the judge was a direction that the delay in complaint of 12 years or 13 years occasioned acute difficulties for the appellant in the conduct of his defence. After such a long period it would be impossible for him to identify who was at the ranch on a particular day and at the time of the offence alleged and obtain evidence that nothing untoward happened. Some of the incidents were alleged to have happened in sheds which were open in the front and to which patrons agisting horses had access. Further, the appellant, after such a long period, could not remember his movements on particular days and what happened. The appellant was deprived of the opportunity because of the lapse of such a long period of being able to support his evidence with adequate details and witnesses. The jury should have been warned that they must bear in mind that the appellant would experience great difficulty in defending himself and may not be able to adequately defend himself by reason of the delay and that accordingly they must examine and scrutinise C’s evidence closely and carefully. Often in court cases one story is good until another is able to be told. 
     
      
    87    The giving of a warning was important in the present case when there were a large number of acts relied upon and the appellant admitted other acts and the judge had emphasised the force of detail. The difficulties which an accused has in a case like this in mounting an adequate and detailed defence are considerable and are matters which would not be readily apparent to lay persons unless pointed out and sufficiently explained. The failure to give the requisite direction when there had been such a long delay amounted to a serious deficiency in the summing up. This ground of appeal has been established. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 6: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in summing up in relation to the evidence of the complainant that Jo Cotter had told her that the “same things” were occurring between the appellant and Ms Cotter as between the appellant and the complainant. 
        
       
      
    88    Leave is required to argue this point as it was not taken at the trial. Counsel for the appellant stated that this ground was advanced on the basis that the judge was in error in leaving that evidence to the jury as capable of supporting the credibility of the complainant. 
     
      
    89    The appellant relied on Ms J Cotter stating that nothing ever “happened” between her and the appellant and that she never said to C that something had. He submitted that in these circumstances it was not permissible to direct the jury that they were entitled to accept C’s evidence that Ms Cotter referred to sexual activity between her and the appellant. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This direction also relates to evidence, if you accept it, by the complainant that her friend Jo Cotter said that she also thought that something was going on between herself and the accused. When Miss Cotter gave evidence, she denied that that was so. It is a matter for you whether you believe the complainant’s evidence on that point. Even if you do, that evidence would not be capable of substitution for the evidence relating to the nine specific incidents, so you have really got to zero in on the - focus on the - nine alleged incidents that have been specifically charged.”  
        
       
      
    90    The appellant submitted that in the context of the previous directions the jury would have understood the judge to be directing them that they could accept C’s evidence and conclude as against the appellant that there was sexual activity between Ms Cotter and the appellant. Such a line of reasoning was in direct breach of the hearsay rule, and the jury should have been told that such reasoning was prohibited. Thus the jury should have been told that there was no evidence of Ms J Cotter and the appellant engaging in sexual activity and that the evidence in question could not be used for that purpose. 
     
      
    91    The appellant further submitted that while the jury were directed that they could not substitute that alleged sexual activity with Ms J Cotter, the judge had earlier directed them that the evidence could be used on matters of credit. Thus, it was contended, the jury would have understood that they were entitled to use evidence that the appellant engaged in sexual activity with Ms J Cotter to assist in deciding whether they believed C’s evidence that she was sexually assaulted by the appellant over two years. This does not follow. There is a distinction between the evidence of C’s complaint of the appellant having sexual intercourse with her and touching her and her evidence that Ms J Cotter had stated that she and the appellant had engaged or were engaging in sexual activity. The latter matter was allegedly given as part of the response of Ms J Cotter to C’s complaint and formed part of the relevant conversation.  
     
      
    92    The Crown pointed out that the judge had reminded the jury that Ms J Cotter had denied that anything had occurred between her and the appellant. It contended that this direction was not an instruction that the jury could use this alleged prior representation by Ms J Cotter as evidence that the appellant had engaged in sexual activity with Ms J Cotter and was therefore some type of proof that he had engaged in the sexual activity alleged by C.  
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    93    In reply the appellant submitted that given the operation of the hearsay rule the judge was required to direct the jury positively that they could not use C’s evidence of Ms Cotter’s statement that “the same things were happening” to her as evidence against the appellant that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with Ms J Cotter. The difficulty with the summing up is that the judge did not give the jury such a direction or instruct the jury as to how that piece of evidence could or could not be used. The jury were, of course, told that they had to decide whether they accepted C’s evidence that Ms Cotter used such words. That highlights the problems and the lack of adequate instruction. We do not know how the jury dealt with this evidence. They may not have accepted C’s evidence on the point. They may have accepted it and treated it as part of the complaint evidence or it may have been regarded as of no importance. They were not told that it could not be used as evidence against the appellant of sexual activity between him and Ms J Cotter. 
     
      
    94    This evidence was in breach of the hearsay rule. Even if it did fall within the exception to the hearsay rule in s. 66 (2) of the Evidence Act 1995, which is arguable, its use should have been limited under s. 136 of that Act and the jury instructed that it was not evidence of the truth of the assertions contained in it against the appellant but simply evidence of a response to the complaint. In the circumstances of this case where Ms J Cotter, in effect, denied the statement attributed to her, and both she and the appellant denied that there had been any sexual activity between them it would have been unfair for the statement attributed by C to Ms J Cotter as to such activity to have been used against him to establish that fact. Further, it is difficult to see the relevance of consensual conduct between the appellant and Miss J Cotter. This is especially true when it is denied. 
     
      
    95    At T5, lines 48 - et seq - T6, line 1 of 26 October 1998 the judge stated what he proposed to do in his summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would then deal with the complaint evidence or lack of complaint evidence … 
         
        and give usual warnings about absence or delay in making complaint, then I would repeat the warning about the limited use of (sic) relevance of other uncharged acts, so that relates to background and context and incidentally that also relates to the statement, if the jury were to believe it, that Ms Cotter said … there’d also been something going on between the accused and her. That’s only according to the complainant’s evidence. Ms Cotter denied it but as the matter’s been touched on in evidence, I think it should be subject of the warning.” 
        
       
      
    96    Counsel did not submit to the judge that he was in error or ask for any further directions. That would have been the appropriate time for any submissions to be made. 
     
      
    97    As has been demonstrated it is hard to gauge the effect of the evidence in question upon the jury. It was treated by the judge as background material. However, it was quite different from background material involving C and the appellant. The jury were told that the evidence was not capable of being in substitution for the evidence relating to nine specific incidents on which they were directed to focus. Counsel was not troubled by the summing up on this issue and did not seek any further direction. This suggests that the matter was not treated as an important one at the trial. While the ground has been made out it is not one which alone would warrant a new trial. It will need to be considered with other matters.  
     
      
    98    As to appeal grounds 5 and 6, the judge appears to have dealt with the question of complaint as though the common law principles were applicable, namely, that the facts contained therein were not admissible as evidence of the truth of what was asserted. The judge proceeded on the limited basis which he specified. Since the summing up the decision of the High Court in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 73 ALJR 1274 has been delivered. That would seem to require a different approach and suggests that the approach taken by the judge on complaint evidence may have been too favourable to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 7: 
       
       
        
        The judge erred in the summing up in failing to direct the jury that they must not engage in tendency reasoning from 
        
       
       
        
        (a) admitted acts of carnal knowledge involving the appellant and the complainant; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) proved acts of carnal knowledge involving the appellant and the complainant; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) proved sexual activity (other than that charged) involving the appellant and the complainant; or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) sexual activity between the appellant and J Cotter 
        
       
      
    99    The Crown did not rely on any of this evidence as tendency evidence (T12, line 55, 19.10.98). The appellant accepted that the judge gave adequate directions when evidence of “relationship” was admitted, that is, evidence of sexual activity other than that charged. The judge explained (T22-23, 19.10.98) to the jury that the wider sexual history was admitted to avoid artificiality or unreality arising from acts seeming to be isolated. The judge told the jury that the Crown had to prove the particular acts covered by the counts in the Indictment beyond reasonable doubt. The judge also directed the jury that “they must not reason on the basis well the accused may have done some things wrong on other occasions relating to this young lady and therefore you will convict on these particular charged acts.”  
     
      
    100    The appellant complained that the judge did not repeat the directions which he had given at an early stage of the trial in his summing up. However, in his summing up the judge referred back to them. He said (SU 30): 
     
      
       
        
        “… I now want to touch on something which I had mentioned earlier in the trial when evidence was given about other acts of sexual interference, most of it, I think from memory, of a much lesser significance than the nine acts charged. 
        
       
       
        
        You remember I told you that that was being allowed into evidence in the crown case on the basis that it was background or contextual matter only for the purpose of giving some explanation as to how the relationship between the accused and the complainant developed over the two years that was the subject of the charges. I informed you, and now repeat, that you should not substitute other acts of sexual interference, if you believe they occurred, for the ones which have been charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Your job is to focus on the nine alleged incidents that have been charged. They are the ones that you have to consider for the purpose of your verdict and you should not substitute evidence of other matters for those and that includes the two admitted acts alleged by the accused, if you do believe that they were separate and different from the nine that have been charged.” 
        
       
       
      That was more than adequate in the light of the earlier directions. It would have reminded the jury of the earlier fuller directions. 
       
      
    101    The appellant complained that the directions did not forbid the jury from reasoning as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the appellant engaged in sexual activity with a young girl in 1984, i.e. C, when as he admitted, he engaged in sexual intercourse with her; or Ms Cotter, if C’s account was relied upon 
        
       
       
        
        (b) therefore, he had a tendency to engage in sexual activity with young girls; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) therefore, we would more readily believe C’s account that he engaged in sexual activity with her in 1983. 
        
       
      
    102    The appellant contended that where evidence of the kind in question was admitted for some purpose other than to support tendency reasoning it is mandatory for a judge to direct the jury that they cannot use it for tendency reasoning. Counsel submitted that there was every danger of the jury so using it in the present case. 
     
      
    103    The Crown contended that it was not the task of the judge to direct the jury how they could not use various pieces of evidence but rather how they could use the admitted acts and proved uncharged acts. It was submitted that the judge gave clear, concise and correct directions as to the relationship and background use which could be made of the evidence of uncharged acts (either admitted or alleged). Further the judge directed that this type of evidence only went to credit and could not be used in substitution for the specific charges. 
     
      
    104    On occasions it is necessary to warn the jury not to engage in forbidden reasoning, for example, tendency reasoning. In the present case, the Crown only relied on the evidence in question by way of relationship and background. It did not rely on it to establish guilty passion or tendency. The evidence led was mainly concerned with the nine alleged incidents. The evidence of other uncharged acts which were not admitted was small in amount, compass and significance. The appellant admitted other uncharged acts. 
     
      
    105    Having regard to the directions which the judge gave and which have earlier been referred to and the burden and thrust of the evidence this was not a case in which there was a danger of the jury engaging in forbidden tendency reasoning. The jury received explicit instructions that they were to focus on the nine incidents and counts and were not to substitute any conclusions which they reached on the uncharged acts. This point was not taken at the trial and leave to rely upon it should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 8: 
       
       
        
        The summing up did not fairly put the defence case 
        
       
      
    106    As earlier remarked this case was unusual in that the appellant denied that all the charged incidents occurred but admitted two other incidents. It was also the defence case that all the sexual activity between C and the appellant was consensual (in the sense that she acted in a way which tended to manifest consent). To support his case on the latter issue the appellant relied, amongst other things, upon the delay in complaint, the alleged entry in the “diary” (exercise book) and C continuing to frequent the ranch in 1983-84. 
     
      
    107    It was submitted that it was wrong for the judge to suggest to the jury that the defence was “all or nothing”. In his opening remarks (T5 19.10.98) the judge said “you have to bring in a verdict on each one of the nine counts, it does not have to be all or nothing … 
     
      
      You might find the accused guilty on some, not guilty on others.” In his summing up the judge told the jury that they had to consider each count separately and give a verdict in relation to each one. He re-iterated that the verdicts on the various counts may be different. 
       
      
    108    The judge reminded the jury that the appellant had put C’s credit in issue in relation to all nine counts. The judge told the jury (SU 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the accused’s response to the Crown case is not to take issue with whether, technically, the essential elements of the alleged offences have been proved. He simply says that none of them ever happened. So it is not necessary to go into the technical matters of what the essential elements are because he simply denies that any of these nine events occurred anyway. On that approach it would not be relevant for him to question whether or not in respect of any of the nine events alleged by the crown what happened amounted to sexual intercourse or whether or not the complainant consented because he says, and says on oath, that none of the nine alleged events ever occurred” 
        
       
      
    109    The judge had previously explained the elements of the offences charged and the alternative offences of carnal knowledge. I have earlier referred to part of the judge’s summary of the defence case. The judge referred to the appellant’s admission of two incidents and his assertion that they had taken place with C’s consent. 
     
      
    110    The appellant complained of this passage at SU 24 in the summing up where the judge reminded the jury of this argument of the Crown, being one of four matters emphasised by the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) The accused does not really take issue with proof of the essential elements of the offence which has been alleged nine times in the indictment. He simply says that none of them ever happened. The Crown says that therefore if you accept that the alleged nine events occurred you might be more easily able to accept the complainant’s evidence that on none of the nine occasions did she consent.” 
        
       
      
    111    That was an unfortunate way to put the matter. If the defence is that the incident did not happen that puts in issue all of the elements of the offence. It was also erroneous to suggest to the jury that if they thought the incidents did occur they might be more easily able to accept C’s evidence that on none of the nine occasions did she consent. That argument should have been corrected by the judge. The judge’s earlier statement previously quoted was also unfortunate in that it did not adequately put the position having regard to the appellant’s defences. 
     
      
    112    In his final address counsel for the appellant raised the issue of lack of consent and the appellant’s lack of knowledge. He told the jury as to counts 1 to 5 that if they were satisfied that something happened but she consented it was their duty to acquit the accused. He pointed out that if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was consensual penile vaginal intercourse they could convict of carnal knowledge on counts 6 to 9. Counsel for the appellant put to the jury that the inordinate and inexplicable delay destroyed any notion of unwanted sexual intercourse. Counsel suggested that after a delay of 12 or 13 years in going to the police there had been an escalation in memory and flashbacks leading her to assert that there had been unwanted sexual intercourse. Counsel emphasised that she was crying out for love, that she thought that he cared and that she kept going back to the ranch. She tried to please him. He also emphasised the entry she made in the exercise book. Counsel submitted that time had distorted her memory and that this was a case of a married woman with hindsight who, not having overcome the termination of her pregnancy, was trying to make good her teenage years.  
     
      
    113    While the summing up made clear to the jury that the appellant denied that any of the incidents occurred it did not put his alternate defence that there was no unwanted sexual intercourse on her part and the arguments in support of that defence. Counsel for the appellant trod a fine line in his address. At the conclusion of the summing up counsel for the defendant protested that it was unbalanced and had not properly put the defence case. This was a case where it was probable that the jury would be satisfied that the incidents or at least most of them occurred and that the real issue was likely to be her consent and whether he knew that she was not consenting. 
     
      
    114    On the first day of their deliberations the jury asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Does the phrase ‘knowing that she was not consenting’ mean that she had to resist in some manner? Please re-define ‘reckless consent’.” 
        
       
       
      The judge, after repeating the question, said at SU 7-9 on 27 October 1998: 
       
        
        “The answer to the question “Does the phrase ‘knowing she was not consenting’ mean that she had to resist in some manner?’, the answer to that is “no”, with this qualification, however - the accused had to know that she was not consenting. Physical resistance is not the only way to indicate non-consent . It could be by saying, “No, no, no”, as the evidence was. It might be indicated by she said she “froze”. I mean that is a question of fact for you whether she was consenting or not. I think too, certainly one I can recall of the events, she said she simply “froze”. She said she thought she “had no choice” in the matter. In one I recall she said that she tried to “back off” towards the kitchen but was held too firmly and could not. So that the “knowing that she was not consenting” is really a question of fact for you to decide but it does not necessarily mean physical resistance. That is the way in which non-consent is typically shown but it does not have to be the only way. 
        
       
       
        
        I think I will tell you how I defined those elements yesterday. “Without the complainant’s consent” means without her conscious and voluntary permission or agreement. So “without her consent”, and this is question of fact for you, without her conscious and voluntary permission or agreement, and I said “Thus a girl who submits to sexual intercourse as a result of terror is not regarded as consenting to it because that is not a conscious and voluntary permission or agreement.” Now that is as to consent. 
        
       
       
        
        Then the question as to whether the accused knew that she was consenting, that is the next essential element, that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent. I said to you that this is typically, but I add today, not necessarily, but the typical way in which it is shown is by evidence of clearly demonstrated resistance. That is because you might reason that if there was clearly demonstrated resistance the accused must have known that she did not consent because it must have been obvious to him. Recklessness goes to knowledge and what I said to you was that the accused is deemed to know that she did not consent if he was reckless as to whether she consented, and that means if he did not care one way or the other whether she consented but realised that she might not be consenting. So I think that is the answer. 
         
         
        You may recall that it was pointed out to you that in a sense no issue was taken about the consent for the reason that the accused’s defence was “Well none of these nine events ever happened.” So he really did not get into the question of whether or not she consented, or whether or not he knew she was not consenting, because to do that would be inconsistent with a defence of saying “Well these events never happened.” The thrust of his defence really was, “Well none of these things ever happened.” So he really did not get into the nitty-gritty of debating those particular two points - the consent, and for that reason it was an all or nothing approach he had, “Well these acts of sexual intercourse just never occurred.” He went on and he said, “But two others did.”, but they are a bit of a red herring in the sense that you are not concerned with those, you are only concerned with the nine that are charged. So that is it.” 
        
       
       
      The judge then reminded the jury that they could return the alternate verdicts of carnal knowledge on counts 6 to 9 if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual intercourse was without consent. 
       
      
    115    Unfortunately, when these directions were given Heazlewood of counsel was not present, having retired to his chambers and his solicitor was left to deal with the matter. Although given the opportunity she was not able to make useful submissions. The following morning, after she had been in contact with counsel, she asked the judge for some re-directions. She handed up some re-directions prepared by counsel. Unfortunately, there is no copy of these draft re-directions. It was obvious that she was in difficulty and out of her depth. 
     
      
    116    In giving his further directions the judge did not seem to appreciate that the jury may regard the real issue as one of lack of consent and the appellant not knowing that she was not consenting.  
     
      
    117    In respect of the passage quoted above the appellant complained that that part commencing from the words “you may recall” to the end confused the account of the appellant in the witness box and the defence case. That case depended not only on the appellant’s evidence but also on the material obtained in examination and cross examination of C and the other witnesses. 
     
      
    118    In view of his primary defence the appellant did not and could hardly say anything about consent or knowledge of consent. That did not mean that the defence case was “all or nothing” as the judge suggested. The effect of what the judge said at the conclusion of the passage quoted was to downplay if not virtually eliminate the issue of consent. There were substantial arguments available to the appellant on the consent issue including the large amount of alleged sexual activity for well over a year, the continued return to the ranch and her continued association with the appellant, her desire to please him, her failure to complain to her mother or godmother, (and, on the appellant’s case, to anyone), her long delay in going to the police, her age of 14 and 15 years, her general intelligence and strong-willed nature. The appellant submitted that C’s accounts of the various incidents raised in the starkest terms the issue of whether the appellant realised that C was not consenting. 
     
      
    119    The judge’s direction that this was an “all or nothing” case was wrong. The summing up did not adequately put the appellant’s case and was therefore unfair. The judge’s response to the jury’s questions compounded the problem. Objection was taken to the lack of balance in the summing up. The defects exposed are of a fundamental nature. This ground has been established. 
     
      
    120    However, there is one further matter which requires attention. The jury by their verdicts on counts 7 and 9 of not guilty of sexual assault without consent but guilty of carnal knowledge has shown that they were very much alive to the issue of consent and lack of knowledge that she was not consenting. These verdicts show that having been instructed that lack of consent and knowledge that she was not consenting were essential elements the jury applied that instruction and did not attach much weight to the judge’s instruction that as the defence was that the incidents did not happen, lack of consent and knowledge that she was not consenting were inconsistent with such a defence and did not really arise. Accordingly, while the ground has been established it matters nought having regard to the way in which the jury dealt with the matter. 
     
      
    121    It is part of counsel’s duty to remain for the summing up and while the jury is deliberating in case there are questions. Sometimes, the questions are important and require directions which may have a significant bearing on how the case is decided. If counsel had remained in the present case he may have been able to persuade the judge to correct the directions which he gave.  
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 9: 
       
       
        
        A miscarriage of justice arose from the failure of defence counsel to obtain a ruling from the judge as to whether evidence of the appellant’s prior conviction would be admissible in the event that the defence adduced evidence of good character in a particular respect 
        
       
      
    122    The appellant was able to call substantial evidence of good character. However, he had been convicted in November 1979 of conspiracy to cheat and defraud, placed on a good behaviour bond for three years and fined $500. At that time the appellant was aged 20 years. Counsel for the appellant did not seek a ruling from the judge that the Crown would not be entitled to adduce evidence as to the conviction as he was entitled to do: R v. PKS, CCA, unreported, 1 October 1998. 
     
      
    123    Mr Heazlewood of counsel has stated in his affidavit of 9 August 1999 
     
      
       
        
        “5. I chose not to pursue the issue of good character because 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) I was concerned that the 1979 conviction for dishonesty would then be placed before the jury by the Crown and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the appellant conceded that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant at a time when she was under sixteen years of age. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        6. At the time of the trial I was unaware of the decision of Regina v. PKS, CCA, unreported, 1 October 1998.” 
        
       
       
      It is not surprising that counsel was unaware of that decision as the trial started 18 days later. 
       
      
    124    The appellant faced two difficulties. He was dealt with for the dishonesty offence less than four years before the 1983 sexual assault offences and he had carnally known C, a girl under 16. If he sought to adduce evidence under s. 110(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 that he was generally a person of good character he was likely to be met by the conviction and his admitted sexual misconduct on two occasions. If he sought to establish that he was a person of good character in a particular respect, namely, he did not have intercourse with girls under 16, he would be met by his admitted sexual misconduct. If the particular respect was that he did not have sexual intercourse with girls under 16 without their consent that would be altogether too precious. I am far from persuaded that this was a case where counsel should have sought a ruling. On the appellant’s own evidence he had committed the offence of carnal knowledge and indecently assaulted C. 
     
      
    125    Even if I were wrong in the view I have expressed the failure alleged would not have warranted the grant of a new trial. The ground that counsel for the accused was incompetent is being raised too frequently and indiscriminately. Appellate counsel are now demanding standards of perfection from trial counsel. This is unrealistic. I have never seen a defence conducted without a mistake. In the present case, counsel for the appellant at the trial conducted his defence with reasonable skill and competence. The mistake suggested is not one which is sufficient to support the contention that there has been a miscarriage of justice. In view of the appellant’s admitted sexual misconduct this is not a case where character evidence was likely to be of any value. This ground of appeal is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 10: 
       
       
        
        The convictions are unreasonable and cannot be supported. 
        
       
      
    126    The appellant submitted that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant knew or even suspected that C was not consenting (assuming that she was not). There was no evidence that he ever said anything to reveal such a belief or suspicion nor did his conduct on her account support the existence of such a belief or suspicion. Further, the crown did not ask the appellant in cross examination whether he knew or suspected that C was not willing and not consenting. The latter point may be disposed of immediately. He could hardly be asked about her not consenting when he denied the incidents alleged ever happened. 
     
      
    127    There was ample evidence that she was not consenting and that he was so aware. She gave evidence of having frozen, of saying no, of pulling her head backwards and the appellant taking hold of her head and moving it back and forwards and compelling her to have oral intercourse, of being distressed and crying, of trying to close her knees and of him pushing them apart, of him pulling her jodhpurs down and holding her head and moving it backwards and forwards and telling her not to tell her mother. Further, he would not let her leave the house prior to the first bathroom incident. The circumstances of the second bathroom incident bespoke lack of consent and knowledge on his part that she was not consenting. 
     
      
    128    I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 11: 
       
       
        
        Evidence of the “look” on the appellant’s face was wrongly admitted. 
        
       
      
    129    The evidence was that of C’s mother and was that the appellant always seemed to be around the girls and “I used to see the look in his face when he looked at any of the girls.” When pressed for further detail she described it as “a look of wanting.” Objection was taken to the admission of this evidence. In R v. Harvey, CCA, unreported, 11 December 1996, this Court had to deal with the evidence of A, a fellow teacher, that 12 months prior to the offence charged as to T she saw Harvey sitting at a desk in the Asst. Principal’s office with the child T standing a couple of feet away, that A saw no activity by either but observed an expression on Harvey’s face which she described as “a look of like sexual gratification”. This Court held that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s. 78 of the Evidence Act 1995 but that it ought to be excluded on discretionary grounds under s. 137. The appellant contended that Harvey was wrongly decided in so far as it held that s. 78 (b) was complied with. I do not agree. 
     
      
    130    The evidence of the mother as to the look of wanting is opinion evidence. Section 76 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed ” 
        
       
      
    131    Section 78 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and 
           
           
          (b) evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event. 
          
         
        
       
      
    132    The appellant contended that s. 78 (b) had not been complied with as it was not necessary to have evidence of the mother’s opinion to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the mother’s perception. The mother’s opinion was based on what she saw. The appellant contended that the mother should have been required to give evidence of the primary facts upon which her opinion was based. The prosecution, by not eliciting these and otherwise, had not shown that evidence of the opinion was necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of what she had seen. 
     
      
    133    I am unable to agree. Most lay people and many lawyers would have difficulty in giving more detail. Indeed, “a looking of wanting” is a matter of impression and opinion. The test in s. 78(b) has been met. Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “In criminal proceedings the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    134    The appellant contended that the evidence in question was highly prejudicial but of minimal probative value. A “look” is transitory and so much depends on the subjective assessment of the observer. Mrs L Cotter had never seen such a look. The mother was giving evidence 14 years after the events in question. The delay is an important factor. Despite this “look” she had done nothing. The probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It should not have been admitted. 
     
      
    135    The jury commenced to consider their verdicts on Tuesday 27 October 1998 at 9.30am and did not return with their verdicts until 12.28pm on Friday 30 October 1998. During the course of their deliberations they asked a number of questions and had quite an amount of the evidence replayed, including the whole of the appellant’s evidence and some of C’s evidence. Shortly after the luncheon adjournment on Wednesday 28 October 1998 the jury advised that they were unable to reach an unanimous decision on any count. The judge gave the usual Black direction. The jury continued their deliberations with evidence being played back at their request. I mention these matters to illustrate that this was a case in which the jury had considerable difficulties in reaching a verdict. In the present case the evidence wrongly admitted and rejected may have had a bearing on whether unanimous verdicts were reached on some of the counts. 
     
      
    136    The defects in the trial, particularly in combination, do not permit the application of the proviso to s. 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 permitting dismissal of the appeal on the ground that there has been no miscarriage of justice despite errors as to counts 3, 4, 5 and 6. Counts 7, 8 and 9 require separate consideration. 
     
      
    137    As to the verdicts on counts 7 and 9 on which verdicts of carnal knowledge were returned, the evidence which was rejected which bore upon the consent issue would not be of consequence. This would apply to Appeal Grounds 1 and 2. Appeal Grounds 3 and 4 failed. However, Appeal Ground 5 (failure to warn of the defendant’s difficulties in defending himself) constituted a significant defect. Appeal Ground 6 is not of sufficient consequence. Appeal Ground 7 failed. Appeal Ground 8 does not apply because it was primarily directed to the consent issue. Appeal Grounds 9 and 10 failed. Appeal Ground 11 has some applications to counts 7 and 9 in that the evidence wrongly admitted formed part of the material pointing to the occurrence of frequent intercourse. With some reluctance, but particularly because Appeal Ground 5 has been established there must be a new trial on counts 7 and 9. 
     
      
    138    As to count 8, while there was some co-incidence between what C and the appellant said there were important differences as to exactly what happened. If the jury were of the view that they were speaking of the same incident the issue of consent was an important one and Appeal Grounds 1, 2, 6 and 9 would apply. Appeal Ground 5 was also important on the issue whether the incident happened as alleged by C. There must be a new trial on this count. 
     
      
    139    Since writing these reasons I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Simpson J. I do not disagree with her observations as to Grounds 1 and 11. As to Ground 4, counsel did not raise the point on which she has relied either at the trial or on appeal. It is a point which counsel and the judge will need to consider carefully on the new trial. I prefer not to express a concluded view in the absence of argument. 
     
      
    140    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal against convictions on counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 allowed; convictions quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A new trial of these counts be held.

     Regina v Nedjelko Bikic 
      
       
     No: 70204/99 
    Judgment: on application for a separate trial (ex-tempore)1     HIS HONOUR: Mr Bikic has made a further application for a separate trial, and after careful consideration, I have determined that it must be granted. 
     
      
       
      
    2     A number of grounds were advanced in support of the application. However, I consider only one of them to be of substance: that is, the ground that he anticipates that his co-accused would support his alibi and he would wish to have them available as witnesses at his trial. That was the only ground argued at the time of the initial application which I determined on 1 December 1999. At that stage, however, no alibi notice had been filed and it was by no means clear what the nature of Mr Bikic's defence would be and in what manner his co-accused might support it. Since then notice of alibi has been filed and this application has been pursued accordingly. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The material before me is to the effect that Mr Bikic would claim at his trial that he was not present at the scene of the shooting or, indeed, at other places earlier in that day when other relevant events are said to have occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    4     I am informed that four of his co-accused have made statements, the effect of which is that, while they were present at least at the time of the shootings, if not at the time of earlier events, Mr Bikic was not. Those four co-accused, as I have said, have provided statements which were presented to me for the purpose of this application in sealed envelopes. Senior counsel for Mr Bikic submitted that I should examine that material in the sealed envelopes to determine the genuineness of this application but that the Crown should either have no access to them or should have access on a limited basis only: that is, on the basis that the material could not be used in the course of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    5     I do not consider it appropriate to examine the material in the sealed envelopes on either of those bases. It seems to me that, if that material is to be relied upon, it must be available to the Crown for all purposes as any other material tendered would be. That said, however, I have the assurance from the Bar table of senior counsel representing Mr Bikic that those statements reveal that each of those four co-accused is prepared to give evidence for Mr Bikic in circumstances where he himself is not placed in jeopardy, and that that evidence would tend to support Mr Bikic's case. Obviously, what weight the evidence might have is a matter I am not in a position to determine and which need not be determined at this interlocutory stage. 
     
      
       
      
    6     I observed when I dealt with the original application for separate trials that it is curious that there appears to be no reported cases in Australia dealing with situations such as this. I am indebted to the research that the Crown Prosecutor has undertaken since I made that observation, which confirms there is no reported case in Australia on this topic. The nearest one gets is an obiter observation in The Queen v Harbach [1973] 6 SASR 427 at 435 to the effect that the desire of one accused to call evidence from another might be a proper basis for directing a separate trial. 
     
      
       
      
    7     I was also referred to R v Knijff (1982) QdR 429, which dealt with the situation where the wife of the appellant’s co-accused was called but, as she was not a compellable witness against the co-accused, cross-examination of her by counsel for the appellant was hampered. In that unusual situation the Court of Criminal Appeal considered a separate trial was called for. The facts of that case, of course, are significantly different from here. 
     
      
       
      
    8     It is to Canada where one must turn for some guidance for the situation which confronts me. The Crown Prosecutor referred me to three decisions from that country. In the first, R v Quiring and Kuipers (1974) 19 CCC (2d) 337, the court held that a separate trial had been rightly refused in circumstances where it had been sought on the basis of the appellant's assertion that his co-accused might give material evidence in his defence. It seems, however, there was no material to establish that that co-accused was prepared to give evidence nor, if he were, what that evidence might be. The court recognised that a desire of one accused to call another in his defence might ground an order for separate trials but found that there was no such basis demonstrated in that case. 
     
      
       
      
    9     In R v Agawa and Mallet (1975) 28 CCC (2d) 379 the appellants had been found guilty of a killing in a prison. Agawa had sought a separate trial on the basis that Mallet made a statement to police tending to implicate himself in the killing but to exculpate Agawa. However, he made the statement with the rider that, ""if any of this is said outside, I will deny it"". A separate trial was refused and, on appeal, held rightly so. As the court pointed out, it was not clear what evidence Mallet would have given if he had been called and, in any event, his preparedness to give evidence on behalf of Agawa appeared to be no more than a mere possibility in the light of the rider he made at the time of his statement to the police. 
     
      
       
      
    10     On that occasion the court had regard to the strength of the Crown case against Agawa and concluded that anything Mallet might have said would have been of very little weight. The court appeared to have considered that that was a proper matter to assess in determining the separate trial application. However, it must be borne in mind that, in any event, this was a case on appeal after conviction where the court was also examining, with the benefit of hindsight, whether the trial had miscarried having proceeded as a joint trial. 
     
      
       
      
    11     On the other hand, in R v Boulet (1987) 40 CCC (3d) 38 a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that a separate trial should have been granted. In that case the appellant was tried with three others for the murder of a prison guard in the course of a riot. It seems that the appellant was initially charged alone and he indicated at a preliminary hearing, before the other three had been charged, that he may wish to call them as witnesses in his case. The Crown case turned primarily on the evidence of another inmate who claimed to have seen the appellant strike the guard. In seeking a separate trial, counsel for the appellant had informed the trial judge that the three co-accused would say that, while they were present at the scene, they had not seen the appellant commit any act of violence against the prison guard. Counsel for the other three accused indicated to the trial judge that anything they might say would not be to the appellant's benefit. Nevertheless, as I have said, the majority of the court were persuaded that, in those circumstances a separate trial should have been granted. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Beauregard JA (at 42) said that the trial judge should have accepted and acted upon the statement of counsel for the appellant from the Bar table that the other three accused might have given evidence favouring his case. The other judge in the majority was Vallerand JA, who at 47ff distinguished the two earlier Canadian cases to which I have referred. There is no precise parallel between the case of Boulet and the case with which I am dealing. However, I do find it of some assistance in the determination of this application. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The Crown’s opposition to the application is founded primarily on the assertion that the application is not made bona fide. Put bluntly, the Crown said this application is a ploy to improve Mr Bikic's chances of being granted bail. He has previously been unsuccessful on a number of occasions in bail applications. One of those occasions was before Adams J in April of last year. On that occasion his Honour refused bail but added the observation that the question of bail might be viewed differently if it appeared there would be any significant delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial.  
     
      
       
      
    14     The Crown submission is that the alibi material is false and has been fashioned simply to give weight to a separate trial application. Obviously, if that application were successful the trial of Mr Bikic would have to proceed after the trial of his co-accused and it is from that, the Crown says, that the sort of delay of which Adams J was speaking may well result. 
     
      
       
      
    15     The Crown relies on a number of other matters to impugn the bona fides of this application. On the first application, which I refused, Mr Bikic was represented by a different barrister from senior counsel who has represented him since. The effect of what was said from the Bar table on that occasion was that Mr Bikic would claim an alibi and would be supported by several of his co-accused because they were with him at the place where he claimed to have been at the time of the shooting. Clearly, that is not the case. As I have said, what I have been told is that the co-accused would acknowledge being at the scene but would deny that Mr Bikic was there. 
     
      
       
      
    16     However, in this application I have the affidavit of the solicitor who was previously acting for the applicant (although he no longer does), the effect of which is that counsel formerly briefed simply misunderstood Mr Bikic's instructions and the solicitor did not see it necessary to point that out to him at the time. Frankly, that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs but that is the situation to which the solicitor has deposed and he was not required for cross-examination on that or any other matter. 
     
      
       
      
    17     The Crown also relies upon the fact that the alibi notice was served late and, indeed, only after the judgment in which I refused the previous application for a separate trial. The Crown said that in the investigation by the police thus far the alibi does not appear to be supported. In particular, the Crown draws attention to a statement taken from one of the persons named in the alibi notice which would appear, in some respects at least, to be inconsistent with Mr Bikic's assertions in the alibi notice in respect of his movements on the occasion in question. 
     
      
       
      
    18     The Crown relies on what is said to be substantial evidence of Mr Bikic's involvement in the planning and execution of these crimes. Indeed, the Crown says that the evidence points to his being central to the organisation of the enterprise. In particular, there is eye witness evidence which, if accepted, clearly puts Mr Bikic at the scene and at another place earlier where it is said arrangements were made for the execution of the enterprise. 
     
      
       
      
    19     I should interpolate at this stage that the Crown also sought to rely in this application upon some evidence which it does not intend to lead at trial. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I could receive that evidence at this interlocutory stage pursuant to s75 of the Evidence Act. I say no more than that I do not consider it appropriate to do so, and I do not think that this is the sort of evidence to which s75 is directed. However, in any event, the outcome of the application would not turn on that material. 
     
      
       
      
    20     The Crown pointed out that part of its case is that Mr Bikic himself shot one of the victims, and the Crown Prosecutor submitted that his absence from the joint trial would distort the Crown case. The jury would not have the opportunity of seeing the totality of the case, including any answer that Mr Bikic might make to the evidence led against him. Of course, if Mr Bikic were granted a separate trial, the evidence of his having shot one of the victims would still be admissible in the trial of the others. Inevitably, directing a separate trial causes some distortion to the fabric of the Crown case. The question is whether the interests of justice override that. 
     
      
       
      
    21     All the matters the Crown Prosecutor raised in opposition to the application are of considerable weight and I have given them very careful thought. One might certainly entertain some suspicion about the true purpose for which this application is being made. As to that I can say only this. If the granting of this application is followed by a further bail application, that application will be dealt with on its merits in the light of the material then presented, although the delay in Mr Bikic coming to trial would be a relevant matter. 
     
      
       
      
    22     There are powerful reasons of policy for the joint trial of persons alleged to be involved in a joint criminal enterprise. For that proposition there are numerous authorities which I need not recite. The ultimate question, however, is what the interests of justice require. That involves balancing the interests of the community and the interests of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    23     In R v Middis & Ors (unreported 27 March 1991) Hunt J (as he then was) expressed the opinion (at p5):  
     
      
       
        
         
         An applicant for a separate trial must demonstrate that there is a real risk (as opposed to a remote possibility) that there will arise in a joint trial prejudice of the type which - if it arises - would result in positive injustice to him. 
         
        
       
      
    24     I am presented with the situation in which senior counsel for Mr Bikic tells me that some at least of his co-accused could give evidence material to his defence. Those co-accused would not be compellable to do so at a joint trial. The only way to ensure their availability to Mr Bikic in his defence is to see them dealt with, one way or the other, before he goes to trial. 
     
      
       
      
    25     It is true, as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, that a separate trial can be granted at any time. If, as it happened, all the co-accused chose to give evidence in a joint trial Mr Bikic's problem might well be solved. However, I have no way of knowing what course the other accused might take at their trial. 
     
      
       
      
    26     In all the circumstances, I consider it undesirable to wait until the trial is well under way to determine whether the interests of justice call for Mr Bikic's separate trial. As Hunt J observed in Middis at p6, sometimes in this circumstance it is not sufficient merely to discharge the jury in respect of a particular accused but it is necessary to discharge the jury in respect of the whole trial and to start again. 
     
      
       
      
    27     For those reasons I am satisfied that the application must be granted. Accordingly, I direct that Mr Bikic be tried separately from his co-accused and after they have been tried.

     10453 of 2000 Glen Roderick Flack v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor 
      
       
    Reasons for judgment1     HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Glen Roderick Flack, is awaiting committal proceedings in respect of a number of serious drug charges and firearms charges. Following his arrest on 20 September 1999, he made several unsuccessful applications for bail in the Local Court. On 3 December 1999 I heard a further application, which was also refused. 
     
      
       
      
    2     However, on 27 January 2000 the applicant sought a review of my decision, pursuant to s44(6) of the Bail Act, before Magistrate Lillian Horler. This application was based upon the conditions of his custody which, for reasons which need not be explored here, were unusually harsh and made it difficult for him to confer with his legal advisers and prepare his case. On the following day, Magistrate Lillian Horler granted him bail. The first defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, then sought a review of that bail decision, pursuant to s44(2) of the Act, contending that bail should again be refused. That application came on for hearing before the second defendant, another magistrate, who has entered a submitting appearance in this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The proceedings commenced on 2 February 2000 and were adjourned, part-heard. The solicitor then representing the first defendant asked that bail be revoked in the meantime but his Worship declined to do so, saying that “it might be premature to revoke it mid-way through a hearing”. Accordingly, bail was continued. The hearing was resumed on 8 February and was again adjourned, part-heard. Again, the solicitor for the first defendant sought the revocation of bail but his Worship declined to do so for the same reason, and continued bail.  
     
      
       
      
    4     The matter was next before the Court on 18 February, when the prosecution case closed. The plaintiff was represented by Mr Boulten of counsel, who appeared in this Court, but on that occasion his instructing solicitor was unable to attend as he was ill. Mr Boulten intended to present evidence on his client’s behalf but was unwilling to do so in the absence of his instructing solicitor, who had been involved in the matter from the outset and was intimately acquainted with it. Accordingly, his Worship acceded to an application for a further adjournment. However, he effectively invited the solicitor for the first defendant to renew his application that bail be revoked in the meantime and, despite the spirited protest of Mr Boulten, he made that order. Mr Boulten then asked his Worship to disqualify himself from the further hearing of the review, on the basis that his revocation of bail at that stage gave at least the appearance of his having pre-judged the outcome. That application was refused.  
     
      
       
      
    5     In relation to the revocation of bail and his Worship’s refusal to disqualify himself, the plaintiff now seeks declaratory and other relief in this Court. Leave pursuant to s104(3) of the Justices Act is sought to appeal under Part 5 of that Act, and the summons also seeks an order in the nature of certiorari. No point has been taken on behalf of the first defendant about the form of relief claimed. It is accepted that, if the plaintiff makes good his arguments of substance, he is entitled to the declarations which he seeks and the remission of the matter to the Local Court to be dealt with accordingly. 
     
      
       
      
    6     I do not have all the material which was before his Worship. It appears that much of the evidence was directed to the circumstances of the plaintiff’s custody and the prospect of his being moved to an institution where conditions would be more favourable. However, there was also evidence touching upon the strength of the Crown case and the extent of any fear that, if granted bail, he would abscond. It seems that Mr Boulten intended to call evidence in the plaintiff’s case about his community ties: in particular, the situation of his family and his prospects of employment. In other words, the evidence in the review proceedings was not confined to the conditions of his custody but was intended to canvass all the matters which a court normally considers when making a bail determination.  
     
      
       
      
    7     His Worship’s reasons for revoking bail on 18 February are, with respect, not entirely clear. He noted he had before him the whole of the material relied upon by the first defendant. He referred to the “great number of bail determinations made over a significant period of time”. He concluded:  
     
      
       
        
         
         I balance out the application made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the prosecuting authority, the material the Court has at this stage and without, to use the vernacular, closing the door on the totality of material which the Court will ultimately have to determine on the question of bail, it would be the view of this Court at this stage, given the reasons and the additional material this Court now has, that pending the next hearing that bail will be refused. 
         
        
       
      
    8     The matter was again before his Worship on 29 February, by which time the proceedings in this Court had been instituted. The plaintiff’s solicitor informed his Worship that, for that reason, he did not propose to present evidence in the review proceedings. His Worship recorded that bail had been refused on 18 February “on the basis of the history of the matter, the reasons consistently set out in the form 8 since the inception of the matter, and of course the Supreme Court bail decision and the additional evidence which has been tested or cross-examined”. Bail was again refused, and the matter was further adjourned to await the decision of this Court. 
     
      
       
        
       Jurisdiction 
        
       
      
    9     Before me, Mr Boulten submitted that the learned magistrate had no jurisdiction to revoke bail before the proceedings for review had been completed. The power conferred by the Bail Act to grant bail includes the power to refuse it: s14. The periods during which bail might be granted are set out in s6. They include:  
     
      
       
        
         
         (c) the period of any adjournment or adjournments including:  
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (i) any adjournment or adjournments during the course of a trial; and  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) any period deemed by section 16 to be the period of an adjournment; 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    10     It is unnecessary to set out the remainder of s6 or s16 of the Act. It is sufficient to say that they refer to periods between steps in the proceedings in respect of which bail is sought. Neither section refers in terms to proceedings for the review of bail under Part 6 of the Act itself. Mr Ellis of counsel, who appeared for the first defendant, pointed out that the expression “adjournment” in s6(c) is unqualified, and he submitted that it embraced the adjournment of the hearing of an application for review. However, in my view, the reference to “adjournment or adjournments” in that paragraph should be read ejusdem generis with the other paragraphs in s6 and with s16. While the notion of an adjournment is afforded an extended meaning, the paragraph relates to steps in the proceedings in respect of which bail is sought. It has no application to proceedings for the review of bail. 
     
      
       
      
    11     Accordingly, the present review hearing should be distinguished from the proceedings before the Local Court in relation to the informations laid against the plaintiff. Those proceedings are governed by Division 1 of Part 4 of the Justices Act, dealing with indictable offences. As it happens, in this case the conduct of the committal proceedings, including pending applications by the plaintiff and his alleged co-offenders under s48E of the Justices Act, is in the hands of a different magistrate. Section 33 of that Act confers a general power to adjourn the hearing of informations such as these, and s30(2) and s41(1A) deal with adjournments in certain specific situations. It is those provisions which are embraced by s6(c) of the Bail Act and, clearly, they have no application to proceedings for the review of bail.  
     
      
       
      
    12     I consider that such an interpretation of the legislative scheme accords with the dictates of justice and good sense. If a bail determination is the subject of review, it ought to remain in force until the process of review is complete. In many cases that process would be concluded on the day the application for review is first listed, and the problem encountered in this case would not arise. However, the bail determination should not be subject to premature reversal or modification simply because the review proceedings cannot be so promptly disposed of. This is not to deny that there may be cases where, while review proceedings are in train, further events occur or new evidence comes to light bearing on the question of bail. In that event, bail might be reviewed upon a different basis or a fresh bail determination might be called for. It is not suggested that this is such a case. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Accordingly, I am satisfied that his Worship had no jurisdiction to revoke the plaintiff’s bail on 18 February, or again to refuse it on 29 February, because the review proceedings had not been completed. To this day Magistrate Horler’s bail determination remains in force. For the same reason, it is doubtful that it was necessary for his Worship to order that bail be continued on the first two occasions when this matter was before him. 
     
      
       
        
       Disqualification 
        
       
      
    14     As I have said, having revoked bail on 18 February, his Worship refused an application that he disqualify himself from the further hearing of the matter. In my view, that application was well founded. It is true, as Mr Ellis pointed out, that by then his Worship was better informed about the case than he had been on the two previous occasions, as the prosecution had led all its evidence. It is also true that his Worship said that he was not “closing the door on the totality of material” which he would ultimately have to consider. The fact remains that he had yet to receive the plaintiff's’ evidence. Nothing had occurred between 8 February, when bail was continued for the second time, and 18 February, when it was revoked, to warrant the urgent review of bail on some different basis or a fresh bail determination. 
     
      
       
      
    15     As I observed earlier, on this occasion it was his Worship who prompted the prosecution application for the revocation of bail. There is another matter which is not without significance. Before Mr Boulten had completed his submissions in response to the prosecution application, he asked for a short adjournment while he conferred with his instructing solicitor by telephone. His Worship granted that adjournment, but varied the plaintiff’s bail so as to confine him to the floor of the Downing Centre where the matter was being heard.  
     
      
       
      
    16     In all those circumstances, a fair minded member of the public could reasonably conclude that his Worship had prejudged the outcome of the proceedings for review. Of course, actual bias is not suggested. The relevant principles were expounded by Cole JA in Balic (No 2) (1994) 75 ACrim R 515 at 520. That also was a case involving a bail determination, although the circumstances there were different from the present case. I am satisfied that his Worship should disqualify himself from the further hearing of the matter.  
     
      
       
        
       Declarations and Orders 
        
       
      
    17     I make the following declarations:  
     
      
       
        
       (a) the second defendant had no jurisdiction to revoke the plaintiff’s bail prior to the completion of the proceedings for review;  
        
        
       (b) the second defendant is disqualified from the further hearing of those proceedings. 
        
       
      
    18     The second defendant’s orders of 18 February and 29 February 2000 refusing the plaintiff bail are quashed. The proceedings are remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law by another magistrate. Pending the conclusion of the proceedings, the plaintiff is to be released from custody forthwith and is subject to Magistrate Horler’s bail determination of 28 January 2000. 
     
      
       
      
    19     If necessary, I shall hear the parties on costs.

       JUDGMENT - Application to Discharge Jury 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: On Thursday 9 March 2000, Mr Corr who appears on behalf of the accused, Mark William Helmhout, made application for me to discharge the jury following the admission of some evidence from Sergeant Dagwell tending to disclose that the accused had, on a previous occasion, been arrested and detained in police custody. 
     
      
    2    The evidence was given late in the day. At the conclusion of Sergeant Dagwell’s examination in chief, Mr Corr made his application. He submitted that the disclosure of material of this nature carried such potential for prejudice that the proper exercise of my discretion required the discharge of the jury. He referred me to the authorities collected on this point in Australian Criminal Trial Directions, Glissan and Tilmouth, Butterworths at para 4-800-15-10. 
     
      
    3    I stood the matter over to 9.30am the following day to enable further consideration of the application. On Friday, 10 March 2000, Mr Corr took me to a number of authorities; R v Knape [1965] VR 469 at 473; R v Waring (No. 2) [1972] Qd.R 263 at 270-271; The Queen v Koppen (1975) 11 SASR 182 at 185; Maric v R (1978) 20 ALR 513 at 519-520. Before turning to a consideration of the authorities, it is appropriate to set out the circumstances in which the matter arose. 
     
      
    4    Sergeant John Warren Dagwell was the custody manager at the Queanbeyan Police Station on 20 June 1998 when the accused was brought into custody pursuant to the provisions of Part 10A of the Crimes Act, 1900. Among the issues in this trial are (i) the extent of the accused’s intoxication by alcohol and/or other drugs at the time he participated in an ERISP on the morning of 20 June 1998, (ii) whether prior to participating in that interview he had been threatened by the detectives in charge of the investigation and (iii) the failure of Sergeant Dagwell to comply with the requirements of cl 28 of the Crimes (Detention after Arrest) Regulation 1998. In the light of these issues, the Crown Prosecutor led evidence from Sergeant Dagwell (without objection) as to the questions asked of the accused and the answers received in the course of completing the custody manager’s protocol. The protocol requires the custody manager to inquire as to the detainee’s state of intoxication. The detainee is also asked if he or she is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. This latter consideration is relevant to the cl 28 issue. The questions to be asked of detainees are brought up on the computer screen as the custody manager completes the protocol. Provision is made for either an affirmative or negative answer to be recorded by typing “Y” or “N”. In the course of his evidence, Sergeant Dagwell was shown a bundle of computer generated documents being the Part 10A protocol relating to the accused. He was invited to recount his questions, and the accused’s responses, by reference to those documents. Both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Corr had copies of a set of computer generated documents (being the Part 10A protocols relating to the accused), however, it appears that neither had the complete set. Sergeant Dagwell’s bundle, MFI 16, included the following question:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Is this the first time you have been arrested and placed in police custody?” 
        
       
       
      The accused’s reply to this question was recorded by the letter  
      “N” 
       signifying that he had asserted it was not. Sergeant Dagwell gave this evidence (T.558/9). 
       
      
    5    It was unfortunate that this evidence was led. However, no question arises of any impropriety or sharp practice on the part of the Crown Prosecutor or Sergeant Dagwell. Sergeant Dagwell was invited to read the questions and answers recorded on MFI 16 and he did so. I think, in those circumstances, it would be unfair to expect that he should have edited out the offending question and answer. There is nothing to suggest that Sergeant Dagwell knew that neither the Crown Prosecutor nor Mr Corr had access to the document from which he was reading. It is quite clear that both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Corr were not aware that the offending question and answer formed part of MFI 16.  
     
      
    6    I approach this matter upon the basis that there has been a wholly inadvertent disclosure of the fact that the accused had been arrested and held in police custody on an occasion prior to 20 June 1998. 
     
      
    7    Mr Corr relied on a passage in the decision of the Full Court in Knape in which it was said (at p 473): 
     
      
       
        
        “An examination of the authorities leads us to the view that unless it can be said, upon the evidence, that the irregular disclosure could not in any way affect the judgment of the jury in coming to their decision of guilty or not guilty, the trial judge should exercise his discretion in favour of the accused.” 
        
       
       
      I should note that on this test (which I do not accept accurately reflects the current state of the law) I would not consider that the proper exercise of my discretion favoured a discharge.  
       
      
    8    The passage cited above in Knape needs to be read in the light of more recent authorities. Gibbs J (as he then was) in Maric referred with approval to the observations of Sachs LJ who delivered the judgment of the Court in Regina v Weaver [1968] 1 QB 353: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is very far from being the rule that in every case where something of this nature gets into evidence through inadvertence the jury must be discharged.” 
         (at p 360) 
        
       
      
    9    In Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact.” 
        
       
      
    10    This mishap occurred towards the close of the ninth day of the trial when the Crown case was drawing to a close. The evidence emerged as the result of a misunderstanding. No question of deliberateness, in the context in which their Honours referred to it in Crofts, arises. When Sergeant Dagwell gave the evidence neither the Crown Prosecutor nor Mr Corr betrayed any obvious reaction to it. Mr Corr waited for a suitable interval before making his application. In this way, no added impact was given to the evidence at the time it emerged.  
     
      
    11    Evidence has been led (without objection) that, at the time of the accused’s arrest, the police located some marijuana and cannabis resin in his unit. In an electronically recorded interview with police the accused readily volunteered that he had been smoking marijuana the previous day. Mr Corr elicited from the witness, Julieann House, that she had supplied the accused with some heroin a matter of hours before the killing. The issue of the accused’s intoxication (both alcohol and drug induced) is a live one in this case. It is for this reason, as I apprehend it, that no objection was taken to the evidence of the accused’s possession of marijuana and cannabis resin. Against this background, I consider the accidental disclosure (that on a prior occasion the accused had been arrested) is not likely to occasion prejudice such that the continuation of the trial would be unfair.  
     
      
    12    The evidence goes no higher than that the accused had been arrested on an occasion prior to 20 June 1998. There is no evidence that he has been convicted of anything.  
     
      
    13    I consider that in the course of my summing up I can effectively deal with this evidence (instructing the jury to put it out of their minds) at the same time as I direct them to put out of their minds the evidence concerning the accused’s possession of cannabis resin and cannabis leaf save in so far as they find it relevant to the question of his ingestion of cannabis on the day preceding the subject events. 
     
      
    14    In The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, Mason CJ and Toohey J said (at p 603): 
     
      
       
        
        “The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in  
        Hinch v Attorney-General for State of Victoria 
         (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 74, in the past, too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them 
        .” 
        
       
      
    15    In the course of the evidence of Detective McCloskey, Mr Corr objected to the contents of a conversation between the Detective and the accused relating to the drugs located at the premises being given. That objection was upheld and I directed the jury that it was self-evident the accused in this case was charged with murder and that the fact that he may or may not have been spoken to about the possession of cannabis was of no concern and should be put out of their minds. As I gave this short direction, a number of the jurors nodded affirmatively.  
     
      
    16    I consider I should proceed upon the basis that this jury will, in conformity with the direction I propose giving them, put out of their consideration their knowledge that, on an occasion prior to 20 June 1998, the accused had been arrested. 
     
      
    17    I did not consider that it was appropriate for me to give a direction to the jury concerning this evidence at the time when it was given by Sergeant Dagwell. To do so would have risked giving the evidence prominence which, in my view, it had not otherwise acquired. I raised this matter with both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Corr. Neither invited me to give a direction at this stage in the trial. 
     
      
    18    For the above reasons, I declined the application to discharge the jury.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 25 February 200070072/99 - REGINA v Wayne John BUTCHERJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Wayne John Butcher, was committed to this Court for trial on 17 September 1999 on a charge of murder. On his first appearance in this Court on 3 December 1999 he pleaded guilty of manslaughter and the Crown accepted that plea in discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    2   The Court has been asked to take into account pursuant to s 21 Criminal Procedure Act two offences, namely that he used a prohibited weapon, namely a shotgun, and that he did not keep a firearm safely. 
     
      
    3   29 May 1999 was the prisoner’s 50th birthday and members of his family organised a party for him at the property occupied by him and his wife near Mudgee. A large number of guests attended the party, which began soon after midday. The deceased, Ross Graham Denney, commonly known as “Shelby”, arrived later than most of the guests, about 9.30 or 10pm. 
     
      
    4   During the course of the party the prisoner consumed a substantial amount of alcohol. His wife Lucinda Butcher also consumed alcohol. 
     
      
    5   After about 10pm most of the guests had either left or had retired to sleep in the main residence on the property or in tents. The prisoner, much affected by alcohol, went to bed in the office. He and his wife had given up their room to guests. The party proper had taken place in a covered area called the greenhouse some distance from the residence. 
     
      
    6   The prisoner was woken by one of the dogs at about 2.30am. He noticed that his wife was not with him and that another dog was making a noise in the place where the party had been held. He rose, dressed and went to investigate. He was still substantially affected by the alcohol he had drunk. He came across the deceased and his wife in the greenhouse. Her jeans were pulled down, her breasts were exposed and the deceased was performing cunnilingus upon her. The prisoner kicked the deceased and remonstrated with him. The deceased used a coarse expression, the meaning of which was unclear. It was capable of being understood as adding further insult and it is not surprising that the prisoner took it that way. He was outraged. He went back to the house and entered the bedroom he normally occupied with his wife. The occupants of the room heard him say - 
     
      
       
        
        I’m gonna fucken kill Shelby. I caught him fucking my missus. 
        
       
      
    7   He went to the wardrobe and removed a rifle case from the top of it. The occupants of the room tried to stop him but were unsuccessful. The prisoner remonstrated again with his wife and repeated that he was going to shoot the deceased. He began calling out his nickname. He walked onto the veranda and took the gun out of the case. 
     
      
    8   He approached the deceased in a spot about 100 metres from the greenhouse. He discharged the shotgun from a distance of about eight to ten metres. The shot hit the deceased in the left chest, the bulk striking an area twenty-five by twenty-two centimetres. Some stray pellets struck the right and left shoulders, the upper neck and the lower jaw. At the base of the neck was an area of abrasion which might have resulted from contact from the integrated shot cup. The deceased died not long afterwards. 
     
      
    9   The prisoner went a little way further and made as though to shoot himself as well, but his son-in-law stopped him from doing so and took the gun off him. 
     
      
    10   The prisoner then began to say different things about what his intentions had been. After saying that he had shot the deceased he added that he only wanted to scare him and did not even aim at him. He also said that he did not even know that the gun was loaded. 
     
      
    11   The police were called and a number of officers attended the scene. The prisoner told them that he had not meant to hurt the deceased, just to scare him. He said to a friend at the police station that he did not think that the gun was loaded and that he was just going to scare the deceased. He said that he did not know how the gun went off and that he did not aim it. 
     
      
    12   The prisoner saw Mr Adrian Robinson, a clinical psychologist, five times between August and November 1999. He saw Dr Bruce Westmore, Forensic Psychiatrist, on 2 December 1999. 
     
      
    13   He told Mr Robinson that after the discovery and confrontation of the deceased he was angry and went to get the gun. He followed the deceased and tripped in the dark. The gun went off when he fell and he had no intention to harm anybody, only to scare the deceased. Even after the gun discharged he did not realise that he had shot the deceased. He thought that he had dived to the ground when he had heard the blast. 
     
      
    14   He told Dr Westmore that when he came on the deceased and his wife he felt sick. At some stage he hit his head on a railing and fell backwards. He saw a bright light. He did not remember saying that he intended to kill the deceased. He went into a paddock where he saw the deceased in silhouette. Some words were exchanged. The shotgun was over his right shoulder. He was left-handed. He recalled having the gun in his right hand and walking towards the deceased. He tripped and stumbled and somehow the gun went off. It scared him because he did not know that it was loaded. 
     
      
    15   The prisoner’s statements that he tripped and did not know how the gun had gone off, coming so long after the events and being so significantly different from what he had said before and after the shooting are surprising. They are even more surprising in view of the fact that when he gave evidence before me the prisoner did not adhere to them and said that he had no clear recollection of the events. He said that he could no longer distinguish between his own memory and what other people had told him had happened, whether by reference to what he said or otherwise. He repeated that his only intention was to scare the deceased. He had no recollection of going and getting the shotgun. 
     
      
    16   The facts of this case are generally not in contention, but an issue has arisen whether the Court can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to do the deceased really serious injury when he discharged the shotgun. That he did is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from his leaving the house carrying the loaded shotgun stating his intention to kill the deceased. Nothing about the wound received by the deceased suggests that the accused did not continue to have that intention when he discharged the gun. 
     
      
    17   The evidence which is said to throw a reasonable doubt upon the conclusion is of the things the accused said afterwards, beginning with the statements that he had only intended to frighten the deceased and that he did not know that the gun was loaded. 
     
      
    18   It is understandable that a person confronted by the events that confronted the accused and reacting as he did should begin to justify his actions upon realising what he had done in the heat of the moment. That is what I think the accused did. I do not accept as factual his claims that he only intended to frighten the deceased or that he did not know that the gun was loaded. Even he has tacitly acknowledged that the story he told about an accident was untrue. 
     
      
    19   None of the things said by the accused after the shooting raises in my mind a reasonable doubt that when he fired the gun he intended to kill the deceased. It is therefore appropriate to sentence him upon the basis that he shot the deceased under provocation. 
     
      
    20   The few years before these events were very stressful for the prisoner. He had been living in the United States of America for about fifteen years when, in 1994, his mother became terminally ill. He and his wife came to Australia to care for her and settled on the Central Coast. In 1997 they bought a house there but within a couple of weeks of their moving in it was destroyed by fire and they lost heavily. The prisoner’s mother had a bad accident and remained in hospital until her death in January 1998. 
     
      
    21   The prisoner worked in the automotive industry during his time in the United States. After his return to Australia he established an importing business, but it did not do well. He and his wife decided to move to Mudgee to make a fresh start. They purchased a piece of land which they intended to clear and use to grow olives. 
     
      
    22   The prisoner’s present wife is his third wife. He maintains good relations with his two former wives and has adult children from one of those marriages. He has a close and supportive family. Notwithstanding that he had those things to be thankful for and that he must have had much to look forward to, he was very depressed at about the time of these events. The circumstances in which his mother had died, the loss of the house and difficulties with his importing business all pressed heavily upon him. The occasion of his 50th birthday was not a source of pleasure for him and it was against his wishes that his wife and daughters arranged the party. 
     
      
    23   The unexpected and distressing nature of what the prisoner saw and the prisoner’s understanding of what the deceased said to him must be seen in the light of the events of the last few years and their effect upon the prisoner. This was yet another disaster, this time a highly humiliating and insulting one. It was provocation of the grossest kind. 
     
      
    24   The prisoner is a man of the highest character. He has never been in trouble with the law. He is highly regarded by his colleagues in the community. He is loved by his family. 
     
      
    25   I accept that he has become despondent about killing the deceased and that his expressions of regret and remorse are genuine. His early plea of guilty is evidence of his remorse and will carry weight in the sentence that must be imposed. 
     
      
    26   I am satisfied that he will not offend again. He is no danger to the community and there is no need for the sentence to provide for his personal deterrence. 
     
      
    27   He is being treated with anti-depressants and I accept the evidence of Dr Westmore that that treatment ought to continue. I also accept the opinion that, a custodial sentence being necessary, the prisoner will have a difficult time because of his depression and the risk that he may harm himself. 
     
      
    28   A report was prepared for the Court by Helen Dowling, Probation and Parole Officer at Bathurst. Making reference to the prisoner’s depression, Ms Dowling recommends that at the conclusion of any custodial sentence the prisoner be directed towards the Mental Health Service to monitor the depression and to continue counselling with the services provided by the Probation and Parole Service. I think that the expected continuance of the depression and the need for treatment and counselling amount to special circumstances justifying the imposition of an additional term of the sentence which exceeds one-third of the minimum term. 
     
      
    29   After his arrest the prisoner was confined to custody for about two and a half months before entering bail. 
     
      
    30   Taking into account the pre-sentence custody and the offences on the Form, I sentence the prisoner to penal servitude for a period of four years and six months. The sentence will comprise a minimum term of two years and six months commencing on 23 February 2000 and expiring on 22 August 2002 and an additional term of two years commencing on 23 August 2002 and expiring on 22 August 2004. The prisoner will be eligible for release on parole on 23 August 2002. 
     
      
    31   I recommend that the prisoner undergo psychiatric examination as soon as possible. I recommend that he serve his sentence in a minimum security institution.

       JUDGMENT - Application for separate trial for Pieter Helmhout 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: Mr Webb, who appears on behalf of the accused Pieter Helmhout, makes application that his client be separately tried from his co-accused, Mark Helmhout. The basis of the application is that at the joint trial the Crown would lead evidence in the case against Mark Helmhout in the form of an ERISP between investigating police and Mark Helmhout. That interview contains material highly prejudicial to the accused, Pieter Helmhout. It is submitted by Mr Webb that the prejudice is of such a high order that it could not be cured by direction. 
     
      
    2    The case against the accused, Pieter Helmhout, will depend in large measure upon the evidence of the witness Edward Szkudelski. The version of events that the Crown anticipates Mr Szkudelski will give receives, on a view, strong support from the account given by Mark Helmhout in his interview. The Crown frankly concedes that it would be difficult for a jury notwithstanding any direction I may give to separate out in their consideration of the weight they give to the evidence of Edward Szkudelski in the trial of Pieter Helmhout the impression created by the contents of the interview between Mark Helmhout and police. 
     
      
    3    I am of the view that there is in this case a real risk that the Crown case against Pieter Helmhout will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the impact of the Mark Helmhout record of interview upon the jury and accordingly pursuant to s 365 of the Crimes Act, I direct that the indictment be severed and that Pieter Helmhout be tried separately from his co-accused, Mark Helmhout.

    2   The injuries which killed the child were inflicted on her during a period of perhaps 15 - 30 minutes in which she was alone in the house with the appellant and her 3 year-old brother. Shortly before her mother left, the child was bathed and dressed in a nappy, pyjamas and / or a tracksuit. When she was taken to hospital after her mother returned to find her comatose, if not dead, there were indications of recent injuries which had not been present earlier, including bruising to her abdomen, throughout most of the circumference of her hymen and to the left of the hymen in deeper tissue, and between the bottom of her vaginal opening and her anus (below and either side of her fourchette), a haemorrhage and laceration of the right side of her clitoris (with fresh blood) with bruising in the more distal extension, and two small linear abrasions (one with attendant bruising) on her right labia majora. The child’s death resulted from bleeding from a ruptured mesocolon, duodenum and liver.  
    3   On 20 September 1989, the appellant was convicted of murdering the child and sentenced to penal servitude for life to commence from 13 August 1988. On the same day, he was convicted of having sexual intercourse with the child, a person under the age of ten years, and sentenced to penal servitude for ten years to commence from 13 August 1988. That sentence has been served. 
    4   On 6 August 1998, a little less than nine years after he was convicted and sentenced, the applicant filed a notice of appeal and a notice of application for an extension of time within which to appeal.  
    5   The application for an extension of time stated that the notice of appeal was not lodged within ten days of conviction or sentence because “[t]he psychological condition of the applicant, and the materialisation of fresh evidence subsequent to such time, did not allow an appeal to be lodged within time.”  
    6   The appellant’s original grounds of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
       
       “ - The Applicant has available to him fresh evidence, the absence of which at his trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  
       
      
      
       
       - There is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the applicant if the new evidence had been before them.  
       
      
      
       
       - The verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
       
      
    7   The matters raised in the application for an extension of time and notice of appeal filed on 6 August 1998 have since been tacitly abandoned. 
    8   On 5 November 1999, the following were notified as the appellant’s grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
       “In relation to the murder conviction: 
       
      
      
       
       1. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence relating to injuries observed to have been sustained by the deceased in the four months prior to her death. 
       
      
      
       
       2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission into evidence of the significant amount of testimony relating to the injuries observed to have been sustained by the deceased in the four months prior to her death.  
       
      
      
     In relation to the sexual assault conviction: 
      
      
       
       3. The verdict is unreasonable / not able to be supported by the evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       4. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury sufficiently or at all in relation to the mental element pertaining to the act of penetration.” 
       
      
    9   The only affidavit in support of the application for an extension of time, which was not filed until Thursday, 2 March 2000, does not give an adequate explanation for the delay in appealing or applying for an extension of time. On the other hand, the prosecution stated that its only prejudice was the “general prejudice” which is usually associated with significant delay, and accepted that an extension of time should be granted if, but only if, the Court considered that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. See also Criminal Appeal Rules 1952, rule 4. The appellant did not argue that a more liberal approach should be adopted. 
     
      
     The appellant’s murder conviction - grounds 1 & 2 
    10   In statements to the child’s mother, staff at the hospital and police, and in an unsworn statement to the jury after the close of the prosecution case, the appellant admitted that he had struck the child after she disobeyed him, but claimed that he had only struck her once, by a spontaneous “backhand” blow to her body in the region of her abdomen, knocking her over. Suggestions were raised by the appellant, either directly or by cross-examination, that the child or her brother might have accidentally caused the injuries to her genitals, and that other recent injuries might have been caused by her falling to the floor when she was hit, the vigour with which the appellant had picked her up and her mother had grabbed her on her return, or attempts to resuscitate her by her mother and hospital staff. 
    11   The jury was required to consider which of the child’s recent injuries were inflicted on her by the appellant and the nature and extent of the violence involved. It was also required to consider the appellant’s state of mind at the time when he injured the child. The appellant was guilty of murder only if, when he struck and killed the child, he intended to kill her or cause her grievous bodily harm or knew that his assault would probably kill her and was recklessly indifferent to her death. He was guilty of unlawful sexual intercourse only if he had penetrated her vagina, intending to do so. The alternative count of attempted unlawful sexual intercourse also involved an intention to penetrate the child’s vagina. The jury’s conclusions were dependent upon the appellant’s limited admissions and the inferences available from other evidence, including the child’s injuries and the possible means by which those injuries could have been sustained. 
    12   Evidence of prior violence by the appellant towards the child which might have rationally affected the jury’s determination of those issues was admissible. 
    13   However, evidence of earlier injuries to the child was also capable of impermissibly prejudicing the jury against the appellant. Evidence of earlier injuries to the child which did not have a genuine probative effect in relation to the charges against the appellant should not have been admitted. Further, accurate and appropriately detailed instructions concerning the significance of evidence of prior injuries to the child, including directions concerning any assistance which such evidence might provide to the appellant, and the limits on the proper use of such evidence in proof of the appellant’s guilt, were called for. 
     
      
    14   In his summing-up the trial judge discussed in considerable detail evidence of two occasions on which the appellant had previously injured the child which the jury might feel were “worthy of … taking into consideration”.  
    15   Both from other evidence and the appellant’s statements to police, he struck the child early in May 1988, not long after he had begun associating with her mother.  
    16   The appellant told police that he “clipped [the child] … around the head”, and “left a hell of a bruise on her”, which “scared the hell out of [him]”. It was initially only a “little bruise” which “ended getting real big”. Contrary to his statements that he had not subsequently struck the child until the night when he killed her, the appellant told police “I’ve hit her since but like I’ve hit her with a little pillow I didn’t want to hurt her.” 
    17   Other witnesses, including the child’s mother, gave evidence that, following that assault by the appellant early in May 1988, the child had substantial bruising to her hips and / or thighs and her stomach “below her belly button”. Medical evidence was given that considerable force would have been required to cause the bruising. The child was subsequently observed to be limping and “leaning to one side”. According to some witnesses, the child also had bruises over the groin area, which a doctor who examined the child thought might have been caused by considerable finger pressure.  
    18   The appellant told the child’s mother that he had given the child, who was whinging, a “backhander on the nappy”, and, when “she didn’t stop … he hit her on the leg”. He told the child’s uncle that she “threw her head forward and her head hit his hand and her nose started to bleed.” 
    19   On Friday 15 June, the child was again injured while being cared for by the appellant. The appellant told her mother that the child ran into a wire fence when running away from a neighbour’s dog, fell over, got up, fell over again “and he picked her up again and then he went up and opened the front door and she was going up the stairs and … got to the second step from the top and fell and the railing on the side of the stairs stopped her from falling right down …”.He said that “she didn’t cry very much”. 
    20   The child received bruises to her buttocks and to both sides of her face. The bruises to her face, which extended from front to rear and involved her ears, “were very characteristic of slap marks” from an adult hand, according to a paediatrician who examined her. Considerable force was involved. The child’s grandmother gave evidence that “she was very badly bruised right down the right side of her face, right down to under her chin. There was just a mottled mass of bruises, they were sort of light and dark patches and from the bottom of her bottom to the back of her knees almost on both legs…” 
    21   The trial judge instructed the jury that the evidence relied upon by the prosecution to prove that the appellant had previously injured the child was evidence which might assist it to be satisfied that, at the time when he struck the child causing her death, he either intended to cause her death or grievous bodily harm or knew that her death was a probability and was recklessly indifferent to the loss of her life.  
    22   Considered in the abstract, the lack of detail in the summing-up might be regarded as objectionable. It was not explained to the jury how the evidence of the appellant’s prior violence towards the child could assist it to determine his state of mind when he struck and killed her. However, the appellant’s counsel plainly did not want the trial judge to elaborate. More detailed directions would have informed the jury that the earlier violence could assist it to decide on the nature and extent of the violence which the appellant inflicted on the child when he killed her, which could in turn assist it to determine whether he intended to cause the child grievous bodily harm, which was sufficient to support a murder verdict. The appellant’s counsel was expressly invited to object to the summing-up or request further directions or redirections and, understandably, declined to so. 
    23   Neither the admission of the evidence of the appellant’s earlier violently injuring the child nor the summing-up involved a miscarriage of justice.  
    24   In this Court, the appellant also complained that evidence was admitted of earlier injuries to the child which, it was submitted, might, on the evidence, have been caused by some other person, not the appellant. However, the appellant’s argument on this point took an artificially narrow approach to the inferences which were open to the jury and its entitlement to consider all of the evidence in conjunction. Further, the trial judge’s summing-up at least substantially diminished, if not eliminated, the significance of evidence of any injuries to the child which might not have been caused by the appellant. In the absence of any suggestion at trial that the trial had miscarried because of the reception of that evidence or any objection to the material portion of the summing up or request for a redirection or further directions, a conclusion that there has been a miscarriage of justice because of that evidence is unwarranted. 
    25   In summary, there was no miscarriage of justice associated with the appellant’s conviction for murder. 
     
      
     The appellant’s conviction for sexual assault - grounds 3 and 4 
    26   The appellant’s attempt to challenge his conviction for sexual assault can be disposed of briefly. 
    27   The appellant seeks to raise arguments that the trial judge omitted to instruct the jury that the appellant was not guilty of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault unless he intended to penetrate the child’s vagina, and that he was not in any event guilty of sexual assault because the prosecution had not proved that he penetrated her vagina since all her injuries were external to her vagina. 
    28   At his trial, the appellant’s case was that he had only struck the child once, by a “backhand” blow to her abdominal region, and had not touched her genitals. Alternative, potentially inconsistent, contentions were not raised; for example, the possibility of a prodding or jabbing blow which might have unintentionally caused the injuries to the child’s genitals through her clothing. And the possibility that, although caused by the appellant, those injuries did not involve penetration of the child’s vagina was expressly abandoned by the appellant, through his counsel, in the presence of the jury. 
    29   There were doubtless forensic reasons for the appellant’s approach at his trial. His claim that he had only struck the child a single blow of the type which he described was important to his defence of both the murder and the sexual assault charges. Further, the contention now sought to be raised that all the injuries to the child’s genitals were external to her vagina was inconsistent with some medical evidence and, if accepted by the jury, would have resulted in a conviction for attempted sexual assault, not sexual assault, if the prosecution case on those alternative charges was otherwise accepted. 
    30   There was no miscarriage of justice associated with the appellant’s conviction for sexual assault. 
    31   Conclusion 
     
     An extension of time to appeal against the appellant’s convictions for murder and sexual assault should be refused.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 25 February 200070064/99 - REGINA v Flocerpina DIAZJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: The accused is charged that on 26 May 1999 at Hamilton New South Wales she murdered Samuel Diaz. At the commencement of the trial yesterday I directed that a plea of not guilty be entered. In defence of the charge she has by her counsel admitted the whole of the Crown case but has asserted that she is not criminally responsible for her act because at the time of the events giving rise to the charge she was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for her action. It has been submitted by counsel on both sides that the Court should return a special verdict that the accused is not guilty because of her mental illness. 
     
      
    2   On 14 February 2000 the accused signed a form of election for trial by judge alone, having received advice from her solicitor and counsel. The Crown consented on 17 February 2000. Notwithstanding questions about her mental capacity on the day of the events giving rise to the charge, counsel for the Crown and the accused are satisfied that the accused had the mental capacity so to elect. It is clear from the report of Dr Westmore of 17 February 2000 that the accused has the capacity to elect. 
     
      
    3   On 26 May 1999 the accused and her child Samuel were alone in the house where they lived in Hamilton, a suburb of Newcastle. The child was seven years old. The accused stabbed him a number of times with a long kitchen knife and pushed the knife through the left eye into the brain for the whole of the length of the blade. Her husband found her when he came home from work. She was seated near the child with her hand in his mouth. She was muttering incoherently and smearing blood on her clothes. 
     
      
    4   The accused is a forty-six year old woman who was born in the Philippines and grew up in a stable family. She learned English and Filipino. She obtained a science degree. She worked as a laboratory technician and for a short time as a clerk. For several years she worked in a business conducted by her mother. She came to Australia in 1991 and married her husband at the age of thirty-six or thirty-seven. They lived in Newcastle where her husband was employed as a rigger. 
     
      
    5   On 13 March 1992 the child Samuel was born in Newcastle. The accused was attended by an obstetrician, Professor Giles. She developed a mental illness which was said to be post-natal depression, as part of which she believed that Professor Giles was using her son for experiments. She believed that Professor Giles was in love with her and was manipulating her life. He told her in her head about his special feelings for her. 
     
      
    6   The accused was treated by Dr Fiona Green from the crisis team at the hospital and was put on medication. Her predominant symptoms were auditory hallucinations and delusions. Her illness lasted two years. After that time she returned to the Philippines where she was treated with herbal medicine. She returned to Australia. 
     
      
    7   In January 1995 the accused gave birth to a daughter in Newcastle but the child died at five days of age from an intracranial haemorrhage. The accused suffered a recurrence of psychotic symptoms with delusional ideation involving Professor Giles. That was in spite of the fact that Professor Giles avoided any involvement in the second birth, having been informed about the symptoms of the accused’s mental illness after the birth of the first child. The accused was treated as an in-patient and later as an out-patient. Her symptoms slowly abated once again. 
     
      
    8   On 16 May 1999 the accused again exhibited delusional ideation about Professor Giles. She was visited at home and assessed by her case manager, Sister Hunt. She remained psychotic but was reluctant to agree to an increase in her anti-psychotic medication. She refused anti-psychotic medication by slow release injection. 
     
      
    9   On 24 May 1999 Sister Hunt visited the accused at home and thought that she was slightly improved. 
     
      
    10   On 26 May 1999 the accused’s husband left the flat where they lived to go to work. During the day Dr Cohen and Sister Hunt visited the accused at home. She was assessed as being thought disordered and displaying signs of her psychiatric illness, though she appeared to be responding to medical treatment. Dr Cohen and Sister Hunt tried by questioning her to assess whether there were a risk that she might harm herself or others but she remained guarded and denied symptoms that might suggest the existence of that risk. 
     
      
    11   During the late afternoon and evening of 26 May 1999 screams were heard coming from the general direction of the accused’s flat. One was thought to come from the child and some from the accused. 
     
      
    12   After she was found with the dead child the accused was taken to the James Fletcher Hospital where an examination and emergency treatment were carried out. She was admitted as an involuntary patient. 
     
      
    13   The accused was seen by Dr Westmore for the purpose of an opinion about her mental state at the time she killed her child. Dr Westmore wrote reports on 10 August 1999 and 17 February 2000. He gave oral evidence. The Crown qualified Dr Strum, who provided a report on 5 November 1999. 
     
      
    14   The accused appeared to Dr Westmore as an alert and attentive historian without ideas of reference from television or radio. She had a blunted unresponsive affect and spoke in a monotonous way, mainly in response to questions, but there was some spontaneous speech. She expressed delusional thoughts relating to the child, the Jehovah’s Witnesses and Professor Giles. Dr Westmore thought that the accused was stressed because her son was apparently having some school difficulties, for which she had approached the teacher and the principal, who had tried to assist her. There is support for that assertion. 
     
      
    15   Dr Westmore thought that when the accused killed her son she was suffering from delusional beliefs of a persecutory nature with erotomanic feelings towards Professor Giles and a distortion of religious views. She had either auditory hallucinations or thought insertion, the content of which appeared to be directly related to the homicide. She also had some features of the Capgras syndrome, a rare condition in which the patient believes that a close person has been replaced by an exact replica. In this case, Dr Westmore thought, the accused held the view that the child was a dummy and that, despite the stabbing, he was not dead. Dr Westmore thought, however, that this was not a pure case of the Capgras syndrome but that she suffered similar symptoms in conjunction with another illness, most likely a paranoid schizophrenic condition. 
     
      
    16   Dr Westmore is of the view that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the incident, suffering from a disease of the mind which totally deprived her of her capacity to know that she ought not to do the act. He thought that there might also be an issue whether she was aware of the nature of what she was doing, that is, that it would lead to the death of the child, but could find no evidence to indicate that she did not understand the quality of her actions. 
     
      
    17   Dr Strum was furnished with a copy of Dr Westmore’s first report. He was in entire agreement with it. He concluded that the accused had suffered three bouts of an illness which was at first thought to be puerperal psychosis but which, on the third occasion, when her illness was not related to child birth, indicated very clearly a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Dr Strum was of the view that at the time of the killing the accused was psychotic and not in control of her actions. He thought that she probably knew the nature of what she was doing but had no concept of the wrongness of her actions. He thought that the psychotic belief that she had not killed her child but a dummy probably helped her to act as she did, because the killing was so much against her nature. Like Dr Westmore, Dr Strum thought that although some features of the Capgras syndrome were present, this was not a case of pure Capgras syndrome. He thinks that the thought that the child was a dummy was merely an act denying what happened. 
     
      
    18   It is for the accused to prove that it is more likely than not that the illness from which she was suffering when she killed her child so affected her that either she did not know what she was doing or that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong. The Crown prosecutor submitted that on all the evidence the accused must be taken to have proved that her illness at the time prevented her knowing that what she was doing was wrong. In my opinion that was a proper submission. In my opinion the verdict contended for by both counsel is the only one to which the Court could properly come. This is a truly tragic case because the accused had no criminal tendencies and no control over her illness. 
     
      
    19   The sympathy of the Court goes out to the accused and her relatives. 
     
      
    20   The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990. The Tribunal will review the accused’s case and make recommendations to the responsible Minister at prescribed intervals about the detention, care and treatment of the accused. In making any such recommendation the Tribunal will have regard to the safety of members of the public as well as to the continuing health and needs of the accused herself. 
     
      
    21   I find that the accused is not guilty of the charge by reason of mental illness. I order that she be detained in a hospital until released by due process of law.

       JUDGMENT -  
       Admissibility of Record of Interview with Joanne Rose Delly 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: Mr Crawford-Fish, who appears on behalf of the accused, Joanne Rose Delly, made application for me to exclude evidence of an interview between Senior Sergeant Little (as he then was) and his client conducted at the Queanbeyan Police Station on 20 June 1998. 
     
      
    2    It was agreed that this preliminary issue might be determined on a voir dire hearing prior to the Crown’s opening.  
     
      
    3    The grounds of challenge advanced were as follows: 
     
      
      (i) the interview was not tape recorded and is accordingly rendered inadmissible by virtue of the operation of s 108 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
        
      1986 
      ; 
       
      (ii) the making of the admissions was influenced by a threat made to the accused by a police officer and, accordingly, the evidence of the contents of the interview is inadmissible by virtue of s 84(1) of the  
      Evidence Act 1995 
       (“the Act”); 
       
      (iii) the accused was unlawfully detained at the time of the admissions and, accordingly, I would reject evidence as to the contents of the interview pursuant to s 138 of the Act; 
       
      (iv) the admissions had little probative value and should, in any event, be excluded pursuant to the exercise of discretion. 
       
      
    4    The accused was living in a de facto relationship with Mark Helmhout as at 20 June 1998. She was the mother of two infant children. They were all living at 10/30 Trinculo Place, Queanbeyan on the date of her arrest. Mark Helmhout’s younger brother, Pieter, was staying at those premises at that time.  
     
      
    5    On Friday 19 June 1998, Mark and Pieter Helmhout together with the accused, Joanne Delly, and others attended the funeral of Mark and Pieter’s brother, John. Following the funeral there was a wake held at the Raiders Club, Mawson. Thereafter, some members of the party, including Mark and Pieter Helmhout and the accused, returned to the Trinculo Place unit. It is the Crown’s case that, during the course of the evening, a man named Paul Harris (who had also attended the funeral and the wake) was strangled by Mark and Pieter Helmhout. His body was then removed from the unit and taken by car to a park in Fyshwick where it was dumped. A man named Edward Szkudelski was present both at the killing and during the disposal of the body. Sometime thereafter, Mr Szkudelski made contact with police and informed them of the location of the deceased’s body.  
     
      
    6    Following the discovery of the body, the police obtained a warrant to search the Trinculo Place unit. A number of police executed that warrant at around 8.30am on the morning of 20 June. Mark and Pieter Helmhout were arrested and conveyed to the Queanbeyan Police Station. They were in due course charged with the murder of Paul Harris. 
     
      
    7    It appears that a short time later the accused was arrested and taken to the Police Station. She had her daughter, Jasmine, then aged seven months with her.  
     
      
    8    Senior Constable Hughes gave evidence that he had seen the accused at the Queanbeyan Police Station sometime between 8.30am and 9.00am that morning. He had been directed by Senior Sergeant Little to “baby sit” the accused. He and Senior Constable McGee sat with the accused in an office at the Police Station. He said the only other person present was Senior Sergeant Little who would come into the office periodically to check if everything was alright. Senior Constable Hughes chatted generally with the accused while they were in the office. He described it as general banter; “how have you been”, “how’s the bub”, “good baby” and the like. 
     
      
    9    At 9.45am, Senior Constable Hughes had a conversation with the accused which he recorded in his notebook. Senior Constable McGee was present at this time. Senior Constable Hughes commenced by cautioning the accused. Then he asked her for an account of her movements on the previous day. She said they had gone to the funeral and later to the Raiders Club at Mawson. At about 11.30pm they had left the Club and gone home. She gave the names of a number of people who were present at her home. She went on to state that she had had a fair bit to drink and that she had gone to bed. Senior Constable Hughes then explained that he intended to conduct an electronically recorded interview with the accused. She inquired whether she had to do that. The officer told her that she was not obliged to, which the accused replied, “can I make a statement?”. Senior Constable Hughes said, “Yes” to this question and the accused replied, “Then I do that”. The accused signed and dated the entry in Senior Constable Hughes’ notebook. 
     
      
    10    Senior Constable Hughes did not arrange to take a statement from the accused following this discussion. He decided to wait for Senior Sergeant Little. The latter was a more experienced detective and Senior Constable Hughes believed that, given the gravity of the matter, it was appropriate to defer any statement taking or further interview of the accused until he obtained a direction from Senior Sergeant Little. Senior Sergeant Little was in liaison with other detectives concerning the investigation and Senior Constable Hughes did not feel he had sufficient information at his command to interview the accused. 
     
      
    11    At some point during the morning, Senior Constable Hughes and Senior Constable McGee escorted the accused and her baby back to the Trinculo Place unit to get some items for the baby and then they conveyed the accused and the baby to a child minder. The accused was brought back to the Queanbeyan Police Station.  
     
      
    12    At 1.50pm, Senior Sergeant Little conducted an interview with the accused in an upstairs room at the Police Station. Senior Constable Hughes and Senior Constable McGee were present during the interview. The interview was recorded in Senior Sergeant Little’s notebook. In all, the accused was asked 81 questions (including a number of formal questions at the conclusion of the interview). The interview was not concluded until 4.55pm. 
     
      
    13    At the commencement of the interview the accused was, again, cautioned that she need not say anything. She was asked if she wished to communicate with a solicitor. She was asked if she agreed that she had earlier said she did not wish to be interviewed by way of a recorded interview. She agreed that was the case and gave as her reason, “I’d just rather make a statement”. In response to that, Senior Sergeant Little commenced to ask her questions which he recorded (together with her answers) in his notebook. In the course of this interview, the accused gave a detailed account of the events of the preceding evening. She described being present when Pieter and Mark Helmhout commenced assaulting Paul Harris. She had seen Pieter pick up a cord. He had told her to go to the bedroom. She was aware the deceased had been strangled. It was not clear that she had witnessed this, however, Pieter and Mark had told her what they had done. The deceased’s body was in the kitchen of the unit. The accused told Pieter and Mark to get the body out of her house. Pieter, Mark and Edward Szkudelski took the body away. While they were absent, the accused cleaned up the beer bottles and the ashtrays. She mopped some blood off the floor because Pieter asked her to give it a clean. About half an hour later, Pieter and Mark returned. Pieter walked straight to the couch. The accused had a smoke and went to bed. Mark had a throbbing headache so he went to bed. 
     
      
    14    At the conclusion of the interview, the accused was asked to read the notes. She did so and confirmed that they accurately recorded the interview. She was asked if any threat, promise or inducement had been held out to her to give the answers she had given in the interview. She said not. She was asked if the answers made by her had been given of her own free will and she said, “Yes”. She signed each page of the notebook. 
     
      
    15    After the interview, she was escorted by Senior Constable McGee to another room in the Police Station. At 5.35pm she was conveyed back to the Trinculo Place unit by Senior Constable Hughes and Senior Constable McGee. The officers then took her to collect her children and appear to have then driven her to premises in Mawson where she stayed.  
     
      
    16    On 1 July, the accused attended the Queanbeyan Police Station and was shown a typewritten transcript of the notebook record of her interview with Senior Sergeant Little. She signed each page of that transcript acknowledging it as an accurate account of her interview with Senior Sergeant Little. She supplied police with a three page typewritten statement supplying further information concerning her knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the killing of Paul Harris. This statement was taken in the form of a standard witness statement. No caution was administered prior to it being taken. 
     
      
    17    Senior Sergeant Little said that, at the time he interviewed the accused on 20 June 1998, he did not suspect that she had committed an offence. He remained of that view when he obtained the witness statement from her on 1 July 1998. 
     
      
    18    It appears Senior Sergeant Little was the officer principally responsible for the conduct of any inquiries concerning the accused as at 20 June 1998. He said that, in the technical sense, the accused was classified as under arrest while she was at the Police Station that day. His own attitude was that, had she indicated she wished to leave, he would have permitted her to do so. 
     
      
       
      Section 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       
      
    19    Mr Crawford-Fish submits that the evidence of the admissions contained in the interview are not admissible since the requirements of s 108(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 have not been met. The Crown accepts that the admissions contained in the interview are admissions caught by s 108. Section 108(2) is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless:  
         
         
        (a) there is available to the court: 
         
          
         
          
          (i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or 
           
            
           
          (ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or  
           
          
         
        (b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made.” 
        
       
      
    20    Section 108(4) provides that “reasonable excuse” includes the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded.  
     
      
    21    Mr Crawford-Fish accepts that his client refused to agree to her interview with Senior Sergeant Little being electronically recorded. It is his submission that s 108(2)(a)(ii) mandates that, in such a case, the investigating official obtain a tape recording of the person’s statement that he or she refused to have the questioning tape recorded.  
     
      
    22    I do not consider s 108(2)(a)(ii) bears the construction for which Mr Crawford-Fish contends. I am satisfied that the Crown has established (within the meaning of s 108(2)(b)) that there was a reasonable excuse why a tape recording, as referred to in s 108(2)(a), could not be made. Accordingly, this ground of challenge to the admission of the contents of the interview fails. 
     
      
       
      Section 84 of the Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    23    The accused said that, while she was at the Queanbeyan Police Station that morning, a police officer said to her, “if I didn’t tell the truth and I went to Court I would look like a bad mother”. The accused said she considered this remark to be a threat. It led her to decide that she should tell the police the truth. Thereafter, she participated in the interview with Senior Sergeant Little. 
     
      
    24    On the accused’s behalf it was submitted that the making of such a remark in the circumstances amounted to oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 84(1) of the Act and that the Crown had failed to show that it had not influenced the accused in the making of the later admissions to Senior Sergeant Little.  
     
      
    25    The Crown Prosecutor accepted that, if the remark was made, it would amount to oppressive conduct for the purposes of s 84(1). He submitted that I would reject the accused’s evidence as to the making of the remark.  
     
      
    26    It was the accused’s account that when she was taken to the Police Station she had been spoken to by a police officer who asked her questions about what had happened the previous night. She had told lies to him and been caught out. It was at this time that the officer pointed out to her if she didn’t tell the truth and the matter went to court she might look like a bad mother. The officer who said this to her was in the room from the start when she was taken to the Police Station (T.155 line 26). She was asked what happened after that and she said, “Well, I got caught out and then I had the threat actually made to me, so I thought that, something in my brain just told me that I’d better tell the truth because I could lose my kids” (T.155 line 32). 
     
      
    27    The Crown submits that I would reject the accused’s evidence since she was at odds with both Senior Constable Hughes and Senior Constable McGee who described no such incident. They were present with the accused in an office at the Police Station during the morning prior to the time when Senior Sergeant Little conducted his record of interview with her. 
     
      
    28    No evidence was led to establish who arrested the accused or who conveyed her to the Queanbeyan Police Station. When Senior Constable Hughes first saw her she was already in the office at the Police Station. Thereafter, he described himself and Senior Constable McGee as, effectively, “baby-sitting” her. 
     
      
    29    It was Senior Constable Hughes’ recollection that Senior Constable McGee had been present with him and the accused throughout the morning (T.134 line 26). Senior Constable McGee said that he had attended to other duties which had taken him out of the office where Senior Constable Hughes and the accused were located. His Duty Book entries tended to confirm that to be the case. It was his recollection that Senior Constable Hughes was not present in the office with the accused the whole time either but that he had come and gone too (T.147).  
     
      
    30    The accused’s evidence was, at times, difficult to follow as to the sequence of events that morning at the Police Station and as to which officers were present at relevant times. Evidence was led to show she has no criminal record. She said that she had been “stressed out”. I accept that she was. I did not think the lack of precision in her evidence affected its reliability in the sense of truthfulness. I was inclined to believe the accused. I think it likely that, at an early stage while she was present at the Police Station that morning, a remark of the character which she describes was made to her by a police officer. It is not suggested that Senior Sergeant Little nor Senior Constables Hughes or McGee made the remark. 
     
      
    31    It is clear that the accused was asked some questions by Senior Constable Hughes at about 9.45am and that these were recorded in his notebook. At that time, the only information she gave concerning events following the return to the Trinculo Place unit was that she had gone to bed. When the accused spoke to Senior Sergeant Little she abandoned this stance and admitted to having been present during some of the assault upon the deceased and to the events which took place thereafter. It was not clear to me whether the accused was saying that the threat had been made prior to 9.45am. There is nothing in the account of the conversation between herself and Senior Constable Hughes which shows her being caught out lying. If the threat was made prior to this time, how can it be said that it influenced the making of the later admissions? She was, after all, prepared to be less than truthful in the conversation she had with Senior Constable Hughes. Against this is the view that the accused was seeking to convey that the threat occurred after the initial conversation recorded in Senior Constable Hughes’ notebook but before the interview with Senior Sergeant Little. This is the sense of a passage in her cross-examination at T.159: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you said you started from scratch after the threat, was scratch when you had the first interview in the notebook? 
         
        A. Not that I can recall. I think it was after the first statement virtually before I’d actually given the truth about the one that we have exhibit.” 
        
       
      
    32    The onus lies on the Crown to establish that the making of the admission was not influenced by the making of the statement. The Crown Prosecutor points to the accused’s answers given at the conclusion of the interview in which she says that she was not subjected to any threat, promise or inducement and that the interview was given of her own free will. The Crown relied on this passage in the accused’s cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And I am saying to you that that answer was correct, that no threat had been made to you, what do you say to that? 
         
        A. It was but I didn’t think about it at the time.”  
        (T.163) 
        
       
      
    33    On one view the accused acknowledged by this answer that the earlier statement had not been operating on her mind at the time of the interview with Senior Sergeant Little. However, I think this is a too restrictive and somewhat artificial interpretation to place on it. I take the accused to have been saying that, when Senior Sergeant Little asked her the question at the conclusion of the interview as to whether she had been subject to any threat promise or inducement, she did not think of the earlier statement made to her concerning how she might be viewed by a court should she not speak truthfully to the police. 
     
      
    34    It is upon the Crown to affirmatively satisfy me that the statement did not influence the making of the admission. I do not consider the Crown has discharged that onus. Accordingly, I find that the contents of the accused’s interview with Senior Sergeant Little on 20 June 1998 are inadmissible. 
     
      
    35    I should note that, in the light of the evidence as to her unlawful detention, I would have excluded the contents of the interview in any event pursuant to s 138. The Crown readily acknowledges that the accused’s custody from around 8.30am to sometime a little after 5.30pm on 20 June 1998 was unlawful. She was arrested and conveyed to the Queanbeyan Police Station where she was detained throughout the day. There was no attempt made to comply with the provisions of Part 10A of the Crimes Act. I think the likely explanation for this is that no officer, connected with the investigation of the death of Paul Harris, suspected that she had committed an offence. Certainly Senior Sergeant Little (who appears to have been the officer most closely connected with the investigation with respect to the accused, Delly,) did not have such a suspicion. Nonetheless, she was held at the Police Station throughout the day. I accept that, had the accused told Senior Sergeant Little that she wished to leave the Police Station, he would have permitted her to do so. However, no one told her that. There can be no doubt she was in custody at least until around 5.30pm. At 9.45am, she told Senior Constable Hughes she would be willing to make a statement. No attempt was made to give her the opportunity so to do. Senior Constable Hughes considered the appropriate course was to wait for Senior Sergeant Little who had more knowledge of the progress of the investigation. No consideration appears to have been given as to whether the delay occasioned by waiting for Senior Sergeant Little was reasonable having regard to the requirements of Part 10A. 
     
      
    36    I consider the disregard of the accused’s rights evidenced by her lengthy unlawful custody to be serious. This is not to say that Senior Sergeant Little deliberately detained the accused unlawfully. The matter was not explored for the purpose of this voir dire inquiry. I had the impression that Senior Sergeant Little had not turned his mind to the question of the accused’s custodial status during the course of the day on 20 June 1998. He was frank in his evidence when the matter was raised.  
     
      
    37    Once it be accepted that evidence was obtained improperly or in contravention of the law, it is inadmissible unless the Court is satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it having regard to the way in which it was obtained. Having regard to the various considerations to be taken into account pursuant to s 138(3) of the Act, I would not be so persuaded in this case.

     REGINA v S L R 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: The applicant, S L R, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon her by Howie DCJ at the Port Macquarie District Court on 29 October 1999. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to an indictment containing four counts: the first count was steal from the person under s94 of the Crimes Act, 1900 (hereinafter ‘the Act’) which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years. 
    2   The second count was under s59 of the Act, occasioning actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. 
    3   The third count was under section 148 of the Act, steal from a dwelling, which carries a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude. 
    4   The fourth count was a further count under s94. 
    5   In relation to the first count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of three months penal servitude to commence on 29 October 1999 and to expire on 28 January 2000. In respect of the second count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of six months penal servitude to commence on 29 October 1999 and to expire on 28 April 2000.  
    6   In relation to the third count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of three months penal servitude to commence on 29 October 1999 and to expire on 29 January 2000. 
    7   Finally, in respect of the fourth count, his Honour imposed a minimum term of four months penal servitude to commence on 29 April 2000 and to expire on 28 August 2000, with an additional term of two years to commence on 29 August 2000 and to expire on 28 August 2002. His Honour directed that all sentences be served in a juvenile detention centre. 
    8   The applicant is of Aboriginal descent. She was born on 19 October 1981 and has lived all her life in the Kempsey area. 
    9   The applicant’s history is conveniently set out in a report of Ms Joanne Smith dated 28 October 1999. Ms Smith is a Juvenile Justice Officer at the Kempsey District Office of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
    10   On 1 August 1997 a child Tashaea was born from a relationship between the applicant and a young male living in the Kempsey area. That relationship has now ceased. In January/February 1998 Tashaea was placed with her paternal grandmother who resided in the Coffs Harbour area. The maternal grandmother, it is contended, hinders any contact between the child and the applicant by constantly moving her address and not advising the applicant of those details. 
    11   This separation from her child under these circumstances caused the applicant anxiety and emotional distress of a significant nature. Indeed, she commenced Family Law Court proceedings in about August 1998. It was about then that the offence in the first count was committed. The offences in relation to the second and third counts were committed shortly thereafter, on 2 September 1998, and the offence in the fourth count was committed on 7 October 1998. 
    12   According to the antecedent record before his Honour, the applicant was before the Kempsey Children’s Court in 1998 on assault and larceny matters. On that occasion she received the benefit of a two year good behaviour bond. On 11 August 1998, she was again before that Court on offences involving violence and she then received a further two year good behaviour bond which, of course, was current, as was the earlier bond, at the time of the commission of the subject offences. 
    13   At the time of the commission of these offences she was, to use a colloquial expression, “living rough”. 
    14   Unhappily, each offence which the applicant committed was extremely serious. I shall gratefully accept his Honour's summation of the relevant facts. As to the first offence, the applicant ran up to a 77 year old lady who was walking along the footpath in central Kempsey. The applicant took hold of her wallet, pulled it from her grasp, and ran off down the street. 
    15   As to the second and third offences, the applicant went into the home of a man who was then aged 76 who lived by himself and was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. His Honour said it was clear that this gentleman had been seen by young children in the community, perhaps particularly Aboriginal children, as a ready source of obtaining money for themselves by visiting his home and pretending friendship and in some way convincing him to part with money. 
    16   The applicant, because her associates were young people wandering around the streets, learned of this fact and went to the home. His Honour said he was certain that she went to the home to get money for herself as the other young people had done. Unfortunately, she was disturbed in the house by the resident. She then assaulted him by punching him and ultimately she picked up an ornament that was in the room and struck him over the head with it, causing a deep laceration to his skull. She stole his wallet, as well as some documents and left the premises. 
    17   Although the victim was taken to hospital, it would appear that no particular serious physical injury was inflicted upon him. 
    18   It would appear, however, that the applicant heard rumours that she may have killed him. His Honour accepted that for a couple of days the applicant experienced great anxiety as a result of this rumour and the possible consequences. 
    19   On 8 September 1998 the applicant was arrested and charged in relation to the first three matters. Between 8 September and 15 September she was in custody and on the last mentioned date she was released on bail. The fourth offence occurred within three weeks of her being released on bail. 
    20   The fourth offence again involved an elderly victim, a 75 year old male whom the applicant observed walking along the roadway in Kempsey towards the mall. The applicant approached him from behind, removed his wallet from his right hip pocket, and at the same time, pushed him heavily in the back so that he fell forward striking his head on the kerb of the roadway causing some minor bruising. 
    21   His Honour concluded that by reason of the serious objective factors, and despite the strong subjective factors, including the applicant’s problems with alcohol and drugs, he had no option but to impose a custodial sentence. His Honour noted that the applicant was at the time she appeared before him pregnant, expecting the baby to be born in June 2000. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “I really wish I could do something else other than to impose a period of detention upon her, and unfortunately I can see no way in which it cannot be detention running past the period in which she is going to have the child. If it were anything else it would simply not reflect the criminality.” 
       
      
      
     His Honour then went on to say: 
      
       
        
       “She is going to serve the sentence in a children’s detention centre, and I am sure that, well I can only hope that those people will do what they can to make it easier for her with the approach to her giving birth to the child and thereafter. 
        
        
       As I say, the sentence is designed to allow her to leave custody as soon as possible so that she can have the child back into the community with her Aboriginal relations and her de-facto as soon as possible.” 
       
      
    22   Mr Pincott, who appeared for the applicant before us, and who had earlier prepared written submissions, fairly and frankly did not seek to argue that the sentencing Judge to use his words, “acted improperly” in imposing the sentence that he did on the basis of the material before him.  
    23   However, this Court has now been informed that the Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre, where the applicant is presently detained, will not be able to accommodate the applicant’s new-born child immediately following the confinement. We were informed that there are, unfortunately, no other juvenile facilities in New South Wales which could so accommodate them. Thus, it was submitted that if the fact that the baby would be separated from his or her mother had been known at the time of sentencing, it would have been appropriate for his Honour to reduce the sentence solely for the purpose of preventing such separation and facilitating the bonding between mother and child. 
    24   In submissions in reply, the Crown understandably stressed that a lesser sentence would not reflect the objective gravity of the offences. Those submissions fairly accepted that the applicant should not be separated from her new-born baby because an order directing her to serve her sentence in a detention centre inadvertently deprived her of a facility which is available to adult female prisoners, namely, to keep their babies with them up to the age of five years. 
    25   It was submitted by the Crown that resolution of this problem could be achieved by quashing the last of the sentences imposed by Howie DCJ, and at the same time, re-imposing the same sentence but adding that the applicant should serve her sentence in a juvenile detention centre until she gives birth and thereafter be transferred to an adult prison. This would allow the applicant either to apply for release under s29(2)(c) of the Correctional Centres Act, or provide her with the facility of the full-time residence programme which enables children to live with their mothers in a correctional centre. 
    26   Details of this programme are contained in a brochure, which has helpfully been made available to the Court by the Crown, entitled ‘Mothers and Children Programme, Information Pamphlet’.  
    27   Mr Pincott has provided this Court with a copy of the judgment in Regina v X Y J, Unreported, NSWCCA, 15 June 1992. which makes it clear that the extensive powers contained in s24(1)(b) and (c) of the Children (Detention Centres) Act, 1989 are not available in respect of a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, notwithstanding that an order has been made under section 19 of the Criminal Proceedings Act that the term be served in a detention centre. Thus, from a legislative point of view, the applicant would be restricted, as the Crown has submitted, to an application for release under s29(2)(c) of the Correctional Centres Act. 
    28   This is a particularly disturbing matter. It was a disturbing matter for his Honour and it is a difficult matter for this Court. However, the authorities make it perfectly clear that the circumstances under which leniency can be afforded to an offender as a result of hardship to a third person are extremely limited indeed: see Regina v Edwards, (1996) 98 ACrimR 510. and in particular the judgment of Wells J in Regina v Wirth. (1976) SASR 291 at 295-296. 
    29   I am quite unable to conclude that in the circumstances of this case that demanding test has been met. 
    30   Mr Pincott has forcefully put upon this Court that the alternative suggested by the Crown of requiring part of the sentence to be served in an adult prison is too draconian, particularly bearing in mind that there is evidence of rehabilitation on the part of the applicant. Also, Mr Pincott stresses that one still does not know, even if the suggestion of the Crown is acceded to, that the favourable treatment for which the applicant would hope, would nevertheless be provided for her. 
    31   Giving these factors full weight, I am still quite unpersuaded, bearing in mind the information presently available to this Court which was not available to his Honour, that the quantum of the sentences imposed by his Honour should be disturbed. One can express confidence that the persons responsible within the corrective services system for the welfare of the applicant and the child which she is about to bear would be responsive to her needs. 
    32   To reduce this sentence, even despite the subjective circumstances as they now exist, would unfortunately result in a regime of sentences which could fairly be described as an affront to the administration of justice. 
    33   Accordingly, I would propose that this Court accept the proposals of the Crown. It would seem to me that it would be sufficient, however, for this Court to grant leave to the applicant to appeal and to uphold the appeal to the extent of varying the direction by Howie DCJ that the applicant serve her sentence in a juvenile detention centre by adding the words ‘until she gives birth to her proposed child and she thereafter be transferred to an adult prison’.  
     
      
    34   HIDDEN J: I agree. I should add that I think it is unfortunate that the deficiency in the Children (Detention Centres) Act identified in this Court in Regina v X Y J has not since been remedied. I hope the matter will be given attention by the appropriate authority. 
    35   The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Carruthers AJ.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: I will ask Smart AJ to give the first judgment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     SMART AJ: S D seeks leave to appeal against the severity of concurrent sentences comprising a minimum term of seven years and an additional term of three years in respect of each of six charges of armed robbery committed between 13 March and 5 April 1998. 
      
       
      
     3     
     In four cases the offensive weapon used was a knife and in two cases a blood filled syringe. The judge also took into account a further twenty five offences of either armed robbery (twenty instances) or assault with intent to rob whilst armed (five instances) with six of these offences being committed whilst armed with a blood filled syringe, seventeen whilst armed with a knife or scissors and two whilst armed with both a knife and blood filled syringe. Thus the applicant committed thirty one armed robberies or assaults with intent to rob whilst armed in twenty three days. Necessarily this involved putting a large number of people in fear of their own safety and well-being. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The sentencing judge pointed out that some of these people were young females (aged fifteen to twenty). The offences were committed at various commercial premises in the western and south western suburbs of Sydney and included service stations, newsagencies, supermarkets, pharmacies, fast food outlets and other retail shops in suburban shopping centres. Sums of money were taken. A further seven offences of larceny of motor vehicles and an offence of possession of cocaine were also taken into account. At the time of his arrest on 6 April 1998 the applicant said to the police: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It's about time I got caught. It's time to go back in, my run has come to an end. It's the drugs man, they just make you do it, I needed the money to keep up the habit."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     5     
     The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and at the first available opportunity. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The applicant was born on 31 March 1968. His adult criminal record began in 1989. He has committed a large number of offences, he has been in prison a number of times and there have been a number of property offences. Of particular importance was his conviction on 17 May 1995 of armed robbery, his sentence comprising a minimum term of three years from 21 January 1995 and an additional term of two years. The offences charged occurred within a short period of his release on parole. His parole was cancelled and he was required to serve the balance of the additional term of one year 11 months and 15 days commencing on 6 April, 1998. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The judge backdated the applicant's sentences to 6 April 1998 so that the applicant received credit for periods in gaol while he was also serving his additional term, that is from 6 April 1998 to 10 December 1998, the latter being the last date on which the sentence imposed by the judge could commence. Further, the applicant served but part of the balance of one year eleven months and fifteen days.  
      
       
      
     8     
     The judge found that the applicant's co-operation and admissions were of particular importance as only a small number of offences were supported to a sufficiently cogent degree by evidence of identification which provided reasonable prospects of conviction. The judge found that the applicant was entitled to the discount or leniency given to such pleas in accordance with  
     R v Ellis 
      (1986) 6NSWLR 603. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The judge further found that the applicant was entitled to a substantial discount for the assistance which he had given and will give in an important but unrelated murder matter where such assistance is critical. The judge noted that the applicant would spend his time in prison in protection and the onerous conditions that that involved. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The judge took into account the applicant's subjective features. He was born in Sydney of Greek parentage and had an unremarkable upbringing save for the separation of his parents when he was 16 years of age. He showed some early promise as a footballer but cannabis use, followed shortly by cocaine and heroin, at the age of 16 led him into theft and ultimately gaol. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The applicant was sent by his father to Greece but this change did not rid him of his drug habit. A number of attempts for rehabilitation have been made over the years but to no avail. At the time of these offences the applicant said that he was spending a thousand dollars per day on cocaine. He has been on a methadone program since 6 April 1998. The judge found that without a major change, and that did not appear to be imminent, the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were dim.  
      
       
      
     12     
     The judge found special circumstances. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The applicant complained that the sentences imposed did not sufficiently reflect the leniency to which he was entitled for providing evidence against himself where the Crown case would have otherwise failed and the discount for valuable assistance to the authorities. 
      
       
      
     14     
     In both cases the allowances had to be substantial. The judge did not specify the allowances which she made nor her starting point. She took an overall approach. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The real difficulty in this case is the extent of the applicant's criminality. The applicant's prior record did not help him. For the six offences of armed robbery with which he was charged he had to receive lengthy sentences; then the other offences had to be taken into account. In the circumstances a starting point of effective head sentences totalling 18 years with a minimum term of 14 years would not have been excessive. If this be correct, as I think it is, the sentences imposed involve an overall discount of forty five percent to fifty percent. The use of knives, scissors and blood filled syringes makes the offences very serious. 
      
       
      
     16     
     While the sentences imposed were lengthy, they had to be, given the nature and extent of the offences. In my opinion the sentences imposed do reflect the substantial allowances to which the applicant was entitled. The sentences were within the sound exercise of the judge's sentencing discretion.  
      
       
      
     17     
     I agree with the judge's remarks on sentence. The application for leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed 
      
       
      
     18     
     GROVE J: I agree and the orders of the Court therefore are, that the application for leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is dismissed.

    1    GROVE J: I will ask Smart AJ to give the first judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    2    SMART AJ: Kiet Huu Nguyen seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence comprising a minimum term of three years six months and an additional term of one year two months for the offence of demanding money with menaces. The applicant was convicted after a six day trial. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The judge found the following facts: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""At about 9pm on Wednesday 19 February 1997 a receptionist at 'The Wild Orchid' Private Hotel at 429A Pitt Street, Sydney received a telephone call from Nhan Thanh Troung. The receptionist did not know that man. He introduced himself to the receptionist as ""Tony"". Troung said that he wanted protection money of $500 a week and that he wanted to see the person in charge of 'The Wild Orchid' at 7pm on Friday 21 February 1997. The receptionist told the manager who in turn contacted the police. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         On Friday afternoon 21 February 1997 undercover police officers set up a video camera in the office of ""The Wild Orchid"" Private Hotel. Just after 7.15pm undercover police officers posing respectively as the manager of the private hotel and as a bartender saw Minh Han Ly and the prisoner Karauwan enter the reception/bar/lounge room next to the office. Each of them was armed with a loaded .22 calibre semi-automatic pistol. Neither of them had a licence authorising possession of those weapons. The weapons were not produced and were not visible. 
         
        
        
         
         A short time after the entry of Ly and Karauwan, Troung and Nguyen entered the premises. They were shown into the office by a staff member of the premises. The office was immediately adjacent to the reception/bar/lounge room. 
         
        
        
         
         The undercover police officer who was posing as the manager said to Troung, 'Who are you?' He said, ""My name is Tony."" The officer said to Nguyen, 'Who are you?' He said, ""I'm Kiet."" Troung then said to the officer, 'You know why we are here.' The officer said, ""No, why are you here?"" Troung said, 'Our brothers were here a couple of nights ago.' The officer said to Nguyen, ""What's he talking about?"" Nguyen said, 'Our brothers came here two nights ago and asked for money for protection.' The officer said, ""What happens if we don't pay?"" Troung said, 'If you don't pay tonight you have trouble, but if you pay I guarantee you are safe.' The officer said, ""Have you got a phone number I can contact you on?"" 
         
        
        
         
         Troung and Nguyen then engaged in conversation in their own language. Nguyen then said to the officer, 'No phone. We'll be back later, about 9 o'clock.' The officer said, ""What's wrong?"" Troung said, ""We come back 9 o'clock."" The officer said, 'I don't want any trouble.' Troung said, ""If you pay money, no trouble."" Nguyen then nodded his head in agreement. 
         
        
        
         
         Troung and Nguyen then walked out of the premises. They were followed by Ly and Karauwan. All four were then arrested by police outside the premises. 
         
        
        
         
         At least three of the four arrested men were part of a joint criminal enterprise to demand with menaces money from the private hotel with intent to steal it. Those three were Troung, Nguyen and Karauwan. 
         
        
        
         
         Karauwan's possession of a .22 calibre semi-automatic pistol was, to the knowledge of Troung and Nguyen, intended to be used for the purpose of enforcing the demand, if necessary, and/or for self safety purposes if the men got into trouble in attempting to carry out their joint enterprise."" 
         
        
        
       
      
    4    The applicant was born on 26 December 1973. His criminal record comprises seven convictions in the Children's Court on 4 June 1991 for two counts of malicious damage, two counts of using a motor vehicle without consent, and three dishonesty offences. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The judge found that the applicant had not shown any real contrition or remorse.  
     
      
       
      
    6    The applicant was born in South Vietnam. His family escaped from Vietnam and became refugees. They entered Australia in about 1983. He went to school and achieved his Higher School Certificate with a TER of 49. In 1997 he completed the first year of a TAFE course in electrical technology. He says that he wants to complete that course. 
     
      
       
      
    7    He comes from a stable and close family and he has a firmly established boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. All are supportive of him. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The applicant has had some intermittent employment. For six months prior to the offence he had been unemployed. The judge accepted this statement of the psychologist Mr W J Taylor: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems likely that his impulsiveness and identification with his peers was responsible for his involvement in the present offence. There is no evidence of any other factor which was influential in his behaviour."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    9    There was evidence that the applicant was immature. The judge was at pains to achieve parity of sentencing amongst the various co-offenders. He carefully assessed the role and circumstances of each and whether they entered a plea of guilty or not guilty. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The applicant contended that the sentence on its face was manifestly excessive. I do not agree. This was a bad offence. The applicant was one of a party of four men, two of whom were armed, who attended at the Private Hotel to extort money from the proprietor of the business on a continuing basis. These were standover tactics of a very bad kind. It is important that people are able to conduct their business and lives free of such illegal and frightening demands. The judge was correct in the view he took of the offence and the punishment it required. Public and personal deterrence are important. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The applicant submitted the judge erred in finding that the applicant was aware that Karauwan had a pistol. I do not agree. There was ample evidence to justify such a finding. This was a case of a planned visit by a group of four men, two of whom were armed, to require the owner of the business to pay protection money on an ongoing basis. Trouble was promised if it was not paid. 
     
      
       
      
    12    A previous demand had been made. It was not known whether those at the Private Hotel would yield or resist. The group had to be prepared for resistance. It is inconceivable, given the circumstances, that the applicant did not know that Karauwan was armed. The weapons were brought to add weight to the group's demands and to deal with any trouble. 
     
      
       
      
    13    The applicant submitted that the judge failed to properly consider the issue of parity between the applicant and Karauwan. As mentioned, the judge examined the issue of parity at some length. The applicant and Karauwan had different matters in their favour. Karauwan had no prior convictions and did not himself make any demand or threat. The applicant did not have a weapon. Karauwan had no previous convictions. The applicant did, albeit when he was a juvenile.  
     
      
       
      
    14    Both, however, were part of the group and they were there in sufficient numbers to handle most situations. Each would have been conscious of the re-enforcing provided by the others of the group. It is true that Karauwan was convicted of the additional offence of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place. The possession of the loaded firearm was ancillary to the demand for money and the steps taken to deal with any eventuality that could arise consequent upon resistance to the demand. In my opinion the judge did not err. I would reject the challenge on the ground of parity. 
     
      
       
      
    15    The judge is not open to criticism for noting that Justice Blanch, when he sentenced Troung, was not aware of the presence of firearms in the group when the demand was made. If Justice Blanch had been so aware it probably would have led to the imposition of a sentence greater than the one Troung received. That seems fairly obvious. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The applicant further submitted that the judge erred in determining that there were no special circumstances. The applicant was a relatively young man, this was his first custodial offence and he was probably influenced by some men who were a little older. He has now forsaken those acquaintances.  
     
      
       
      
    17    He was twenty four years of age at the time of sentencing. He has the support of his family and girlfriend. He does also have a TAFE course to complete. Fourteen months supervision should be sufficient. The judge did not err in not setting a longer additional term. 
     
      
       
      
    18    The minimum term of three and a half years was at the bottom of the range of sentences which could be imposed for the gravity of the criminality. Leave to appeal should be refused. 
     
      
       
      
    19    GROVE J: I agree. The order of the Court will be as proposed by Smart AJ.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Luland DCJ following the appearance of the applicant and his pleas of guilty to some thirty counts in one indictment and two counts in a further indictment. Those counts were representative of criminal conduct of the applicant extending from 1953 until approximately 1978 to 1980. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The offences involved depredation of a sexual nature upon some seven victims, all of whom were either members of, or step members of, or de facto members of various families of the applicant over the years. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant was born on 25 November 1922 and accordingly appeared for sentence when he had attained the age of seventy one years. As I have said, the counts presented against him were representative. 
      
       
      
     4     
     Facts were put before the learned sentencing Judge including, by consent, a statement which included a conclusion that each of the victims had suffered extreme emotional, psychological and physical torment that continued to affect their lives and the lives of their families. It further said that most of the victims have had the sexual and intimate relationships in their lives ruined because of the abuse they suffered at the hands of the accused. 
      
       
      
     5     
     His Honour imposed a number of sentences but the overall effective sentence was an encompassing term of a total of sixteen years divided into minimum and additional term components of twelve years and four years respectively. 
      
       
      
     6     
     There is no doubt that that could be described as a heavy sentence. Nevertheless, the criminality of the applicant was great; indeed, extreme. A number of facts relative to some of the representative counts have been extracted and it is appropriate in these brief remarks to recapitulate some of them to give substance to the observation that the criminality of the applicant was extreme. 
      
       
      
     7     
     One count involved anal intercourse with a step daughter. She bled heavily from the anus following the attack and was unable to go the toilet for several days because of the pain inflicted. Another count involved penile/vaginal intercourse with a step daughter aged eight. When he inserted his penis into her vagina she screamed. The applicant did not stop but placed his hand over her mouth and cut off her breathing until he had finished having intercourse with her. 
      
       
      
     8     
     In yet another count the victim was aged somewhere between seven and nine years when the applicant had anal intercourse with this male victim. He was his step son. After the attack the child had to crawl from the shed in which this offence took place. 
      
       
      
     9     
     Another count involved a victim who was a mere four years of age when the applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. When she screamed in her agony at what was being done to her, he placed a pillow over her head, holding it there until he had finished. 
      
       
      
     10     
     There are counts which demonstrate that it was not only sexual depravity which the applicant forced upon his victims but non sexual violence as well. There is a count which involved kicking a victim aged about ten to twelve years at a time when the applicant was wearing steel capped boots. The victim was rendered unconscious and it was several months before this female victim was able to return to school.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Another count involved a female victim aged nine. In this case, also, the applicant continued with his offence despite the fact that the victim was screaming in pain at what he was doing to her. This victim was the applicant's natural daughter. 
      
       
      
     12     
     A number of counts involved a son whom I will refer to as D who was eight years of age when the applicant grabbed him by the hair and dragged him into a bathroom. He put his head down the toilet, another example of non sexual violence.  
      
       
      
     13     
     However D was also the object of the applicant's sexual depravity. On one occasion the applicant forced this boy, aged four, to engage in an act of sexual depravity with the family dog. It is not necessary to describe what happened on this occasion. With this victim there were acts of fellatio performed on and by the victim. 
      
       
      
     14     
     It is this victim who spoke to the applicant in circumstances where arrangements had been made through police for a recording of their conversation to take place. The transcript of that very long conversation was before the sentencing Judge. A reading of it led his Honour to this finding that he had formed the view that the applicant just expected everyone to forget it (it being the many crimes charged in the indictment) and let him get on with his life. 
      
       
      
     15     
     Mr Hamill of counsel who has appeared for the applicant in this appeal, has taken us to a number of parts of the transcript of that conversation in order to support his submission that that finding was not open to his Honour. I would reject that submission. 
      
       
      
     16     
     It does not seem necessary in the present circumstances to go through the exercise of simply extracting portions of the transcript and it suffices to say that a reading overall of that transcript shows that the finding of his Honour was well open to him. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The applicant's age is a factual circumstance which does not require elaboration. The submissions on behalf of the applicant were considerably focused on the delay which has occurred since the last offence in about 1978 to 1980 and the matters coming before the court in the latter part of the 1990s. His Honour came to the conclusion that this was not a case in which the delay would operate to mitigate the sentence which he had otherwise assessed as appropriate in all the circumstances.  
      
       
      
     18     
     It is a matter of observation that every case is different and, as was pointed out by Allen J in  
     R v Holyoak 
      1995 82 A Crim R 502 there are extremes of circumstance concerning the potential effect of delay. There are some people who spend the time in effect waiting for justice to arrive and catch up, whereas there are others who are confident, as time goes on, that their misdeeds will not lead to any retribution. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The learned sentencing Judge found that this case fell into the latter category. In that finding I perceive no error. Undoubtedly the sentence, as I have already said, was severe but the criminality merited such a sentence. In the written submissions, challenge was made to his Honour's declining to find that there were special circumstances permitting a departure from the division of minimum and additional terms in accordance with section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. It suffices, in my view, to say that I perceive no error in his Honour's judgment and, indeed, given the overall circumstances, I would add that I would come to that same conclusion myself. 
      
       
      
     20     
     Accordingly, I propose the following orders: that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     21     
     SMART AJ: I agree. The conduct of the applicant was so gross that the sentences imposed, although severe, were well within the sound exercise of discretion by the sentencing Judge. 
      
       
      
     22     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by Mahoney DCJ in the Parramatta District Court. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to three counts in an indictment, those counts respectively charging sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, malicious wounding and stealing from the person. All of these offences involved the same victim in circumstances to which I will turn shortly. 
      
       
      
     3     
     His Honour imposed a total sentence of nine years penal servitude which he divided into Minimum and Additional terms of six years and nine months and two years and three months, applying the formula set out in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It is convenient to mention at the outset that the applicant appeared for sentence with the handicap of a very considerable prior record; although as counsel has pointed out many of the offences of violence appeared to have been committed in a domestic context. It nevertheless must be observed that the applicant has a very substantial record for offences of that character. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The applicant was born on 6 April 1970. I turn to a brief recitation of the facts concerning the offences. These are set out in more detail in the remarks on sentence of Mahoney DCJ. The victim was a young woman who was attending a nightclub which is operated in a hotel at Pennant Hills. She consumed a considerable amount of intoxicating liquor. She left the nightclub initially with a friend; it appears that the security personnel declined to allow her to re-enter the nightclub because she appeared to have been affected by her prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor. 
      
       
      
     6     
     After some discussion with her friend she decided to walk about in order to see if she could “sober up”, as she put it, when asked about the matter later. The applicant was nearby, he too had been partaking of intoxicating liquor. It suffices for present purposes to note that in the vicinity of the pedestrian rail crossing bridge at Pennant Hills the applicant approached and later attacked the victim. 
      
       
      
     7     
     He had forcible sexual intercourse with her and in the progress of his crime he stripped the victim and took her clothes. It may also be mentioned that he took her purse. The taking of the clothes and purse founding the third count in the indictment. At a point of the events the victim was wounded as a result of the attack by the applicant thus giving rise to the count of malicious wounding. 
      
       
      
     8     
     It can be noted that persons appear to have been passing in the vicinity but they did not immediately realise what was going on, Ultimately the applicant decamped leaving his victim naked and unconscious in this public place near the railway station. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The applicant drove himself to the home of a friend which was a considerable distance from Pennant Hills. The statement of that friend shows that when he was awoken by the applicant a conversation took place between them and amongst other things the applicant said to him: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I asked her for a cigarette. I sat next to her and started to talk to her and I started kissing her and she refused and she started verbally abusing me. I just snapped, king-hit her, knocked her flying. She was unconscious so I just ripped her clothes off her and started raping her."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     10     
     The friend said, with a certain amount of prescience, ""you have done it this time"". The applicant indicated that he was going to flee but he was ultimately arrested hiding in a wardrobe. He was located by a police dog. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The applicant broadly raised three matters in support of his appeal. These matters arise out of errors said to be detectable in the remarks on sentence of the learned sentencing judge. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The first proposition related to the error said to be made by his Honour taking into account the violence (the nature of which was specified in connection with the second count of malicious wounding) when describing the events that he found had taken place concerning the sexual intercourse. 
      
       
      
     13     
     It was pointed out that the charge under s 61I of the Crimes Act involved sexual intercourse without consent in distinction from other provisions in that Act which prescribe elevated penalties for aggravated offences of that nature. A circumstance of aggravation capable of being charged under one of those other sections would involve the violence and the doing of harm such as occurred in relation to the offence of malicious wounding. 
      
       
      
     14     
     It was contended on behalf of the applicant that in the light of the counts in the indictment to which pleas were offered and accepted it should be concluded that, despite what the applicant said to his friend, any violence meted upon the victim should be regarded as having been caused after the sexual intercourse had taken place. It was pointed out that it may be a circumstance of aggravation to accompany a forcible act of sexual intercourse with violence at the time or shortly before or after such offences. 
      
       
      
     15     
     No doubt his Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise bearing in mind the specifics of the counts in the indictment. It seems to me that he was properly entitled to look at the overall picture of what occurred. By the same token the applicant had an entitlement to be dealt with in respect of only the counts and specifically the ingredients of the counts charged against him. 
      
       
      
     16     
     However, given the facts which I have shortly sketched and the pleas of guilty to both malicious wounding and sexual intercourse without consent, it seems to me that it can be perceived that in any event accumulation would lead to a result no different from that which his Honour reached. 
      
       
      
     17     
     If there was error in his Honour taking into account the matters of violence on the first count it seems to me that it is not a matter which provokes the exercise of jurisdiction by this court bearing in mind a conclusion to which I have come, that in any event no lesser sentence than that passed by his Honour was warranted. 
      
       
      
     18     
     I turn, however, to the second matter specifically raised on behalf of the appellant. In the course of his remarks on sentence his Honour made reference to  
     Ramsey v Watson 
      118 CLR 642. His Honour recited from that authority the proposition that hearsay evidence does not become admissible to prove facts because the person who proposes to give it is a physician. In short in that case the court was dealing with histories given by patients to medical practitioners. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The advent of the Evidence Act 1995 has had the consequence that those histories become admissible as evidence of facts and to the extent that it might be thought that his Honour was ruling the evidence of the history given to Dr Westmore in the instant case inadmissible, he was in my respectful opinion, incorrect. Nevertheless his Honour added that in any event the history given to Dr Westmore did not in his opinion advance the prisoner's case at all and that the history should not be accepted. To my mind that indicates that his Honour had not ruled the material inadmissible but was rather rejecting its content. That rejection was within his discretion. 
      
       
      
     20     
     The third matter advanced on behalf of the applicant related to some remarks which his Honour passed concerning  
     R v Fernando 
      76 A Crim R 58. That well-known authority deals with the considerations which are applicable to persons of aboriginal background. There is no need for present purposes to recapitulate its content. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Mahoney DCJ said: 
      
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems to me that whatever benefits might have accrued to this offender out of Fernando's case have long since been lost to him"". 
         
        
       
       
      
     22     
     With respect to his Honour the matters canvassed in Fernando's case relate to the disadvantages that are frequently found to be borne by people of aboriginal background. It does not to my mind therefore give rise to something which is available at some time and expires; it is something which is always relevant to be taken into account where a person has that background. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Whether it is of any particular weight in a given case is of course a matter for a sentencing judge. But in so far as his Honour's remarks suggested that there is some sort of expiry upon the benefit to be had from the application of the principles expounded in that case, I disagree. 
      
       
      
     24     
     A fourth matter that was raised concerned his Honour’s declining to find special circumstances so as to alter the proportions of the total sentence differently from the formula set out in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act.  
      
       
      
     25     
     It suffices in my opinion to say that his Honour had discretion to make the findings which he did and they have not been demonstrated to be wrong. I would not interfere with his Honour's conclusion in this regard. 
      
       
      
     26     
     I return, however, to the matter which I have previously stated, namely that given the circumstances of these crimes I am of the view that there is no sentence other than that imposed by his Honour, whether greater or lesser, which should be imposed. 
      
       
      
     27     
     The jurisdiction of this court is specific in relation to substitution of sentence and in my view this is a case where even if the matters to which I have adverted be characterized as errors, there is no warrant for this court to intervene. 
      
       
      
     28     
     I propose the following orders: that the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     29     
     SMART AJ: There is considerable substance in the first three challenges to his Honour's remarks on sentence. However, the overall sentence was correct, even if some of the reasons were erroneous. 
      
       
      
     30     
     I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J. 
      
       
      
     31     
     GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I proposed.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60285 of 1999 
      
     HIDDEN J CARRUTHERS AJ Friday 25 February 2000 
     
     Regina v Malcolm Harry Bruce  
      
      
    Judgment - ex-tempore 
     
      
       
      
    1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Malcolm Harry Bruce, pleaded guilty before Woods DCJ to supplying commercial quantities of drugs, namely, methadone, cocaine and ecstasy. On each charge his Honour sentenced him to concurrent terms of five years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of three years and nine months, commencing on the date when the sentence was passed, and an additional term of one year and three months. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      
    2     Given the way the application has been argued, it is unnecessary to state the facts giving rise to the charges. It is sufficient to say that they arose from the applicant’s association with one Leslie Kalache, whose own substantial involvement in drug trafficking in this State can be gleaned from the decision of this Court in R v Kalache (2000) NSWCCA 2. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The applicant entered his pleas of guilty early. He is now sixty-two years old. He has a criminal record but it is of little significance for present purposes, and this is his first custodial sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    4     Apart from the period when he himself became involved in drug abuse, and in turn involved in these offences, his background is otherwise creditable. His Honour described him as a ""knockabout character"" and he was highly spoken of by a number of witnesses, who portrayed him as a devoted family man and a man helpful and generous to others in need. By the time he came for sentence he had abandoned his drug abuse and had already made substantial progress towards rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      
    5     No argument was addressed before us against the five-year effective sentence. The only submission was that his Honour should have found special circumstances warranting a different proportion between minimum and additional terms. It is clear that the matter of special circumstances was argued but in his Honour’s remarks on sentence he simply observed, without elaboration, that he did not find any. 
     
      
       
      
    6     Before us Mr Byrne SC, who appeared for the applicant, pointed to four matters which, it was said, dictated a finding of special circumstances: firstly, his early pleas of guilty to the charges; secondly, his mature age and the absence of any prior experience of imprisonment; thirdly, his better than average prospects of rehabilitation upon his release and fourthly, an illness which it was said would render his imprisonment more onerous.  
     
      
       
      
    7     That last matter is a reference to a medical report that was before his Honour by a general practitioner who had treated the applicant over a long period of time. The effect of that report was that more recently the doctor had treated him for severe depression arising from his withdrawal from his drug abuse. Although the report is not entirely clear upon this, it is reasonable to infer that the depression endured at the time of sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Mr Byrne submitted that the condition was one which should have been taken into account by his Honour on the question of special circumstances, relying to some extent by analogy upon the decision of this Court in R v Sellen (1991) 57 ACrim R 313. Mr Byrne also relied upon decisions of this Court from which it is clear that the discretion imposed by s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 to find special circumstances should not be unduly circumscribed and might be enlivened by a wide variety of factors. Mr Byrne took us back to the classic exposition of that subsection by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at pp120-121.  
     
      
       
      
    9     The fact remains, however, that the clear effect of authority in this Court on the question of special circumstances is that, for one reason or another, it must be demonstrated that there is a purpose to be served by a longer than usual additional term. That is not to deny that there can be cases in which the minimum term is reduced for no other reason than that there are particularly onerous conditions of custody imposed upon the prisoner.  
     
      
       
      
    10     The prisoner’s depression, whilst it has its origins in his withdrawal from drug abuse, is nonetheless a condition which no doubt many prisoners suffer from, merely from the fact of imprisonment. It is a condition which is amenable to treatment and appropriate treatment is available within the prison system. So much is clear from the report of Dr Olaf Nielssen, which we received this morning in the event of re-sentencing.  
     
      
       
      
    11     The other matters relied upon, that is, the applicant's early pleas of guilty, his maturity, the fact that this is his first experience of imprisonment and the fact of his better than usual prospects of rehabilitation are matters to which his Honour had regard in arriving at the overall sentence of five years. 
     
      
       
      
    12     This is indeed a very sad case. It is tragic that a man with this applicant’s background should so late in life have gone seriously off the rails and find himself in the predicament he now faces.  
     
      
       
      
    13     Nevertheless, fortunately, he has made considerable strides towards his rehabilitation and there is every reason to believe that he will maintain that course upon his release. As the Crown prosecutor correctly pointed out, the additional term of fifteen months is enough time to foster that process.  
     
      
       
      
    14     This is a case where it might have been open to his Honour, in the light of this material, to find special circumstances, but I cannot conclude that his Honour was in error in not doing so for the reasons I have enunciated. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    15     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    16     HIDDEN J: The orders of the Court will be those which I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J : 
       
      This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Rummery DCJ in the Sydney District Court. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant appeared before his Honour upon two indictments. On the first indictment, he pleaded guilty to the alternative count of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, and on the second indictment he pleaded guilty to a charge of breaking entering and stealing. 
      
       
      
     3     
     In respect of the second indictment, his Honour was asked to take into account an offence of malicious damage by fire. His Honour imposed sentences in respect of both indictments, and I shall in due course return to make some observations about the orders made in connection with the service of those sentences. 
      
       
      
     4     
     For present purposes it suffices to indicate that the encompassing sentence was imposed on the first indictment, being a total of eight years penal servitude divided into minimum and additional terms of four years each respectively. 
      
       
      
     5     
     I propose to deal with this matter in relatively a short form. There is no doubt that there is tragedy involved beyond the usual in this case. 
      
       
      
     6     
     It should be noted that the applicant was born with cerebral palsy and is an intellectually and physically disabled person. It is said in some of the reports which were before his Honour that he operates in some respects at the level of a seven year old. 
      
       
      
     7     
     On the other hand, in respect of some matters, for example, an interest in the mechanics of motor cars and the like, he seems to operate at a somewhat higher level. At the time of the offences with which Rummery DCJ had to deal the applicant was twenty three years of age. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The matters in the second indictment were the first in time. Briefly, on 5 April 1997, the applicant broke into a pie shop and stole $180 and whilst there he set fire to paper bags under a counter. The resulting fire caused damage to stock and equipment. It was said that the applicant later told someone that he had lit the fire because the lady at the pie shop had accused him of trying to steal her car. There seems to be no evidence to support this assertion. 
      
       
      
     9     
     Be that as it may, the applicant was on Supreme Court bail in respect of this matter when the events occurred which gave rise to the first indictment. 
      
       
      
     10     
     At about 7.30 pm on 2 February 1998 the applicant entered the victim’s home unit through a closed, but unlocked, wire screen door and removed a knife from a cutlery drawer. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The victim was himself a severely handicapped person and sight impaired. He was sitting in a darkened room with the television going. The applicant stabbed him some fifteen times causing grievous injury in a number of parts of the man’s body. He left the premises, having washed the knife and replaced it in the drawer. He pulled the door shut which activated a deadlock. Fortunately for the victim, the applicant’s mother, who happened to be visiting somebody in the same block of units, heard sounds of distress and ambulance officers were called and were able to break into the flat and take the victim for treatment. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The applicant has considerable antecedents. It was observed by his Honour that his prior record contained some ninety or thereabouts appearances for offences before courts. Obviously because of the handicaps he has been treated over the years for these many offences with a considerable amount of leniency. Many offences have been dismissed pursuant to section 556A of the Crimes Act and other very lenient impositions have been made. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The applicant draws attention to two matters primarily in support of this appeal. It is said that his Honour gave too much weight to the issue of general deterrence. His Honour stated in the course of his remarks that considerations of general deterrence loomed large notwithstanding the special nature of the prisoner’s intellectual and physical disabilities. 
      
       
      
     14     
     There is ample authority that persons of intellectual and like disabilities may not be suitable vehicles for the manifestation of general deterrence. Nevertheless, the law is not that such persons cannot be a vehicle at all for manifesting general deterrence. 
      
       
      
     15     
     His Honour was obviously alert to the necessity for specificity about this matter, and for my part I am unable to attribute error to his finding. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The next matter that was adverted to related to matters that were explored by professionals concerning ways in which the applicant may be able to be rehabilitated. It should be observed that over the years it has been the opinion of suitably qualified professionals that the applicant is fit to plead. That is to say, he understands the nature of charges brought against him and the proceedings. There is no reason to conclude that he was not aware of the criminality of his actions. 
      
       
      
     17     
     It is said by reference to statistics that this sentence, that is to say the encompassing sentence of a total eight years with a minimum term of four years, should be categorised as manifestly excessive. I am unable to uphold that submission. It seems to me that the enormity of the offence, including the attack upon the defenceless, unsuspecting and unprovoking victim is such that a sentence of the kind imposed by his Honour was warranted. Had the offender not been in the position of this applicant, in my view a much larger sentence would have been warranted. 
      
       
      
     18     
     I turn to a final matter which arises out of his Honour’s orders. I refer to the matters upon each indictment. His Honour imposed a sentence of eight years on the first indictment, and ordered it to commence on 2 September 1998. That date represented the expiry date of sentences for unrelated matters which the applicant was serving. He had in fact been in custody since on or about 2 February 1998 in respect of his arrest following the malicious wounding, and in respect, ultimately, of serving other sentence. 
      
       
      
     19     
     When his Honour came to sentence the applicant for the offence of breaking entering and stealing at the pie shop, the facts of which I have sketched, he said that he would take into account the matter on Form 1 and order a fixed term to commence on 2 February 1998 expiring on 1 April 1999. 
      
       
      
     20     
     He then said, after referring to the reason for the fixed term, “both the sentences are to be served concurrently”. It is pointed out that on any view, the sentence imposed for the breaking entering and stealing will be wholly subsumed within the minimum term component of the sentence imposed for the malicious wounding. 
      
       
      
     21     
     Counsel for the Crown has acknowledged that what his Honour has done in setting different commencing dates appears odd but has pointed to the circumstance that I have just mentioned, and said that therefore on any view what his Honour must have meant when he said that both sentences were to be served concurrently is that the second shorter sentence would be subsumed within the minimum term of the other. 
      
       
      
     22     
     Counsel for the applicant has argued that there is, to say the least, doubt about what his Honour intended and if he intended that the sentences were to be served concurrently then he has either made an error in not matching the commencing dates, or one can speculate there is a typing error in one or other of the commencement dates. 
      
       
      
     23     
     This court is not in a position to know, in the event that the latter is correct, which is mistaken. That is to say, whether February should read September, or whether September should read February. 
      
       
      
     24     
     I have come to the conclusion that there is sufficient lack of clarity about the matter to require this court  
      ex debito justitiae 
      to adjust the commencement date of both the sentences so that they fulfil the formula which his Honour expressed, namely that both the sentences would be served concurrently in the conventional sense that they would commence upon the same date. I would not, however, otherwise vary the sentences. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      
     26     
     That the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, that the appeal be allowed to the extent that the orders made by his Honour in respect of the first count be quashed and in lieu thereof the terms be specified as a minimum term of imprisonment of four years to commence on 2 February 1998, and to expire on 1 February 2002, together with an additional term of four years commencing on 2 February 2002. 
      
       
      
     27     
     Save those variations, the sentences imposed and the other orders made, are to stand. 
      
       
      
     28     
     SMART AJ: I agree. 
      
       
      
     29     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I proposed.

       JUDGMENT -  
       Admissibility of record of interview with Deborah Joy Davidson 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: On Wednesday 23 February 2000, Mr Stratton, who appears on behalf of the accused, Deborah Joy Davidson, made application for the contents of an electronically recorded interview between his client and police, made on 20 June 1998 (“the ERISP”) to be excluded from evidence. This application, together with a number of like applications made on behalf of the other accused, was dealt with after the jury was empanelled but prior to the Crown’s opening. 
     
      
    2    Mr Stratton’s challenge to the admission of the interview was made upon two grounds: 
     
      
      (i) the accused was unlawfully detained at the time the interview was conducted and it was thus inadmissible unless I was persuaded by the Crown that the desirability of admitting it outweighed the undesirability of so doing pursuant to s 138 of the  
      Evidence Act 1995 
       (“the Act”); 
       
      (ii) in the course of the interview the accused made plain that she did not wish to say anything beyond that which she asserted in answer to question 115. The continued questioning of her thereafter was improper and either attracted the operation of s 85(2) of the Act or, alternatively, should be excluded in the exercise of discretion pursuant to ss 90 and/ or 137 of the Act. 
       
      
    3    In the event that Mr Stratton’s challenge based upon ground (i) succeeded, it would provide a basis for rejecting the ERISP in its entirety. Mr Stratton informed me, in the course of submissions, that he was confining his application to the exclusion of that portion of the interview which follows question 114 (it should be noted that by agreement between the parties questions and answers 109 to 114 will not be pressed by the Crown). 
     
      
    4    At the conclusion of evidence taken on the voir dire and after hearing submissions from the Crown and Mr Stratton, I ruled that in the exercise of my discretion I would reject certain of the questions and answers contained in the ERISP. The passages which I rejected are as follows: questions and answers 141, 144, 169-180 inclusive, 184-259 inclusive. 
     
      
    5    I now give my reasons for so ruling. 
     
      
    6    I will deal firstly with the issue of the lawfulness of the accused’s custody. The accused was arrested together with Pieter and Mark Helmhout. The brothers Helmhout were arrested for the murder of a man named Paul Harris. All were arrested at premises at 10/30 Trinculo Place, Queanbeyan. The accused’s arrest was effected around 8.45am. The three were taken to Queanbeyan Police Station. The designated custody manager at the Queanbeyan Police Station on that day was Sergeant Dagwell. Pieter Helmhout was placed into the charge of the custody manager at around 9.05am. It appears that the process of completing the requirements imposed by ss 356M and 356N of the Crimes Act 1900 takes about twenty minutes or more. Sergeant Dagwell next dealt with Mark Helmhout whom he commenced to process at 9.30am. At 10.09am or thereabouts, Detectives Porta and Walpole introduced the accused, Deborah Davidson to Sergeant Dagwell. 
     
      
    7    Sergeant Dagwell read out to the accused a statement of her rights pursuant to Part 10A of the Crimes Act. He then obtained information from her which he recorded on the computer. At the completion of the custody manager’s protocol, the accused was placed in an interview room. She was kept there until 1.47pm when Detectives Porta and Walpole commenced the ERISP. The accused had been detained under arrest for around five hours at the time of commencement of the interview. The interview was not completed until 2.39pm. She was not charged until 6.55pm that evening. 
     
      
    8    Part 10A of the Crimes Act was introduced by the Crimes Amendment (Detention after Arrest) Act 1997. It commenced on 9 February 1998. The objects of the Part are set out in s 354. They include the provision of a period of time during which a person, who is under arrest, may be detained by a police officer to enable the investigation of his or her involvement in the commission of an offence. A police officer may detain a person, who is under arrest, for the investigation period provided by s 356D. Section 356C(4) provides that the person must be released within the investigation period (whether unconditionally or on bail) or brought before a justice, magistrate or court within that period or as soon as practicable after that period.  
     
      
    9    The investigation period is a period which begins when the person is arrested and ends at a time that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances; s 356D. It may not exceed the maximum investigation period. The maximum investigation period is four hours or such longer period as may be extended by a detention warrant. No detention warrant providing for the extension of the accused’s investigation period was sought or obtained in this case.  
     
      
    10    A justice of the peace was available on call on Saturday 20 June 1998 in Queanbeyan to hear applications for bail. The accused was not released nor was she taken before a justice until the following day, Sunday 21 June 1998. This history does not suggest that those responsible for the accused’s custody paid proper attention to the requirements of Part 10A of the Crimes Act. However, for the purpose of this application, I am concerned with the lawfulness or otherwise of the accused’s detention up to and including the time taken to conduct the ERISP.  
     
      
    11    Section 356E provides that, in determining what is a reasonable time for the purposes of s 356D(1), all the relevant circumstances must be taken into account. Section 356E(2) sets out twelve circumstances to which (if relevant) attention must be directed in determining this issue. Those twelve circumstances are not an exhaustive statement of the matters which may be taken into account. When the reasonableness of the period of time during which a person was detained under Part 10A is in issue in criminal proceedings, it is the Crown which bears the onus of establishing on the balance of probabilities that the period of time was reasonable.  
     
      
    12    Section 356F(1) provides that certain times are not to be taken into account in determining how much of the investigation period has elapsed. Those periods are set out in paras (a) to (m). Again, the onus lies upon the Crown to show on the balance of probabilities that a particular period of time ought not to be taken into account in determining how much of the investigation period has elapsed.  
     
      
    13    In this case, the Crown relied particularly on s 356F(1)(b) and (c). Paragraph (b) permits the court to disregard the time that is reasonably spent waiting for the arrival (at the place where the person is being detained) of police officers whose particular knowledge of the investigation, or whose particular skills, are necessary to the investigation. At the time of the arrest of the accused, police executed a search warrant on the premises at 10/30 Trinculo Place. A black ladies’ jacket was located in the bedroom in which the accused was sleeping. This jacket was the focus of considerable attention during the course of the ERISP. At the time of the accused’s arrest and when she was first brought back to the Queanbeyan Police Station neither Detectives Porta nor Walpole were in possession of the jacket. The jacket was brought back to the Police Station subsequently by Detective Senior Sergeant Little. A search of the jacket revealed a card belonging to the deceased.  
     
      
    14    The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the time spent waiting for the arrival of Detective Senior Sergeant Little and the jacket should not count towards the calculation of the investigation period.  
     
      
    15    Detective Porta said that the delay associated with the interview of the accused was occasioned both by waiting for the results of inquiries which were being conducted at the Trinculo Place unit and in waiting for the electronic recording interview room to become available (T.101). 
     
      
    16    Detective Senior Sergeant Little (as he then was) gave evidence that he collected the black jacket from the bedroom at the Trinculo Place unit. He left those premises with the jacket at about 10.15am and returned to the Queanbeyan Police Station. That journey took no more than five minutes. On arrival at the Police Station, he handed the jacket (and the card which had been located in the pocket) to Detective Walpole (T.110). 
     
      
    17    I consider that the prosecution has established that the time spent waiting for the return of Detective Senior Sergeant Little with the items of physical evidence should not be taken into account in determining how much of the investigation period had elapsed. 
     
      
    18    The remaining period from around 10.25am to 1.47pm was wholly referable to the delay in getting access to the ERISP machine. No inquiries were made to determine the availability of a portable machine. 
     
      
    19    Section 356F(1)(c) provides that a further period which should not count towards the investigation period is any time that is reasonably spent waiting for facilities, for complying with s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to become available. This was the principal basis upon which the Crown relied for its contention that the investigation period had not elapsed at the time of the commencement (or throughout) the ERISP.  
     
      
    20    Evidence was led on the accused’s behalf which tended to show that a portable ERISP machine had been available at the Queanbeyan Police Station on 20 June 1998. An interview conducted on a portable ERISP machine between Detective Nixon and Edward Szkudelski on 20 June 1998 at the Queanbeyan Police Station was in evidence before me on the voir dire.  
     
      
    21    Detective Porta said that he was not sure whether a portable ERISP machine was available at Queanbeyan Police Station on that day, although he was aware that there had been one available in the past (T.102). 
     
      
    22    Detective Walpole said that the morning had been spent waiting for the ERISP facility to become available. He was aware that a portable ERISP machine was available at Queanbeyan Police Station from time to time. He was not able to say whether that machine had been available at Queanbeyan on 20 June 1998 (T.114).  
     
      
    23    There was no challenge to the evidence that the interview room containing the ERISP machine was occupied up to 1.47pm or thereabouts when Detectives Porta and Walpole commenced their interview with the accused.  
     
      
    24    The portable ERISP machine permits the recording of an interview which complies with the requirements of s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act in that it tape records the contents of the interview. However, it does not have the capacity to record the interview on videotape. I accept that a portable ERISP machine was present at Queanbeyan Police Station on 20 June 1998. There is no evidence that it was in use prior to 1.30pm when the interview with Mr Szkudelski was commenced.  
     
      
    25    It appears clear that the lengthy delay, prior to the commencement of the interview, was brought about by waiting for the standard ERISP machine to become available. In the initial phase of the interview, after obtaining the accused’s agreement that her rights under Part 10A of the Crimes Act had been read to her, this question and answer are recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you agree since then we’ve pretty well been waiting for the availability of this machine and you’ve been waiting and had some lunch and some more smokes and coffee? 
         
         A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    26    Prior to the interview the accused was provided with refreshments. Section 356F(1)(j) provides that this period of time is to be taken out when calculating the investigation period. There was no evidence as to how long was taken up with the provision of lunch to the accused. It would seem that at least two hours were spent waiting for the ERISP equipment after the time when the jacket and card were made available to Detectives Walpole and Porta. The interview itself occupied another 52 minutes.  
     
      
    27    Neither Detective Porta nor Detective Walpole appears to have turned his mind to the question of whether an alternative to the standard ERISP machine might be available. I do not consider this omission to mean that the time spent waiting for the ERISP was not reasonable within the meaning of s 356F(1). The delay occasioned by waiting for the ERISP interview facilities to become available was a long one. On balance, I consider that it remained within the bounds of that which was reasonable. Accordingly, I do not consider that the accused’s custody was unlawful as at 1.47pm or during the balance of the time taken up by the interview. 
     
      
    28    I should note that if I were to have found that the accused’s custody was unlawful, I would have been of the view that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it having regard to the manner in which it was obtained; s 138(1). In this regard, I consider that the matters to be taken into account pursuant to s 138(3) favour admission. I accept that Detectives Walpole and Porta did not deliberately shut their minds to the availability of alternative equipment to the standard ERISP machine which was located at Queanbeyan Police Station. I would not categorise any failing on their part as deliberate or reckless within the meaning of s 138(3)(e).  
     
      
    29    The second ground of challenge related to the conduct of the questioning of the accused. During the interview, the accused was asked some questions concerning the purchase of a train ticket with a pension card. This line of questioning concluded with this exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.114 O.K. How did you get, which train station did you arrive at?  
         
        A. I won’t answer it. 
         
        Q.115 In relation to any of these matters do you wish to answer any more questions at all? 
         
        A. All I’ll say is I went to bed last night, I crashed out and I just spun out, I mean, all I did was come down for a funeral.” 
        
       
      
    30    Mr Stratton submitted that, by her answer to question 115, the accused indicated an unambiguous intention to say nothing more than that which is embodied in the answer. For the police to persist with further questions thereafter was to disregard the accused’s right to silence. It was submitted that I would reject the balance of the interview following answer 115 in the exercise of my discretion pursuant to ss 90 and/or 137 of the Act. 
     
      
    31    I viewed that portion of the videotape of the interview showing answers 114 and 115. It is to be noted that answer 114 is plainly referable to the accused’s refusal to answer further questions on the topic of the rail ticket. I do not consider answer 115 to be a statement that the accused was refusing to answer further questions generally on the topic of the investigation into the death of the deceased. I note the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Clarke (1997) 97 ACrimR 414 at 419-20. His Honour observed that it is a question of degree as to whether persistence has crossed the line so as to render it unfair to the accused to use the answers in evidence. I do not believe that line was crossed by the questions which followed answer 115. 
     
      
    32    I did reject a number of questions and answers contained in the interview from question 141 on, as set out at the commencement of these reasons. I do not propose to go through those passages of the interview in detail. Generally, the rejected questions involved pressing the accused on her answer concerning her asserted lack of knowledge of the black ladies’ jacket. The questioning was persistent and, at times, argumentative. It elicited further denials. Other questions which I rejected involved allegations being put to the accused which, again, elicited denials. In a number of instances, the questions were framed in a somewhat loaded way (see, for example, questions 219 and 225). Overall, the accused’s denials added little to the Crown case. I considered that there was a danger of unfair prejudice (in the sense in which that concept was explained in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 ACrimR 457 at 460) to the accused.

     REGINA v Melissa ROBINSON 
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Melissa Robinson seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed on her by Knight DCJ at the Dubbo District Court on 25 August 1999. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty on 89 counts under s178BA of the Crimes Act, 1900, of obtain benefit by deception. That section imposes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. 
    2   In relation to the first 88 offences, which fall within a pattern of similar offences, his Honour sentenced the applicant, in each case, to a minimum term of 18 months commencing on 25 August 1999 and expiring on 24 February 2000, together with an additional term of two and a half years to commence on 25 February 2001 and to expire on 24 August 2002. 
    3   His Honour ordered that the applicant be eligible for release to parole on 24 February 2001, and recommended to the Parole Board that such parole be subject to supervision and further supervision conditions set out in Form 2 of Schedule 1 of the Sentencing General Regulation 1996. 
    4   In relation to the 89th count which can be categorised as a discrete matter, His Honour nevertheless imposed the same sentence as he had in relation to the earlier matters. Thus those sentences were to be served concurrently. His Honour found special circumstances consisting of the hardship which would be caused to the three young children of the applicant by reason of her imprisonment and her need for a lengthy supervised period of rehabilitation. 
    5   It is helpful to consider the subject offences in the light of the applicant’s history. The applicant was born at St Leonards, Sydney, on 1 June 1969. When she was aged five years, her family moved to Wellington in New South Wales. She attended the Wellington High School and graduated in 1986 with the Higher School Certificate. Due to a shortage of work in Wellington the applicant moved to Sydney on her own where she obtained work as a clerk with the State Bank in 1987. 
    6   However, between 29 June 1988 and 2 August 1989 the applicant committed eleven counts of larceny as a clerk from the Bank involving an aggregate sum in the order of $23,000. 
    7   Having been duly charged on 19 February 1990 with those offences, the applicant came before the Sydney District Court on 2 August 1990. On that occasion she received the benefit of a four year good behaviour bond, a condition of which was the repayment of $24,000 in instalments to the State Bank. A fine of $2,000 was also imposed. 
    8   On 28 February 1992 the applicant came before the Sydney District Court, presided over on this occasion by Shadbolt DCJ, for a breach of the recognisance. On this occasion the applicant received the benefit of a further good behaviour bond of four years. 
    9   On 16 March 1993, a breach report was submitted. Ultimately no action was taken on that breach, the matter being brought to finality on 24 September 1994 at the Dubbo District Court. That recognisance expired on 27 February 1996. 
    10   The applicant married in November 1994 and at some stage resumed living with her husband in the Wellington area. In that year she obtained employment as a casual clerk with a company called Message Pty Limited which traded as Dubbo Shutters and Screens. Her duties included book-keeping, collection of moneys owed, maintaining company records, preparing wages and group certificates, and banking. As part of her employment the applicant had access to the company’s cheque book. The applicant would prepare accounts for payment and a director of the company would sign the cheques. 
    11   The subject 88 offences were committed between 6 January 1995 and 13 July 1996. Effectively what the applicant did in many cases was to complete cheques by making them payable to cash and then she appropriated the money to her own use when the cheque was presented. Unfortunately this dishonesty was simplified by the fact that she was provided at times by her employer with signed blank cheques. In total the sum of $85,131 was stolen from the applicant’s employer. 
    12   His Honour described the circumstances giving rise to the commission of the 89 charge as follows: 
     
      
       
       “In February 1996 the company by which she was employed was approached by a person interested in purchasing the business and the applicant was concerned to endeavour to hide her defalcations. Accordingly she approached Westpac Bank and applied for a personal loan in the sum of $20,000. In order to secure that loan the applicant provided information by way of documents and otherwise to the bank. The contents of those documents were false. The falsity included statements as the applicant’s wage, the purpose of the loan, her marital status and her residential address. In reliance upon that deception Westpac advanced the loan to the applicant.” 
       
      
    13   The applicant was arrested on 18 December 1986 and in an extensive record of interview substantially admitted the criminal conduct which brought her before the District Court. 
    14   As to the subjective circumstances, it is necessary to note that the applicant has three children born respectively on 2 July 1995, which was during the commission of the subject offences, 28 September 1997 and 16 April 1999. The two younger children were accordingly born after the applicant was charged with the subject offences. 
    15   In evidence before His Honour the applicant was asked how it was, bearing in mind her earlier trouble with the law, that the subject offences came to be committed. She said: 
     
      
       
       “We had a lot of mounting debts had a baby on the way, we had nothing for it at that stage. At one stage my husband had a loan with Westpac that he hadn’t repaid and one day the sheriff came knocking on the door with a writ, so that was repaid and then I also had a problem with poker machines and a vast lot of money went into that.” 
        
       
      
    16   As to her gambling addiction she elaborated: 
     
      
       
       “The money that was spent on gambling went into poker machines and I’d stop at the RSL Club here in Dubbo or in Wellington and sometimes put you know., daily, $300-400 through the machines.” 
       
      
    17   One could add, parenthetically, the mind boggles that this young woman was putting so much money daily through poker machines in the district in which she worked and lived and yet, apparently, the matter was not brought to the attention of her employer. 
    18   In any event, after having been charged with the subject offences, the applicant, her husband and children moved to Wandering, a small town in Western Australia not far from Perth. Apparently there are no licensed poker machines in Western Australia. 
    19   With regard to living in Wandering the applicant said: “It is a place where I just spend all day with my children and friends so I have no temptation of poker machines, anything like that.” 
    20   In evidence the applicant stated if she were to receive a custodial sentence her mother-in-law would look after the children in Western Australia. Further to what I shall say shortly, that is what has happened since the applicant commenced to serve the subject sentences. 
    21   Bearing in mind the applicant’s prior criminal record and the seriousness of the subject offences, a major number of which were committed whilst the applicant was still on a recognisance, the sentencing Judge was, notwithstanding the subjective circumstances, in my respectful view required to impose a full-time custodial sentence. 
    22   The major consideration in the present application is, however, whether sufficient weight was given to the hardship imposed upon the applicant’s immediate family, particularly the children, by the imposition of the full-time custodial sentence, particularly bearing in mind that it will be necessary, to maintain their father’s employment, for the family to remain in Western Australia whilst the applicant serves her sentence. That comment is again subject to something that I will say shortly. 
    23   It is now well established as a sentencing principle that hardship to third parties ought only be taken into account as a sentencing factor where special circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be in effect, inhuman to refuse to do so. Reference may be made to the relatively recent decision of this Court in Regina v Edwards. (1996) 98 ACrimR 510 and the cases there cited.  
    24   That phrase “where the circumstances are highly exceptional, where it would be in effect inhuman to refuse to do so” is taken from the often quoted judgment of Wells J in Regina v Wirth. (1976) SASR 291 at 295-296. 
    25   To understand how demanding this test is, Wells J gave an example. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “For example, if it were demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Court that to send a man to prison would, without much doubt, drive his wife to suicide, it would be a steely-hearted judge who did not, however illogically, at least try to meet the situation by suitably framed orders as to penalty. But further than that, in my judgment, courts should not go.” 
       
      
    26   This is a particularly tragic case, tragic for the applicant and tragic for her family. However, this is a Court of error so that it would be acting contrary to the law if this Court were to interfere with the sentences imposed by His Honour unless some error in the sentencing process was identified. 
    27   It is appropriate in my view when assessing whether the sentences were within the discretionary range available to His Honour, both as to the overall sentence and the allocation of the sentence between minimum term and additional term, to bear in mind that there is an administrative and legislative regime within this country designed to mitigate the effects upon the mother and young child or children where a mother is required to serve a custodial sentence. 
    28   In this particular case, bearing in mind that the applicant’s family are themselves in Western Australia and the applicant is presently serving her sentence in New South Wales, there is the option of her applying for a transfer under the Prisoners (Interstate Transfer) Act. There is also the option of her making an application for release under s29 of the Correctional Centres Act, 1952. I am not to be taken by referring to that section intending to suggest what approach those whom the law requires to consider an application under that Act should take. 
    29   Further, there is the full-time residence program which enables children to live with their mothers in a Correctional Centre. We have been helpfully provided in another case by Miss Hock, who appears as counsel for the Crown in this matter and a further matter, with a copy of a pamphlet entitled “Mothers And Children Information” dealing with full-time residence programs. 
    30   Mr Craigie, who represents the applicant before this Court, and who has put on her behalf everything that could be put on her behalf, has tendered a report from the New South Wales Department Of Corrective Services dated 14 February 2000 under the hand of Chris Sharp. That report was tendered on the basis that it may assist the Court if error had been disclosed in the sentencing process and it were necessary for this Court to re-sentence. To my mind that situation has not developed, but I do take the liberty of referring to it because it brings up to date the position of the youngest child of the applicant. It states, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
       “Since the arrival of her daughter on December 26 Miss Robinson has demonstrated care and competence as a mother and the child appears to be happy and secure in her company.” 
       
      
    31   I refer to that because it brings the Court up to date with the relationship between the applicant and her youngest child. Although it could not, in the circumstances, affect the decision to which this Court comes, it does provide some degree of comfort and a demonstration that the program is working successfully in this particular case. 
    32   For those reasons I have considered therefore that although the application for leave to appeal should be allowed, the appeal should be dismissed. 
    33   HIDDEN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be those as proposed by Carruthers AJ.

     60090 of 1999 
      
     HIDDEN J CARRUTHERS AJ  Friday 25 February 2000 
     
     Regina v JS 
      
      
    Judgment1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, whom I shall refer to as JS, pleaded guilty before Nader DCJ in the District Court on two counts of aggravated indecent assault under s61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and asked his Honour to take into account on a form 1 a further similar offence. 
     
      
       
      
    2     On those two counts, and taking that matter into account, his Honour sentenced the applicant to concurrent terms of three years imprisonment, each comprising a minimum term of eighteen months to commence on the date when the sentence was passed, 2 March 1999, and an additional term of eighteen months.  
     
      
       
      
    3     The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.  
     
      
       
      
    4     There is no need to elaborate upon the facts. The victim of the offence was the applicant’s thirteen year-old stepdaughter. The two offences in the indictment occurred on the same day, 28 May 1996. On each occasion the applicant and the victim were engaged in what might be described as ""a friendly wrestle"", in the course of which the applicant seized the victim's breasts and touched her vaginal area on the outside of her clothing. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The matter the subject of the form 1 occurred on 12 June 1996. On that occasion the applicant approached the victim in the kitchen of their home and placed his hand onto her exposed breast beneath her dressing gown. 
     
      
       
      
    6     It appears that these were three isolated incidents. There was no evidence that they were part of a wider pattern of abuse. Two days after the latter offence the applicant was served with an interim apprehended domestic violence order and he left the matrimonial home. 
     
      
       
      
    7     The applicant is now fifty-three years old. He has no criminal record and has an entirely creditable background. The evidence before his Honour was that he had been an excellent worker and that, putting aside these offences, he had otherwise been a good husband and father to his wife and to his four step-children, including the complainant, of that union. 
     
      
       
      
    8     His Honour had regard to all this material. His Honour acknowledged the value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty and noted the likelihood that he might require protective custody during part, at least, of his sentence. In the light of all that material, his Honour found special circumstances so as to extend what would otherwise have been the usual additional term. 
     
      
       
      
    9     The thrust of this application is that the effective sentence of three years is manifestly excessive. To that end Mr Craigie, who appears for the applicant, has produced Judicial Commission statistics and these have been supplemented this morning by the Crown prosecutor, who has produced somewhat updated statistics. I need hardly repeat the caution with which those figures must be approached. 
     
      
       
      
    10     When one examines those figures factoring in all the variables which apply to this applicant, the sample becomes so small as to be of no use. But when one looks, however, at the figures for all offenders, what they show is that a sentence of three years for this class of offence is in the upper range, although by no means at the top of it. I should add that, in any event, that is the experience of the Court of the pattern of sentencing in matters such as this. 
     
      
       
      
    11     In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, it just does not appear to me that a sentence of that order was called for. I say that when one looks at the nature of the indecent conduct, the fact that these were three incidents standing alone and were not part of a wider pattern of abuse and, of course, when one has regard also to the applicant’s age and prior good character. 
     
      
       
      
    12     We received some further evidence this morning should we turn to the question of re-sentencing, and that material discloses that the applicant has been well behaved whilst in prison and has taken educational opportunities available to him. It also reveals that he suffered the loss of his mother in September last year. 
     
      
       
      
    13     In my view the sentences passed by the learned sentencing judge should be quashed and, in lieu, on each count, and taking into account the matter on the form 1, the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for two years, comprising a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of twelve months. 
     
      
       
      
    14     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    15     HIDDEN J: Formal orders of the Court are: leave to appeal is granted. The appeal is allowed. The sentences passed in the District Court are quashed. In lieu, the applicant is sentenced as follows: On each count in the indictment, and taking into account the matter on the form 1, he is sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of two years, comprising a minimum term of twelve months to commence on 2 March 1999 and to expire on 1 March 2000, and an additional term of twelve months. We direct the applicant's release at the expiration of the minimum term.

      GREG JAMES, J. 
     TUESDAY 15 FEBRUARY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. PETER CHARLES HUGHES 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GROVE, J: I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: On 11 March 1999 the appellant was indicted before his Honour Judge Shillington, QC. at Sydney District Court on four counts that between 31 December 1978 and 30 June 1979 at Vaucluse in the State of New South Wales he did commit with Stephen James Reed the crime of buggery. There were two additional counts that he, between 31 December 1978 and 30 June 1979, at 23 Warners Avenue, Bondi in the State of New South Wales did commit with the same person the same crime. 
    3   He was convicted on all counts and sentenced to a minimum term of three years penal servitude and an additional term of three years. 
    4   At the trial the complainant gave evidence, as also did Alan Harper. That evidence related to events that were identified by both witnesses as having occurred in 1979 at, as far as the first four counts were concerned, in the appellant's grocery shop opposite another business the appellant carried on called the Telephone Shopping Centre in Vaucluse. 
    5   The complainant gave graphic evidence of the circumstances of the commission of the crimes and in particular gave evidence of these crimes having been committed whilst he was employed by the appellant stacking goods on shelves initially and otherwise at the shop. He referred to his obtaining the employment in consequence of having seen a sign in the window of the shop and having spoken to the appellant as the operator of the shop. 
    6   Mr. Harper gave evidence confirming the initial contact between the appellant and that employment and the timing of it as following the Christmas holidays and in the commencement of 1979. 
    7   Subsequently, according to the complainant, he had been taken by the appellant to the premises at Warners Avenue, Bondi, where the additional two offences had been committed. Initially, when speaking to the police concerning those offences, the complainant showed some inability accurately to describe the location of the appellant's flat within those premises. 
    8   The complainant continued to work with the appellant, but with the Telephone Shopping Service, for some time following the commission of these offences and for many years told no one of the commission of these offences upon him, although in the 1990s he said he saw a van with the appellant's business name on it drive past him and rang the appellant asking if he could remember who he was. He contended that the appellant had said, ""You were little Stevie"". The appellant denied that was the content of the telephone call. 
    9   In cross-examination it was raised with the complainant the suggestion that the appellant had not had access to the premises in 1979 and indeed had not opened the shop until 1981. This was denied. Quite crucially in the Crown case, this matter which had not been an essential element of any of the offences, took on such a complexion of importance that the learned trial judge in his summing-up directed the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
       ""You are reminded the real issue raised by the accused is whether he was running the business in 1979 and he has produced certain documents. The Crown says, 'Well, these are documents which he could have manufactured afterwards to bolster up a false case'. There is nothing from an independent source. There are no tax records, for example, or records of the purchase of the business. There is no evidence from the person from whom he bought the business, Thomas, substantiating these matters. For these reasons, amongst others, you can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you could safely and confidently act on the evidence of Lee."" 
       
      
    10   This passage encompassed the arguments his Honour referred to as put by the Crown at trial. 
    11   As I have said, both the complainant and Harper were cross-examined to suggest that the offence did not occur at that time and at that place and, indeed, were further cross-examined, and it was put expressly, in particular, to the complainant that the offences alleged had not occurred at all. 
    12   The appellant gave evidence. He denied the offences. He had earlier, in a record of interview, denied to the police the commission of the offences and denied memory of the complainant. He referred in his record of interview to his having purchased the grocery shop, he thought in the 1980s. He had referred to his various home addresses. In his evidence he asserted that he had a provedore business at the address opposite to that at which his shop was alleged to be since 1976 and that he had purchased the shop from a man named Joffrey Thomas, or Joffrey Thomas and his wife, in April 1981. 
    13   He asserted he had no physical connection with the business before that time, although he had supplied that business from the provedore business. In his evidence he asserted he had checked his records recently before giving evidence and had found a bill of sale for the stock in the shop, a handwritten copy of a document that he had submitted to the Corporate Affairs Commission, he said in 1981, together with a cheque butt showing, he said, payment to the Commission. These were tendered in evidence. 
    14   He referred also to a milk vendor's licence which he said had been transferred to himself, cheque butts for electricity and telephone deposits, and a reference which he said he had provided to the complainant, a reference the complainant had denied receiving, and produced what purported to be a copy of that reference showing employment by the complainant in his business for a period between September and November 1981. These were also tendered. 
    15   The Crown Prosecutor in response cross-examined the appellant in respect of his assertion of lack of contact with the shop in 1979 and in relation to the documents, suggesting that the assertion he had not been associated with the shop in 1979 was an invention, recently made, raising why the appellant had not called the vendor of the business, Joffrey Thomas, or his wife; raised the absence of the solicitor's records of purchase; suggesting that the bill of sale could have been given at any time, further suggesting that the Corporate Affairs return might have been manufactured or fabricated for the purposes of the trial and that the cheque butts had been back-dated. 
    16   It was put that those documents and the story were all made up. The absence of the appellant's tax returns at the relevant time was referred to and questions were put seeking the employees' wage books. It is notable that in re-examination it was raised that these records were offered to the police in the record of interview but not searched, and it was further raised in argument before his Honour that these matters had been adverted to by defence counsel at the committal. 
    17   When the trial commenced the precise time at which it was alleged the offences had been committed was not so important as to amount to an element of the offences or crucial to prove all the offences. However, by reason of the conduct of the case, the place at which it was alleged the offences had been committed and the time at which it was alleged the offences had been committed, became critical, since to succeed in the prosecution it was necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the matters asserted by the Crown witness which were, except to the limited extent referred to by Mr. Harper, uncorroborated, and since the offences were denied. 
    18   In that sense, the places at which and the time at which the complainant says these offences were committed was practically essential to acceptance of his evidence. Indeed, I would regard it as crucial in the sense referred to by the Chief Justice in The Queen v. VHP (CCA, unreported 7 July 1997) when he refers to such matters at 15:- 
     
      
       
       ""As a general rule, what the Crown needs to establish in order to obtain a conviction are the essential facts alleged in the indictment, and if the Crown fails to establish an inessential fact, or a particular which has been provided before the trial, or which emerged from the evidence of Crown witnesses, that is not fatal. However, that generalisation may, in any given case, need to be qualified. Two examples of possible qualifications are of present relevance. First, in some circumstances the requirements of procedural or substantive fairness may restrict the capacity of the Crown to depart from particulars. Second, the evidence in a case may be such that it would not be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to treat one part of the Crown case as reliable, and another part as unreliable."" 
       
      
    19   In this case the issue of the credit of the complainant was to be tested having regard to the place and the time at which he said the offences had been committed. Proof of the place and time were essential to the acceptance of the complainant's account as reliable on the necessary matters. I am of this view particularly in the context that the events said to give rise to the offences are said to have occurred over twenty years ago and to have remained unknown arising from the failure of the complainant to complain for many many years, such that, as was pointed out in evidence, many of the records that might otherwise have assisted to test the propositions asserted had been archived or were otherwise unavailable. 
    20   On this appeal it is sought to rely on evidence which is set out in the affidavits of William James O'Sullivan sworn 8 December 1999, the undated affidavit of William James Sullivan, the affidavit sworn 10 December 1999 of Michael Marx, solicitor, and the affidavit of 16 December 1999 sworn by Peter Mark Skinner, trial counsel. Those affidavits relate in particular to documentation now obtained from the Corporate Affairs Commission showing the lodging of a Statement of change of certain particulars of the appellant's business, which document on its face appears to offer cogent support for the documentation provided by the appellant at his trial, which documentation was alleged to have been invented and forged. 
    21   It was documentation which might well have been tendered in re-examination to rebut the suggestion of recent invention. However, the trial commenced on 11 March 1999 and was concluded with a verdict adverse to the appellant the following day and the material was not available in time. 
    22   The affidavit material discloses counsel's request for the material at the time at which the Crown raised the allegations and the attempt to obtain the material, which attempt however was unsuccessful since the material had been archived. 
    23   For my part, bearing in mind the way in which the trial was conducted, I am of the view that that material should be admitted on this appeal in accordance with the principles referred to by this court in The Queen v. Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, in which the court held that even though the evidence might not be new it would be admitted if, when admitted, it would show that a miscarriage of justice occurred at trial and it is of such significance that a reasonable jury might regard it as having a real bearing on its decision, even though its existence was known to the accused, provided that its significance was not realised by him at the time of the trial and provided that its existence was not made known to the accused's legal advisers at the trial. 
    24   This material was effectively unobtainable at the trial, unknown to counsel until too late, and the issue that the Crown would assert of documents otherwise apparently regular being fabrications and forgeries was not one reasonably within the expectation of counsel. 
    25   Having regard to that material, it seems to me that the appellant has made out the proposition for which he contends in his grounds of appeal that there has been a miscarriage below. The question then arises as to the gravity of that miscarriage. 
    26   Essentially this was a case which turned on credit. The new material is such as, in my view, to have adversely affected the credit of the complainant. It is not such as, in my view, would entirely dispose of the question of the complainant's credibility so that the verdict should be treated as one which it was not open to a jury to reach. 
    27   In those circumstances, the question of a new trial becomes a question for the exercise of the discretion of this court. 
    28   It has been raised that at such a trial or at this trial it would have been open to the Crown to put a wider case; that is, that the offences were committed at some other date. All that I need say about that is that the controversy as to date was raised in the record of interview at committal. The wider case was not run at this trial. Particularly the Crown Prosecutor put that the events could not have occurred in 1981 because that was the year of the complainant's School Certificate, when he was not then working. The indictment was not then amended and such an assertion would involve a two-year error on the part of both Harper and the complainant. As a practical matter it would seem to be unavailable. 
    29   Nonetheless, I do not see that this is a case in which the Crown should not have the benefit of a new trial on the counts that it has presently preferred. In my view, this is a matter in which it would be open to submit the matter to a jury, although it would remain a question for the Director of Public Prosecutions, bearing in mind the age of these matters and what occurred at this trial and the evidence by the complainant and Harper, asserting apparently with some degree of conviction the date 1979, as to whether the Director would wish to proceed further. 
    30   I would propose that leave to rely on the fresh evidence be given, that evidence be admitted. Leave to appeal insofar as it might be necessary be granted. The appeal upheld and a new trial ordered. 
    31   GROVE, J: I agree with the judgment delivered by Greg James, J., save that I would refrain from any comment about the aspects of any new trial. I would content myself with saying that, in my view, the discretion of the court ought to be exercised so to order. 
    32   HIDDEN, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
    33   GROVE, J: The orders of the court therefore will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: At the conclusion of the judge only trial for murder in which I found the special verdict under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, s.38 and made the order under s.39 of that Act, the Crown informed me of a related offence within the meaning of that term as used in s.34 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and has provided to me a certificate pursuant to s.34A of that Act.  
    2   That certificate indicates that the accused was also charged with common assault of his friend following the killing of his mother. Under s.35 of the Criminal Procedure Act it is provided that if, at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person in an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person guilty of the offence, the court may, unless it considers it inappropriate, order the charge to be dismissed or may deal with any related charge. 
    3   Under s.35(1A), the court may deal with the related offence if, at the conclusion of the trial, the court finds the accused person not guilty. In dealing with a related offence it appears to me I have the power to dismiss it although s.35(1A) does not contain an express equivalent of s.35(1)(a). The legislature must have intended that I could dismiss the charge, or dealing with the offence would be an absurdity and no true trial at all. The Crown urged me to dismiss the offence. Mr. Zahra who appeared for the accused, does likewise. 
    4   I am not sure, nor is it necessary for me to determine whether, in so dealing with the offence I should conduct the equivalent of a judge only trial of it under the Criminal Procedure Act. I could dismiss the offence pre-trial by consent as a judge. Perhaps the hearing involved in dealing with it is a mere adjunct to the principal trial. In any event, since I am being urged by the Crown and the defence to dismiss the charge and since at any trial the tribunal of fact in such circumstances need hear no more once the matter has been opened, it does not seem to me that it is necessary that I should remind myself or record in writing all of the directions one might have given had one proceeded to determine a contested trial. It is unnecessary for me in the circumstances, to determine the precise context. 
    5   I dismiss the charge.

      REGINA v. ANGELO SAMUEL FIORI 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The accused stands charged that on 10 December 1998 at Ashbury in the State of New South Wales he did murder Sarina Fiori, his mother. To that charge he has pleaded not guilty. 
    2   An election for trial by judge alone signed by the accused, witnessed by his counsel and signed by the Crown Prosecutor and thus accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, has been filed in accordance with the provisions of s.32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
    3   There has been tendered to me, to ensure no question arises as to that election, a medical report from Dr. Mastroianni dated 10 February 2000, confirming no question arises as to the competence or fitness of the accused to stand his trial and to make his election. The learned Crown Prosecutor has confirmed that no such question arises. In the circumstances both parties have sought that the trial proceed before me as a judge only trial. 
    4   Prior to the trial coming on for hearing, and by consent, the parties had provided to me material which contained a copy of the proposed indictment, a chronology, a Crown case statement and reports by psychiatrists, including Dr. Westmore, Dr. Canaris and Dr. Mastroianni, together with very many statements by investigating police and witnesses as to the circumstances giving rise to the charge. 
    5   I had the opportunity to read the whole of that material and have done so. It was provided to me in this way as I was informed by both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel that no issues of fact or controversy over the facts arose in respect of this matter. It has now been admitted into evidence and confirms that what occurred on 10 December 1998 was an appalling tragedy which arose because, at that time, the accused was suffering from a psychosis, that is a serious mental illness which I am satisfied on the whole of the evidence was such that he should not be held mentally responsible for his actions. Those actions were not in any way provoked or occasioned by any inappropriate behaviour of his mother, or that of the family of friends to whom he went following these events. 
    6   I have been informed that following the conclusion of the proceedings on this charge the Crown will seek that I deal, pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, with a charge of assault against this accused in consequence of what occurred when he visited that family. I have further been informed that there is no dispute with the Crown case statement and indeed that it is accurate. 
    7   That statement reads:- 
     
      
       
       ""Up until the time of this offence, the accused had been living with his mother (the deceased) in her home at 78 King Street, Ashbury. He was employed as a labourer for a packaging company. On Thursday 10 December 1998, he had worked between about 6.00 am and 2.50 pm. Fiori was then driven by a workmate, Anthony Delmas, arriving home at about 3.30 pm. The accused became agitated and aggressive at home and an argument developed after his mother challenged him at about 4.00 pm. In the hallway he punched her face and continued to assault her head after she fell to the tiled floor at the front verandah. This was witnesses (sic) by various passers-by. He also ripped the security grill off the front door, ripped the front garden gate off its hinges and punched the fence. 
       
      
      
       
       The assault was reported to police who attended at about 4.10 pm after the accused had departed. They found the deceased lying unconscious on the verandah, bleeding from the head. They could not detect a heart beat or breath, and commenced CPR. This continued for about 25 minutes without success. Later post mortem found that death had been caused by blunt force head injuries which were consistent with blows to the face and possible striking the back of the head against the tiles on the verandah. 
       
      
      
       
       After the accused left the scene of the assault on his mother, he walked several blocks to Cheviot Street, Ashfield. On the way he attracted the attention of others by his erratic behaviour, such as climbing onto the roof of a passing car, and uprooting a rose bush that he took with him. When he reached 41 Cheviot Street, the home of the Delmas family, he was emotionally disturbed, carrying the rose bush, yelling, grunting and he head-butted the front door until he fell down and broke the door. Anthony Delmas attempted to pacify him. Without apparent provocation, Fiori punched Delmas repeatedly until he was rescued by others. Police subsequently attended and arrested the accused after a struggle. 
       
      
      
       
       As a result of injuries to Fiori's hand, he was taken to Concord Hospital for treatment. He was subsequently interviewed by police (ERISP) and admitted assaulting his mother. Prior to the assault, which he attributed to 'utter madness', he claimed to have felt frustrated about life in general and angry about his mother. At the time of hitting his mother he said he had 'to kill' in his mind and 'something came over me and I just was not thinking at the time'."" 
       
      
    8   In the statements of the police officers who had interviewed him at the police station there is clear reference to the eccentricity of his behaviour even then, to the aberrant nature of his affect and his conduct. There is also a wealth of evidence in the material with which I have been provided to show that until a short time prior to these events the accused had been a person who had apparently lived within the community a life that was entirely estimable in content. 
    9   The medical evidence discloses that for some time, probably for some years, the accused had suffered from the psychosis which led to the commission of the killing. The psychiatrists describe the precise condition differently. Various of the medical witnesses attribute differing roles within that condition to the use of marijuana and to the possible effects of a cycle of steroids used by the accused in an attempt to build his body with a view to attaining esteem within the community and, of course, with a view to reinforcing his own self-esteem. 
    10   Whatever be the causative basis for the medical condition, whatever be the precise label to be attached to it - and these may be matters of importance for treatment and diagnosis - there is no disagreement amongst the medical experts, including those who had attended the accused and treated him whilst in custody, and those to whose reports I have been referred but that, at the time of the commission of the act comprising the offence for which the accused was charged, he was suffering from a disease of the mind, such that he either did not know the nature and quality of his act or, and in some cases and, did not know that what he was doing was wrong, and thus was not mentally responsible at law for the crime with which he was charged. 
    11   Since this is a trial by judge alone, I must remember that this is not the only issue before me. I direct myself of the elements of the crime with which he is charged, that is murder, that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts which caused the death of his mother, and did so with intent to kill or intent to cause grievous bodily harm, or adverting to but not caring about the prospect that she might die as a result of his acts. 
    12   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he struck his mother, as the evidence discloses that he did, that he intended at least to cause grievous bodily harm, or was recklessly indifferent to human life as prescribed by the section. I am not satisfied that he intended to kill her. 
    13   I invited both counsel to draw my attention to any other directions that should properly be given by me to myself to comply with the requirements of the Criminal Procedure Act for the purpose of at least looking at the nature of the crime. I was assured there were no further directions which, in respect of that matter, needed to be given. 
    14   On the question of mental illness I reminded myself that that being a defence raised by the accused, it is the accused who bears the onus of proving it, but only on the lesser standard of proof on the balance of probabilities. I remind myself that it is not open to an accused to avoid the inference of intent arising from his actions by reference to matters that would only go to proof of the defence of mental illness. I remind myself that it is mandatory for me to bring in the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness in the event that, on the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied, as I am here, of the matters that constituted that defence. 
    15   I remind myself that in those circumstances it is incumbent upon me to have regard to the professional expert evidence of the psychiatrists, and in this case, to have regard to the fact that evidence is unchallenged; indeed, both parties accept that all opinion is unanimously of the view that the accused, at the time of the commission of the acts, was not mentally responsible. 
    16   I am obliged also to explain to myself the legal and practical consequence of the findings which are open in this trial. Under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1900 which apply if I find the special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, it is my duty to order the accused to be detained in strict custody in such a place and in such a manner as to me seems fit, until released by due process of the law. He would not return automatically to the community; he would be detained in strict custody in a place which, one may assume, would be a psychiatric hospital gazetted under the Mental Health Act.  
    17   Whilst detained in strict custody in that way the accused would come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which comprises a president or deputy president with legal qualifications, and two other members, one of whom must be a psychiatrist and the other with appropriate qualifications to serve on that body. Within 14 days after verdict, the Tribunal would commence review of the accused's case, at the conclusion of which it would make a recommendation to the Minister for Health, which may be unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. 
    18   If the Tribunal is satisfied, but only if it was satisfied, that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it could make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation, then that would be considered by the Department of Health which, in turn, would advise the Governor. The Governor would then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice of the Tribunal, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release. That order could be conditional or unconditional. The Governor could only make an order for release where the tribunal itself had recommended release. 
    19   After that first hearing of the Mental Health Tribunal it can, at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused. At such a later review it could make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued care, detention or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditionally or unconditionally. 
    20   Again it would not be free at any stage of review to make a recommendation for release unless it was satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered. Again the matter would go to the Department of Health, the Minister and the Governor, and any recommendation could only be carried into effect by the order of the Governor. 
    21   If the accused were, at any time, released into the public on conditions and it appeared a breach of those conditions took place then the Governor may order the apprehension of the accused. Such an order would follow by reason of a practical consideration that if a person is released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case, with the assistance of the Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist or one of the other public facilities available. 
    22   The conditions which could be applied include conditions going to such matters as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the patient or the accused is properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain in strict custody in one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients, the only manner in which a person ceased to continue to be a patient is when he is released by the Governor, or is released on conditions after the expiration of a particular period of time or in particular circumstances the release should be come unconditional. But that recommendation could only be made of the Tribunal were satisfied as I have said. 
    23   It is not necessary for me, in the way in which the Crown and the defence have conducted this matter, to descend to any greater detail by setting out in this judgment the precise passages in the evidence showing the commission by this accused of the acts on which the Crown relies or the precise passages from the medical opinion concerning the illness from which he suffers and his prior history. But it should be clear that he has apparently suffered and desperately tried to cope with delusions of ever increasing gravity over a substantial period, until he was unable to cope any more. 
    24   What happened is an appalling tragedy. I am satisfied he committed the acts and I am satisfied of the defence. The appropriate course that I should take in these circumstances is that defined by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. I am guided as to the relevant tests as to what is said in my judgment in Regina v. Gillett [1999] NSWSC 115; Regina v. Maxwell [1999] NSWSC 281 (per Hidden, J.); Regina v. Gabranovic [1999] NSWSC 205 (per Newman, J.); and Regina v. Noyes [1999] NSWSC 397. 
    25   I have taken into account all the matters that are referred to in those decisions. I am of the view that the defence is made out and I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. I make the order required by s.39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, that is, that Mr. Fiori be detained in strict custody in ""C"" Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital, and thereafter in such place as is determined according to law until released by the process of law.

     REGINA v Luke John HAWKINS 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SULLY J: The Court has come to a view about this matter. I invite Carruthers AJ to give the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Luke John Hawkins seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Judge Luland QC at the Penrith District Court on 30 September 1999.  
    3   The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company under s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (as amended), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of one year penal servitude to commence on 30 September 1999 and to expire on 29 September 2000 and imposed an additional term of two years to commence on 30 September 2000 and to expire on 29 September 2000.  
    4   The applicant was born on 16 October 1980 and was, accordingly, 18 years old at the time of the offence which committed on 8 March 1999. 
    5   The relevant facts may shortly be stated. On the evening of 8 March 1999, the victim, who was the proprietor of a food bar at Whalan, locked the shop. As he and his female assistant walked to the rear of the premises, they were approached by the applicant and a co-accused James Lucas, who was then, in fact, aged 15 years although the applicant believed he was older. Both offenders were wearing balaclavas.  
    6   The applicant grabbed the victim by the shoulder and told him to sit down. The co-accused took hold of the assistant. The victim threw the day’s takings onto the ground and told the offenders to take the money and leave him alone. As the applicant reached to take the money, the victim pulled the balaclava off his head and was able to identify the applicant, as he was a customer of the shop. After the applicant’s balaclava was removed, Lucas struck the victim over the head with a large stick resembling an axe handle, and both offenders ran off. 
    7   The sentencing judge expressly stated that he did not take this striking into account, because it was not an element of the offence, and he accepted that the applicant did not know that Lucas, his co-offender, was armed.  
    8   Another person, Jamie Robinson was aware that the robbery had taken place. Robinson was 22 years old at this time and had a significant criminal record. Robinson, together with a number of other men, confronted the applicant and Lucas shortly after the offence. One of the men with Robinson struck the applicant in the face, which caused quite serious damage to a tooth. The applicant stated during an ERISP, that he had been “king hit”.  
    9   Robinson took the money and returned some of it to the victim but retained some for himself. Robinson was later arrested and charged with demanding money with menaces and concealing a serious offence. He was sentenced to a fixed term of five months imprisonment to date from March 1999.  
    10   The applicant was arrested three days later and participated, as I have said, in an ERISP. During the course of that ERISP, he made full admissions. He also named his co-accused, who was arrested shortly after the completion of the interview. He also named Robinson.  
    11   The applicant said in the interview that he saw James Lucas about 2 pm on the day of the robbery. Lucas arranged to come to the applicant’s house later that evening. Regrettably, during the course of that afternoon, the applicant drank most of a four litre cask of wine. As a consequence, he stated that he was “quite drunk” and “seeing double”. The applicant said that Lucas planned the robbery and told the applicant that he would give him $150 if he would help him out, and that all the applicant needed to do was to tell the victim to sit on the ground. The applicant said that he did not know that the co-accused had a stick and, indeed, when the applicant saw the co-accused strike the victim, he immediately ran away. 
    12   The seriousness of the subject offence needs no elaboration. The frequency with which the offences of robbery, robbery in company and armed robbery come before the District Court and this Court is a matter of grave public concern. A significant deterrent element is necessarily involved in the sentencing process. 
    13   There are, in this case, significant subjective circumstances, many of which were adverted to in the pre-sentence report of 22 July 1999 under the hand of Miss Bonnett, Probation and Parole Officer, Mt Druitt District Office. Inter alia, that report discloses that the applicant is an only child who resided with his mother. His father died of a heart attack when the applicant was five years old. His mother became, the report asserts, a chronic alcoholic who was and still is heavily dependent upon the applicant because of her alcoholism. 
    14   The applicant left school when he was 15 years old and has worked in several jobs. He was unemployed at the date of the robbery but was actively looking for work. 
    15   Since mid-March 1999, he had been in a relationship with a lady who was described in the report as “mature”. She has a four year old daughter. According to the report, this lady apparently has had a positive influence on the applicant, who has, it is said, acted like a father towards her young daughter.  
    16   The applicant made clear that he hardly ever drinks alcohol. He appeared to be genuinely contrite and concerned about the victim, to whom he wished to apologise and to whom he wished to afford compensation.  
    17   At the sentencing proceedings, Mr Gary John Tate gave evidence that he had known the applicant for three and a half to four years and had recently employed him on weekends to assist him in his work as a painter, decorator and gyprocker. Mr Tate was aware of the offence and said that it was completely out of character. He described the applicant, whilst working for him, as being punctual, honest and reliable. 
    18   The applicant gave evidence that he had recently gained permanent employment for five days a week as a powder coater with a local company. A reference was tendered from one Sam Palise confirming this employment and congratulating the applicant on his obvious effort and determination to change the path of his life through gaining fulltime employment. More references were also tendered. The applicant pressed for leniency and indicated he would be in a position to pay the $485 compensation sought. 
    19   The applicant expressed concern about full-time imprisonment emphasising the incident with Robinson after the robbery. He pointed out that that the assault resulted in a tooth being pushed back into the roof of his mouth. Robinson had recently been released from gaol and the applicant was called a “dobber” by Robinson. The applicant believes Robinson had friends in the prison system and was naturally concerned about his safety if he were sent to prison. He said that he had not consumed alcohol since the offence. 
    20   The sentencing judge appropriately treated the applicant as a person with no prior criminal record. Somewhat remarkably, during the course of his Honour’s remarks on sentence his Honour did not mention the fact that during the ERISP the applicant had named Lucas and Robinson as offenders. Also, somewhat remarkably, apparently at the conclusion of the sentencing process those appearing before his Honour did not draw his attention to this omission. 
    21   Basically, the application before this Court relies upon two grounds: firstly, that there was an appealable error in the fact that his Honour did not refer to the assistance which the applicant had rendered to the authorities and the public benefit which flowed from such assistance; and, secondly, the question of parity between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and the manner in which Lucas was dealt with.  
    22   At the time the matter came for sentence before Judge Luland QC, Lucas had not been finally dealt with. Lucas, in fact, pleaded guilty to the same charge as the applicant at the Children’s Court on 30 March 1999. He was referred for a youth conference under The Young Offenders Act, 1997. On 30 November, after satisfactory completion of an outcome plan, the charge was dismissed under s.52(7) of that Act. 
    23   I do not accept that there is a valid argument available to the applicant on the ground of parity with Lucas because of the discrepancy between their subjective circumstances. Lucas is, in fact, three years younger than the applicant, and he was dealt with under a different sentencing and legislative regime to that of the applicant. However, in my view the ground upon s442B of the Crimes Act has been made out and it is necessary for this Court to intervene and re-sentence the offender. 
    24   In the event that the Court would take this approach, evidence has been put before the Court as to the efforts made by the applicant towards his rehabilitation during the course of his four and a half months imprisonment to date. Those efforts are indeed praiseworthy but it is not necessary for me to refer to the detail of them. 
    25   As, unfortunately, one would have feared, bearing in mind the youth and presentable appearance of the applicant, he had not been in the gaol system long before a sexual advance was made towards him in distressing circumstances by a fellow inmate. Also, he was the victim of an unassociated attack by three inmates who beat him up (to use his expression), in his cell because he tried to maintain his rights, when waiting in a queue to telephone his mother. 
    26   At the moment, the applicant is at Oberon Correctional Centre, where he seems to be safe and doing well.  
    27   I cannot accept that his Honour erred in imposing a full time custodial sentence, bearing in mind the deterrent aspect and, to the extent that they are relevant, the views expressed by this court in the guideline judgment of Regina v. Henry & Ors. (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Although that case deals with armed robbery, guidance in this case must necessarily be found from the judgments in Henry, because armed robbery and robbery in company could fairly be described as cognate offences. 
    28   That leaves, for re-sentencing purposes, the additional subjective circumstances which have been put before this Court and the necessity to grant to the applicant the benefit of the provisions s.442B. Balancing the objective and subjective circumstances, as we now know them, and accepting, as his Honour did, that there are special circumstances, I would propose that this matter be dealt with as follows: 
     
      
     1. that leave to appeal be granted; 
      
     2. that the appeal be upheld; 
      
     3. that the sentence below be quashed; and 
      
     4. that, in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to six months penal servitude by way of a minimum term to commence on 30 September 1999 and to expire on 29 March 2000, and an additional term of 18 months to commence on 30 March 2000 and expire on 29 September 2001; and 
      
     5. that it be ordered that the applicant be released to parole at the expiration of that minimum term and that he be subject to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for so much of the additional term as they may deem to be necessary. 
      
    29   SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed; and the orders of the Court will be as just now announced by his Honour.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal by the Crown against the alleged inadequacy of the sentence imposed on the Respondent by Judge Coolahan, sitting in East Maitland District Court on 24 August 1999. 
     
      
    2    The Respondent pleaded guilty to four counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each offence is penal servitude for twenty years. The judge sentenced the Respondent on each count to a minimum term of twelve months penal servitude, to commence on 3 April 1999 and an additional term of three years, to commence on 3 April 2000, expiring on 2 April 2003. 
     
      
    3    There were four separate armed robberies committed over a period in excess of one month as follows: 
     
      
    · On 27 February 1999 at 8.00 am, the Respondent entered the Shell Service Station at Rutherford. The service station was then being attended by a twenty year old woman. The Respondent approached her, told her to get to the ground, at which time she noticed he was holding in his left hand a large knife about 40cms in length. She said that during the robbery she was very scared and thought that the Respondent was going to hurt her. The Respondent removed notes and coins to the value of about $300. As he left, the Respondent said “I’m sorry for scaring you, but I’m desperate”. 
     
      
    · On 27 March 1999 at about 11.45 pm, the Respondent returned to the same service station, which was then attended by an eighteen year old male employee. The Respondent said “OK buddy open the till and sit on the floor”. He produced the 40cm knife. The attendant said he became scared and was worried that he would be hurt. The Respondent took about $250 from the till. On his departure, the Respondent said “Do me a favour and give the cops a shitty description of me.” 
     
      
    · On 28 March 1999 at 4.42 am, at the Ampol Service Station in East Maitland, the Respondent confronted a twenty-four year old female employee with the 40cm knife. The employee said that she was afraid that if she did not remain calm and do what he was telling her, the Respondent might have used the knife on her. About $60 was taken. 
     
      
    · On 3 April 1999 at about 3.00 pm, the Respondent approached a forty-five year old female employee, who was then serving a twelve year old boy in the Mobil Service Station at Cessnock. Another woman was also in the shop. The Respondent pushed the boy out of the way, pushed the employee against the brick wall. When she called him “a mongrel”, he told her to “shut up”. He held a 7cm knife in his right hand and pointed it at her waist. The boy ran out of the shop. The employee said that she was hysterical and shaking after the event and in a total state of shock. She indicated that she had feared for her life. On this occasion, the Respondent removed about $350 from the till. 
     
      
    4    On each of the occasions, the Respondent made no effort to conceal his identity. When apprehended, shortly after the last robbery, he admitted to the four offences. He said that he had been armed so as to scare the employees. He said that he had formed an intention to commit each robbery shortly before actually committing it. He said he had needed the money for drugs. 
     
      
    5    The objective circumstances of each offence indicates that each must be treated as serious offences. The cumulative impact of the four separate offences is also of considerable significance. The degree of violence threatened was, on each occasion, of a significant order and, on the last occasion, aggravated by an escalation in the level of aggressiveness and the presence of a twelve year old boy. 
     
      
    6    In the course of his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge found that all of the offences were drug related in the sense that the Respondent was using the proceeds of the robberies to support his habit. He also found that the words he used at the time of the first offence, namely, “I’m sorry if I scared you but I’m desperate”, reflected his state of mind at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    7    The Respondent was twenty-one years old at the time. The evidence presented before the sentencing judge indicated a supportive family background and a youth of generally good character until his addiction overwhelmed him. It is a common tale nonetheless regrettable in the individual case, by reason of the frequency of its occurrence. 
     
      
    8    In his evidence before the sentencing judge, the Respondent indicated that he had not partaken of illicit drugs of any description while in prison, notwithstanding their availability to him in prison. He asserted that on any release he would accept guidance and help from the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    9    One of the factors which, it appears, had brought this young man to pursue the calamitous path of addiction, was the separation from his family, which had moved to Queensland. He gave evidence that he intended to live with his parents in Queensland on his release. 
     
      
    10    The Respondent’s father gave evidence about the availability of drug counselling and rehabilitation in the area in Brisbane where he lives. The Crown indicated that by reciprocal arrangement between the States, the parole authorities in the State of Queensland would be able to supervise a person serving an additional term under supervision. 
     
      
    11    His Honour accepted the Respondent’s expressions of remorse as genuine. Furthermore, his Honour correctly gave weight to the fact that the Crown was unlikely to be able to prove two of the offences without the confession. In these cases the plea of guilty is entitled to real consideration. 
     
      
    12    In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge stressed the subjective features. He accepted the Respondent’s evidence that he would undertake drug rehabilitation and would also attempt to further his education. He went on to find “special circumstances” for the purpose of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act and said : 
     
      
       
        
        “The additional term exceeds one-third of the minimum term because of the special circumstances to which I have referred earlier, namely the relative youth of the prisoner and the strong desire that he undertake extended supervision for his drug addiction.” 
        
       
      
    13    His Honour’s conclusion was to radically alter the statutory relationship so that the additional term was increased from one-third of the minimum term to three times the minimum term. 
     
      
    14    No particular error in the reasoning has been identified. The Crown case was essentially that of manifest inadequacy by reason of the total sentence and, in particular, by reason of the short period imposed by way of a minimum term. 
     
      
    15    The issue of whether or not all four of the sentences should have been made concurrent, was raised in the Crown’s submissions. It was, in my opinion, open for his Honour to make the sentences concurrent by applying the principle of totality, so long as the final result reflected the substantial criminality involved in the commission of four offences. In particular, the minimum term must itself reflect the seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    16    In my opinion, the Crown’s submissions are correct. The sentence imposed by his Honour, and in particular the minimum term, is manifestly inadequate in the requisite sense. The objective circumstances of the offences were very serious. The degree of violence threatened to the four individual attendants, and especially so in the case of the last offence, was of such an order that a minimum term of twelve months is manifestly inadequate. Furthermore, the total term of four years does not reflect the degree of criminality involved in the four offences. 
     
      
    17    On this appeal, the principle of double jeopardy must be applied. Further, the Respondent has served a very substantial proportion of his minimum term. Although he was only sentenced on 24 August 1999, the sentence was back-dated to 3 April 1999 when he was arrested. I take into account the consequences on him of adding to the Respondent’s minimum term only a few months before its expiry. But for this factor I would have imposed a minimum term, even on appeal, of three years. 
     
      
    18    In my opinion, the least sentence that could properly have been imposed in all of the circumstances is a minimum term of two years and an additional term of three years. Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1 Crown appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2 Sentence quashed. 
       
       
      3 In lieu thereof sentence the Respondent to a minimum term of two years penal servitude, to commence on 3 April 1999 and to expire on 2 April 2001, and an additional term of three years, to commence on 3 April 2001 and to expire on 2 April 2004. 
       
      
    19    HULME J: The facts in this matter have been comprehensively summarised by the Chief Justice and I can accordingly be brief. 
     
      
    20    Among the major reasons for sentencing people such as the Respondent to custody for long terms, and for the guideline judgment in offences of this nature, was the need to discourage others in the community who even think of committing these offences from doing so. Regrettable though it is, if this Court does not ensure that sentences send a definite message out to such persons, then the incidence of crimes of violence will increase. 
     
      
    21    When regard is had to the four offences committed by the Respondent, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was wholly inadequate. It was said by the Respondent’s counsel that his reluctance to commit the offences was indicated by his expressed desperation at the time. There were other courses open to him to cope with the problems he was then experiencing beyond committing crime, and in particular premeditated violent crime. 
     
      
    22    In my view, the lowest possible sentence which the trial judge might have imposed involved a total term of at least five years and a minimum term of not less than three years. That is the sentence that this Court should impose. 
     
      
    23    SMART AJ: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    24    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I have indicated.

     REGINA v MINH HIEU NGUYEN 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Smart AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   SMART AJ: Minh Hieu Nguyen seeks leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence for manslaughter comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year. The judge took into account the period of pre-sentence custody of one year eleven months twenty-two days. 
    3   The applicant was arrested and charged on 15 June 1994 with murder. He and his co-accused were tried for murder in mid-1997. The applicant was convicted. His appeal against conviction was upheld by this court on 1 October 1998 and a new trial was ordered. 
    4   On 31 May 1999 the applicant was again indicted for murder. He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted his plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The plea was accepted on the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act, namely, the striking of the deceased by the applicant with a baseball bat around the neck and head. 
    5   The Crown case was that the applicant was engaged in a common criminal enterprise to assault and attack the deceased. Many of the facts were in dispute. The judge made detailed findings, all of which were open and justified on the evidence. The summary which follows is based on those findings. 
    6   On the evening of 28 May 1994 some hundreds of people, mostly of Vietnamese origin, attended a concert at Bankstown RSL Club. The judge accepted that this was a legitimate well-conducted evening until the series of events next mentioned occurred. 
    7   The deceased, a small man weighing only 37 kilos, attended with his de facto wife, two nieces and a group of friends. The applicant was present at some stage with his girlfriend and later in the company of his friends. During the concert, when dancing was being undertaken, someone in the group with which the applicant was associated approached one of the deceased's nieces, then aged fifteen, and asked her to dance, which she did. The deceased, on seeing this, told the young man not to dance with her again and this annoyed the young Vietnamese man. 
    8   As the concert was ending the deceased was suddenly struck by a chair by one of the audience and this caused him to fall down and bleed. The identity of that person was much in dispute. After the concert the deceased, with the assistance of some friends, entered a nearby carpark. He was attacked by a group of young men who kicked and punched him, and by the applicant, who struck him on the head with the baseball bat. There was an upheaval. Shots were fired, another person was killed, and a third person was wounded. The applicant was not associated with these latter incidents. A short time later a Suzuki Vitara motor vehicle driven by the applicant sped off and drove through a red light. 
    9   When first spoken to by the police on the morning of 30 May 1994 and on subsequent occasions, the applicant denied that he was present when the shooting occurred and the deceased was assaulted. The investigation and his denials continued. On 15 June 1994 he was escorted to the Bass Hill police station. He conceded that he had a dark jacket with patches. A garment of this description was worn by the attacker. The applicant continued to deny being present when the incident occurred, asserting he had left before it happened. When told by the police there were traces of blood on the driver's side door of the Suzuki vehicle, the applicant said that the man who went to the hospital hit him. He said, ""I walking past and he hit me. I want to hit him back but there were too many people."" 
    10   He asserted that he went to the carpark and that he ""was looking for the man who hit me. I saw people fighting. I saw them kicking each other."" He said that he went looking for something to hit the deceased with and ""I found a baseball bat on grass in the street."" He said that he grabbed it, went back and hit the deceased. He said, ""I hit him once. I kept trying to hit him but I miss. Someone pull me off."" He said that he went to the car, drove off with one of his friends, and threw the bat away. On further questioning, he conceded he had obtained the bat from the car, did not throw it away but burned it. He next took part in a record of interview in which he made certain admissions. 
    11   The judge determined that the applicant's evidence could not be approached ""with any great degree of confidence"". The judge evaluated the evidence at some length and with care. The account of events which the applicant gave to his forensic psychologist was intriguing. He endeavoured to minimise his criminality. 
    12   In his evidence the applicant said, ""At the time I was drunk and I didn't know anything about what I was doing. I was struck, so I just wanted to get back and hit the guy back."" The judge rejected that explanation. The judge said: 
     
      
       
       ""I do not accept for a moment that at the time he was drunk he did not know what he was doing. This was ... a very deliberate act and a determined act on his part."" 
       
      
    13   The judge was not satisfied that the applicant was responsible for hitting the deceased on the head with a chair, although there was some evidence to that effect. The judge said: 
     
      
       
       ""Despite misgivings I am driven to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that I should accept with modifications the version of facts given by the prisoner. I do not accept, as I have said earlier, that he was drunk but I accept that he consumed some alcohol which may have affected him to some extent and caused him to lose his temper. Furthermore and not without some reservation, I accept that something happened to him to lose his cool and I accept for the purposes of sentence that he was struck accidentally as the fight was taking place. For some reason not satisfactorily explained he apparently lost his temper and, I would emphasise, without any real justification in the circumstances even if he was hit in the manner in which he said he was. 
        
        
       I find, however, without justification he determined to hit the deceased with the baseball bat which he had conveniently in the back of his vehicle. This necessitated him leaving the auditorium, crossing the RSL carpark to where his car was parked on the other side of Kitchener Parade and obtaining from that vehicle the baseball bat. He did not, in my view, give a satisfactory explanation of why he had it in his car. He said it was for his safety. In using it as he did on this night it could hardly be said he used it for his safety. He, having obtained the bat, then deliberately returned to the scene when the unfortunate deceased, I find as a fact, was on his knees having been seriously assaulted by the other individuals and then, swinging the baseball bat, hit him hard over the head."" 
       
      
    14   The judge was unable to say whether the applicant struck the deceased more than once, but he attempted to do so. The judge was satisfied that the applicant struck the deceased with the bat with considerable force, with the obvious intention of inflicting violence on the deceased. The judge characterised the blow ""as a cold-blooded and deliberate act perpetrated on a man who was already seriously injured, on his knees and defenceless."" The judge continued: 
     
      
       
       ""...there was absolutely no justification for this activity and it has been in some sense responsible, together with the other assaults, for a death and calls for, in my view, severe punishment for such a cowardly attack on ... a very small defenceless man."" 
       
      
    15   The judge took into account that the applicant had no prior convictions and was otherwise a man of good character. This act was out of character. The judge also took into account his solid family ties and background with a reasonable employment record. The judge thought the applicant's regret resulted in the main from the predicament in which he found himself. The judge made allowance for the plea of guilty, including saving the Crown the expense of a long and costly trial, and that the matter had been hanging over the applicant's head for a long time. 
    16   The judge thought that the argument that there were special circumstances because this was the applicant's first prison sentence lacked weight. The applicant had previously been sentenced and had already spent nearly two years in gaol. The judge also thought that, given the applicant's strong family support, an additional term of one year would give more than adequate time for him to readjust into the community. The judge thought that there were no special circumstances warranting an additional term longer than one year. 
    17   The applicant complained that while the additional term of one year amounted to one-third of the minimum term of three years, the additional term was one-fifth of the period to be served in custody, taking into account the pre-sentence custody. The judge regarded six years penal servitude as the appropriate total sentence. 
    18   The applicant submitted this was a case in which the judge should have found special circumstances and directed a longer additional term. The special circumstances included that the offence in question was the occasion for the applicant to go to prison for the first time, his age of twenty when he committed the offence, the time spent in custody would amount to almost five years of a total sentence of six years, and the length of time that the matter had been hanging over the applicant's head. The applicant further submitted that with a longer sentence a longer period of parole supervision was required. It was also stressed that the applicant became depressed while in gaol. That is quite common. Reliance was also placed on a psychological assessment. 
    19   The difficulty with the applicant's submissions is that they are at variance with the judge's findings. The judge had the opportunity to assess the applicant and his family situation. The evidence revealed that after the applicant underwent his first stretch of pre-sentence custody he was able to find employment and worked overtime. He was naturally affected as the charge was still pending. 
    20   The judge took the pre-sentence custody into account. He determined that an additional term of one year sufficed in the circumstances of the applicant. The judge regarded five years in custody as being required. This was a very bad and a very serious offence and the judge was not in error in the view which he held. It should not be overlooked that after each of the periods of pre-sentence custody he spent significant periods out of custody on bail; that is, two years two months and seven and a half months respectively. This is not a case of a continuous period of five years in custody. 
    21   As matters of substance were argued, I propose that leave to appeal be granted. The appeal, however, should be dismissed. 
    22   SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
    23   HULME J: I also agree. 
    24   SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the court will be appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v Peter Kenneth STANLEY  
      
     JUDGMENT: 
    1   SULLY J: The Court has come to a view about this matter. Carruthers AJ will deliver the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Peter Kenneth Stanley applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Twigg QC at the Coffs Harbour District Court on 1 February 1999. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a knife under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 as amended. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude.  
    3   His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of four years penal servitude to commence on 10 September 1998 which was the date of the offence and the date upon which the applicant was taken into custody, and to expire on 9 September 2002. His Honour imposed an additional term of three years to commence on 10 September 2002 and to expire on 9 September 2005. 
    4   I have found this to be, speaking for myself, a troublesome matter, made more troublesome by the fact that the applicant was unrepresented, although we have had the benefit of considerable assistance by Mr Maxwell QC on behalf of the respondent Crown.  
    5   The applicant, who regards himself as an Aboriginal, was born on 6 November 1968. He has led an itinerant life and has convictions in this State, the Northern Territory and other States. His prior record commenced on 15 February 1985, when he was aged 16, and his litany of offences concludes on 13 August 1998 when he was given the benefit of a recognizance in relation to assault matters and stealing property in a dwelling house. Interestingly, however, prior to the subject sentence, he has not served more than three months by way of a custodial sentence which was imposed upon him on 3 August 1998. He has, in a disturbing way, referred to his earlier itinerant life, flowing from a dysfunctional family background, living on the streets in Melbourne, becoming addicted to drugs and the heavy consumption of alcohol.  
    6   He told the sentencing Judge that he has always had a problem with alcohol and drugs and that is to block out a lot of things which happened to him as a child, including sexual abuse. Without, in any sense, criticising anyone, I note that at the time he appeared before the sentencing Judge a pre-sentence report was not available and one had never been sought. The applicant has explained today to this court that because of his incarceration whilst “bail refused” at Grafton, facilities were not available he contends, for a pre-sentence report to be obtained. In any event, whatever the explanation one has never been obtained although this Court knows something of his background from the evidence which the applicant gave before Judge Twigg. 
    7   Judge Twigg did have the benefit of a report from the methadone unit at the Long Bay Complex, which appears to be undated, but certainly refers to the fact that the applicant sought to be placed on a community Methadone Program. However, the best that could be done for him was to be put on a waiting list. It has been extremely helpful in determining with the sentence imposed on him was within the range available to the sentencing Judge, from a discretionary point of view, by reference to the Judicial Commission statistics and I will refer to them shortly.  
    8   Firstly, may I refer to the facts of the subject offence. On about 7 September 1998 the applicant was released from the three months gaol sentence to which I have already referred. He was at Coffs Harbour which may fairly be categorised somewhat generally as his home base. He was staying with friends in Coffs Harbour. However, having been released from gaol, the first thing he did was to commence consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and ingesting some drugs. He obviously felt the need to obtain more drugs and he was misinformed, it would appear, that the male occupant of the house next door had drugs in those premises.  
    9   The applicant then embarked upon an inept attempt to threaten the male occupant of those premises with a knife, whilst partially disguised in order to obtain access to the drugs which he believed were on the premises. He, therefore, possessed himself of a beanie and cut a hole in the beanie and obtained a 14cm knife from the premises where he was residing and went into the next door premises. However, the male occupant happened to be down the road doing some shopping and a young friend of his, Mr Colley, who was only 18 years of age, was outside the house.  
    10   The applicant approached him and forced him to go inside the house.  
    11   Then he punched him to the throat and cheek area and asked for the “gooey” several times. The victim had no knowledge of there being any drugs in the premises. He was fearful for his safety and he was fearful for the safety of the two young children who were in the premises and who were no doubt terrified by what was happening. After a short time, Mr Colley opened his wallet to show the applicant that he did not reside in the subject premises and gave him $20 from his wallet to get rid of him and asked him to get out of the house. The applicant took the money and left the house.  
    12   The victim’s friend, the occupant of the house, returned and armed himself with a iron bar to confront the applicant who had readily been identified by the two children. As it turns out, it was not necessary to use the iron bar because police officers immediately came to the premises. Although the applicant denied any involvement in the offence, the police, because of the identification available to them, arrested him and he has remained in custody ever since. It was not until he came before the District Court, as I understand it, that he actually admitted the offence. 
    13   He has explained to us today, if one accepts it, that this was because it was not really until some six months after the commission of the offence that his memory came back, such was the extent to which he was affected by alcohol and drugs at the time of the commission of the offence.  
    14   Understandably, in his remarks on sentence, Judge Twigg stressed the strong deterrent element involved in sentencing for this offence, and the necessity, to use his Honour’s words, to send out a strong warning to the community that those who would commit such violent crimes for their drug habit must be punished, and a strong deterrent must be given to the prisoner and the community at large that such offences will not be tolerated. 
    15   Turning then to the judicial commission statistics, firstly, if one looks at the statistics for the full terms, of offenders in relation to robbery being armed, or in company, of the higher courts between December 1994 and July 1999, one notes that in 920 cases full term custodial sentence were imposed. That is an extremely reliable group. They demonstrate that a full term of seven years was imposed on only 5% of offenders. That is a total of 46 out of 920 cases. There was another 4%four percent of eight years, 1% of nine years, 1%of ten years and 1% of 12 years. Albeit, the sentences before the Court today will require some minor adjustment when one goes to the minimum terms for all offenders over the same period and with the same total number of sample cases because a minimum term of four years involved only 2% of all offenders, namely, 21 out of the 920. There were only some 63 of the 920 total cases who received more than a minimum term of four years.  
    16   It seems to me that when one looks at the subjective considerations here, (albeit the ingestion of alcohol and drugs can never be an excuse for the commission of such a serious crime as armed robbery), and balances those subjective circumstances against the objective circumstances, they do not put the applicant in the elite class of 2% to 4% disclosed by those statistics.  
    17   No doubt Judge Twigg did not have these helpful statistics available to him. I have concluded, not without some anxiety because of the serious nature of the offence, that the imposition of the minimum term of four years and an additional term of three years upon this particular applicant went beyond the sentencing discretion available to his Honour, and, therefore, I would conclude that the intervention of this Court is called for. 
    18   It would be wrong of me not to say that I was impressed by what the applicant, unrepresented, has put to us. He presents as looking physically well and mentally alert and a somewhat different person to the one who committed the subject offence. He has produced various certificates indicative of the fact that over the period of his incarceration he has of his own motivation and assisted by those persons within the Corrective Services Institution who care for the welfare of prisoners, made a determined effort to rehabilitate himself.  
    19   He seems to determined to come to terms with his past conduct. Whether he will or not, we do not know. One can only hope that he will. But they are matters which he is entitled to have taken into consideration in the re sentencing process. Regard must, of course, be had to the guideline judgment in Regina v Henry. (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It would seem to me that applying the principles in Henry and adverting to the particular subjective and objective circumstances of this case that an appropriate minimum term for this court to imposed upon the applicant is one of three years penal servitude and an appropriate additional term is two years. Accordingly, I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be upheld and that the minimum and additional terms imposed by his Honour Judge Twigg be quashed and, in lieu thereof, a minimum term of three years penal servitude be imposed to commence on 10 September 1998 and to expire on 9 September 2001 and an additional term of two years to commence on 10 September 2001 and to expire on 9 September 2003. 
    20   SULLY J: I am content to join in the making of the orders as proposed by Carruthers AJ. I must say that, for myself, I regard this case as very much on the borderline, not least of all because of the fact that the offence in question was committed at a time when the applicant was subject to the recognizance, of which his Honour has spoken, granted on 13 August 1998; and that he was, as well, barely two days into his parole period, as explained by his Honour.  
    21   But I think that, for the reasons given by his Honour, such doubts as one might have about the applicant deserve, in the circumstances of this case, to be resolved in his favour. Not without some hesitation I think it is appropriate to intervene in the way his Honour proposes.  
    22   I agree with the orders proposed; and the orders will, therefore be as his Honour has announced them. 
    23   Mr Stanley, we have intervened and we have taken your overall sentence down from seven years to five; and we have taken your minimum term down from four to three; and your additional term down from three to two. Do you understand? 
    24   APPLICANT: Yes. 
    25   SULLY, J: I hope it won't be thought untoward if I say that you are lucky to have got that concession. It gives you the chance that you want to make something of your future. We hope you don't throw it away. 
    26   APPLICANT: Thank you.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60684/99 IRELAND J HULME J SMART AJ Friday, 18 February, 2000 
     
     REGINA -v- John Steven DAWSON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1    IRELAND J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to S 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912, against the claimed inadequacy of sentence imposed upon the respondent by Judge Hosking QC at the District Court Sydney on 15 October, 1999. 
     
      
    2    On 13 July, 1999 the respondent pleaded guilty at the District Court at Sydney to the counts contained in two indictments, the first of which alleged that on 29 June, 1997 at Petersham he entered the dwelling house of Raymond Angus situated at 13 Marshall Street with intent to steal certain property of Raymond Angus and immediately after entering the dwelling house, did wound Raymond Angus and Ian Smith. 
     
      
    3    That charge was laid under S 111(3) of the Crimes Act, 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 20 years. 
     
      
    4    The second indictment relates to a charge of obtain benefit by deception in contravention of S 178BA of the Crimes Act, 1900. The indictment contains six counts of dishonestly obtaining money, the offences having taken place between 7th February and 1st April, 1997 - the amounts totalling $4,270. Judge Hosking took into account on a Form 1, ten further offences under S 178BA, totalling $8,540 and one charge of larceny regarding $300, the money in each case being the property of Raymond Angus. 
     
      
    5    On the matters contained in the first indictment, the respondent was sentenced to 2 years penal servitude to be served by way of periodic detention, to commence on 22 October, 1999. In imposing that sentence, the Form 1 matters were taken into account. 
     
      
    6    On the second indictment, a sentence of 12 months imprisonment on each of the six counts was imposed, to be served concurrently with the matters contained in the first indictment by way of periodic detention commencing on the same date, that is to say 22 October, 1999. 
     
      
    7    The facts relating to the charges are not in dispute. They have been shortly stated in the written submissions furnished by Mr Frearson, counsel for the appellant, in the following terms:- 
     
      
    8    Re: Count 1: On 29 June, 1997 the respondent entered the home of Raymond Angus at Petersham. He gained entry to the house despite attempts by Angus to stop him. The respondent pushed Angus to the floor. He entered Angus’ bedroom where he took a wallet and attempted to depart. Angus and another man, Ian Smith, struggled with the respondent to stop him leaving. In the course of this struggle, they were both struck with a metal pipe. Mr Angus retrieved the wallet and the respondent ran from the premises. Mr Angus suffered injuries including lacerations to the hand and head, both of which required sutures. X-rays revealed undisplaced fractures to the skull. Mr Ian Smith received a laceration to the head, which required sutures and a fracture to his right forearm. 
     
      
    9    These were serious injuries, I nevertheless note that Mr Smith was discharged on the day of admission, that is to say on 29 June, 1997 and Mr Angus was discharged from hospital on the next day, 30 June, 1997. 
     
      
    10    The section 178BA charges relate to the use by the respondent of a number of Mastercards that belonged to Raymond Angus over the period February to May, 1997, the respondent having obtained these cards from Mr Angus. The PIN number was kept with the cards as Mr Angus suffered from memory loss.  
     
      
    11    In his succinct and very much to the point written submissions, Mr Frearson has set out the following subjective features considered by the learned sentencing judge:- 
     
      
    12    1. Sexual abuse of the respondent as a teenager which has led to a fragile emotional condition and a serious drug problem. 
     
      
    13    2. Genuine expressions of remorse. 
     
      
    14    3. Impressive efforts to turn his life around. 
     
      
    15    4. The respondent has reached a turning point in his life. 
     
      
    16    5. The respondent gave evidence during the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    17    In support of his contention that the sentence imposed upon the respondent was manifestly inadequate, counsel has identified a number of sentencing principles, supported by appropriate references to authorities. These include:- 
     
      
    18    (a) The need for the sentence imposed to reflect the objective seriousness of the crime - R -v- Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594; Veen -v- The Queen (No 1)  143 CLR 458; R -v- Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 
     
      
    19    (b) The importance of both special and general deterrence - R -v- Radich [1954] NZLR 86 at 87. 
     
      
    20    (c) The need to maintain reasonable proportion between a sentence which will deter others whilst tempering the effect of the sentence with humanity, the latter usually being subsidiary to the former. 
     
      
    21    (d) The necessary constraint to allowing subjective features to blind justice to the objective seriousness of the crime - R -v- Martin (unreported - NSWCCA - 19.3.92). 
     
      
    22    (e) Recognition that some measure of rehabilitation has been achieved necessarily remains subsidiary to the need for a sentence to act as a deterrent to the public - R -v- Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 469. 
     
      
    23    Our attention has also been brought to the fact of the seriousness of the matters set out in both indictments and the fact that the respondent’s prior record for break, enter and steal offences is a significant consideration. 
     
      
    24    A further point made by the appellant is that the reference by the learned sentencing judge to giving a credit for 10 months pre-sentence custody, in the period 21.12.97 to 6.10.98 - i.e. 9 months and 15 days, was in respect of a 9 months fixed term referable to unrelated matters. Accordingly, the submission is made that an allowance of 10 months offends the general principle to be found in such authorities as R -v- McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 and R -v- S.A.E. (unreported - NSWCCA - 3.4.1997) which confines such allowances to custody exclusively referable to the crime for which the offender is being sentenced. 
     
      
    25    In this regard the concession made by the Crown at the sentencing hearing is not binding on this court - R -v- Qi (unreported - NSWCCA - 22.6.98). 
     
      
    26    In the present case the position is not altogether straight forward in that the passage appearing at p 17 of the transcript on sentence indicates that the 9 month sentence, being a fixed term, was imposed at a time when the respondent was bail refused with regard to the present matters and as a practical matter a custodial sentence was imposed in the Local Court in circumstances where, absent the fact that the respondent was bail refused, such a course may not have been followed. In any event, the considerations of totality would have warranted Judge Hosking taking into account the period the respondent spent in custody. Certainly the Crown at the sentence hearing was in no doubt that his Honour was appropriately to take the period spent in custody by the respondent into consideration. 
     
      
    27    The learned sentencing judge took time to consider the material placed before him and to reach a decision on the appropriate sentence to be imposed. He frankly disclosed his thought processes, both at the initial stage, and after having reflected at some length upon the matter. The care with which his Honour considered the whole of the material before him and the considerations to be borne in mind is plain to see in the remarks on sentence. It is also clear from what was said that his Honour was mindful of the fact that the 9 month period in custody was served with regard to unrelated matters, albeit overlapping with the bail refused period regarding the matters in question. 
     
      
    28    One of the factors which bears upon the sentencing considerations in this case is that the serious offences in the first indictment had taken place two and a half years before sentencing and in the interim period there had been clear and cogent evidence of rehabilitation and a turn around in the respondent’s career path. 
     
      
    29    This consideration has been brought to our attention by counsel for the respondent in the reference to Mill -v- The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 where the High Court cited with approval (at 64) the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in R -v- Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519-520:- 
     
      
       
        
        “where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between offence and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing the dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner”. 
        
       
      
    30    It is submitted, on behalf of the respondent, that the approach adopted by the learned sentencing judge displayed the “understanding and flexibility of approach” required in the particular circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    31    There is, in my view, force in this submission. 
     
      
    32    For my part, I confess to being troubled by this appeal. Given the gravity of the offences and their multiplicity, at first blush, the sentence imposed has the indicia of being manifestly inadequate. In other respects I am not persuaded sentencing error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    33    The subjective aspect which weighed heavily in the respondent’s favour was expressed by Judge Hosking in these terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “My finding is that the prisoner has reached a turning point in his life and this has highly favourable consequences for the prisoner. That this is not a finding based upon sympathy or sentiment. It has a solid evidentiary basis in the reports of Illawarra Health Service which became Exhibit 1 and 2”. 
        
       
      
    34    I would add that the favourable consequences extend also to the community. 
     
      
    35    Where, as in this case, it would appear that notwithstanding serious transgressions of the law in the past, an offender has convincingly demonstrated that he has reached the cross-roads and moved along the path to rehabilitation, this court has been reluctant to interfere, when a judge has exercised leniency to facilitate such rehabilitation. 
     
      
    36    I have reached the conclusion that that is the proper course to be adopted in this case. 
     
      
    37    For these reasons, I would propose that in the exercise of the available discretion this court should dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    38    HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    39    I would add only this: Although I do not embrace, in their precise terms, all of the remarks of King CJ on R -v- Ozenkowski (1982) 5 A Crim R 594, there is much with which I do agree. In this case the sentencing judge extended leniency to the respondent. In my view, this court should echo that approach. 
     
      
    40    SMART AJ: I agree with Ireland J. 
     
      
    41    IRELAND J: The order of the court will be as I have proposed.

     REGINA v Craig Raymond CAMPBELL 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SULLY J: The Court has come to a view about this matter. I invite Carruthers AJ to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Craig Raymond Campbell seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Armitage at the Dubbo District Court on 16 October 1998. The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of break and enter with intent under s113(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (hereinafter the Act). They were counts one and four of the indictment. This offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. A further three counts under s112 of the Act of break, enter and steal. They were counts two, eight and nine. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. A further count under s154A of the Act of allow to be carried in a stolen conveyance. This was count three. This offence carries a maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. A further one count of receiving s118 of the Act. This was count six. This offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. Finally, one count of possess housebreaking implements under s114(1)(b) of the Act. This was count seven. This offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude. 
    3   The indictment contained a further count of break enter and steal (count five). The applicant pleaded not guilty to this count and the Crown accepted the guilty pleas in relation to the other eight counts in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
    4   In relation to counts one, four, six, eight and nine his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two and a half years penal servitude to commence on 27 March 1998 and to expire on 26 September 2000. His Honour imposed an additional term of two years to commence on 27 September 2000 and to expire on 26 September 2002. 
    5   In relation to count two, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of three years penal servitude to commence on 27 March 1998 and to expire on 26 March 2001 with an additional term of two years to commence on 27 March 2001 and to expire on 26 March 2003. Count two was the most serious of the break enter and steal offences. 
    6   In relation to counts three and seven, his Honour imposed a fixed term of one year penal servitude to commence on 27 March 1998 and to expire on 26 March 1999. 
    7   Thus the effective overall sentence is one of five years. The effective minimum term is one of three years and the applicant will be eligible for parole on 26 March 2001. His Honour found special circumstances and imposed a longer than normal additional term. 
    8   The applicant was born on 10 November 1973 and was accordingly aged 24 at the time of the sentences and is presently aged 26. The applicant is of aboriginal descent. His background is set out in a report by Ms Anna Robilliard, psychologist, dated 8 October 1998. It appears from that report that the applicant’s father who was an alcoholic, died in 1991. His mother lives in Dubbo. He spent his early childhood in the Redfern Waterloo area and left school at the age of 15 with a rudimentary education. He has never been in paid employment. From the age of 19 to the age of 21 he lived with a girlfriend, Raelene, who is five years older than himself and they have a young child. According to Ms Robilliard the applicant is sincerely committed to that child. 
    9   When the applicant was aged 20 he discovered that Raelene was using heroin and he likewise became addicted to that drug. He began drinking alcohol at the age of 17 and by the age of 20 he would often drink all day. However at about that age he ceased drinking but moved into drugs and was a user of marijuana until his arrest on 27 March 1998. He had a heroin habit for about a year when aged 21 but told Ms Robilliard he took control of his addiction during the 12 months he served in prison. On his release he returned to Raelene, found that she was using cocaine and then joined her in the use of that drug, not because he liked it but because he wanted to be close to her. 
    10   The sentencing judge noted that psychometric tests carried out by Ms Robilliard disclosed that the applicant functions at around the lower average range. He demonstrated quite adequate understanding for everyday purposes and is capable of acquiring basic self understanding and insight. The applicant was noted by his Honour, by reference to the report of Ms Robilliard, to be very disturbed in his thinking with extremely negative self opinion and feelings of self worth. He is distressed by certain events and struggles to control underlying levels of associated residual anger. He has expressed an interest in attending a rehabilitation program. Ms Robilliard supports that proposal and believes he would work well in an appropriate psychotherapeutic setting. 
    11   During the sentencing process his Honour noted with regard to the prisoner’s record that “it is enough to say that it is of no assistance to him”. When one looks at the applicant’s antecedent criminal record his Honour’s comment maybe categorised as euphemistic indeed. The applicant was first before a Court on 28 October 1987 when he was 12 years of age. Thereafter he was constantly before various courts in New South Wales. Ms Robilliard specifically noted, from an examination of the applicant’s antecedent record, that although he has committed regular offences none featured an element of violence until 1992 when he was charged with malicious wounding. Since then he has incurred repeated assault charges, many of which have been directed against police officers. This seemed to Ms Robilliard to reflect some change in his disposition or mental health. Prior to the subject sentences the longest term which the applicant served was an effective minimum term of 12 months imprisonment concluding on 9 January 1998. Having been released to parole in January 1998 the applicant shortly thereafter committed the subject series of offences. 
    12   His Honour did not recount the details of the various offences in his reasons for sentence. A helpful summary of them is however to be found in the applicant’s written submissions before this Court under the hand of Mr Nicholson QC. I shall gratefully adopt that summary.  
    13   The most serious of the offences was the break enter and steal at premises at Margaret Crescent Dubbo when some nine paintings from Central Australia and other items were taken. The value of the property taken was estimated to be $26,500. This is of course a reference to count two. 
    14   On the same day the applicant had broken into premises at Tink Avenue Dubbo by smashing the kitchen window. In a number of rooms cupboards were opened and drawers were pulled out as the applicant apparently searched for things to steal. However the home owners did not subsequently report anything as missing. 
    15   Four days later the applicant broke and entered premises at Cobra Street Dubbo by forcing the rear door. Two bedrooms showed signs of being searched and a rear door to the garage was also opened. 
    16   Two weeks earlier business premises at 43 Douglas Mawson Drive Dubbo had been broken into and a number of power tools had been stolen. Two days later the applicant pawned a hammer drill for $70 and a petrol generator for $150. Both items had earlier been stolen from those premises. The applicant was charged with receiving those goods. 
    17   On 21 March 1998 the applicant broke and entered business premises at Young Street Dubbo. The manager found a flyscreen had been removed and a window forced open. Two hundred and eight dollars plus a couple of cameras and a carry bag had been stolen. A cabinet which had contained money had been forced and the lock was damaged. The applicant left the scene by taxi which was intercepted by the police. When confronted by the police the applicant sought to flee. He was apprehended and found to have a yellow screwdriver concealed in his left sock. The applicant was charged with possessing housebreaking implements and subsequently that day released on bail. 
    18   On 9 March 1998 the applicant broke into and entered a workshop in Boundary Road Dubbo through a skylight which he smashed with a piece of wood. A mobile phone was taken. 
    19   These eight offences occurred over a three week period from 7 to 27 March 1998. All offences were committed while the applicant was on parole. The applicant was on bail when the offences of 23 March (counts 1, 2 and 3) and the offence on 27 March (count 4) were committed. 
    20   The first ground of appeal is that the sentences are manifestly excessive in the circumstances. According to the submissions on behalf of the applicant some 90% of break, enter and steal matters are dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty that can be imposed by a magistrate for the offence is two years. Where there is more than one offence the maximum penalty is three years. Thus any offender dealt with by a magistrate would not receive a sentence greater than three years in relation to any particular offence of break enter and steal and to such a sentence the provisions of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 would normally apply. Thus a quarter of the sentence or more would be taken from the minimum term. 
    21   Counsel for the applicant seeks to rely in this regard on comments by Grove J In the Matter of the Attorney General’s Application No.1 Under s26 of The Criminal Appeal Act dated 16 December 1999. However I do not, with respect, think that the judgment of Grove J goes as far as the applicant contends. The submission is that the District Court in setting a sentence should have regard to the range of sentences being imposed for like matters in the Local Court and as I have said the judgment of Grove J is relied on to support that proposition. Having carefully examined the judgment of Grove J, I have concluded that at the highest, for relevant purposes, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
       “Of further significance in the present case is the circumstance that by choice of the Crown, the overwhelming majority of these cases are proceeded with in the Local Court where the maximum sentence is well below what the Crown put forward as a possible guideline in the present proceedings.” 
       
      
    22   I think the most that one could infer from what his Honour said is that the difficulty of fixing a guideline or one of the difficulties of fixing a guideline for the offence under s112(1) is that the guideline suggested by the Crown is inappropriate to the majority of offences which are dealt with in the Local Court by reason of the maximum penalty which can be imposed in the Local Court. His Honour did not say that when a judge is dealing with a matter in the District Court under s112(1) he or she is required to have regard, or should have regard, to the range of sentences being imposed for like matters in the Local Court. 
    23   Bearing in mind the prior criminal record of the present applicant, the seriousness of the offences for which he stood to be sentenced, and the fact that count two could only be dealt with in the District Court the Crown was perfectly entitled to have elected to have all these matters dealt with in the District Court. The matters then being properly and lawfully in the District Court for adjudication it was appropriate for the sentencing judge to deal with the matters by reference to the maximum sentences which could be imposed in the District Court for the relevant offences. However I am mindful of the authority of this Court that the maximum sentences which could be imposed for like offences in the Local Court may be a relevant consideration when sentencing in the District Court. 
    24   Be that as it may, counsel for the applicant have drawn this Court’s attention to the fact that the Judicial Commission statistics disclose that offenders sentenced in the District Court serve an average minimum term of 20 months for s112(1) offences where the felony is stealing. Specifically those figures reveal that of 483 offenders sentenced to imprisonment for break, enter and steal, where there may well have been more than one offence for these offenders, only 12% received an overall sentence of five years and only 13% received minimum terms of three years or more. Thus the applicant’s sentence falls within the top 13% of sentences imposed within the District Court. It was contended that the objective gravity of the break enter and steal offences in the instant matter was not such as to require a sentence to fall within the 13% range. 
    25   In the Attorney General’s Application No. 1 to which I have referred, this Court identified by way of guidelines aggravating factors in the commission of offences under s112(1). The first of those factors is whether the offence is committed whilst the offender is at conditional liberty on bail or parole. All the subject offences were committed whilst the applicant was under supervision on parole serving two concurrent additional terms for the offences of break, enter and steal and receiving. Four of the offences, counts one to four, were committed whilst the applicant was on bail. 
    26   A second factor in the guidelines is whether the offender has a prior record particularly for like offences. This applicant has a lengthy record for like offences. 
    27   A third factor in the guidelines is the multiplicity of offences, in which case regard must be had to the criminality involved in each offence. See Pearce v The Queen. (1998) 72 ALJR 1416. Of course, in the instant case, there was a multiplicity of offences all of which had a relatively high degree of criminality. 
    28   A further factor in the guidelines is the value of the stolen property to the victim, whether that value is measured in terms of money or in terms of sentimental value. That factor is particularly relevant to the second count in the instant indictment which relates to the stolen pictures. 
    29   It is perfectly true, as Mr Zahra of counsel submitted in his particularly careful and helpful arguments before this Court that there are other factors in the guidelines which play no role in the subject offences. However, it must be said that it would be a rare case indeed which embraced all the factors in the guidelines. 
    30   It is convenient then to turn to the second ground of appeal by which the applicant contends that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the subjective circumstances. In this regard the applicant contends that he should have been given greater credit for pleading guilty, notwithstanding that the Crown case against him was strong. Secondly, it was contended that the applicant’s aboriginality is a factor that his Honour should have taken into account as a basis for understanding the applicant’s sense of dispossession and lack of opportunity. Specific reliance was placed here upon para 40 of the judgment of Grove J in The Attorney General’s Application No. 1. There his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “A study (ANZ Journal of Criminology Vol 32 Pt 2) has concluded that aboriginal males are ‘over- represented’ among those convicted of breaking entering and stealing. It would have to be recognised that many such offenders would merit particular consideration for the reasons elaborated in  
       R v Fernando 
        (1992) 76 A Crim R 58.” 
       
      
    31   Grove J went on to say that, in his view, the existence of such significantly large groups touches upon the content of guidelines rather than upon whether the Court should refrain from issuing guidelines. Interestingly the guidelines, as formulated make no specific reference to aboriginality. 
    32   Counsel for the Crown has pointed out in his written submissions that during the course of his remarks on sentence Judge Armitage said: 
     
      
       
       “In particular I have regard to the applicant’s deprived background.” 
       
      
    33   I accept that this was a reference to the applicant’s aboriginality and the deprivation which flowed therefrom. 
    34   For the purposes of the instant case I have carefully re-read Fernando’s case but I am unable to conclude on the evidence available to Judge Armitage that the sentences which he imposed involved any conflict with the principles enunciated in Fernando or any misunderstanding of those principles. 
    35   I have already referred to the view expressed by Ms Robilliard that the applicant would work well in an appropriate psychotherapeutic setting. This is an observation which was relied upon heavily by the applicant in these proceedings. It seems to me however that his Honour accommodated that belief by fixing an extended additional term during which the applicant would be subject to supervision. 
    36   I am quite unable to conclude, giving full weight to the subjective circumstances of the applicant’s aboriginality and the principles enunciated in Fernando, and the terms of his Honour's sentencing remarks that this aspect of the application for leave to appeal should be upheld. 
    37   Sadly the case does fall into what seems to now have become a well known syndrome of young aboriginal males, lack of opportunity, an early dysfunctional family and social life, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment and criminality. However, taking all that into account, the sentencing regime imposed by his Honour was in my respectful view, well within the discretionary range available to him. I would in the circumstances grant the application for leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal. 
    38   SULLY J: I agree. 
    39   FOSTER AJ: I likewise agree. 
    40   SULLY J: The orders will be as proposed by his Honour. Thank you for your help Mr Zahra. Thank you Mr Campbell, go down please. 
    41   ZAHRA: Your Honour might those certificates be returned to Mr Campbell? Can I say one thing before Mr Campbell leaves about that. Your Honour from my conversations with him this morning he was very accepting of the difficulties that his application faced here today but there was an element of pride in his progress and he understands that your Honours could not take that into account in the application but he has made excellent progress and he was rather proud of that this morning and I think in Mr Campbell's presence it should be noted that he has made quite significant progress since the sentence but he was very accepting of the difficulty of the application here today. 
    42   SULLY J: Thank you Mr Zahra. What’s been said can be noted in the judgment.

    1    GROVE J :  The appellant was convicted on two counts of sexual assault without consent in circumstances of aggravation after a trial before Ainslie-Wallace DCJ and a jury. Two grounds of appeal were argued and in the alternative the appellant sought leave to appeal against the severity of sentence. At the conclusion of the trial the appellant also appeared for sentence after pleas of guilty to two counts in a separate indictment charging assault occasioning actual bodily harm and larceny. On this latter indictment the appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of twelve and six months penal servitude and on the counts of the trial indictment he was sentenced to concurrent total terms of eight years penal servitude cumulative upon the twelve months sentence and divided into minimum and additional terms of five years and three years respectively. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The relevant grounds of appeal were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “That the learned trial judge erred in failing to discharge the jury after the evidence ‘a lot of people have been saying that he (the accused) had a gun and that he wasn’t afraid to use it and kill people’, and 
         
        
        
         
         Her Honour erred in the direction she gave concerning the complainant’s evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    3    The appellant and the complainant had been acquainted for a short time before the offences. He was then aged twenty years and she fourteen. On Saturday 10 August they encountered each other near some shops at Shalvey. The complainant was in the company of two female friends. There was some verbal exchange there and at a later encounter near the appellant’s home he asked the complainant if she would accompany him to church on Sunday.  
     
      
       
      
    4    Some time before lunch on that following day, the appellant called at the complainant’s home and again asked if she wanted to go to church. She obtained permission from her parents to go, changed her clothes and went with the appellant to his home. A party of significant size was to attend from the home at a Mormon church in Doonside where the service was expected to extend from 1 to 4pm. Arrangements were made for travel and a number of the appellant’s family proceeded in a red commodore car and the complainant and the appellant waited in the home where they were to be collected by the appellant’s sister. Whilst awaiting her arrival the appellant took the complainant into his room where forced penile intercourse and an act of fellatio took place.  
     
      
       
      
    5    Subsequently the appellant’s sister arrived and they travelled with her to the church in her white van. After the service they returned to the appellant’s home at about 4.30 pm where a meal was available but the complainant did not partake. Her father arrived in the evening and conveyed her home. She did not tell him that anything untoward had happened to her whilst she was in the company of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The following day (Monday) the complainant stayed home from school. The appellant visited her home and told her to come back to his home with him. This invitation/direction was accompanied by a threat in terms that the complainant would know “what would happen otherwise”. The complainant told her mother that she was going to the appellant’s house and then did so. At the house she was taken into the appellant’s room where she was forced to engage in fellating him. After this, the complainant ran from his room and left the house without speaking to anybody.  
     
      
       
      
    7    She went to the home of a friend named Kelley. Kelley was one of the group at the Shalvey shops on the previous Saturday. The complainant told her that she had been raped and Kelley took her to a woman named Barbara. On the following day the complainant was medically examined.  
     
      
       
      
    8    The foregoing represents the essence of the complainant’s sworn evidence and does not purport to recapitulate detail or elaboration. The appellant gave sworn evidence. He denied committing any sexual assault upon the complainant and specifically denied those alleged to have occurred on Sunday and Monday 11 and 12 August. He denied that the complainant entered his bedroom at all on the Sunday and said that he had met her at the shops on Monday and it was from there that they had gone to his home where, upon arrival, his father had told him to take her home which he did.  
     
      
       
      
    9    There was no eyewitness to any of the activity which was the subject of the indictment. Subject to application of the onus of proof it was for the jury to resolve this total contradiction in the versions of the complainant and the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The jury were not however left to deliberate upon what might loosely be described as oath against oath. There were numerous circumstances revealed in the evidence which had potential for assisting in assessing the credibility of the versions of each of the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    11    It is not necessary for present purposes to comb the evidence to identify every one of these but it may be useful to refer to some of the more prominent circumstances. The complainant made no report on the Sunday and particularly did not avail herself of the opportunity to speak to her father; she was collected by the appellant’s sister and seen by her and other members of the appellant’s family at the church service and later, none of them detected any sign of distress and they testified that she displayed a relatively happy countenance; the unlikelihood of voluntary return by the complainant to the appellant’s home on the Monday if she had been subjected to serious assault on the previous day; the evidence of Dr Marks concerning her examination of the complainant on 13 August when she detected frank injuries in the area of the complainant’s genitalia and on 20 August (the reason for examination in this respect not being possible on 13 August being explained) observation of hymenal disruption; the evidence of Kelley that during the encounter on Saturday 11 August the appellant had said separately to the complainant and to herself that he wished to see “if he can put his big dick inside” of them; the admission in evidence by the appellant that he wanted to accompany the complainant to a doctor’s appointment on the Monday in the context of his assertion to police, affirmed in his evidence, that the fourteen year old complainant had expressed a wish to have sex with him and his further assertion that there had been no congress at all between them of a sexual nature. 
     
      
       
      
    12    The refusal to discharge the jury referred to in the first ground of appeal arose in these circumstances. Shortly before the trial and apparently following a conference with the complainant a letter was dispatched to the appellant’s solicitor containing the following relevant advice: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “You are hereby put on notice that the Crown proposes to lead evidence from the complainant that the reason she went to the accused house on Monday 12 August 1996 was threats made by the accused on 11 August 1996 when the accused produced to her what she believes was a pistol. 
         
        
        
         
         It is anticipated that the complainant will give evidence that the accused told her to return to his home on the following day - that he would harm the complainant and her family if she did not comply - and that he went to a wardrobe and produced an item which was partly obscured but appeared to be fitted with a barrel consistent with being a pistol.” 
         
        
       
      
    13    In the event, the evidence did not exactly match the particulars provided. The complainant was asked about her state of mind relative to fear of the appellant and threats which had emanated from him and in response to a question whether there were any means of which she was aware whereby he would be able to carry out threats she stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “A lot of people had been like saying that he had a gun and that he wasn’t afraid to use it to kill people.” 
         
        
       
      
    14    She further testified that she saw what looked like a gun in the appellant’s wardrobe. However she asserted that she had made this observation on the Monday which was, of course, after she had returned to the appellant’s home on the second occasion. It can be mentioned that there was evidence disputing the presence of any wardrobe at all in the appellant’s room. It is also convenient to refer now to the judgment of the learned trial judge on the application to discharge the jury when she recounted that the evidence of the complainant consisted of words to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “People said he had a gun and he wasn’t afraid to use it to kill someone.” 
         
        
        
       Her Honour did not have the benefit of a transcript. It was argued that her Honour’s paraphrase showed that she had a mistaken appreciation of the evidence and that that appreciation was of a markedly milder potential prejudice to the appellant than the words actually used. I reject that submission. Her Honour’s paraphrase shows a clear appreciation of the relevant thrust of the evidence namely that the complainant believed that the appellant was capable of violence of a high order. Of course, the issue in focus was the complainant’s belief and not the truth or otherwise of its content. 
        
       
      
    15    The ground of appeal is expressed in terms of a challenge to the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge and the inhibitions upon appellate intervention against the exercise of such a discretion are governed by well known authority: see House v The King 1936 55 CLR 499 and the many cases in which that authority has been applied. Counsel appearing for the appellant at trial (who did not appear in the appeal) argued his application for discharge of the jury on the basis of somewhat wide ranging submissions but the essential argument referred to the statutory requirement in s137 of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence where probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The applicability of that section directly faced the obstacle that no ruling was sought before the evidence emerged, it being common ground that the anticipation was that the evidence would be as particularized and not as it emerged. Thus the argument was mounted that if the evidence had been accurately anticipated, her Honour would have in the circumstances ruled that the probative value was relevantly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and that discharge was a necessary remedy to avoid miscarriage. 
     
      
       
      
    16    It was not contended that the foreshadowed evidence as particularized was inadmissible. Nor in my view would the evidence as it emerged have been inadmissible if particularized, being both probative of the state of mind of the complainant, and relevant to a fact in issue namely whether the complainant returned to the appellant’s house voluntarily. As is obvious, the actual content of the evidence given was hearsay, and provisions of the Evidence Act which permit hearsay to be probative of content were adverted to in the course of argument but it is not necessary to explore such concepts for the purpose of ruling upon the ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      
    17    The learned trial judge refused the application for discharge and gave reasons for her ruling. It was argued that the reasoning in her judgment was vulnerable to attack. The power of this Court to intervene is enlivened by error in decision. In my view her Honour’s decision is untainted by such.  
     
      
       
      
    18    It is to be noted that her Honour recorded that it was conceded that the evidence given by the complainant was relevant to her state of mind at the time of the second assault, and more particularly relevant to why she returned to the accused’s house on a second occasion. Reference was made to Regina v Preston unreported CCA 9 April 1997. The facts of that case bore similarity to the present circumstances in that there was a challenge there to the exercise of discretion by a trial judge admitting evidence by a complainant that she was scared because she heard that the appellant in that case had assaulted people and that he had once taken part in a shooting. As I have said, it was not argued in the present case that the evidence was not admissible; but in effect it was argued that the danger of unfair prejudice was such that, had the matter been adverted to prior to the emergence of the evidence, it must have been excluded when s137 was applied.  
     
      
       
      
    19    In my view her Honour was correct to regard Preston as providing relevant guidance. Further, her Honour determined that any unfairness to the appellant could be extinguished by direction limiting the use to which the jury might make of that evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    20    The evidence had emerged, and the argument upon it had occupied an afternoon, resuming the following morning. Upon return of the jury, her Honour forthwith adverted to the matter, and gave this direction: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Yesterday the complainant gave some evidence about rumours that she had heard concerning the accused. The direction of law I give you is this. That is not evidence about the accused’s behaviour and you may not take it into account in coming to any - in any way about the behaviour of the accused. You may, if you wish, take the complainant’s evidence about the rumours into account in coming to an assessment of her state of mind from time to time but I direct you that the evidence as she gave yesterday about rumours is nothing more than that and it is certainly not evidence about the accused’s behaviour”. 
         
        
       
      
    21    That direction was couched in such terms as to foreclose the possibility of the jury’s treating the evidence as proof of any fact, or as proof of some bad character on the part of the appellant. Given that direction, the reliance by counsel for the appellant upon the judgment of the Victorian Full Court in R v Knape 1960 5 VR 469 was misplaced. 
     
      
       
      
    22    As has been pointed out, the evidence was not in accordance with particulars supplied, and to that extent it might be described as inadvertent in the Crown case. I would adopt the approach of Sachs LJ speaking for the Court of Appeal in R v Weaver 1968 1 QB 353 where such a situation had arisen:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “It follows, as has been repeated time and again, that every case depends upon its own facts. It also, as has been said time and again, thus depends on the nature of what had been admitted into evidence, the circumstances in which it has been admitted and what, in the light of the circumstances of the case as a whole, is the correct course. It is very far from being the rule that in every case when something of this nature gets into evidence through inadvertence the jury must be discharged.” 
         
        
       
      
    23    There is no dispute that the evidence currently in focus was technically admissible; and the challenge is to discretionary exclusion against the background of s137 of the Evidence Act. In my view the course adopted by her Honour, to limit the use to which the evidence might be put, and to direct the jury in that regard firmly and immediately, was correct.  
     
      
       
      
    24    The next ground argued was expressed with notable lack of specificity, but as I understood it, the principal thrust of argument was focussed upon the initial absence of complaint and subsequent delay in making complaint, as being destructive of the complainant’s credibility. It was necessary for the trial judge to instruct the jury, in terms of s405B of the Crimes Act, that delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false; and that there may be good reason for a victim’s hesitating in making complaint. Her Honour did so. It was contended that “her Honour ought properly have instructed the jury that the delay in complaint may affect (adversely) the credit of the complainant”. There is ample authority that in an appropriate case fairness provokes a requirement for such a direction: Longman v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 79; Crofts v The Queen 1996 186 CLR 427; R v Gust 1999 NSW CCA 265.  
     
      
       
      
    25    Included in her Honour’s charge to the jury was the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It is for you to decide whether the fact that she complained to other people does or does not support her evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         It has been put to you on behalf of the accused that the delay in making the complaint is inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence because if it happened in the way she said she would have complained earlier …… 
         
        
        
         
         However, I also instruct you that delay in making a complaint does not necessarily mean that the allegation is false. There may be a good reason why a victim of sexual assault might hesitate in making a complaint about the assault. The question for you to consider is whether, in this case, the complaint and the circumstances in which it is made, is consistent with the evidence of the complainant or whether it throws doubt on the evidence of the complainant.” 
         
        
       
      
    26    No application was made by trial counsel for further elaboration of these directions; nor for any additional directions. The issue in this trial was not whether acts in private between two people were consensual, but whether the jury was satisfied to the requisite standard that sexual assault, or indeed any form of sexual contact had occurred at all. In the context of that stark issue, and in the absence of any perception by trial counsel that elaboration was required, I am unable to conclude that there was error in her Honour’s directions. 
     
      
       
      
    27    It was argued that the learned trial judge should have added her imprimatur to the potential for delay in complaint to erode credibility.  Imprimatur is a latin expression which translates as it may be published but the submission used it in the sense of adding the authority of the Court itself to the argument advanced at trial for the appellant. It was no part of her Honour’s duty to strengthen or weaken partisan contentions. I do not say that occasions may not arise where comment by a trial judge in respect of some particular submission is appropriate, and even necessary but this was not such a case. It is inconceivable that the jury did not appreciate the plain contradiction between the appellant and the complainant and her Honour’s directions appropriately pointed to the approach the jury should take in resolving that contradiction. Further it should not be overlooked that her Honour’s charge to the jury was delivered following upon addresses by counsel which, it is reasonable to assume, would have made emphatic reference to matters relied upon in support of, or in derogation from, credibility. A considerable bulk of the submissions on appeal, when analysed, amount to complaint that the summing up did not repeat in terms every argument maintainable on behalf of the defence. Her Honour was not required so to do; and the summing up, read as a whole, fairly summarized the competing cases, and fairly emphasized the obligation to apply the correct onus and standard of proof. 
     
      
       
      
    28    Neither of the grounds of appeal against conviction has been made out. 
     
      
       
      
    29    Application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence was made. Attention was drawn to psychological testing which indicated that the appellant was of low intellectual ability, being statistically placed in the bottom 1 percent of the population, and categorized as mildly mentally retarded.  
     
      
       
      
    30    Counsel for the appellant referred to R v Scognamiglio  1991 56 A Crim R 81 and R v Bus unreported CCA 3 November 1995. Those and other authorities indicate that persons suffering from mental disorder - her Honour described him as mildly intellectually disabled - are inappropriate vehicles for sentences manifesting general deterrence. However, allowing this to be a matter attracting moderation of sentence in the instant case, the evidence of the appellant and his responses to police at interview make it clear that he appreciated the gravity of the conduct alleged; and the finding of the jury is conclusive that he perpetrated the actions involved. As remarked by Hunt CJ at CL in Bus, in such circumstances moderation need not be great. 
     
      
       
      
    31    I have already described without detail the nature of the sexual assaults. As to the first count, the appellant forced penile intercourse; and as to the second count, forced the complainant to fellate him. She was a fourteen year old girl at the time of the offences. In my view the sentences imposed by her Honour are well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
     
      
       
      
    32    The sentences were cumulated with those on the additional indictment, but I see no error on the part of her Honour in terms of totality. The sentences for which the appellant received an effective custodial term of twelve months involved serious misconduct. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm related to an attack at a railway station upon a man who was struck on the head from the rear, and robbed of money whilst he lay unconscious from the blow.  
     
      
       
      
    33    The appellant is still a relatively young man, but it is to be noted that at the time of the sexual assault offences he was on parole, having been released after serving a minimum term of fifteen months for an offence of robbery in company. Further, the offences at the railway station to which I have just made reference were committed whilst the appellant was on bail.  
     
      
       
      
    34    I am unpersuaded that this Court should intervene to vary the sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    35    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       (a) The appeal against conviction be dismissed; 
        
        
       (b) The application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that appeal also dismissed.

     Regina v Margaret Geoghegan  
      
      
    Judgment1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Margaret Geoghegan, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her in the District Court after she pleaded guilty to an offence of armed robbery, asking the learned sentencing judge to take into account a further offence of demand money with menaces and a relatively minor offence, larceny. His Honour sentenced her to penal servitude for four years, comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The applicant is unrepresented. She has previously forwarded to the Registrar written arguments in support of her appeal. She explained that she had written those before she received a copy of the remarks on sentence of the learned sentencing judge and, having received those remarks, she was satisfied she could not pursue those matters. Instead, this morning she sensibly acknowledged that she had some difficulty mounting any argument against the sentence which was imposed. I say no more than that, on the face of it, a sentence of the order of four years for those offences, taking into account the applicant's background and record, does appear entirely appropriate and within the range one might except. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The applicant quite frankly told us that the principal purpose of pursuing her appeal was to attempt to obtain some reduction in her minimum term so that she might be free at the beginning of the year 2001 for the beginning of her children’s school year. The particular significance is that one of her children will start secondary school in that year. 
     
      
       
      
    4     As it happens, the view I have arrived at is that there ought to be some reduction of her main term although not, of course, for that reason. The reason is this: In the course of oral evidence before the learned sentencing judge, the applicant referred to the fact that she was “badly anaemic”. The context in which she said that is now important for our purposes. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Today she has tendered two reports of a medical practitioner which confirm that she does suffer from that condition, identified as quite severe anaemia. Fortunately that condition is treatable. The medical reports are not all that clear about the matter but it is of significance that the doctor considers that the effects of anaemia are “to make a person feel much more easily tired, stressed and unmotivated”. 
     
      
       
      
    6     We received those reports in evidence primarily with a view to considering them should the question of re-sentencing arise in the light of the other matters agitated in support of the appeal. However, not without some hesitation, I am of the view that they ought to be received as fresh evidence in the true sense. 
     
      
       
      
    7     My misgiving arises from the fact that there is before us no explanation as to why this matter was not before the sentencing judge. Nevertheless, as I said, the applicant is before us unrepresented and I feel some latitude should be allowed in this regard. 
     
      
       
      
    8     What the doctor has written about the effects of anaemia appears to me to indicate that that condition could well render her experience in prison more burdensome than it might otherwise have been. That, of course, is a well recognised reason for extending some measure of leniency. 
     
      
       
      
    9     It appears to me that that fact, together with the other subjective matters to which his Honour did have regard, warrant some adjustment of the minimum term. I do not believe a reduction of more than three months would be appropriate but that appears to me to be the appropriate course to take. 
     
      
       
      
    10     I am of the view that the sentence of four years should stand but should be re-adjusted in this way. The minimum term and additional term imposed by his Honour should be quashed and in lieu I would fix a minimum term of one year and nine months to commence on 26 March 1999 and to expire on 25 December 2000. I would fix an additional term of two years and three months to commence on 26 December 2000 and to expire on the 25 March 2003. 
     
      
       
      
    11     His Honour recommended that the applicant be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service throughout her parole period and that recommendation should stand. 
     
      
       
      
    12     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    13     HIDDEN J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by O'Reilly DCJ. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The appellant appeared before his Honour, committed for sentence following pleas of guilty to five counts of kidnapping and 21 counts of aggravated sexual assault. As well, his Honour was asked to take into account on a Form 1 a further ten offences of a variety of kinds. The principal charges involved five victims. The offences on the Form 1 involved two further victims, one of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and another of homosexual intercourse without consent with a victim aged fifteen years. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The learned sentencing judge imposed sentences as follows: Upon the kidnapping counts, Fixed concurrent terms of fourteen years penal servitude, and upon all of the aggravated sexual assault counts Fixed terms of fourteen years and three months with the exception of one count, number 25, upon which his Honour imposed a total sentence of nineteen years penal servitude, divided into a Minimum Term of fourteen years three months with an Additional Term of four years nine months. It follows that the effective order for custody was that the appellant would have a Fixed or Minimum term of fourteen years three months with an Additional Term of nine months as I have indicated. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It is appropriate in this appeal to make some preliminary observations. The first is that this application has been directed pursuant to s 6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act to be heard by a bench consisting of two judges. Such direction is given where the appeal is not likely to require the resolution of a disputed issue of general principle. In my view, although some matters have been raised, for the reasons to which I will come it is not necessary for this court to resolve any such issue. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The second preliminary observation I would make relates to the first argument advanced on behalf of the appellant which was couched in terms asserting that his Honour erred in ascertaining the facts upon which the appellant was to be sentenced. An examination of the transcript shows that what happened was that at the hearing before the learned primary judge there was tendered a document containing the facts alleged against the appellant in respect of the charges. That document was admitted without objection but there was some discussion about a dispute said to be raised about parts of it. His Honour adverted to this and had been handed a document which was entitled Proposed Agreed Facts, and as is obvious from an examination of that document, it appears that the appellant was wishing to challenge some facts in relation to two of the kidnapping charges, but the document itself did not challenge the criminal activity which was documented as having taken place in the appellant's home.  
      
       
      
     6     
     His Honour referred to this matter of dispute and asked the representative of the appellant whether or not anything really turned upon this matter. He was told by the appellant's legal representative that the matter had been raised particularly in the light of an anticipation that his Honour may have certain victim impact statements put before him. It appears that was not the case. From reading the exchange between counsel and the judge it was agreed that the minor variations sought to be made by the proposed agreed facts document were such that they were acknowledged to be of very little consequence at all.  
      
       
      
     7     
     Accordingly I am of the view that no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's drawing upon the document tendered without objection for the purpose of findings of fact and expressed in his remarks on sentence. Still less am I of the view that any error has been demonstrated by his Honour in the asserted failure to find facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced.  
      
       
      
     8     
     The facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced were set out in some detail in his Honour's remarks. It has to be observed that the conduct of the appellant was the subject of video recordings which he had caused to be made while these events were going on. The evidence showed that when first approached by the police the appellant feigned ignorance of the focus of police interest, however as a result of a search these videos were located and he confessed to facts pointing towards his guilt. It can be observed that the videos, once in police hands, provided, certainly in relation to the counts of aggravated sexual assault, most powerful and overwhelming evidence of the appellant's guilt.  
      
       
      
     9     
     I propose to relate again some of the facts upon which the charges brought against the appellant were based. I acknowledge the careful recitation of these by the primary judge in his remarks on sentence nevertheless, as the initial submission on behalf of the appellant involved a concession that the objective facts of the offences were serious, it is appropriate to repeat some of those facts in order to demonstrate just how serious they were. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The set of charges relating to the first victim were based upon these facts: 
      
       
      
     11     
     On Friday 28 March 1997, at about 10.30pm, a fifteen year old boy was walking home from a party and passed near the entrance to some sporting grounds. The appellant was standing near his motor car in the area. He went to some nearby bushes and watched the victim. He said something to him in order to attract his attention whereupon the appellant reached into his jacket pocket and produced what appeared to be a handgun. He pointed it at the victim and said, ""Shut up and come with me"". He covered the victim's eyes and made a movement with the gun pressed against the victim's stomach. He was forced into the car and then driven to the appellant's home. Some type of clothing was placed over the victim's head, removed and another jacket placed over his head. It should be borne in mind that these things were happening to a fifteen year old boy. Once inside the house the appellant led the victim to a room where he was tied to a bed and a pillow placed above his head. The victim's arms and legs were spreadeagled across the bed and he was given five or six tablets with an alcoholic drink to wash them down. The victim told the police he passed in and out of consciousness from this point of time. That was, to a limited extent, fortunate. 
      
       
      
     12     
     What happened after that involved sadism of the worst kind. The appellant struck the victim with a belt. He forced him to fellate him, lick his anus, he put his hand into the anus, he put a bottle into the same orifice. He had anal intercourse with the victim and inserted a baton into the victim's anus. At some stage the victim was then taken back to the motor car, driven away and then thrown out, where he was located unconscious by a passer-by. A video of the activity which I have sketched was found amongst the appellant's possessions with a label indicating that the video contained ""X-files 2, Emu Hunting"". 
      
       
      
     13     
     The second victim was a seventeen year old youth who at about 9.30pm on 21 April 1997 was walking home from a party. The appellant offered him a lift in his car and the victim made the error of accepting. A hand gun was produced and the victim was told to get on to the floor of the car or he would have his brains blown out. A jacket was placed over the victim's head and they proceeded to the appellant's house.  
      
       
      
     14     
     Again this victim was led to a bedroom where he was placed on a bed and had his eyes taped. This victim was forced to perform fellatio upon the appellant and after a period of time the appellant urinated into his mouth. The appellant then fellated the victim and he ejaculated into the victim's mouth. Later this victim was crying and the appellant spread his buttocks and placed his penis into the anus and performed anal intercourse. When the victim commenced to scream a baton was placed into the anus. The appellant whipped him with a leather belt. He inserted his hand into the anus. Later the appellant forced the victim to lick his own anus, following which the appellant placed his hand into the victim's anus. Later the appellant burnt the victim with a cigarette and forced the victim again to fellate him. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The victim said that he fell asleep, which would be equivalent in my view to loss of consciousness, and the next thing he remembered was that he woke up in a parkland. A video of all this activity was found amongst the appellant's belongings entitled ""X-files 3, Adam raped"". 
      
       
      
     16     
     The third victim was a 22 year old young man who was grabbed from behind whilst he was running in the early hours of Sunday morning, 12 May. When he was grabbed from behind and fell, he thought what was a gun was put to his head. That head was covered with some sort of clothing and he was forced into a vehicle where his eyes were taped and his hands were handcuffed behind his body. There followed a series of offences not dissimilar to those in relation to the first and second victims. It appears that this victim was a member of the Australian Army, and the video recording found amongst the appellant's belongings was entitled ""X-files, one Army boy"". 
      
       
      
     17     
     The fourth victim was an 18 year old youth who was waiting at a bus stop shortly before 11pm on 29 October 1997. The bus stop was in the suburb of Claymore. Again the appellant adopted what I might describe as his routine modus operandi. The appellant produced a handgun forcing the victim into a vehicle and took him to his home where a series of actions took place, again not dissimilar to those which I have related concerning the first and second victims. This video tape evidencing the criminal conduct of the appellant was entitled ""Clay shooting, 18 points"". As I indicated, the victim had been standing at a bus stop in the suburb of Claymore. 
      
       
      
     18     
     Next I turn to the fifth victim. Again this was a boy aged 15 years who, in the early hours of Sunday morning 2 November 1997, was walking home from a party. The victim approached the appellant's vehicle which had stopped nearby. He saw the pistol and fearing for his safety got into the car. His head was covered and again he was taken to the appellant's premises. He was there given a number of tablets to swallow and placed in a bedroom. Again a number of sadistic sexual actions took place which it is not necessary to elaborate. This 15 year old boy was also burnt as a result of a cigarette being put out upon his shoulder, and the appellant made him swallow the cigarette butt. In this case the appellant directed the victim ""to lick him all the way from top to bottom, all the way to the toes"". 
      
       
      
     19     
     It might also be observed that during the course of his offences against this victim the appellant threatened to circumcise the victim with a pair of scissors. At some stage after the offences which I have mentioned, and many others took place, the victim was located semi-conscious in the Macquarie Fields area. Having been found he was taken to hospital. A video of the appellant's crimes was later found entitled ""Two all Beef Patties on a M'fields bun"". 
      
       
      
     20     
     It is against the background of those facts that a number of submissions have been made to this court. I have already made reference to the asserted error by the primary judge in ascertaining the facts upon which the appellant was to be sentenced. It should be observed that even if one were to hypothesise that his Honour should have given some weight to the two implied differences relating to the issue of the offences of kidnapping, they would, on any assessment, pale into insignificance in the light of the overall criminality in the appellant's conduct. 
      
       
      
     21     
     The second argument advanced on behalf of the appellant asserted that his Honour erred in the determination of the maximum sentence for the offence, and as a subsidiary matter, it was argued that there had been some duplication in his Honour's application of his findings in relation to injury. For this purpose it suffices to look at s 90A of the Crimes Act. S 90A provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Whosoever leads takes or entices away or detains a person with intent to hold him or her for ransom or for any other advantage to any person shall be liable to penal servitude for twenty years or, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge that the person so led taken enticed away or detained was thereafter liberated without having sustained any substantial injury, to penal servitude for fourteen years."" 
         
        
       
      
      
     22     
     It was argued that the maximum penalty for the offence was fourteen years escalating in the event that injury was caused. It is plain that the statute is not so structured, and indeed the structure of that particular provision has been the subject of comment in this court in  
     R v Row 
     , 89 A Crim R at 467, where the former Chief Judge at Common Law, Hunt J said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The intention of s 90A is clear. It is to offer an inducement to the kidnapper to refrain from killing the victim in order to destroy the evidence, or from inflicting substantial injury upon the victim, by offering a lower maximum sentence where no such injury has occurred. The form in which the section is expressed clearly places the onus upon the accused to satisfy the judge that the victim was liberated without having sustained such injury; it does not require the Crown to eliminate any reasonable possibility that such injury was sustained. It is not a matter of aggravation but of mitigation."" 
         
        
       
      
      
     23     
     Insofar as the learned primary judge found there was injury to the victims in this case, it was argued that the evidence of injury had been used for two purposes, one in relation to the specification of the maximum penalty under s 90A, and the second as a factor in proof of the element of aggravation in the counts of aggravated sexual assault. That submission in my view mis-states and mis-apprehends the purpose of the section. The absence of injury is a matter which is available for proof by the accused person in order to reduce the maximum penalty otherwise applicable. But there is no duplication where there is injury in fact if that matter of injury which is proved is used in order to demonstrate a circumstance of aggravation in order to elevate the sexual assault into the more serious category. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The next matter argued was that it was alleged that his Honour erred in not giving any, or giving insufficient weight to the plea of guilty of the applicant. It is plain that once the investigating police were in possession of the videos they had a case against the appellant which it is difficult to imagine could be contradicted in any significant manner. It is true that the videos did not provide evidence of the kidnappings themselves but it is almost fanciful to imagine that given the circumstances of what occurred to each of the victims there can be any realistic suggestion that their version of arrival at the appellant’s premises would be rejected.  
      
       
      
     25     
     In any event, as has been pointed out, the appellant was appearing before his Honour on some 26 counts to all of which he had pleaded guilty. It was a matter for his Honour to determine how much weight he would give to such pleas, given particularly the virtually incontrovertible evidence provided by the videos. It is not surprising that his Honour felt that the plea of guilty as such was not a matter in the circumstances of great weight. 
      
       
      
     26     
     It is argued that his Honour fell into error in failing to comply with the requirements of s 439(2) of the Crimes Act which requires: 
      
       
        
         
         ""A court which does not, as a result of this section, reduce the sentence that it passes on a person who pleaded guilty to an offence, must state that fact and its reasons for not reducing the sentence when passing sentence."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     27     
     His Honour said that the matter was not of great weight. It was contended that it was not possible precisely to determine whether by his remarks his Honour was giving the appellant some weight or none at all. The ordinary use of language suggests the former. However, if it be postulated that there was error in failing to express his reasons beyond what he said, for reasons to which I will come it is not a matter of consequence for the disposal of this appeal. 
      
       
      
     28     
     The next proposition argued was that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the circumstances that the appellant will, as is likely, serve his sentence in protective custody. His Honour was not unaware of that likelihood and made explicit reference to it in his remarks on sentence. I can reach no other conclusion than that his Honour's reference to it means that he had it well in mind in his assessment of the appropriate sentence for the appellant and I would not sustain that argument. 
      
       
      
     29     
     The next proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant was that his Honour erred in not taking into account on the matter of sentence the consent of the applicant to the forfeiture of his house. It would appear that pursuant to the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act the appropriate authority had made application for forfeiture of the house. In terms of the statute it was manifestly clear that in every case of the counts that I have mentioned it was the very location used in the commission of the crimes. It is true that it is apparent that the appellant consented to the making of an order, but it is well nigh impossible to conceptualize any sustainable basis upon which he could resist. Nevertheless it was argued that it was a matter which his Honour could have taken into account in a slightly oblique fashion in the sense of confirming some contrition on the part of the appellant adding to the contrition which might be inferred from the plea of guilty which, amongst other things, has been pointed out by counsel for the appellant relieved the victims of the undoubtedly onerous prospect of having to give evidence and relive their experiences as they related them. 
      
       
      
     30     
     There was some exchange between the bench and counsel about whether the forfeiture of the house could be described as penal in nature or whether as the Crown contended in its written submissions, the matter is a separate issue entirely to the sentence which is imposed by the court. Apart from its availability as some evidence of contrition, I would favour the Crown's submission but it is not necessary in this appeal for that argument to be resolved. As I have indicated the approach to the disposal of this appeal is a matter to which I will finally turn. 
      
       
      
     31     
     Next, it was said that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the fact that the appellant himself had been sexually assaulted as a young person. There was some material before his Honour which included a relation of history by the appellant of his own background. There was psychiatric opinion from Dr Lucas about the appellant. Nevertheless in my view no error was demonstrated in his Honour not finding that there was some relationship between the assault claimed to have occurred against the appellant himself and the commission of these offences. The authorities are clear that in an appropriate case such might be given some weight, but as I have said, I do not perceive any error by his Honour on the evidence before me in this case. 
      
       
      
     32     
     It was argued that his Honour ought to have found special circumstances pursuant to s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act and by implication so divided the minimum and additional term components of sentence so as to enable the appellant to be potentially on parole for a longer portion of the overall sentence. In my view there is simply no error manifest in his Honour's finding that there were no special circumstances so as to provoke such an order.  
      
       
      
     33     
     It was penultimately said that his Honour erred in not taking into account the rehabilitation of the appellant. Rehabilitation is always a factor to be looked at when one comes to the question of sentence. Nevertheless his Honour had before him the material concerning the appellant, the material manifesting not only the objective seriousness of the offences, but the background of the prisoner who stood before him to be sentenced. I am unable to perceive that his Honour made any error in balancing the respective factors that he was required to take into account.  
      
       
      
     34     
     Finally, it was said that the sentence itself was manifestly excessive. This brings me to the basis upon which I am of the opinion that this appeal can be dealt with. It should not be overlooked that the jurisdiction of this court is in statutory terms. When dealing with a matter concerning sentence, the court's jurisdiction is enlivened if it is of the opinion some other sentence, whether more of less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed. In my view the sentences imposed in the District Court were entirely appropriate to the overall circumstances of the crime and the offender.  
      
       
      
     35     
     I am not persuaded any other sentence should have been imposed and I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     36     
     GREG JAMES J: I agree with what has been said by his Honour the presiding judge in his reasons and with the result proposed for this appeal. For myself I would merely add that these crimes were in totality appalling. Many might think that the sentence passed by the learned trial judge was lenient, and indeed very lenient. I see no basis upon which the challenge made here could have succeeded. 
      
       
      
     37     
     GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v Khaled ELOMAR 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Khaled Elomar seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Nield at the Parramatta District Court on 1 October 1999. On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to one count under sections 25 (1) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, of supply a prohibited drug (Cannabis). That offence, dealt with in the District Court, carries a maximum penalty for imprisonment of 10 years and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units. His Honour also took into account on a Form 1, two offences of possessing a prohibited drug, viz heroin; one offence of goods in custody, viz a television set; and three offences of unlawfully possessing a prescribed restricted substance. 
    2   His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of nine months imprisonment to commence on 1 October 1999 and to expire on 30 June 2000 with an additional term of one year nine months to commence on 1 July 2000 and to expire 30 September 2001. 
    3   Acting on information received, police executed a search warrant on 11 May 1999 at the applicant’s premises. A search of the home located a plastic bag containing a block of cannabis and 26 small resealable plastic bags, each containing a quantity of cannabis. A further search the located items which gave rise to the six matters on the Form 1. 
    4   The applicant, despite his relative youth, has a criminal record which constitutes 23 prior offences, some of which have been serious. At least four of them involved robbery, either alone, or in company, or armed. Other offences involved acts of dishonesty and/or violence. The applicant’s penultimate sentence was imposed on 19 June 1998 by a District Court judge at Liverpool for breaking and entering a building intending to steal. The applicant was, with regard to that offence, sentenced to penal servitude for a total term of 2 years and 6 months, of which the minimum term was 6 months commencing on 19 June 1998 with an additional term of 2 years commencing on 19 December 1998. The applicant was in fact admitted to parole on 19 December 1998 and the subject offence was committed on 11 May 1999, which was less than six months after the applicant was admitted to parole. Judge Nield noted that the commission of the subject offence whilst on parole was an aggravating feature. It indicates, his Honour commented, that the applicant was not prepared to change his criminal ways or his drug use ways. 
    5   It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive having regard to the fact that the offence could have been dealt with summarily, had the prosecution not elected otherwise; the relatively small amount of cannabis involved; the plea of guilty; the recent attempts by the applicant to rehabilitate himself. 
    6   The effect of section 33 C(1) of Pt 9A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is that the matter could indeed have been dealt with summarily by a Local Court unless the prosecuting authority or the applicant had not elected to have the offence dealt with on indictment. The prosecuting authority did in fact elect to have it dealt with on indictment. The amount of drug involved, 359.3 grams, was slightly more than the traffickable quantity(300 grams) but less than the indictable quantity (1000 grams). 
    7   I have already referred to the maximum penalty for the subject offence when dealt with on indictment. The penalty for such an offence, where the amount of the drug is not more than the indictable quantity, if dealt with summarily, is a fine of 100 penalty units and/or imprisonment for two years. 
    8   This Court has acknowledged that the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing Judge. The cases were recently referred to in Regina v Crombie. (1999) NSWCCA 297 para 15. However, as this Court pointed out in Crombie, none of those decisions goes so far as to require the sentencing judge in the District Court to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that it is a circumstance to be taken into account by the judge in the exercise of his or her discretion. Depending upon the objective and subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence which would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Moreover, where it appears that such a factor has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may justify the granting of leave to appeal. 
    9   The degree of relevance, however, of the maximum penalty which the offence would have attracted in the Local Court depends, of course, upon the circumstances. 
    10   In the instant case, the submissions of the legal representatives before the sentencing Judge have not been transcribed. It is not possible for this Court, therefore, to determine whether or not reference was made by the legal representatives to the maximum penalty in the Local Court, and if so, the extent of the reliance (if any) which the applicant’s legal representative may have sought to place upon such a circumstance. His Honour did not in his recorded remarks on sentence specifically refer to the maximum penalty in the Local Court. I must say I find it difficult to conclude that such an experienced sentencing Judge would have overlooked the matter, whether it was raised by those appearing before him or not. However, be that as it may, there is no reference in the remarks on sentence to this particular circumstance. 
    11   I would add that bearing in mind the antecedent criminal history of the applicant, together with the fact he was on parole at the time of the offence, I am persuaded that it was perfectly proper for the Crown to elect to proceed against the applicant in the District Court. However, taking into account that the applicant is entitled to seek to rely upon the fact that his Honour made no reference to the Local Court maximum, and the fact that a relatively small amount of the drug in question was located at the applicant's residence together with the fact that the applicant frankly admitted before the sentencing Judge, (contrary to what he had said to the interviewing police), that he proposed to sell some of the cannabis, a case had been made out for the intervention of this Court. 
    12   Bearing in mind the prior criminal record of the applicant, the fact that he was on parole at the relevant time and, balancing the objective and subjective circumstances, I am not persuaded that this Court should interfere with the minimum term of 9 months. I am persuaded however, not without some hesitation, that this Court should reduce the overall sentence as reflected in the additional term. I would propose, therefore, that the minimum term of 9 months imprisonment commencing on 1 October 1999 and expiring 30 June 2000 be confirmed and the additional term be varied so that in lieu of one year and nine months, the applicant be sentenced to an additional term of one year three months imprisonment to commence 1 July 2000 and to expire 30 September 2001. 
    13   Leave to appeal should therefore be granted and the appeal upheld to the extent which I have indicated. 
    14   HIDDEN J: I agree an overall sentence of two years in the present case is justified. Notwithstanding the relatively small amount of the drug involved, in the light of the applicant’s criminal history and the fact he was on parole at the time of the offence, the orders of the Court will be those by Carruthers J.

      GREG JAMES, J. 
      
       
     MONDAY 21 FEBRUARY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. JAMES PHILLIP PRIEST 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GROVE, J: I will now ask Greg James, J. to deliver the judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence of four years penal servitude comprising a minimum term of two years, six months, and an additional term of one year, six months imposed upon him in the District Court sitting at Taree by his Honour Judge Howie, QC. for the crime of maliciously damaging property by fire. 
    3   In a careful and detailed judgment his Honour reviewed the facts of the applicant's crime and noted his initial plea of guilty before the magistrate under the provisions of s.51A of the Justices Act 1902, a plea to which he adhered before his Honour. It is not necessary to set out in detail those facts. 
    4   In summary, the applicant had been residing with a young woman who had separated from her husband and lived with her four children in Taree. It had been a relationship of some considerable duration. The applicant had been contributing to the family expenses of the young woman and her children. She had been renting a home from the Housing Commission and the relationship had generally been a good one. However, on 10 December 1998, whilst they were at the home of a friend, the two became intoxicated and fell out. During the hot words that accompanied the altercation, the young woman left the premises, leaving the children and the applicant behind. She became quite emotional. He became quite distraught because of her absence. He took the children home and at that time, several hours having passed, he had become very angry and was well under the influence of alcohol. 
    5   His Honour found that during the conversations he had with her he, at least, was of the view that she had told him that she would prostitute herself throughout Taree in order to earn money to pay the bills. He told a neighbour that he intended to burn her house down. He went to the premises and ensured they were not occupied. He told another neighbour to move a truck so that it would not be damaged. He handed to the first neighbour the young woman's two cats so they might be removed from danger. He asserted to her that the young woman had been ""out slutting around"". He was muttering things which the neighbour could not entirely understand but heard him say a number of times, ""I am going to burn the house, my boys are safe, I am going to burn the house"". She raised with him the prospects of danger to her own house. When she decided that her efforts to dissuade him could not be successful, she left the premises to call the police. After she left he set fire to the house and walked next door, sat on the verandah of the neighbouring home and conversed with the neighbour's husband, confirming to him also that he had intended to set fire to the house. After watching the premises for a few minutes, he started to leave, saying that the fire must not have taken but when he could see smoke was coming from the premises, he said, ""Let it burn, let it burn, don't worry about it"". 
    6   The Fire Brigade was alerted to the fact that the fire was under way but the home of the young woman was completely gutted and almost all the property inside was lost, including the uninsured personal effects of the young woman and her children. The accused, as a result of his own actions, lost valuable property of his own, in particular, his tools which also were uninsured. 
    7   No-one was injured. In part that was due to his warnings to the neighbours and his removal of the children. In part it was due to sheer luck. 
    8   He went, after the fire, to the home of a friend and confessed. He asserted that he had taken the course of burning down the home rather than physically assault the young woman. He was, however, highly emotional and believed by his friends to be suicidal. He did indicate he wished to go to the police the following day and give himself up, but he was arrested by the police, having returned to the scene of his crime. To the police he described the crime as ""one hell of a domestic"". He apparently prided himself on not having assaulted the young woman saying, ""Yeah, I don't hit women but when the slut fucks around on me I burn everything I earn"". The latter part of that sentence is apparently a reference to some belief on his part that as he had contributed economically to the family's circumstances, he had somehow acquired some right in the disposition of the family's home and property. 
    9   He made a record of interview in which he referred to the argument and he asserted provocation by the young woman arising from her alleged statement and asserted that when she said she would prostitute herself he ""went ballistic"". He referred to his actions of making sure that the children and domestic animals were safe and other people were not going to have their property damaged and his then setting fire to the house. Initially he said he wished to have it destroyed, subsequently, that what he did was intended merely to produce some smoke. He told the police that once before he had threatened to do such a thing in response to an earlier assertion by the young woman that she would prostitute herself to pay bills but later he denied that threat. The young woman said in her statement that he had previously made such a threat. 
    10   He said that he regretted what he had done but was glad he had done it and would do it again if the young woman were unfaithful to him. She has denied she ever said that she would prostitute herself but said that he became jealous from time to time and accused her of doing so. 
    11   The trial judge found for the purposes of sentencing that the applicant believed that she had prostituted herself or was about to do so and was emotionally distraught and outraged at her contemplating such a course. In addition he found there was also an additional element in the applicant's motivation, that he was also aggrieved, because he considered that he had been doing the best he could to provide for her and her children and she had, as it were, disparaged his performance of that role. 
    12   It was urged upon us in submissions here that his Honour fell into material error, that it was not open to reach such latter finding and that in doing so he had reached a finding adverse to the applicant. I would reject such a submission. In my view there was clear evidence sufficient to support the finding in the various statements made by the applicant to police and to others, and in the light of that evidence the finding that his motivation included a reaction to that infidelity in the context of providing economic substance to the family was not only open to the trial judge but inevitable. 
    13   One cannot quarrel with his Honour's view that what the applicant did was a cruel act intended to punish the young woman for what he considered to be her infidelity to him and the disparagement to which I have referred. What the applicant sought to do was to punish her in such a way as to avoiding physically inflicting damage upon her person but to damage the things that to her were essential as providing a home for herself and her children. The applicant's reasons for his crime show he sought to exercise sexual and economic dominion over the young woman and reacted adversely to a challenge to that dominion. 
    14   His Honour pointed out that insofar as the prisoner regarded the house his own, it was not his own in any sense of the word, and what he did was a matter of grave criminality. His Honour referred to the aggravation of the offence in that the prisoner knew that the personal effects were not insured, and knew of the financial effects his conduct would have upon his victims. He found, properly, no mitigation in the prisoner's destruction of his own property. There was no error either in his Honour's findings or reasoning. 
    15   His Honour did have regard to the prisoner's intoxication as affecting his judgment. He had regard to the psychiatric material tendered. There was no suggestion of lack of mental responsibility. There was irrationality but that irrationality seemed to be solely due to the applicant's emotional state and alcohol. His Honour found those matters and treated them in the applicant's favour. 
    16   Further, it was put that there was insufficient weight given to the plea of guilty, insufficient weight to the applicant's remorse and contrition, and insufficient weight given to his Honour's view that it was unlikely a similar offence would be committed by this applicant again. It is sufficient answer to all of those submissions that all of those matters were expressly dealt with by his Honour in his judgment and to some degree the applicant given the benefit of them. Matters of weight are peculiarly a matter for the trial judge. It is only if he descends into error on fact-finding either as to law or as to a basic finding of fact that, in general, this court will intervene. 
    17   Having regard to the matters of motivation, the submission was put to us that, overall, the sentence was excessive, even considering the objective seriousness of what was done. One should remark expressly that his Honour did give the applicant the benefit insofar as any benefit was called for, of a finding that he had committed the offence under what he believed to be severe provocation. 
    18   Despite the very detailed and extensive written submissions provided by counsel for the applicant and having regard to the careful and detailed reasoning of the trial judge, I am not persuaded that there is any error of principle or any error in the result in this sentence. 
    19   I would consider that the appropriate course this court should take is to grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
    20   GROVE, J: I agree and the orders of the court will be as proposed by Greg James, J.

     HIDDEN J CARRUTHERS AJ Monday 21 February 2000 
     
     Regina v Daniel Patrick Spiller 
      
      
    Reasons for judgment1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Daniel Patrick Spiller, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Gibson in respect of three counts of aggravated indecent assault under s61M(2) of the Crimes Act, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, and one count under subs 61M(1) of the Act, carrying a maximum of seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      
    2     His Honour sentenced the applicant in respect of the second count, that is one of the counts under subs (2) to imprisonment of four years, comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of two years. On the other count under that section, his Honour imposed concurrent sentences of fixed terms of 18 months, and on the count under subs (1) his Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months, also to be served concurrently. Effectively, the sentence to be served is a minimum term of two years with an additional term of two years. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The three more serious counts related to offences committed against a girl over a period when she was aged between about six and nine years. There was evidence that the three counts were not isolated incidents but were part of a pattern of indecent behaviour over roughly a three year period. The less serious count relates to indecent conduct with a girl aged twelve and relates to one incident only. 
     
      
       
      
    4     The applicant had been living in a defacto relationship with the mother of the two girls. He is now thirty years old. He does have a criminal record but not for offences of this kind. When the offences came to light, he himself went to the police and made a full confession of his behaviour. 
     
      
       
      
    5     He was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 1990, sustaining an injury which led to some brain damage. His Honour had regard to that matter, although there was a psychiatric report of Dr Bruce Westmore which did not see that brain damage as contributing in any significant way to his behaviour. On the other hand, Dr Westmore saw the offences as arising in the context of the relationship and concluded that the applicant did not meet the diagnostic criteria for paedophilia. He did not see him as a substantial risk to children in the community in that he was not to that extent a predator of children. 
     
      
       
      
    6     He had in the past been a heavy drinker and a user of heroin. It seems his drinking moderated after his accident and he gave up marijuana after his arrest for these offences. In the light of that background, his Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    7     Mr Dalton, who appeared for the applicant today, submitted that the effective sentence is manifestly excessive. He argued that the error may well have arisen from his Honour's assumption that a custodial sentence was necessarily called for for offences of this kind, leading his Honour to assess the appropriate sentence from a starting point that was too high. It certainly is the case that offences of indecency with children where no penetration is involved do not necessarily carry a full-time custodial sentence: see R v Baxter (CCA, unreported, 26 May 1994). 
     
      
       
      
    8     However, in my view a fair reading of his Honour's remarks does not disclose an assumption on his Honour's part that there had to be a sentence of full-time custody in matters of this kind, regardless of the facts and circumstances involved. What his Honour said was this: 
     
      
       
        
         
         His conduct in relation to these two young girls was appalling. They were his stepdaughters. They were entitled to look to him for love and protection against this very type of action from other men and the very person to whom they are entitled to look towards to protect them is the person that has taken advantage of them in their most vulnerable years. And in relation to the younger of the two girls, this extends over a considerable period in excess of two years and in my view there is only one thing that can be done in relation to a person that breaches his trust in that way and that is to put him in custody. 
         
        
       
      
    9     It appears to me that his Honour was doing no more than concluding that a custodial sentence was called for in the particular circumstances of this case, and that that conclusion was not affected by any misplaced assumption about how sentencing for matters of this kind should be approached. 
     
      
       
      
    10     Baxter itself was a Crown appeal in which the Court refused to interfere with recognizance for offences of committing acts of indecency upon a young child. The offences for which Baxter was sentenced were under a section of the Crimes Act, since repealed, which carried a maximum sentence of four years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      
    11     We were also referred to R v Turner (No 2) (CCA, unreported, 28 July 1995) where, upon a Crown appeal, periodic detention was substituted for an order to perform community service. That was a case in which discretionary considerations loomed large but, again, the offences for which Mr Turner was dealt with were under another section of the Crimes Act for which the maximum sentence was five years imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      
    12     We were also referred to R v Barrett (CCA, unreported, 26 July 1995) where a sentence was reduced for offences of this kind. However, the influential factor in relation to the Court's intervention there was the state of health of the applicant, a matter as to which fresh evidence was led in the course of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    13     None of these cases, it seems to me, provides any useful guide to the appropriate sentence in the present case. As I have said, the legislature has recognised the seriousness with which the community views those offences by providing for significantly greater maximum sentences than used to be the case: in the case of the younger girl, as she was under ten, a maximum of ten years and in the case of the older girl, a maximum of seven years. 
     
      
       
      
    14     In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in his approach to his sentencing task or in the effective sentence at which he arrived. The matter was clearly worthy of argument and I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    15     CARRUTHERS: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    16     HIDDEN: Leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     MONDAY 21 FEBRUARY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. MAURICE JOSEPH AZAR 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GROVE, J: The Court is in a position to give judgment. I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: Application for leave to appeal against sentence is brought in respect of sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Job QC. in the District Court at Newcastle on 24 June 1998. His Honour imposed sentences in respect of three counts on an indictment, two of them being counts of break and enter, each punishable by a maximum sentence of 14 years penal servitude, and one count of receiving under s.188 of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years penal servitude. In addition there were some 16 matters taken into account on a Form 1. These comprised offences of breaking and entering and larceny, but mainly of offences of the receiving of stolen goods. The offences included two offences of supply prohibited drugs, that is obtaining stolen goods in exchange for cannabis. There were also offences of possessing housebreaking implements and entering land with intent to steal and possessing stolen goods. 
    3   In respect of those offences his Honour imposed on the receiving count in the indictment a period of four years penal servitude by way of fixed term dating from 7 July 1997 on which date the applicant entered into custody for these offences, and on the first offence of break, enter and steal, taking into account the matters contained in the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of eight years penal servitude to commence at the expiration of the fixed term for the receiving offence, ie., 6 July 2009. For the second offence of break, enter and steal his Honour appears to have imposed a similar sentence, the effect being that the total sentences involved a sentence of some nine years minimum term and an additional term of three years, that total sentence commencing on 7 July 1997.  
    4   The sentences were imposed upon the applicant in the light of his extensive prior record. His Honour, when dealing with that matter, referred to the frank evidence of the applicant before him, that he was by occupation a thief. He has had little or no other work throughout his life. His prior criminal record commences with offences of dishonesty when he was a child in 1972. It has extended through many many offences since. Most recently, as his Honour observed, he had prior to this offence been sentenced in the District Court at Parramatta on 21 May 1991 for numerous offences of dishonesty, to a term of penal servitude, presumably for 10 years to date from 10 July 1990 with a minimum term of five years. He had had previous substantial sentences of imprisonment for dishonesty offences. 
    5   He had, his Honour noted, committed offences whilst on parole and in particular the prisoner was on parole when he had committed certain of the offences here alleged. His Honour noted that the prisoner has had a problem with drugs, that he became addicted to drugs whilst in prison and on release was on methadone and that the evidence showed that whilst he was before the court to be dealt with by his Honour, he was still on methadone. It was in that context, including the leniency which his Honour found that had been extended to the prisoner in the past, that his Honour considered the principles referred to the passage in the judgment of the High Court in Veen v. The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, which he quoted in his remarks on sentence, in particular, drawing the distinction between an ""uncharacteristic aberration, or the manifestation of a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law"". That passage refers to the previous history of a prisoner coming forward for sentence as available to ""illuminate the moral culpability of the offender ... or to show a dangerous propensity or a need to impose condign punishment"". His Honour expressed the view that the passage was particularly apt in this case. 
    6   Although his Honour did not expressly say so it seems as though his Honour was of the view that the prior circumstances of this applicant called for a more severe penalty in the light of his prior record, as reflecting on his moral culpability and as showing a dangerous propensity. His Honour went on to observe that although the prisoner did ""appear to have quite an engaging personality, his real problem was he just cannot keep his hands off other people's property"". 
    7   The prisoner's parole had been revoked as a consequence of his arrest for this offence and the situation, as far as his prior sentence is concerned, is that he is not due for release until 27 November 2000. Thus the sentence that was passed to commence on 7 July 1997, is to that extent concurrent with the sentence that the prisoner was to serve for his prior offences. 
    8   In evidence before his Honour, as well as the detail of the circumstances of the commission of these various offences, which, since they are set out in his Honour's remarks on sentence, are matters to which I need not turn in detail, was evidence that the prisoner had now a family involving a daughter and a son for whom he was greatly concerned and a wife who was supportive of him. He expressed to his Honour on sentencing his concern for the effect of his sentence on his family and his relationships with them. 
    9   There was evidence before his Honour that he had come to commit the offences by reason of having, during a period of heroin addiction, fallen into debt to a drug dealer who had supplied him with heroin whilst he was in gaol. The prisoner had given evidence that that dealer, who is now dead, required him to meet a debt of some $17,000. 
    10   His Honour referred to the evidence that the dealer pursued him, threatened him, even at one stage making him dig a grave and stand in it as a means of seeking to compel him to pay that debt. 
    11   Before his Honour the prisoner expressed the view that he wished to remain out of gaol and would prefer to sleep in the gutter rather than remain in gaol. His Honour noted the current support of the applicant's family. However, his Honour did conclude, in my view, that it was necessary to impose a severe sentence in order to guard against what his Honour saw as the danger to the community arising from the prisoner's recidivism. 
    12   Application was made to us to receive in evidence the affidavits of Heather Anderson sworn 18 February 2000, and of the applicant, affirmed 20 February 2000, which provided additional material to that which was before his Honour. The affidavit of Heather Anderson annexes the discharge summary and clinical notes in respect of two of the applicant's stays in B Ward at Long Bay Hospital, and two reports of Associate Professor Andrew Lloyd concerning the applicant's current medical condition. Those reports disclose, as was summarised in the helpful written submissions provided to us by the applicant's counsel, that the applicant is Hepatitis C positive and has developed an arthritis condition and that those conditions have become active and chronic, that the disease has now occasioned ""quite disabling musculoskeletal pain and ongoing joint inflammation"" and that there is a high probability that the symptoms will continue into the foreseeable future resulting in the applicant now being, and for the future being ""functionally disabled by the combination of pain, swelling and limited range of movement of the affected joints"". 
    13   The affidavit of the applicant discloses that although he had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C since 1993 and there was some reference to his medical condition before his Honour at the time of sentencing, nonetheless subsequent to sentence, but in consequence of the matters brought forward at that time, his latent conditions have now progressed towards a dramatic impediment of mobility. The applicant says that he becomes overly tired, has swollen legs with pain in the joints and as a result is suffering from such immobility that he has not returned to the main section of the gaol is experiencing difficulty with visits from his family spends a lot of time bedridden and due to his immobility and vulnerability in gaol, will spend the balance of his sentence either in the hospital section or the section for the aged and infirm. He is presently detained in the aged and frail special ward unit. His condition was patent on his presentation before us on the appeal. The Crown did not seek to challenge any of this material. 
    14   Although it was not before his Honour, nonetheless it appears to me that this court should have regard to the material as it falls within the principles that have been enunciated in this court on a number of occasions, and most notably in Regina v. Bailey (1988) 35 ACR 458 at 462. It is clear that the prisoner will, as a result of the unforeseen extent of matters the existence of which, but not the extent of which, were known preceding sentence, find the circumstances of his confinement significantly more burdensome than the ordinary inmate, and his Honour was, with respect to that matter, led into error by the material before him as failing to draw attention to this matters. The applicant will be suffering under disabilities in this confinement a good deal more than was expected by the trial judge when he came to impose sentence. 
    15   When the newly appreciated medical condition of the applicant involving, as it does, a physical incapacity such as to severely limit his physical abilities to commit most crimes, is considered in conjunction with his having brought his drug addiction under control so that it is not a factor adversely affecting the prospects of the applicant's recidivism, and the psychiatric evidence, that was before the trial judge, but to which he does not appear to have adverted in any great detail or to which he has not given great weight, that the applicant, now is eager to entertain the idea of counselling or psychotherapy, notwithstanding that it could be long and distressing, it seems to me that a real basis has been provided to intervene. 
    16   It was urged that the court should have regard to the motivation for the applicant's offence as somehow mitigating the culpability for the crime. True it is that the applicant did not go out to commit a crime to feed an addiction directly but the participation in the life style of the addict could be expected eventually to lead inevitably to such a relationship with those also involved in that life as to expose the applicant to the likelihood of committing crime for the purposes of paying for drugs, whether they be his drugs or the drugs of others. One can have regard to the vulnerability of the applicant arising from the addiction and one might extend compassion in those circumstances but such motivation as is here alleged does not, it appears to me, really differ in kind from that of the addict committing the crime to feed the addiction. For my part I would prefer to look at that factor as playing its part in the total complex of matters to be considered in this applicant's special case. In the event that this court comes to the view that by reason of the admission of the additional material that and the other factors to which counsel has directed us, might be reflected in the outcome on re-sentencing. 
    17   I have, for the reasons that I have given, come to the conclusion that the court should intervene and re-sentence. In that regard our attention was drawn to matters that were said to show special circumstances. Plainly in this applicant's case there are things that when properly considered, do point to the applicant requiring particular support and assistance but it does not seem to me in the context of the sentence that in my view would be appropriate to replace that passed by the trial judge, they are such that there need be in additional lengthening of the additional term. 
    18   The structure of the sentences as passed was such as to permit this court when intervening to do so particularly in respect of the sentence for receiving. The sentences imposed on the break and enter offences were longer than had been previously passed upon the applicant for the similar previous offence by Viney, DCJ. I would not consider it appropriate to reduce any sentence passed upon him for those offences in this context below that imposed upon him by Viney, DCJ. However, in my view the overall sentence does require reduction. To achieve that goal, I would propose a sentence on the count of receiving of a fixed term of two years penal servitude to date from 7 July 1997 and in respect of the break and enter counts, I propose concurrent sentences each of a minimum term of five years to commence at the expiration of the fixed term and an additional term of three years to commence on 7 July 2004 and to expire on 6 July 2007. 
    19   The formal orders I propose are:- 
     
      
       
       (a) leave to appeal granted; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) appeal upheld; 
       
      
      
       
       (c) quash the sentences passed in the District Court; 
       
      
      
       
       (d) in lieu thereof, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years on the receiving count. Such term to commence 7 July 1997 and to expire 6 July 1999. On the two counts of break and enter, sentence the appellant to imprisonment for eight years cumulative upon the fixed term already imposed but concurrent between themselves, comprising a minimum term of five years to commence 7 July 1999 and to expire 6 July 2004 and an additional term of three years to commence 7 July 2004 and to expire on 6 July 2007. 
       
      
    20   GROVE, J: I agree with the judgment just delivered by Greg James, J. and the structure of the orders which are proposed. We will need to impose imprisonment rather than penal servitude having regard to recent legislation and take into account the matters on the schedule.

     REGINA v Kylie EVERETT (nee BEARD) 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   HIDDEN J: The court is in a position to give judgment now and I will ask Acting Justice Carruthers to give the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Kylie Everett Beard has applied for leave out of time to appeal against a sentence imposed upon her by Judge McGuire in the Newcastle District Court on 16 December 1998. The applicant had pleaded guilty to 2 counts of dangerous driving occasioning death under s52A (1) of the Crimes Act, 1990 which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. His Honour took into account 2 offences on a Form 1, namely one offence of being an unlicensed driver and one offence of self administer a prohibited drug. The offences were committed on 18 December 1997. On the first count, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 16 December 1998 and to expire on 15 December 2000, with an additional term of 2 years to commence on 15 December 2000 and expiring on 16 December 2002. On the second count his Honour imposed a fixed term of two years imprisonment to commence on 17 December 1998, and to expire on 15 December 2000. 
    3   The applicant was born on 4 June 1974. She has a history of addiction to heroin and other drugs. When she was 17 years of age, she was convicted at the Castlereagh Street Local Court on 26 February 1992 of being an unlicensed driver. She was fined $85. Between that time and 15 January 1997 she was before Local Courts on a further nine occasions for driving without a licence. She has never held a licence. 
    4   With regard to the applicant’s conviction on 15 January 1997, she was fined $350. A stage should had been reached by that date, in my opinion, when she should have had a suitably deterrent penalty imposed on her for persistently driving on public roads without being licensed, and never having had a licence. It is a great pity, in retrospect, that this did not occur. 
    5   Apart from been an unlicensed driver, her prior criminal record contains a litany of offences concerned with disobeying the law relating to the use of motor vehicles upon public roads. However prior to the subject sentence she has not received a full-time custodial sentence. 
    6   I turn then to the basic details of the subject offence. At about 4.43pm on the date of the offence, the applicant was driving a Ford Fairlane sedan in a northerly direction on the F3 freeway one kilometre south of the Cessnock turn-off when she lost control of the vehicle which travelled off the western shoulder of the highway and collided with a large road sign. Her husband, whom she had married only a few days before, and who was aged 34, was killed as well as the applicant’s two year old son from a previous relationship. The applicant’s four year old daughter of the same relationship mercifully survived. Syringes and other equipment concerned with the injection of heroin together with some heroin were located in the vehicle by police officers. 
    7   Having examined a blood sample of the applicant, Dr Perl was of the view that, at the time of the accident, the applicant was under the influence of morphine and cannabis within a toxic to lethal range. 
    8   After the accident, the applicant alleged that it was caused by her going to sleep and she untruthfully denied to police officers she had at some time prior to the accident administered heroin to herself. The forensic tests clearly indicated otherwise. 
    9   In his remarks on sentence, Judge McGuire comprehensively referred to the subjective and objective circumstances. Not surprisingly, he described the applicant’s conduct on the day in question “as greatly criminal”. However, his Honour found special circumstances flowed from the subjective factors. 
    10   His Honour directed, that upon the applicant’s release to probation, she subject herself to all directions of the officers of the Probation Service. She is to undertake any course of rehabilitation required or otherwise determined by her probation officer. She is to abstain from prohibited drugs and she is to subject herself to urine analysis or any other testing designed to detect the ingestion of prohibited drugs. A pre-sentence report under the hand of Ms Amanda Graveson, a Community Correctional Officer of Queensland Corrections dated the 7 September 1998, was before his Honour and in her evaluation, Ms Graveson said: 
     
      
       
        
       “Miss Everett is an intelligent, likeable young woman who has potential but is unable to cope with life without drugs. She has the support of her mother and with her assistance appears to adequately care for her young daughter. 
        
        
       While Miss Everett accepts she cannot live her life through a drug induced haze, she does not appear to have the will power and conviction needed to successfully rehabilitate herself. Ms Everett’s main concern at present is the effect of her being imprisoned will have on her daughter …” 
       
      
    11   The applicant appeared before the Court in person and she has already supplied the Court with written submissions to support her application. This morning she has read to the Court a harrowing description of the effect that the accident has had upon her emotional well-being and her concerns about the impact that it is having upon her young daughter. 
    12   The Court has also had the evident benefit of written submissions from the Crown in response. 
    13   I do not find it necessary to dwell for present purposes on the applicant’s written submissions. In summary they rely upon alleged errors of facts by the judge relating to the accident itself, the applicant’s attempts at rehabilitation and alleged inappropriate reference by his Honour to another driving case causing death, insufficient or no weight having been given to the effect of the applicant’s incarceration upon her daughter who lives in Queensland with her maternal grandmother and, finally, too much weight having been given by his Honour to the applicant’s prior record. 
    14   Having carefully considered each of these submissions and the responses by the Crown to them, I am quite satisfied none of them contains substance. Even if I were wrong in that regard, to the extent that there are subjective factors they are quite overwhelmed by the seriousness of the criminal conduct which resulted in the tragic death of two of the applicant's passengers on 18 December 1997. 
    15   Reference must necessarily be made to the guidelines in R v Jurisic. (1988) 45 NSWLR 209. It became necessary for this Court to lay down guidelines for the imposition of sentences for the subject offence because of a grave public concern at the frequency of the commission of this offence and a further concern that prior sentences were generally not adequately severe to accommodate the frequency and seriousness of the offence. His Honour’s sentence accommodates the guidelines judgment. 
    16   It must be remembered that compassionate as judges may wish to be and as touched as they may be by some of the tragic situations that are presented to them in the discharge of their difficult responsibilities, a sentencing judge has a responsibility to the community at large to ensure that offenders are appropriately punished as a deterrent to others who might be minded to commit the offence in question. 
    17   Time after time this Court has said that objective circumstances must be generally subservient to the imposition of deterrent sentences for offences such as the subject one. 
    18   This Court has had the very considerable assistance of Ms Woodburne on behalf of the Crown who has drawn to the Court’s attention ways in which the separation by the applicant from her daughter, who is in Queensland, may be ameliorated. 
    19   First, Ms Woodburne has drawn our attention to the fact that it is possible for the applicant to apply to serve the balance of her sentence in Queensland pursuant to Part 2 of the Prisoners (Interstate Transfer) Act 1982. 
    20   Secondly, she has referred s29 of the Correctional Centres Act, 1952 which vests Corrective Services with a discretion to permit an inmate absence from a New South Wales Correctional Centre in certain circumstances for humane reasons and, finally, she has referred to what is known as the Occasional Residential Programme existing at centres such as Mulawa under which children under 14 may have limited residential rights to be with their mother. Some matters by way of fresh evidence has been handed to the Court today, indicating that efforts are being made by the applicant, commendably it may be said, to come to terms with her long standing drug addiction. One can only express the sincere hope that the programme proves to be fruitful. 
    21   However, bound as this Court is by the principles of law which it must administer, the conclusion is inevitable that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were well within the discretionary range available to him, and, indeed, I would venture the comment that it would have been open to him, appropriate to his discretion, to have imposed a higher sentence. 
    22   In these circumstances I would propose that the application for leave to apply to the Court out of time be allowed; that the application for leave to appeal in the circumstances be granted; that the appeal be dismissed. 
    23   HIDDEN J: I agree. This is a tragic case, as cases of this kind usually are. Looking at her now one can only have a great deal of sympathy for the applicant. The learned sentencing judge said of her 
     
      
       
       “What she has inflicted upon herself will have far greater effect than the prison term to be imposed”. 
       
      
    24   Nevertheless, for the reasons Carruthers J has given, a prison term certainly had to be imposed and the length of it is such as could not possibly be challenged in this Court. His Honour faced a very difficult sentencing exercise but no error in the exercise of his discretion has been demonstrated. 
    25   The orders of the Court will be those proposed by Acting Justice Carruthers.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of the sentence following a plea of guilty by the appellant to aggravated robbery dealt with by Nader A/DCJ in the Newcastle District Court. On that occasion his Honour also took into account three offences on a Form 1. Those offences were a mid range driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol and driving whilst cancelled and an offence of failing to appear. It is convenient to mention that the first and second of those offences on the schedule related to driving a motor car in association with the subject matter of the indicted offence, or, to be more accurate, the offence for which the appellant was committed for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act. 
     
      
       
      
    2    So far as the offence of failing to appear, it appears that his Honour accepted the explanation of the appellant that he had not on an occasion attended at court because his son had been involved in a very serious motor car accident and he had gone to see him in Queensland. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The appellant is a 39 year old man of aboriginal background. His Honour sentenced the appellant to a total sentence of three and a half years penal servitude which he divided into minimum and additional terms of two years and one year and six months. 
     
      
       
      
    4    I propose to deal with the matter in relatively short form. The learned sentencing Judge described the events in his Remarks on Sentence and I do not propose to materially repeat them save to refer to some very unusual circumstances of this case. 
     
      
       
      
    5    It appears that the victim offered the appellant a lift in his motor car, the appellant having missed the last train of the evening. The appellant, however, had a duty to look after his 11 year old nephew and eventually the three were in the car when the victim said that, rather than transporting them, he would offer them overnight accommodation. He took them to a house where the electricity was not connected and at the house made remarks clearly and understandably taken by the appellant to indicate that the victim, as he became, was interested in a sexually predatory manner in the 11 year old boy. This upset the appellant. It may be, as his Honour found, that the vulnerability of the appellant to upset was enhanced by his prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor. Be that as it may, the reaction of the appellant was to defend his nephew from perceived future misconduct by the victim and, as a result the appellant attacked him, and afterwards robbed the victim and took his motor car. The evidence before his Honour showed that the reason for the robbery and the taking of a motor car was very much provoked by a perceived need for the appellant to take his nephew away from the danger, or, in short terms, to escape. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The learned sentencing judge took into account the matters to which I have made brief reference. It was argued, however, by Mr Nicholson SC that while his Honour recognised the appellant's aboriginality and the well-known approach to be taken by sentencing Courts along the lines delineated in R v Fernando 76 A Crim R 58 he had not perceived that the close kinship with the nephew would culturally inspire the appellant to go to the defence of his nephew. In my view there is substance in Mr Nicholson's submissions. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The learned Judge dealt with the appellant very promptly after his arrest. This was enabled because of the ready concession by the appellant of his guilt of the offence charged and the absence of any necessity for extended court hearing. This was a matter that the appellant was entitled to have taken into account and his Honour said he would take into account time in custody prior to sentence. The appellant had in fact been in custody since 2 March 1999 and sentence was imposed to date from his appearance on 30 April 1999. Whilst I do not express any hesitation about accepting his Honour's indication that he had taken into account the pre-sentence custody, it is desirable that there be patent manifestation that it has been taken into account. It was fairly conceded by the Crown that the approach of backdating the sentence to the first day in custody would have been appropriate and I agree with that concession. 
     
      
       
      
    8    In my view this is a case where Court should intervene and proceed to resentence. I have commented in passing that the appellant may have been affected by intoxicating liquor on the occasion of this crime. Information before the sentencing Judge indicated there is a desirability for the appellant to have assistance in overcoming what might be broadly described as an alcohol problem. In my view a total sentence of less than three years would be appropriate in this case. By virtue of the Sentencing Act that will mean that the parole of the prisoner will be ordered by the Court rather than resting within the discretion of a Parole Board. In those circumstances the court is empowered to give directions as to the conditions of parole and in this, what I have described as most unusual, if not unique case, I regard that as highly desirable. 
     
      
       
      
    9    Accordingly, I propose the following orders: That the application for leave to appeal be granted; the appeal allowed; the sentence in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced taking into account the Form 1 offences, to a total of two and a half years imprisonment. I would adopt, for the reasons expressed by the sentencing judge, his finding of special circumstances and I would order that total sentence be served in a Minimum Term of 18 months to date from 2 March 1989 and to expire on 1 September 2000 together with an Additional Term of 12 months to date from 2 September 2000. I would order that the appellant be released to parole on 1 September 2000 and whilst on parole he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and in particular obey any instructions they give him in relation to the attending of rehabilitation courses in connection with alcohol indulgence. 
     
      
       
      
    10    GREG JAMES J: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    11    GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

     HIDDEN J CARRUTHERS AJWednesday 23 February 2000 
     
     Regina v Ryan Kenny 
      
      
    Judgment1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Ryan Kenny, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying methyl-amphetamine. That was a charge under s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, the quantity involved being less than the commercial quantity, and the maximum sentence is fifteen years imprisonment. He asked the sentencing judge to take into account certain matters on a Form 1, which were related to the circumstances of his arrest and to which I do not think I need make any further reference. 
     
      
       
      
    2     His Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for two years, comprising a minimum term of one year and an additional term of one year, and he seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    3     Shortly stated, the facts are that the applicant was stopped in a motor vehicle in the small hours of 26 January 1999 in the Chippendale area. There the methyl-amphetamine was found in a bag, its quantity being about fifty-eight grams. In evidence before his Honour, the applicant said that he intended to use some of the drug himself and to supply the rest to a friend. 
     
      
       
      
    4     In the course of his evidence, both in chief and under cross-examination, the applicant admitted having dealt in the drug for a couple of months prior to his arrest. The precise extent of his dealings and the measure of his profit from them was not explored. What can be said, however, is that the picture which emerged was of a user/dealer, that is a person who, from time to time, gives drugs away and, at other times, sells drugs, but sells them for the purpose only of financing his own drug use. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The applicant is now twenty-four years old. He has no criminal record. Apart from his drug abuse, his background is quite creditable, despite some significant difficulties in his earlier family life. At the time of sentence he was in a stable de facto relationship and he was in employment and had had a good work record. He gave evidence, which apparently his Honour accepted, that he had ceased using illicit drugs and broken off his associations in the drug sub-culture. His Honour found special circumstances, fixing a longer than usual additional term to foster the rehabilitative process. 
     
      
       
      
    6     In the application in this Court, Mr Byrne SC, who appeared with Mr Ikners for the applicant, presented an interesting argument about the relevance, indeed the admissibility, of the applicant's evidence of his course of drug dealing over the month prior to his arrest. I find it unnecessary to deal with those submissions, which were of substance and which may well raise, in an appropriate case, an important question of sentencing policy. 
     
      
       
      
    7     I am content to say that it appears to me the material was admissible on the basis that it tended to show that the applicant's possession for supply on the occasion in question was not an isolated incident and the applicant would not have been entitled to leniency on that basis: see R v Wotan (CCA unreported, 4 February 1988). 
     
      
       
      
    8     The final submission of Mr Byrne, and the one which I think is in any event made out, was that the sentence of two years imprisonment is manifestly excessive. In all the circumstances, it appears to me that a custodial sentence was called for in this case, but we have had the benefit of statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in relation to sentence for this class of offence. Those statistics, of course, must be approached with caution for the reasons identified in many decisions of this Court since they came into being. 
     
      
       
      
    9     Nonetheless, they confirm, as Priestley JA had occasion to observe in R v Cacciola (CCA unreported, 15 October 1998), that where custodial sentences are imposed for this type of offence, they are frequently quite low. Without analysing those statistics, it is sufficient to say that a sentence of two years appears relatively high in the range, and when one examines the amount involved here, which was substantial but still a great deal less than the commercial quantity, and when one has regard to the applicant's prior good character and prospects of rehabilitation, it appears to me that the two-year sentence imposed was more than was called for. 
     
      
       
      
    10     The reduction I consider appropriate is of six months. I would propose that the additional term of twelve months be maintained, but that the minimum term be reduced to six months. The convenient course I think to give effect to my proposal would be to grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed by his Honour and in lieu sentence the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months, comprising a minimum term of six months to commence on 16 November 1999 and to expire on 15 May 2000, and an additional term of twelve months to commence on 16 May 2000 and to expire on 15 May 2001.  
     
      
       
      
    11     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree.  
     
      
       
      
    12     HIDDEN J: The orders of the Court then will be as I have proposed. I should add this, however, the applicant is to be released on parole at the expiration of the minimum term which has been ordered. That being so, it will be a condition of his release to parole that he submit himself to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of officers of that Service. 
     
      
       
      
    13     In arriving at that sentence, we have taken into account the matters on the Form 1. I should also record, although I did not specifically say so, we have had regard to certain material tendered only this morning on the question of re-sentence.

     HIDDEN J CARRUTHERS AJ Wednesday 23 February 2000 
     
     Regina v Jack Sua 
      
      
    Judgment - ex-tempore1     HIDDEN J: The present applicant, who was under the age of eighteen at the time of the offence which brings him before this Court, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him after he was found guilty at trial in the District Court of a charge of armed robbery. The learned trial Judge sentenced him to penal servitude for five and a half years, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two and a half years, and directed that that sentence be served in a Juvenile Justice Centre until the applicant turned twenty-one. The applicant in fact was just short of seventeen years at the time of the offence. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The facts as his Honour found them for the purpose of sentence are particularly serious. On 3 June 1998 the applicant went to a private hotel, where he forced his way into the manager's private premises. He threatened the manager with a pistol and demanded money. He tied the manager to the bed in the room and took roughly $140 in cash. He held the pistol against the manager's head and said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""If you don't tell me where the money is I'll blow your fucking head off."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    3     The manager told him, as he had told him earlier, that the proceeds of the private hotel business were not in the room. The applicant in effect ransacked the room and then left. The experience for the manager must have been terrifying, to say the least. 
     
      
       
      
    4     The applicant has a rather disturbing criminal record for one so young. He is now eighteen years old. It includes a number of offences of violence, including an earlier offence of robbery. However, the sentence his Honour imposed is the first order of full-time custody which he has had to face. He was subject to probation at the time of this offence. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The applicant has had a significantly disturbed childhood. He was born in Samoa but was brought to this country in 1991 by an uncle and aunt, leaving his biological parents in Samoa. Just why that happened is not entirely clear. It does seem that the experience was unsettling for the applicant and he continued to miss his home and his biological parents. 
     
      
       
      
    6     It seems that he was in some way the subject of abusive behaviour by his uncle, although the precise nature of that also is not clear. This led to his leaving home and virtually living on the streets for a period. It is fortunate that he came to form an association with a woman who lived at Leichhardt with her son. In due course the Department of Community Services intervened and he was fostered to that woman.  
     
      
       
      
    7     Whilst living with her, a very serious offence was committed at her home. In effect, it was a home invasion, in the course of which the woman's son was beaten over the head with an iron bar, sustaining severe injuries. It seems that the applicant was present at the time, although upstairs in a position where he was unaware of what was happening, and a psychological report notes that that incident had a severe effect upon him, leaving him with feelings of guilt that he did not intervene and prevent that young man from being injured. It is a terrible irony really that the offence for which he is before this Court bears some resemblance to the incident to which I have referred.  
     
      
       
      
    8     Not surprisingly, part of his unfortunate background is his descent into drug abuse.  
     
      
       
      
    9     In respect of this offence he has been in Juvenile Justice custody since 15 June 1998 and there was before his Honour a report of a psychologist with the Department of Juvenile Justice and a more conventional Juvenile Justice report prepared for the purpose of sentence.  
     
      
       
      
    10     Those reports were somewhat guarded about the applicant's future but certainly contained significant hopeful signs. The Juvenile Justice report in particular noted that the applicant had endured considerable hardship throughout his life; that since being in custody he had given his situation a considerable amount of thought; that he had maintained a high level of positive behaviour and demonstrated an ability to control his anger and violence within the custodial environment; and that he was willing to engage in counselling and would no doubt benefit from it. All this material was before his Honour and it does seem that that experienced sentencing Judge took it into account. 
     
      
       
      
    11     In written submissions prepared on the applicant's behalf there were some criticisms of the adequacy of his Honour's reasons for sentence and the suggestion of his Honour's failure to refer to some relevant matters, but those criticisms were not really pressed before us. The nub of the application is that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the offence, the sentence in fact passed fails to give adequate weight to the applicant's age and his unfortunate background. 
     
      
       
      
    12     Passing reference was made to the guideline judgment in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, but it does not appear that much assistance is available from that case. I take the guidelines to be applicable to adult offenders and not to embrace the special facts governing the sentencing of children. The principles governing the sentencing of children are well known. I am well aware that the special consideration which might be afforded to persons under the age of eighteen for the purpose of sentence might be qualified where the offence involved is a particularly serious one: that is, a crime which might appropriately be characterised as grave adult behaviour. This, of course, is such a case. 
     
      
       
      
    13     I have given this matter earnest consideration. The offence, as I have outlined it, is undoubtedly very serious. On the other hand the applicant was quite young, not quite seventeen at the time, and the sentence which he now faces is the first ever imposed upon him. 
     
      
       
      
    14     In all the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that his Honour has failed to give adequate weight to his youth and his background in arriving at the sentence and that this Court should consider for itself what sentence must be passed. To that end we have received in evidence today a further report from the Department of Juvenile Justice which confirms the encouraging trend apparent from the earlier reports, and which gives one some hope that this young man may emerge from custody substantially rehabilitated and may well benefit from guidance and supervision thereafter. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Even though I am satisfied this Court should intervene, the seriousness of the offence persuades me that any reduction in sentence cannot be substantial. The reduction I have in mind is six months of the minimum term. I would propose that the additional term not be disturbed. 
     
      
       
      
    16     The orders I propose are these: 
     
      
       
       1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
        
       2. Appeal allowed. 
       
      
    17     3. The minimum term fixed by his Honour is quashed and in lieu thereof I would fix a minimum term of two and a half years penal servitude to commence on 15 June 1998 and to expire on 14 December 2000. The additional term of two and a half years penal servitude should stand.  
     
      
       
      
    18     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. I would merely add that if the applicant commits a further offence one would anticipate that the sentencing Judge would take the view that the applicant has exhausted any leniency which he could expect from the criminal justice system as a consequence of his disturbed background.  
     
      
       
      
    19     HIDDEN J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       JUDGMENT -  
       Admissibility of ERISP with Mark Helmhout 
       
      
    1    HER HONOUR: After the jury was empanelled but prior to the Crown's opening, Mr Corr, who appears on behalf of the accused, Mark Helmhout, made application for me to determine the question of the admissibility of an electronically recorded interview between his client and Detective McCloskey made at the Queanbeyan Police Station on 20 June 1998. Mr Corr submitted that the interview was inadmissible, having regard to the provisions of ss 84, 85 and 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”). Alternatively, Mr Corr submitted by reference to s 90 of that Act that I would exclude the interview in the exercise of my discretion. 
     
      
    2    The Crown Prosecutor agreed that it was appropriate that this matter be determined as a preliminary issue. I embarked upon a voir dire hearing pursuant to s 189 of the Act. Evidence was led by the Crown from Detectives McCloskey and Hinton, who were the two officers who conducted the interview. 
     
      
    3    Sergeant Hanrahan, the officer in charge of the Queanbeyan Police Station at the time, was also called. Sergeant Hanrahan spoke to the accused at the conclusion of the interview and asked him a series of formal questions which are recorded at question 354 and following. 
     
      
    4    Sergeant Dagwell, the custody manager at the Queanbeyan Police Station, responsible for the accused's custody in the relevant period, also gave evidence. 
     
      
    5    A number of exhibits were tendered on the voir dire, including the two videotapes of the interview. I viewed the whole of the interview during the course of the hearing. In the accused's case, evidence was led from the accused, Mr Jeffery, a solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service, and from Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist. 
     
      
    6    The challenge to the admissibility of the interview was advanced on three grounds. Firstly, it was submitted that the accused had been threatened by Detectives McCloskey and Hinton prior to the commencement of the interview. The tenor of the threat said to have been made was that, if the accused did not cooperate with the police, his de facto wife, Ms Joanne Delly, would be charged with an offence and his children might be handed over to the welfare authorities. 
     
      
    7    This conduct was said to be oppressive within the meaning of s 84(1)(a) of the Act. The Crown Prosecutor accepted that such behaviour, had it taken place, would be oppressive within the meaning of that section. 
     
      
    8    Secondly, the accused was said to have been affected (at the time of his participation in the interview) by a combination of alcohol, drugs, and underlying depression such that the Crown could not discharge the onus cast upon it pursuant to s 85(2) of the Act which provides that evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which it was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 
     
      
    9    Thirdly, it was submitted that the police had failed to comply with the requirements of cl 28 of the Crimes (Detention after Arrest) Regulation 1998. The custody manager had not informed an Aboriginal legal aid office of the fact that the accused was being detained. This, it was submitted, amounted to improper conduct, or conduct in contravention of Australian law such as to enliven the operation of s 138 of the Act. 
     
      
    10    In determining the factual issues raised by these various challenges, I am to have regard to the provisions of s 142 of the Act, and I do so. 
     
      
    11    The accused was arrested at his home at 10/30 Trinculo Place, Queanbeyan at about 8.30am on Saturday 20 June 1998. At the time the police were in possession of information from Edward Szkudelski tending to implicate the accused, and his brother Pieter, in the murder of the deceased Paul Harris. It was said that the deceased had been killed at the Trinculo Place unit the previous evening. The deceased had been drinking at those premises with the accused, Pieter Helmhout, Edward Szkudelski, and others. 
     
      
    12    On the previous day, the accused had attended the funeral of his elder brother, John. Following the interment, a wake was held at the Raider’s Club, Mawson. The drinking session at the Trinculo Place unit was a continuation of the wake. Edward Szkudelski told police that the deceased had been assaulted and strangled in the accused's unit and that his body had been subsequently dumped in Fyshwick. The deceased's body was located by police in the early hours of 20 June 1998 in Fyshwick at the location described by Mr Szkudelski. 
     
      
    13    Police obtained a search warrant to search the Trinculo Place premises. 
     
      
    14    Detectives McCloskey and Hinton gave evidence, which I accept, that the accused was informed at the unit that he was under arrest for a murder said to have been committed the previous night. The accused was taken to the Queanbeyan Police Station. He arrived there around 9.30am. It appears that not later than 9.33am he was handed over to the custody manager, Sergeant Dagwell. 
     
      
    15    Sergeant Dagwell gave evidence, which I accept, that he read to the accused a statement of his rights under Part 10A of the Crimes Act. A copy of the document in terms also identical to that read to the accused was in evidence before me. The recitation of those rights included reference to the right of an Aboriginal detainee to have a support person present. The accused is an Aboriginal person within the meaning of Part 10A of the Crimes Act. The accused said that he did not recall Sergeant Dagwell reading the statement of rights to him. He did not deny that this had been done. Sergeant Dagwell said it was his practice to read the Part 10A statement as the first thing he does after explaining to a detainee who he is. Sergeant Dagwell was not able to recall whether he had made contact with a representative of the Aboriginal Legal Service. 
     
      
    16    There is no record of a representative of that service or any other Aboriginal legal aid organisation attending the Queanbeyan Police Station to see the accused on that day. Mr Jeffery gave evidence that both he and his field officer, Mr Brandy, had mobile phones. Save in extreme circumstances, Mr Jeffery always leaves his mobile phone on. It is his understanding that Mr Brandy is in the practice of leaving his mobile phone on also. Neither Mr Jeffery nor Mr Brandy were contacted that day. 
     
      
    17    Clause 28 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If a detained person is an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander, then, unless the custody manager is aware that the person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning of the person, the custody manager must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) immediately inform the person that a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation will be notified that the person is being detained in respect of an offence, and 
           
           
          (b) notify such a representative accordingly."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    18    The requirements of cl 28 were not met. I will return to this in due course. 
     
      
    19    The accused gave evidence concerning the circumstances leading up to his participation in the interview in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At first they started talking about what was supposed to have happened and I just still sorta said I don't know what youse are talking about and then that is when Detective McCloskey said to me ‘I can give you ten to fifteen years if you are going to make it hard for us or I can give you five to seven years, if you don't you know, if you start talking to us’. I said, just shrugged my shoulders and that is when Detective Hinton - he got his little notebook out and sorta read out everything what I was supposed to have done, and then, I still sort of played dumb and they said, ‘Well we can charge your missus too and we can always ring the welfare up and take your kids away too’ and he picked up the phone, Detective Hinton did. He picked up the phone and just pressed two numbers and I said, ‘Oh, well - what is it - we will talk about it’, and like I said, he read all his notebook out and then we sort of went and done that interview, record of interview."" 
        
       
      
    20    On a voir dire hearing to determine whether an accused's admission should be admitted into evidence in a criminal proceeding, the issue of the truth of the admission is to be disregarded unless it is introduced by the accused (s 189(3) of the Act). In this case, the issue of the truthfulness of the admission was raised in the accused's case. It was his evidence that those portions of the interview in which he made admissions as to striking the deceased, on more than one occasion, and to participating in the strangling of the deceased were not true. He had only said these things to please the police officers since his first priority was to see that his wife and children were taken care of. 
     
      
    21    The accused said that he had not been informed that he was being arrested for the offence of murder. His understanding was that his role that night was consistent with him being an accessory after the fact to murder but that he had played no part in the killing of the deceased. His assistance was limited to driving the car with the body and his presence at the scene of its disposal. 
     
      
    22    I do not consider it appropriate to embark upon a detailed examination of the evidence of the accused given on the voir dire. But it is necessary for me to observe that I did not accept his evidence in a number of respects. I note, among other matters, that in evidence in chief the accused was asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When you arrived at the Police Station were you intending to take part in a record of interview? A. Yeah. I don't know this - they just put me in this room and they just, talking about things."" 
        
       
       
      He was then asked: 
       
        
        ""Did you know that you had a right to remain silent when you got to the Police Station?"" 
        
       
       
      to which he replied: 
       
        
        ""Yeah."" 
        
       
       
      He was asked: 
       
        
        ""Q. Did you intend to speak to the police about what happened?  
         
        A. No, not really - not really."" 
        
       
      
    23    The report of Dr Nielssen dated 21 February 2000 sets out the history that he obtained from the accused. Dr Nielssen reports: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Helmhout said that based upon his experience in the justice system he had not intended to participate in an ERISP interview."" 
        
       
      
    24    That does not sit well with the accused's first response when the matter was raised with him in examination in chief. I also note that the accused's evidence contained allegations against Detectives McCloskey and Hinton of a more detailed nature than had been put to either officer in the course of cross-examination. On the accused’s account, it was Detective McCloskey who said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""That he could give him ten to fifteen years if he was going to make it hard for police or five to seven years if he did not."" 
        
       
       
      That allegation was not put to Detective McCloskey but it was put to Detective Hinton. 
       
      
    25    The Crown Prosecutor submitted that I would reject the accused's version given in evidence. He submitted that it was inherently implausible that a man whose only involvement in the crime had been as an accessory after the fact would confess to involvement in the killing in the belief that he would be charged with a lesser offence than murder. Had this happened it is inconceivable that when charged with murder he would make no complaint. Mr Corr submitted that to the extent that his client was being taken to task for failing to complain to Sergeant Hanrahan the Crown was being somewhat unrealistic. Would an Aboriginal person in custody be likely to complain to one officer about what he perceived to be the unfair conduct of that officer's colleagues? I accept the force of Mr Corr's submission in that regard. 
     
      
    26    As to what is said to be the inherent implausibility of the accused's version, I bear in mind that I am concerned with his allegation that he was threatened by the police prior to the commencement of the interview. Whether the threats induced him to make a false confession or a true confession would not matter for the purposes of the discharge of the onus imposed upon the Crown pursuant to s 84 of the Act. However, I do have regard to the Crown's submissions as to the implausibility of the account offered by the accused in assessing the weight that I give to his evidence generally. 
     
      
    27    I do not consider the accused's appearance on the videotape or the manner or the contents of his answers is suggestive of a man who was recounting a script furnished to him in a pre-interview discussion. I also note that the accused told Dr Nielssen this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He said he could remember the important details of the events leading up to Mr Harris's death, and said it was roughly in accordance with the account given in the ERISP, although he said that several details had been suggested to him by the police."" 
        
       
      
    28    In evidence, Dr Nielssen was asked this question by the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did Mr Helmhout say anything to you about the police telling him what to say for parts of the interview? 
         
        A. He did, but when I attempted to ask him what parts he had been told to say, he wasn't able to direct me to the specific examples."" 
        
       
      
    29    In the light of the accused's evidence, I consider that to be a significant answer. 
     
      
    30    I accept Detectives McCloskey and Hinton in preference to the accused as to the events leading up to the conduct of the interview. I do not find that threats of the character described by the accused were made. 
     
      
    31    Accordingly, I am satisfied that the interview and the making of the interview were not influenced by oppressive conduct or indeed any other conduct falling within the terms of s 84(1)(a). 
     
      
    32    There was evidence that the accused had consumed a quantity of alcohol and other drugs in the period leading up to his arrest. His brother had died a week before the subject events. In that week, it was his account he had been consuming substantial quantities of amphetamines. He had also consumed a fair amount of marijuana. After his brother's funeral he had one shot of heroin. 
     
      
    33    He had also drunk a considerable quantity of alcohol following the funeral. He said he had consumed probably half a dozen schooners or more of beer at the Raiders Club and that he had drunk further alcohol after the group had returned to the Trinculo Place unit. He thought he had drunk about five or six stubbies of beer at this time and, after the beer ran out, he had probably two stubbies of wine. 
     
      
    34    The accused gives an account of his alcohol consumption in the interview broadly consistent with that given in evidence, although without reference to the stubbies of wine. 
     
      
    35    The accused had also consumed some prescription drugs in the period prior to the interview. There was evidence that he had consumed Oxazepam tablets. 
     
      
    36    Dr Nielssen expressed this opinion in his report: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In response to your specific question regarding Helmhout's state of mind at the time of the ERISP, I believe he is likely to have been in an acutely depressed state because of a combination of the grief following his brother's death, his predicament in having been charged with the offence, and also the after effects of having taken large doses of amphetamines over the week before the funeral. He is also likely to have been affected by the cumulative dose of oxazepam, an anxiety reducing sedative, which may have affected his judgment in agreeing to give the interview."" 
        
       
       
      I accept this opinion. 
       
      
    37    None of the police who gave evidence on the voir dire considered that the accused had been obviously affected by alcohol or drugs at the time of the interview. In particular, I note that Sergeant Dagwell paid regard to this consideration as one of the matters which he took up with the accused in the course of administering a questionnaire to him. Sergeant Dagwell recorded that the accused was suffering from some physical problems but he made no note of noticeable affectation by drugs or alcohol. 
     
      
    38    The appearance of the accused in the course of the lengthy videotaped interview together with the responses that he gives to the questions asked of him does not, to my mind, give rise to concern that in consequence of his ingestion of drugs and/or alcohol he was significantly (in the sense of noticeably) incapacitated. His answers are responsive. At times they are lengthy and contain a good deal of volunteered detail. On more than one occasion the accused gives a physical demonstration of the events that he is describing. He does not appear to exhibit any difficulty in coordination. I also note that the accused's evidence is suggestive of him having a good recall of the course of the interview. During the interview he was asked about the effects of alcohol upon him and he told the police that it caused him to ""blackout like a pork chop"". There is nothing to suggest that the effects of alcohol or drug affectation was of that order on him on this occasion. 
     
      
    39    I note that Dr Nielssen observes in his report: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The answers recorded in the transcript of the interview are reasonably coherent, and do not suggest that he was delirious acutely mentally ill."" 
        
       
      
    40    Dr Nielssen did not have the benefit of observing the appearance of the accused on the videotape. I consider, as I have noted, that a viewing of the videotape tends to confirm that the accused was coherent during his interview. 
     
      
    41    In considering the onus placed upon the Crown pursuant to s 85(2) I have regard to the observations of Barr J in Regina v Rooke (unreported, CCA, 2 September 1997) at p 15. I am concerned with whether the circumstances of the official questioning were such as to produce unreliable evidence. I am satisfied that the Crown has discharged its onus of establishing that the circumstances in which the admission was made was such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. 
     
      
    42    This brings me to a consideration of the failure of the police to contact an Aboriginal legal aid organisation in accordance with the obligation imposed upon them by law so to do. The Crown accepted, having regard to the evidence of Mr Jeffery which was not the subject of challenge, that I would find (as I do) that the Aboriginal Legal Service was not notified that the accused, Mark Helmhout, was being detained in custody at the Queanbeyan Police Station. 
     
      
    43    The Crown further accepted that the failure to comply with the obligation imposed upon the custody manager pursuant to cl 28 of the Regulation produced the result that the interview was obtained improperly or in contravention of Australian law within the meaning of s 138(1) of the Act. Accordingly, the evidence is not to be admitted unless I am of the opinion that the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, given that it was obtained in the way that it was. 
     
      
    44    In considering this matter, I have regard to the considerations set out in s 138(3). I note that those considerations are not an exhaustive statement of the matters to be taken into account in determining whether the evidence might be admitted, notwithstanding that it has been obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law. 
     
      
    45    Firstly, I turn to the probative value of the evidence. “Probative value” is defined in the dictionary to the Act. The “probative value” of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. Viewed in this way, the probative value of the evidence must be put as very high. 
     
      
    46    The next consideration set out in s 138(3) is the importance of the evidence in the proceeding. Mr Corr submits that the Crown still has available to it the evidence of the witness, Edward Szkudelski. He notes that Mr Szkudelski's version is corroborated in some respects by other evidence. 
     
      
    47    Equally, Mr Corr was frank in acknowledging that the interview forms a central plank in the Crown's case against the accused. This was, in my view, a realistic concession. 
     
      
    48    I consider the interview to be of critical importance. There are passages in the interview capable of providing support of the version of events described by Mr Szkudelski. Without this material, Mr Szkudelski's version might be considered suspect. Mr Szkudelski was present at the scene and, on his own account, accompanied the accused and Pieter Helmhout to the place where the body was dumped. 
     
      
    49    I next turn to the nature of the offence and it is sufficient to state that the accused is charged with murder. 
     
      
    50    I must have regard to a number of things which include the gravity of the impropriety or contravention and whether it was deliberate or reckless. I consider the failure to comply with the requirements of the Regulation is a serious matter. Part 10A of the Crimes Act was inserted by Act No.48 of 1997 and confers power on police to detain persons under arrest for a period of time in order to enable the investigation of the person's involvement in the commission of an offence. The introduction of this Part effected a significant departure from the common law. In order to balance the desirability of allowing police the opportunity to investigate suspects’ involvement in crime with respect for individual liberties and, importantly, the right to silence, a number of protective provisions were introduced in Part 10A. Importantly, the custody manager is charged with the provision of information to the detained person pursuant to ss 356M and 356N. 
     
      
    51    Section 356A provides that the regulations may make provision with respect to the modification of Part 10A in relation to, inter alia, Aboriginal persons. This has been done. Aboriginal persons fall within the definition of “vulnerable persons” for the purposes of the Regulation. 
     
      
    52    Part 5 of the Regulation, which contains cl 28, is expressed to modify the application of Part 10A of the Crimes Act with respect to vulnerable persons. Aboriginal persons are thus persons who have been identified as needing special protection for the purposes of Part 10A. 
     
      
    53    Unless the custody manager is aware that a detained Aboriginal person has arranged for a legal practitioner to be present during questioning, the custody manager must inform that person that a representative of an Aboriginal legal aid organisation will be notified of the fact of the person's detention and must notify such a person. 
     
      
    54    In this case, the evidence is that the accused was asked whether he wished the services of a solicitor or whether he wished to contact a friend. To both questions he said, “No”. I should observe that, in the course of his evidence, the accused said that the investigating police had given him an account that they were unable to contact anyone from the Aboriginal Legal Service. I do not accept that evidence. It emerged for the first time in the course of the accused’s evidence, no such suggestion having been put to the police in the course of cross-examination, notwithstanding the central importance of that matter having regard to the issues agitated on this voir dire. 
     
      
    55    Neither Detective McCloskey nor Detective Hinton was challenged as to their respective accounts that the accused had been offered the opportunity of contacting a solicitor and that he had declined to do so. The making of such an offer and the accused’s response is confirmed in the opening section of the electronically recorded interview. 
     
      
    56    However, the fact that I find the accused was informed of the right to contact a solicitor and that he declined to do so is not to the point. It is to be observed that the custody manager is required to notify an Aboriginal legal aid organisation and that obligation remains upon the custody manager (save in a circumstance where he or she is aware that arrangements have been made for a legal representative to attend) even where the detained Aboriginal person says he or she does not wish legal assistance. That serves to underscore the strongly protective nature of the regime under Part 10A with respect to Aboriginal persons. 
     
      
    57    I next consider whether the failure was a deliberate or reckless one. I unhesitatingly accept that it was not deliberate. I found Sergeant Dagwell to be a witness of truth. It was not suggested on behalf of the accused that I would find otherwise. Sergeant Dagwell was emphatic that he understood it was his obligation to notify the Aboriginal Legal Service. In similar circumstances he had done so on other occasions. He knew Mr Brandy well. It was his evidence that he could not recall whether he had made contact on this occasion. As I have noted, I find that he did not. 
     
      
    58    What is the explanation for that failure and does it constitute a reckless disregard by the Sergeant for the obligations imposed on him? Sergeant Dagwell was involved that morning, as custody manager, in processing (in the sense of conforming with the protocols relating to persons detained pursuant to Part 10A) Pieter Helmhout, Mark Helmhout, Deborah Davidson and Edward Szkudelski. I accept that it was, from his point of view, a busy morning. The physical conditions of the Queanbeyan Police Station at the time made the scene somewhat chaotic. More importantly to my mind, neither the custody management record completed in manuscript nor the computer program designed to record custody actions made provision to prompt or remind Sergeant Dagwell of the notification requirement imposed by cl 28 of the Regulation. This is a defect in the design of the Part 10A protocols which, if it has not been corrected, in my view, should be. Sergeant Dagwell impressed me as an officer who would faithfully carry out each function he was required to perform as he attended to the completion of the handwritten and computer prompts. I consider it likely that, on this day, Sergeant Dagwell did just that. He commenced by the rote reading of the Part 10A document which he frankly observed was a long screed and it had been his experience that detainees tended not to ask questions arising out of it. He then moved to the process of completing the custody management record, Ex G, and to the questionnaire which is performed in answer to computer prompts. Nothing reminded him of his obligation pursuant to the Regulation and I find that he overlooked it. I do not consider that that failing was reckless. 
     
      
    59    It is not submitted that the contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nor is it submitted that para (g) of s 138(3) is relevant to my determination of the present case. 
     
      
    60    As to the consideration contained in para (h) of that subsection, I find there would have been no difficulty in complying with the Regulation. 
     
      
    61    The failure to comply with an important protection designed to safeguard the accused’s interests as a vulnerable person is a significant one. However, ultimately, having weighed the various matters that I am required to take into consideration, I have determined that the desirability of admitting the interview outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, notwithstanding that it was obtained following that failure. In arriving at this determination, my view that Sergeant Dagwell's omission was neither deliberate nor reckless is important. 
     
      
    62    I should note that I have also given consideration to the exercise of my discretion under s 90 of the Act to refuse to admit evidence of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, it would be unfair to use the evidence. The High Court considered the content of the so-called fairness discretion at common law in The Queen v Swaffield (1997) 192 CLR 159. The majority noted that their statement of the law in this area was conformable with the requirements of the Act. One aspect of the fairness discretion of which the majority spoke at p 189 was the consideration that no confession might have been made at all had the police investigation been properly conducted. 
     
      
    63    The accused's evidence is that he was aware of the right to silence. As I have noted, I do not accept that he was threatened or that his participation in the interview was the product of those threats. I do not consider that it would be relevantly unfair to the accused to use the admission. 
     
      
    64    For these reasons, I propose to allow the tender of the interview.

     REGINA v Abdul Hakim ZREIKA 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   HIDDEN J: I will ask Acting Justice Carruthers to give the first judgment. 
    2   CARRUTHERS AJ: Abdul Hakim Zreika, the applicant, was arraigned before Judge Grogan and a jury of twelve at the District Court Parramatta on 9 February 1999. He pleaded not guilty to the four charges in the indictment which, briefly stated, were:  
    3   Count 1 charged that on or about 7 February 1996 at Lidcombe the applicant, knowing that a person, whose name remains unknown, committed the offence of robbery at Clancy’s Supermarket, failed, without reasonable excuse, to bring information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of that unnamed person to the attention of a member of the Police Force. This count is under s316 of the Crimes Act 1900, as amended, and is generally known as “concealing a serious offence”. That offence imposes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years. 
    4   Count 2 charged that the applicant on 23 December 1996 at Lidcombe, did act, namely to request Monica Gruszka to conceal information from the police in relation to the aforesaid robbery, with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice. This is a count under s319 of the Act which is generally known as “perverting the course of justice” and carries a maximum sentence of fourteen years penal servitude. 
    5   Count 3 charged that between 25 May 1997 and 29 May 1997 at Lidcombe the applicant did threaten to cause a detriment, namely difficulties generally, including in regard to her education, to Elizabeth Passarelli, with intent to influence her, a person called in a judicial proceeding, namely proceedings against Abdul Hakim Zreika, for the offence of robbery in the Lidcombe Children’s Court, and for public justice offences in the Burwood Local Court, to not attend as a witness. This is a count under s322(a) of the Act, which is generally known as “threatening a witness”, and imposes a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
    6   Count 4 charged that on 4 June 1997 at Lidcombe, the applicant threatened to do injury to a police officer, with intent to influence him in his conduct as a public justice official in relation to the judicial proceedings referred to in the third count. This was a count under s322(d) of the Act. 
    7   On 24 February 1999 the jury found the applicant guilty of counts 1, 2 and 3 in the indictment and not guilty of count 4. On that day, the applicant was remanded in custody to appear for sentence. The sentence proceedings were, by consent, delayed until 2 July 1999 to permit the applicant to be represented by the particular counsel of his choice. 
    8   The very detailed remarks on sentence, running into some 49 pages, by Judge Grogan are available for public inspection and accordingly permit this Court to deal with the factual matters with brevity. Firstly, as to the sentences, his Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: 
    9   As to the first count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of three months imprisonment to commence on 24 February 1999 and to expire on 23 May 1999.  
    10   With regard to the third count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment, to commence on 24 February 1999 and to expire on 23 February 2000. 
    11   With regard to the second count, which was obviously treated by his Honour as the most serious matter, his Honour imposed a minimum term of nine months, to commence on 24 February 2000 and to expire on 23 November 2000, with an additional term of 15 months to date from 24 November 2000. 
    12   The following skeletal outline of the facts will suffice:  
    13   The applicant and Miss Gruszka were both present at Clancy’s Supermarket at Lidcombe on 7 February 1996 when the applicant informed her that “He and his mates were going to rob the store and that he was going to get half the money and buy a rotary engine for his car”. 
    14   The unnamed offender, as so referred in count 1, in fact assaulted the store manager and stole $15,000 from him. When the police arrived, however, because of intimidation by the applicant, Ms Gruszka declined to inform the police officers what she knew of the robbery. The applicant, likewise, did not give the police any information. 
    15   The applicant drove Ms Gruszka home, telling her not to say anything. These facts constituted the first count. However, Ms Gruszka, who was then a 16 year old schoolgirl, on 26 December 1996, in fact assisted the police with their enquiries, and such assistance came to the knowledge of the applicant. On 23 December 1996, the applicant had threatened her “that he and his friends would get her if she signed anything and that she would not be having a Christmas”.  
    16   Ms Gruszka was extremely shaken and upset, to the extent that she was sent home from her work. Indeed, she was so frightened that she made a statement to the police about the matter, as I have indicated. The applicant was then charged with aiding and abetting the robbery and perverting the course of justice. Those facts constituted the second count in the indictment.  
    17   Ms Passarelli, who was also a 16 year old schoolgirl was, in 1997, in her final Higher School Certificate year, as indeed, as I understand it, was Ms Gruszka. She was also aware of the applicant’s involvement in the robbery. She had apparently a relationship with the applicant. 
    18   Between 25 May 1997 and 29 May 1997, the applicant seriously threatened her on a number of occasions. This was in the context that the applicant was on conditional bail in relation to the count of aiding and abetting the robbery, and a bail condition was that he was not to approach or communicate with Ms Passarelli. 
    19   Included in the breaches of the bail conditions is the fact that between 23 May and 4 June 1997 the applicant telephoned Ms Passarelli 60 times. The evidence does not indicate how many times he telephoned her home between 25 May 1997 and 29 May 1997. I shall not relate the nature of the threatening calls which he made to Ms Passarelli, but they were serious indeed. 
    20   On 12 August 1997, Ms Passarelli, as a crucial Crown witness, attended the committal proceedings at Burwood Local Court in relation to the aiding and abetting the robbery charge against the applicant. However, because she was in such fear of the applicant and of the repercussions which she felt would eventuate, she said in answer to all material questions by the Prosecutor that she could not remember. Following the committal hearing, the applicant was discharged in respect of the robbery matter. Thus, because of the fear engendered by the applicant’s threats to Ms Passarelli, there could well have been a gross miscarriage of justice. These facts constitute the third count in the indictment. 
    21   It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentences imposed were excessive, particularly having regard to the youth of the applicant at the time the offences were committed. He was born on 12 July 1978, thus at the time of the first offence he was aged 17 years nine months, at the time of the second offence, 18 years and seven months, and at the time of the third offence, 19 years and thirteen days. The point was made that he was not in a position of authority when he committed the subject offences and, therefore, his conduct did not represent a breach of trust, which is so frequently associated with offences in the nature of interfering with the administration of justice. 
    22   In his written and oral submissions to this Court, senior counsel for the applicant has referred to relevant statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, and again stressed the young age and immaturity of the applicant. Senior counsel frankly conceded that the offences committed by the applicant merited significant punishment, but submitted that Judge Grogan had not given sufficient weight to the true measure of objective criminality disclosed in the applicant's conduct, as well as the subjective matters to which I have referred. 
    23   We were referred to well-known authority: R v Karageorge (1998) 103 ACrimR 157. and R v Pangello (1991) 56 ACrimR 441 at 443.. This Court was there concerned with two members of the legal profession who had committed serious offences against the administration of justice. However, it must be borne in mind, when comparing their sentences as persons in positions of trust and responsibility, that they would inevitably have suffered the ignominy and financial detriment of having been struck off the role of solicitors. 
    24   It must also be borne in mind when considering the statistics, as counsel have fairly conceded, that there is a relatively small sample. 
    25   The present applicant suffers the disadvantage of having been convicted by a jury of three offences extending over a period from 7 February 1996 to 29 May 1997. There is a further difficulty which confronts the applicant, namely offences which he committed between the offence constituted by count 2, and the offence constituted by count 3. 
    26   Thus, on 29 July 1997, the applicant was convicted of the offences of exceeding the speed limit, being a cancelled driver, driving while cancelled and driving in a manner dangerous. These offences were committed on 21 January 1997.  
    27   On 31 October 1997, the applicant was dealt with at Redfern Local Court in respect of 15 charges of obtaining money and other property by deception, three charges of obtaining money by deception, and one of making a false statement to obtain money. In relation to these matters, the applicant had the benefit of a four year good behaviour bond, and in respect of one charge he was ordered on appeal to perform 100 hours of community service and to pay certain compensation. These offences were committed between 20 January 1997 and 1 February 1997. 
    28   On 24 February 1998, the applicant was convicted of driving while disqualified. Initially, a sentence of four months periodic detention was imposed, but on appeal a community service order of forty hours was made. That offence was committed on 23 November 1997. 
    29   Despite the criminal convictions of the applicant to which I have referred, he was, at the time that he came before Judge Grogan for sentence, employed permanently as a flagman by the State Rail Authority and, apparently, he was highly regarded by his employer. 
    30   Subjective considerations are that the applicant does not have the benefit of a plea of guilty. He clearly stood to gain and may well have gained by the threats which he made to potential witnesses. There was the concatenation of offences to which I have referred. There was the aggravating circumstance that the third offence was committed whilst he was on bail caused for the first two offences, and also whilst on bail for the deception charges. Such an abuse of bail attracts a severe punishment, for which the case of R v WHS, Unreported, NSWCCA, 27 March 1995, is a well-known authority. 
    31   I might add that a Victim Impact Statement by Ms Gruszka contained disturbing material in relation to the serious emotional consequence the intimidation which she suffered at the hands of the applicant caused her. His Honour did, however, expressly state that he was not imposing a heavier sentence than otherwise he would have imposed, by reason of the contents of that statement. 
    32   As one might well have expected, Ms Gruszka achieved a much lower overall result in her Higher School Certificate examinations in 1997 than she would otherwise have expected, due, she clearly believed, to the emotional trauma that she suffered at the hands of the applicant, trauma that required psychiatric treatment. The lower than anticipated result in her Higher School Certificate deprived her, so she believed, of the opportunity of entering into the university faculty which she had in mind. 
    33   It is troubling that offences against the administration of justice in this State are not as infrequent as one would have hoped. The reference to earlier authorities demonstrates this fact. It must never be forgotten that the proper administration of justice is a fundamental element in our democratic system of government. Prospective witnesses should be able to present themselves at Court and give their evidence truthfully without fear of prior intimidation and/or subsequent retaliation. It goes without saying that intimidation of witnesses, such as occurred in this case, was an intolerable abuse of the administration of justice and called upon his Honour to impose condign punishment. 
    34   To my mind, balancing the subjective and the objective circumstances, I am quite unable to conclude that the sentences imposed were in any way outside the sentencing discretion available to his Honour. His Honour allowed for an extended period of rehabilitation, having found that special circumstances existed. Bearing in mind the youth of the applicant, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
    35   HIDDEN J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Acting Justice Carruthers.

     JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1    BELL J:  On 15 December 1999 I made orders quashing the appellant’s convictions and sentences on each of four charges which had been dealt with in the District Court pursuant to Pt 10 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (“the Act”) as it then stood. The appeal was brought under ss 5AD and 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which, relevantly, provide that the power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to hear and determine appeals in respect of convictions (and sentences) imposed pursuant to the exercise of jurisdiction under Pt 10 of the Act is to be exercised by a single judge as the Chief Justice may direct. 
     
      
    2    I now give my reasons for making those orders.  
     
      
    3    On 8 March 1999 the appellant appeared for trial in the District Court sitting at Broken Hill. He was jointly arraigned with Anthony Craig Boston upon an indictment charging him with the supply of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) being not less than the commercial quantity of the same contrary to ss 25(2) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The appellant pleaded guilty upon his arraignment. The proceedings were stood over to 9 March 1999 for submissions on sentence.  
     
      
    4    During the course of the sentence proceedings the court was invited to deal with certain outstanding offences with which the appellant had been charged at the time of his arrest. There was discussion as to the appropriate mechanism by which these matters might be disposed of. Ultimately it appears that the four matters were dealt with pursuant to the provisions of Pt 10 of the Act. Mr Craigie, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, contended that the court did not have jurisdiction so to do.  
     
      
    5    It is to be noted that the Act has been amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999. The provisions governing the circumstances in which back-up and related offences may be dealt with by the Supreme and District Courts are now contained in Pt 2 Div 4 of the Act.  
     
      
    6    The appellant and his co-accused were arrested on 28 July 1998 in a room at the Crystal Motel, Broken Hill. A quantity of methylamphetamine was located by police during a search of the room. The police also searched a Ford Falcon sedan which was parked outside the motel room. A quantity of .22 calibre ammunition and a .22 calibre rifle was located during the search of the vehicle. The vehicle was registered in the appellant’s name.  
     
      
    7    The appellant was charged with a number of offences (in addition to the charge of supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) possess firearm without licence contrary to s 7(1) of the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) fail to take precaution to ensure safekeeping of firearm contrary to s 39(1) of the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) possess ammunition without licence contrary to s 65(3) of the  
        Firearms Act  
        1996; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) fail to pay for accommodation supplied at inn contrary to s 9 of the  
        Innkeepers Act 
         1968. 
        
       
      
    8    Offence (1) above may be dealt with summarily or on indictment. It is an offence listed in Table 2 of Pt 9A of the Act and, as such, is to be dealt with summarily unless the prosecuting authority elects otherwise. If dealt with summarily it carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or a fine of 50 penalty units. The matters referred to in (2), (3) and (4) are summary offences within the meaning of the Act. As at 8 March 1999 all four charges were pending in the Local Court at Broken Hill. No issue has been taken but that each constituted a “related offence” within the meaning of s 34(1) (now s 35(1)) of the Act.  
     
      
    9    The transcript of the sentence proceedings suggests that there was some confusion in the minds of the legal representatives of both the Crown and the appellant as to the mechanism by which these outstanding charges might be dealt with by the sentencing judge in the District Court. Thus, at the outset of proceedings on 9 March the Crown Prosecutor is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “My friend has just told me something. I don’t think he has any objection to me relaying what it was. He has indicated that his client may wish to ask your Honour to take into account certain summary matters. That is to say he proposes to plead guilty to a number of offences with which he is charged” (T2). 
        
       
      
    10    The Crown Prosecutor’s reference to asking the sentencing judge to take summary matters into account might have been thought to be a reference to the procedure provided under s 21 of the Act (now s 161) which permits the court, if it thinks fit, to take into account all or any offences set out in a document filed in the court. The document is to be in the form prescribed. The Criminal Procedure Regulation 1995 makes provision for the form of the document. It is therein described as a Form 1. Prior to the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act provision was made in s 447B of the Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed) for a person found guilty of an offence charged on indictment (not punishable by penal servitude for life) to ask the court to take into account any or all offences specified in a list set out in a document filed in court. That document was to be in or to the effect of the form contained in the Ninth Schedule to the Crimes Act 1900. This explains the continuing tendency for practitioners to refer to the procedure under s 21 as “dealing with matters on a schedule”. The procedure under s 21 permits the court to take the offences set out in the document into account in passing sentence for the offence prosecuted on indictment for which the prisoner has been found guilty. The sentence imposed in respect of the indictable offence may be greater than would have been appropriate had it stood alone. However, it may not exceed the maximum sentence available in respect of the indictable offence (s 21(3)) (now s 161(3)). No conviction is recorded in respect of an offence specified in the Form 1 document and taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the Act.  
     
      
    11    The sentencing judge sought to clarify upon what basis he was being invited to deal with the four outstanding matters. He asked if the Crown was seeking to proceed by way of a schedule. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there were two options available and he then referred the court to s 34 (now s 35) of the Act. He indicated that it was the Crown’s preference for the matters to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Pt 10 of the Act. The appellant’s counsel asked for the matters to be put on a schedule. The Crown Prosecutor expressed his concern as to any disposition of the matters in accordance with s 21 of the Act in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think I would be opposed to the form 1 document because the record would, at a later time, be meaningless, four further counts taken into account behind a drugs matter might suggest that they were in some way supply or possession of a drug. I think I would probably be in a position to uplift the informations, that is to say the charge sheets which would be pending before the Local Court here at Broken Hill, and place them before your Honour” (T3). 
        
       
      
    12    The submission that the appellant’s record would be meaningless should the s 21 procedure be adopted seems to me to be somewhat misconceived. Had the four offences been taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the Act the appellant’s record would reflect that fact. There could be no warrant for any presumption that the charges listed on the Form 1 document were matters related to the possession or supply of prohibited drugs. The nature of the matters taken into account pursuant to s 21 of the Act is a matter of record. Section 23(7) (now s 163(7)) allows proof that an offence was taken into account under s 21 in the same manner as the decision in respect of which it was taken into account.  
     
      
    13    In the event, the transcript of the proceedings shows that the appellant’s counsel thereafter consented to the matters being dealt with in accordance with the procedure contained in Pt 10 of the Act. Part 10 was inserted into the Act by the Criminal Procedure Legislation (Amendment) Act 1990. Provision was made under that Part for both “back-up offences” and “related offences” to be dealt with in the Supreme or District Court in certain circumstances. Back-up and related offences are summary offences or indictable offences which are capable of being dealt with summarily by a Local Court in accordance with Pt 9A of the Act. Back-up offences are offences which are to be prosecuted upon the same facts as the indictable offence and all the elements of which are common to the indictable offence (s 34). Related offences are offences which arise from substantially the same circumstances as those from which the indictable offence arose but do not include back-up offences (s 34).  
     
      
    14    Under s 34A (now s 36) provision is made on committal for trial of a person charged with an indictable offence for the prosecuting authority to inform that court of whether the accused has been charged with any back-up or related offence and, in the event that he or she has been so charged, to produce to the court a certificate specifying each charge. It is to be noted that a reading of the transcript of the proceedings does not suggest that a s 34A certificate was before the sentencing court. Rather, it appears that during the course of proceedings on 9 March 1999 the Crown Prosecutor (or some person acting at his direction) uplifted the original charge sheets in respect of the four offences from the Registry of the Local Court and that these were then tendered (as Exhibits 13A-D) in the sentence proceedings before the District Court.  
     
      
    15    At the conclusion of the proceedings on 9 March 1999 the sentencing judge purported to record convictions in respect of each of the four charges and to impose sentences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Offence (1) 
         - a fixed term of six months imprisonment to commence on 28/10/2000 and to expire on 27/4/2001; 
        
       
       
        
        Offence (2) 
         - a fixed term of three months imprisonment to commence on 28/4/2001 and to expire on 27/7/2001; 
        
       
       
        
        Offence (3) 
         - fined $500 and allowed 28 days to pay; 
        
       
       
        
        Offence (4) 
         - fined $55 and allowed 28 days to pay. 
        
       
      
    16    The fixed term sentences imposed were, as to offence (1), cumulative upon the minimum term of two years and three months imprisonment imposed with respect to the supply drug conviction and, as to offence (2), cumulative upon the sentence imposed in respect of offence (1).  
     
      
    17    The appellant submitted that the accumulation breached the limitations imposed upon the sentencer by s 444(4)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 36(3) (now s 38(3)) provides that in sentencing a person in respect of a back-up or related offence the court is subject to the same restrictions as a Local Court constituted by a magistrate. The Crown conceded that the sentence imposed in respect of offence (2) contravened the provisions of s 444(4)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. In the light of the view I took as to the challenge to the appellant’s convictions it was not necessary to deal further with this aspect. 
     
      
    18    Section 35 of the Act (now s 37), relevantly, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence, a court finds the accused person guilty of the offence, the court: 
        
       
       
        
        (b) may deal with any … related offence with which the accused person has been charged in accordance with this Part.” 
        
       
      
    19    In the instant case the appellant was committed for trial on the charge of supply of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. Upon his arraignment he entered a plea of guilty. Mr Craigie submitted that the proceedings thereafter were not proceedings “at the conclusion of the trial of an accused person for an indictable offence” within the meaning of s 35. The Crown did not seek to contend the contrary. In written submissions the Crown put it this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown concedes that in the absence of concluded ‘trial’ proceedings his Honour was without jurisdiction to dispose of the summary offences pursuant to Part 10 of the Act. 
        
       
       
        
        It is apparent from the provisions of Part 10 of the Act that that Part applies only to the disposition in the District Court of outstanding summary matters (being either ‘back up offences’ or ‘related offences’) following the conclusion of contested ‘trial’ proceedings. Such a construction is made plain by the terms of s 36 of the Act and also by the Attorney’s Second Reading Speech introducing Part 10 of the Act …”. 
        
       
      
    20    Section 36 (now s 38) provides that the court is to deal with the related offence without a jury “on the basis only of evidence given during the trial of the accused person for the relevant indictable offence in the same proceedings and additional evidence given under this section” (it is to be noted that both the prosecutor and the accused may, by leave, adduce additional evidence in relation to the related offence).  
     
      
    21    Generally, it was the Crown’s submission that the terms of s 36 make plain that the purpose of the Pt 10 procedure was to admit of the efficient disposition of back-up and related offences where the facts necessary for determination have been canvassed at trial.  
     
      
    22    The Act does not define “trial” either for the purposes of Pt 10 or otherwise. In written submissions the Crown drew attention to a number of provisions which it was said evidenced a distinction maintained throughout the Act between “trial proceedings” and “sentence proceedings”; see s 7 (now s 40) and s 31 (now s 15).  
     
      
    23    At common law there seems to have been some doubt as to the point of commencement of a criminal (jury) trial. The authorities in this regard were reviewed by the Canadian Supreme Court in Basarabas v The Queen (1982) 144 DLR (3d) 115. The court there concluded that the weight of authority supported the view that a trial commences when the accused is placed in the charge of the jury (at 124). As the court noted, the time of commencement of a trial will vary according to the language of any relevant statute governing trial proceedings. In New South Wales the Act makes provision for trial by judge alone. That procedure was introduced into the Act at the same time as Part 10. In trials conducted before a judge alone plainly enough no question of the accused being placed in the charge of a jury arises. Further, s 19 (now s 56) confers jurisdiction on the court with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused is arraigned but before the jury is empanelled. Sub-section (3) provides that the proceedings (prior to the empanelment of the jury) are part of the trial of the accused. These provisions are inconsistent with a view that in New South Wales a criminal trial begins when the accused is placed in the charge of the jury.  
     
      
    24    I note that the contention that at common law a criminal trial begins as soon as the accused is called upon to plead was rejected by the court in Regina v Faderman (1850) 1 Den C.C. 565, 169 ER 375. In the course of argument in that case Baron Parke observed at 567 (ER 376) that “[p]roperly, there is no trial till issue is joined”. An accused by his or her plea of not guilty joined issue with the Crown. An accused who entered a plea of guilty upon arraignment thereby confessed his or her guilt and was liable to be sentenced upon the same; see Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law (edited by JWC Turner, 19th ed, Cambridge University Press, 1966, at 602 and following). 
     
      
    25    Section 395 of the Crimes Act 1900 applied as at the date of the appellant’s sentencing. The Crimes Act provision has since been repealed and a provision in identical terms has been inserted into the Act (s 88). The section provides that if a person arraigned upon indictment pleads “not guilty” thereto he or she is deemed to have put himself or herself “on the country for trial” and the court shall order a jury for his or her trial accordingly. This is consistent with the view expressed in Faderman that the trial does not commence as soon as the accused is called upon to plead but only upon him or her entering a plea of not guilty (or some time thereafter). 
     
      
    26    In this case the appellant pleaded guilty upon his arraignment. It is not necessary to explore what might be embraced by the submission that the Part 10 procedure is only available at the conclusion of ‘contested trial proceedings’. I consider that the subject proceedings did not take place at the conclusion of a trial within the meaning of s 35 and, accordingly, that the court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the four offences pursuant to Pt 10 of the Act. In a case where an accused pleads guilty upon arraignment the provisions of Pt 10 (now Pt 2 Div 4) do not apply and the court does not have the jurisdiction to deal with back-up and related offences other than by means of taking such offences into account on a Form 1 pursuant to s 21(now s 161) of the Act.

     SPIGELMAN CJ HULME J CARRUTHERS AJ Tuesday 8 February 2000 
     
     REGINA v Nabil MRISH 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon Nabil Mrish by his Honour Judge Davidson of the District Court of New South Wales on 11 June 1999. 
     
      
    2    The Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing a firearm contrary to s5 of the Firearms Act 1989. The maximum penalty for that offence is ten years imprisonment. His Honour sentenced the Applicant to a fixed term of eighteen months commencing on 21 May 1999, being the last date of the trial. 
     
      
    3    The Applicant pleaded not guilty to two counts of intentionally perverting the course of justice, contrary to s319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is fourteen years penal servitude. The Applicant was found guilty by a jury on two separate counts. 
     
      
    4    Judge Davidson sentenced the Applicant to a minimum term of two years and three months from 21 May 1999 and an additional term of nine months from 21 August 2001, expiring on 20 May 2002, with respect to the first count on this second indictment. On the second count he sentenced the Applicant to a fixed term of two years from 21 May 1999, expiring on 20 May 2001. 
     
      
    5    On 7 February 1995 the Applicant was arrested with respect to the two charges of perverting the course of justice. During the course of the execution of a search warrant on his home on that day a firearm, together with ammunition for it, was discovered. The two counts of perverting the course of justice arose from the Applicant's conduct with respect to a charge against his brother, George Mrish. The charge was that he, together with a Henry Blunden, had murdered two persons, Mr and Mrs Dresler. 
     
      
    6    In March 1994 Henry Blunden died in gaol, allegedly at the hands of George Mrish, who never came to trial on that charge because, following his conviction for the murder of Mr and Mrs Dresler, George Mrish committed suicide in gaol. 
     
      
    7    During his period in gaol awaiting trial George Mrish met a man named Jason Smith who purported to be able to obtain firearms and confidential information, including information about the whereabouts of particular persons. After Jason Smith was released from gaol the Applicant approached him with a view to obtaining firearms and, also, obtaining addresses of certain witnesses against his brother, some of whom were in witness protection schemes. 
     
      
    8    Conversations between the Applicant and Jason Smith were recorded on listening devices attached to Smith. His Honour found as a fact that the Applicant was seeking the addresses for the purposes of intimidating the witnesses and that at least one of the firearms which he sought to obtain from Mr Smith was also intended by him to be used for the purposes of intimidating witnesses in the trial against his brother. The first count on the indictment for perverting the course of justice related to these events. 
     
      
    9    The second count of perverting the course of justice involved attempts by the Applicant to intimidate Sandra Blunden, the wife of his brother's co-accused, who was a prospective witness in his brother's trial. His Honour found as a fact that the appellant did intimidate her, first by sitting in a car and observing her house on numerous occasions; secondly, by following her when she went in her car to her girlfriend's house on one occasion and to a restaurant on another; thirdly, after she moved her home, by presenting himself at an exhibition home which was being built next door to her new home and taking a video of the premises. His Honour found that this conduct did put Sandra Blunden in fear and that the Applicant undertook this conduct with the intent to pervert the course of justice. 
     
      
    10    In the course of his reasons on sentence his Honour made reference to the broken period of custody which the Applicant had served prior to the trial, to the fact that the applicant was, until that point, a person without any prior conviction, to the evidence of his prior good character and to other submissions made on behalf of the Applicant, including the significance of his bail conditions over an extended period of time and the element of entrapment involved in the conduct of Mr Smith. 
     
      
    11    His Honour gave particular emphasis to the personal family situation of the Appellant and, in particular, the tragic history in relation to the eldest child of the marriage, which his Honour found to be: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A situation which has placed and will continue to place a serious burden on both of you in looking after and caring for that child in her affliction."" 
        
       
      
    12    His Honour found that these circumstances, together with other personal aspects, constituted ""exceptional circumstances"" which could justify taking hardship to others into account in determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    13    The offences of which the Applicant was convicted are serious offences and his Honour said so. In particular, the element of intimidation and threatened violence involved in the conduct leading to the conviction for perverting the course of justice constituted a substantial attack on the integrity of the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    14    The sentences ultimately imposed by his Honour would, by many standards, be regarded as lenient. There is no warrant, in my opinion, for any further leniency. Even if, contrary to the conclusions to which I have come, there was any basis for properly interfering with his Honour's exercise of the sentencing discretion and the discretion to be exercised again in this Court, I would not have imposed any lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour. As his Honour said, ""This was indeed a serious case of its kind"". 
     
      
    15    One of the submissions made on behalf of the Applicant was that the sentence was excessive. Reference was made to the fact that according to the nineteen cases listed under s319 of the Crimes Act in the Judicial Commission Statistics, no offender received a minimum or fixed term of more than two years. Reliance was placed in this respect on the fact that the Appellant's minimum term of two years and three months should be understood in the context of the period in excess of fourteen months which the Applicant had served in custody prior to the trial. 
     
      
    16    The Judicial Commission Statistics indicate that some 16% of the limited sample were in fact sentenced to minimum fixed terms of 24 months; only three months less than the Applicant. However, those cases would, similarly, not reflect any prior custody, unless the sentence was back-dated at the time it was imposed. 
     
      
    17    There is no warrant on the basis of the Judicial Commission Statistics to conclude that the sentence in this particular case was excessive, let alone so excessive as would justify the interference by this Court. His stalking of Mrs Blunden was deliberate and terrifying. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    18    The Applicant submitted that his Honour failed to address the question of special circumstances under s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989, and accordingly fell into error. It was submitted that a number of factors indicated special circumstances, including the prior custody served in broken periods, the fact that he had no prior history and the various personal family circumstances to which his Honour referred as identifying ""exceptional circumstances"" which justified taking into account on sentence the impact of imprisonment upon his family. 
     
      
    19    The first of these factors has been identified as capable of constituting special circumstances (see Close (1992) 65 ACrimR 55 at 60). I do not see that the fact that he had no prior criminal history could be so regarded. The third aspect of exceptional circumstances had already been taken into account by his Honour, expressly, in fixing, by way of reducing both the total and the minimum term. 
     
      
    20    In the circumstances of the case, none of the three matters, either alone or cumulatively, would justify a departure from the statutory relationship. It is most unlikely that a judge as experienced as Judge Davidson would overlook this consideration. In my opinion, nothing in the evidence indicates that the additional term should exceed one-third of the minimum term. 
     
      
    21    The submissions in this Court appeared to proceed on the erroneous assumption that ""special circumstances"" exist if there is some circumstance which would justify a lower minimum term. The statutory formula directs attention at circumstances which would justify a larger proportionate additional term. (See R v Gray, NSWCCA (unreported) 17 March 1993, per Hunt CJ at CL). 
     
      
    22    None of the matters pointed to, in my opinion, would do so in the present case. In any event the Court should not intervene in such a way as to reduce further the minimum term where the judge has already displayed considerable leniency in sentencing the Applicant and fixing the minimum and fixed terms. 
     
      
    23    The final submission was that his Honour failed to take into account in an appropriate manner the time spent in custody. It was submitted that a new concept of ""an effective sentence"" was to be computed in terms of adding pre-verdict custody to the sentence imposed so that the minimum term was to be computed by adding the time spent in custody to the minimum term then imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    24    It was then submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is clear from the structure of the sentences his Honour imposed that he intended that the statutory relationship between the minimum term and additional term should be maintained."" 
        
       
      
    25    There is no such suggestion in his Honour's reasoning. This submission is entirely without merit or foundation. 
     
      
    26    On no less than four occasions in his reasons for judgment his Honour made reference to the fact that he had expressly taken into account the period in custody before conviction. This would be a reference to both the fixing of the minimum term and of the total term. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I also take into consideration the fact that you have already spent in broken periods a total of fifteen months and four days in custody solely in respect of these offences."" (Page 8.1) 
        
       
       
        
        ""I take into consideration of course your previous custody."" (Page 9.8) 
        
       
      
    27    His Honour made a reference to ""a further period of incarceration ..."" (page 10.9) and finally, 
     
      
       
        
        ""In imposing those sentences I have taken into consideration the fact that you have served over fourteen months in custody and I have approached the sentences on a totality basis."" (Page 11.8) 
        
       
      
    28    His Honour took into account in this express way the prior custody. It affected his Honour's formulation of both the total and minimum terms. The factor cannot be related only to the minimum term. The submission based on an artificial addition of prior custody and of the minimum term as actually imposed, as a foundation for a suggestion that his Honour had inadvertently varied the statutory relationship, is devoid of merit. 
     
      
    29    In my opinion leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISION BELL J FRIDAY 17 DECEMBER 1999 070007/98 - REGINA v STUART JOHN HOWARD SENTENCE 1    HER HONOUR: On 6 December 1999 Stuart John Howard was arraigned before me on an indictment charging him that on 15 November 1997 at Greenacre he did murder Shane Usher. He entered a plea of not guilty and a jury was duly empanelled. On 10 December 1999 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2    The prisoner was aged thirty-one at the date of the offence. He had been friendly with the deceased, who was also aged in his early thirties, for about two and a half years. Both were living with their respective de facto partners in a block of units at 23 Marlene Crescent, Greenacre. 
     
      
    3    Around June 1997 there was a deterioration in the relationship between the two men. The deceased borrowed a guitar belonging to the prisoner's partner, Colleen Lyons. Some time later the prisoner came to learn that the guitar had been pawned by the deceased. Further, the deceased had borrowed some money from Ms Lyons, the bulk of which had not been repaid. 
     
      
    4    The deceased's younger brother, Jamie McCissock, was then on friendly terms with the prisoner. Again, around mid-1997 Jamie had a falling out with his older brother and moved into the prisoner's flat. It appears that the prisoner considered that the deceased had treated Jamie and his partner, Crystal, shabbily. A combination of these matters led the prisoner to develop a growing resentment towards the deceased. 
     
      
    5    On the evening of Saturday, 15 November 1997, the prisoner telephoned Jamie McCissock. He had not seen Jamie for the past fortnight and appears to have been somewhat annoyed that Jamie had resolved his differences with the deceased. During the course of this telephone call the prisoner made reference to his dispute with the deceased. During the course of the trial there was some controversy concerning the content of this call. Jamie and Crystal gave an account that the prisoner had made some unspecified threat towards the deceased by reference to a gun. The prisoner denied making any threats or referring to a gun. He agreed in the course of his evidence that when the deceased called to his home later that night he, the deceased, had asked, ""What's this I hear about a gun?"" I accept that some reference was made to a gun in the course of the call. It does not appear that the threat was taken seriously by Jamie McCissock or by the deceased. However, it prompted the two of them to call to the prisoner's home later that evening. 
     
      
    6    At about 10.30pm Jamie McCissock and the deceased knocked at the prisoner's front door. The prisoner called out asking who was at the door. McCissock replied, ""It's Jamie"". The prisoner opened the door and the deceased forced his way into the premises knocking the prisoner to the floor. At that point the deceased was in an aggressive mood. He threatened the prisoner saying words to the effect, ""If you don't stop threatening us we are not the ones going to be hurt, it is you"". Jason Post, an old friend of the prisoner, was also present. The deceased turned to Post and said, ""Sit the fuck down or I""ll kill you too"". Shortly after this things appeared to calm down somewhat. The deceased walked over to Post and shook him by the hand speaking to him in quite friendly terms. The prisoner had regained his feet by this stage. There appears to have been some brief discussion concerning the debt owed by the deceased to the prisoner. The prisoner walked to his kitchen, picked up a carving knife and returned to the lounge area of the flat. He was observed by both Jamie McCissock and Jason Post to run towards the deceased and to stab him. 
     
      
    7    The deceased suffered two stab wounds, one to the left chest which penetrated to a depth of 14.5 centimetres and severed the aorta. This was the fatal wound. A second wound was sustained in the region of the front left shoulder. This penetrated to a depth of 13 centimetres. Neither of the witnesses saw more than one apparently deliberate stab wound. The deceased collapsed shortly after the infliction of the wound. 
     
      
    8    The prisoner ran from the unit. He appears to have been in a state of considerable distress. He ran some distance to a hotel. He made a reverse charge telephone call to his father who lived in a suburb not far away. He caught a taxi to the father's home. By this time police were waiting at the family home and the prisoner was arrested. At the time of his arrest he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where's my Dad? I'm sorry Dad, please forgive me. I didn't mean to do anything. I didn't mean to do it. You don't know the pressure I've been under. I've been under pressure. If they understood the pressure I've been under lately. It's not my fault. I didn't mean to stab him. I love Shane, I would never mean to hurt him. Please have mercy Dad. Have mercy. Have mercy Dad. I wish I could have swapped with you Dad and gone to war and been killed. I wish I could replay my life"". 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    9    The prisoner was interviewed in the early hours of the following morning. Generally, in that interview he gave an account that he had been under a great deal of pressure in the weeks leading up to the killing. He could not explain the stabbing beyond asserting he had lost control in consequence of these pressures. He also spoke of being in fear of the deceased. In this regard he commented on the deceased's appearance. The deceased had a mohawk style of haircut with his head closely shaved at the sides. He was wearing army camouflage pants. It appears that the prisoner had not seen the deceased sporting this hair style and it had caused some added alarm when the deceased burst into the unit that night. 
     
      
    10    The prisoner denied having any intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. Indeed, although he accepted that he had been responsible for the infliction of both stab wounds, it was his account that he did not remember the stabbing. 
     
      
    11    Manslaughter (as an alternative to murder) was left both upon the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act, in the event that the jury had a doubt as to the proof of the intent for murder, and provocation. Mr Wetmore, who appears for the prisoner, accepts that the proper basis for me to approach sentence is that the prisoner's culpability for murder was reduced to manslaughter by provocation. To my mind that is clearly so. 
     
      
    12    I should note that both in his interview with the police and in evidence the prisoner described an incident in August 1997 in which the deceased had called him out of his flat and threatened him. This arose in the context of some concern on the deceased's part that the prisoner had made a slighting remark about the deceased's de facto partner. 
     
      
    13    The deceased was the father of Tynan and Melanie. At the time of his tragic death his partner, Michelle Dawes, was seven months pregnant. She subsequently gave birth to a son, Anthony. A Victim Impact Statement signed by Ms Dawes and dated 14 December 1999 was tendered at the sentence hearing. Ms Dawes speaks movingly of the terrible loss that she and members of the deceased's family have all suffered. The Court extends its sympathy to them in their loss. I have regard to the observations of the former Chief Judge at Common Law concerning the receipt of Victim Impact Statements pursuant to s 23C(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. I adopt that approach in the instant case. 
     
      
    14    The prisoner gave evidence at his trial. He raised his good character which was not the subject of challenge. He has one prior conviction for an offence committed when he was a child. I put that to one side for present purposes. He comes from a supportive and loving family. His father gave evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    15    The prisoner left school at the end of Year 11. He obtained an apprenticeship studying mechanics. He then went on to obtain his trade certificate. However, working as a mechanic was not to his liking. He moved into employment in the spare parts industry. At the time of his arrest he was working for Purnell Motors Ltd.  
     
      
    16    Generally, in the years since leaving school, he has been gainfully employed. He lived at home with his parents until he was aged about thirty. He then moved out of home in order to commence living with his de facto partner, Ms Lyons, in the Marlene Crescent unit. He appears to have maintained regular contact with his parents both of whom are elderly and in poor health. 
     
      
    17    Mr Birkinshaw, who has been a neighbour of the Howard family for some forty years, provided a reference for the prisoner. He has known the prisoner throughout his lifetime. He attests to the generally good reputation the prisoner enjoys within the community as a hard working, courteous and pleasant individual. The prisoner is described by Mr Birkinshaw as having demonstrated a great sense of civic responsibility. The Vlahadamis family also provided a reference attesting to the prisoner's non-violent disposition. The family has lived as neighbours of the Howard family for some twenty-one years. Mr Burgess, in a reference dated 4 December 1999, speaks of the close knit nature of the Howard family. He has known the family since 1978. The prisoner, who is one of three children, is described as having grown up in a family with a strong sense of traditional family and social values. Mr Burgess comments favourably on the prisoner's close bond with his two year old son, Brendan. 
     
      
    18    At the time of his commission of the offence, the prisoner's partner, Ms Lyons, was pregnant. The child, Brendan, was born following the prisoner's arrest. The prisoner was held in custody from the date of his arrest until his release on bail on 24 December of that year. It was a condition of his bail that he reside with his parents. The relationship with Ms Lyons has come to an end in consequence of the commission of the subject offence. However, as I have already noted, the prisoner maintains a close level of contact with his son. 
     
      
    19    The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that prior to the first occasion when this matter was set down for trial, Mr Greenhill SC, who then appeared for the prisoner, had indicated on his client's behalf a willingness to plead guilty to manslaughter. The Crown determined not to accept that offer and the prisoner was, accordingly, indicted for murder. I take into account the timely indication of a willingness to plead guilty to an offence for which the prisoner was convicted. He is entitled to some benefit both for the contrition which I accept the plea evidences and on account of the utilitarian considerations which favour some discount in sentence upon a plea. In this regard I take into account the observations of the court in R v Oinonen [1999] NSW CCA 310. 
     
      
    20    I consider the prisoner is a person with good prospects of rehabilitation. He has employment skills and a background of family support. I do not consider that there are special circumstances in this case justifying a departure from the proportion as between the minimum term and additional term provided in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 
     
      
    21    I consider the prisoner has shown remorse for his offence. The most telling evidence of this appears in passages in the recorded interview together with his apparent distress during that interview. There are a number of subjective features which favour the extension of some leniency to the prisoner in the circumstances of this case. I have referred to those in the course of these reasons. Taking those matters into account, the sentence I impose must nonetheless reflect the seriousness of the unlawful taking of a human life:  R v Macdonald (unreported, NSW CCA, 12 December 1995). 
     
      
    22    The prisoner was taken into custody on 16 November 1997. He was released on bail on 24 December 1997. He has thus spent thirty-eight days in custody in relation to this offence. I intend to structure the sentence in order to give the prisoner full credit for this period of custody. 
     
      
    23    I consider an appropriate minimum term to be one of five years penal servitude. I propose to reduce that term by thirty-eight days in order to reflect the pre-sentence custody. Accordingly, the sentence I impose will commence on 10 December 1999 and expire on 2 November 2004. I specify an additional term of one year and six months to commence on 3 November 2004 and to expire on 2 May 2006.

     REGINA v Peter Malcolm WATSON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The appellant was originally indicted on two counts before the District Court. The first count was a charge that the applicant had supplied a prohibited drug not less than a large commercial quantity, the drug being methylamphetamine. The second being framed in the alternative being an allegation that he supplied a prohibited drug not less than a commercial quantity, the drug being the same. 
     
      
    2    In the event the jury found him guilty of the alternative count while not guilty of the first count. 
     
      
    3    The learned trial judge sentenced him to a minimum term of six years and an additional term of two years. The maximum penalty for the alternative count pursuant to s 25(2)/33(3) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, is imprisonment for twenty years or a fine of 3,500 penalty units or both. 
     
      
    4    The Crown case may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    5    An undercover police operation was initiated at the beginning of 1992. During this operation an undercover police operative who was known as “Neil Davies” approached the appellant’s co-accused Dick Garner in relation to a purchase of a quantity of methylamphetamine. He met Garner in February 1992. Between February and 30 April that year Davies had several conversations (both in person and over the telephone) with Garner about purchasing drugs. The police obtained warrants to tape Garner’s phone line at 1101 Alamein Avenue, North Albury. The telephone conversations between Garner and the appellant, as well as conversations between Garner and Davies were recorded by a telephone intercept and six of those tapes were tendered at trial. 
     
      
    6    In a conversation which took place on 1 May 1992 and was recorded on tape, Davies inquired about buying some “speed” and Garner responded that he would need “12 and a half” thousand dollars for a pound and added “you want three” meaning three pounds of speed. In another conversation on 3 May 1992, which was recorded on tape, Garner referred to the purchase price for three pounds, that is $37,500. The transaction was to take place on Wednesday, 6 May 1992. 
     
      
    7    On 5 May 1992 the appellant was observed in the Oak Hotel in the Albury area by Sergeant Ramsey, who also noted the presence of a red Corvette in front of the hotel. He heard the appellant being addressed as “Windy”. 
     
      
    8    Davies gave evidence that on 6 May 1992 he went to the Wagga Wagga area where he met other police and was fitted with a listening device and a recording device. He was accompanied by another undercover operative “Tony Romano”. At about 3.40 pm the two officers drove to Garner’s premises at 1101 Alamein Avenue, North Albury in a red Holden Commodore. Once they arrived Davies met with Garner and went inside the house. He was taken to the bedroom and given a small bag containing white powder that served as a sample. 
     
      
    9    A short while later, both Davies and Garner were observed leaving the house and driving off in Davies’ red Holden Commodore. While in the vehicle Davies showed the $37,500 to Garner, who then telephoned someone from Davies’ mobile phone and handed the phone to Davies. Davies then had a conversation with a male person whose voice he was unable to identify. That conversation was also recorded, however only the voice of the undercover operative was audible. The mini audio tape of those conversations was tendered. 
     
      
    10    Observations at 313 Olive Street, South Albury commenced at about 2.45 pm on 6 May 1992. Snr Const Jones noticed the appellant standing in the driveway wearing a short sleeved black T-short and blue denim jeans. At 4.12 pm Det Sgt Cook who was conducting surveillance duties, observed a beige Statesman pull up opposite the house. Garner exited the car and entered the premises. At 4.30 pm a brown Ford sedan pulled into the driveway and a male person wearing a blue flanellette checked shirt and blue jeans came out of it and entered the premises. At around 4.50 pm the appellant and an unidentified male person came out of the house and entered the Ford and drive off in a southerly direction. The car was seen by Snr Const Gray driving into the bushland south of Olive Street. 
     
      
    11    Around 5.45 pm the brown Ford returned to Olive Street. The appellant and the unidentified male left the car and were joined by Garner. They went to the rear of the Ford sedan and the unidentified male walked towards the house and out of view. Const Walker gave evidence that he observed the appellant handing something to Garner, but conceded in cross-examination that he did not see Garner holding it when he was crossing the street. Snr Const Jones saw Garner returning to his car, which was parked opposite the premises at 313 Olive Street carrying a package. He described the package as “approximately the size of a house brick and … light in colour”. This evidence was corroborated by Snr Const Gray. 
     
      
    12    Before starting the car Garner appeared to be interfering with the inside of the car door. He then drove his beige Statesman in a northerly direction. The car was followed to Alamein Avenue, North Albury, at which point Sgt Cook returned to 313 Olive Street. He noticed that the premises were in darkness and that both the red Corvette and the brown Ford were gone. Cook also gave evidence that at around 6.45 pm other police officers arrived at the scene. They conducted a search of the premises. At the time there was no one at home. 
     
      
    13    The observations made by the police officers who were involved in the surveillance operation were recorded in a “surveillance log”, which was not able to be located at the time of the trial. 
     
      
    14    At about 5.52 pm on that day Davies received another call on his mobile phone from a male person who told him, “Dick’s coming back with it now”. At about 6 pm he returned to Garner’s house, walked out of the car and went down the driveway where he observed Garner ducking down next to the boot of his beige Holden Statesman. Davies was handed a large clear plastic bag containing white powder, which Garner produced from the boot of his car. 
     
      
    15    At that point police officers attended the scene at Alamein Avenue and arrested Garner and the two undercover operatives. A search warrant was executed. Sgt Leckey took photographs of the inside of the Statesman where some traces of the white powder could still be seen near the kick plate of the driver’s side and also beside the driver’s side of the driver’s seat. Snr Const Thompson, the exhibits officer, took possession of a big plastic bag containing white powder and took it to the Albury police station where the white powder was weighed, recorded and labelled. 
     
      
    16    On 11 May 1992 the powder was analysed and found to weigh 441 grams. A fingerprint examination was also conducted, but no identifiable fingerprints were found on the plastic bags. 
     
      
    17    On 11 February 1993 Det Snr Const Cole and Det Snr Const MacDonald, two officers from the Victorian Drug Squad, came to Sydney and were taken to the Telephone Intercept Unit of Sydney Police by Det Sgt Ramsey. These officers were asked to listen to the cassettes and identify any of the voices and in particular the voice of the appellant. They were able to recognise the voice of the appellant on four of those tapes. The transcripts of these tapes were tendered as exhibits. 
     
      
    18    Both MacDonald and Cole had spoken to the appellant on several occasions prior to February 1993. In his evidence MacDonald said that the subsequent contact with the appellant “reinforced to me that may identification of his voice on those tapes was correct.” During cross-examination he described the appellant’s voice as “a deep guttural type voice”. In the course of cross-examination Cole characterised the voice as “sort of a dull sort of deep voice”. Ramsey had listened to the tapes as well, however in cross-examination he conceded that he could not identify the voice of the appellant on them, despite the fact that he had heard him speak on 5 May 1992 at the Oak Hotel. 
     
      
    19    In 1993 the appellant was extradicted from Victoria and brought to Sydney by Snr Const Bradley. He was then charged with the abovementioned offences. 
     
      
    20    In response the appellant made an unsword statement and called no other evidence. In his statement he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not guilty of this charge. On 5 May I left Melbourne to go to Sydney to a party. On the way I picked up Brian Gibbons from Olive Street. We stopped at a hotel on the way, went to Sydney. The next morning, on 6 May, we left Sydney, returned back to Albury. When we returned, we had some sleep, then had a barbecue in the afternoon. After that, I left Albury and went back to Melbourne. At no stage did I hand a parcel to anyone. I knew Garner through Brian Gibbons, I was introduced by him. My wife’s family are from Albury. I work for John Bell, and everything he said was true. And I ask of you to find me not guilty. Because I am not guilty. Thank you.” 
        
       
      
    21    The appellant raised seven grounds of appeal. I shall deal with them seriatim. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in law in misdirecting and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to the essential ingredients of the offence. 
       
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in law in failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to 
       
       
      (a) common purpose; 
       
       
      (b) joint enterprise; 
       
       
      (c) the ordinary meaning of “supply”; 
       
       
      (d) the evidence relied upon by the Crown as to supply 
       
       
        
        (e) the facts upon which certain inferences set out on pp 31-32 were to be made. 
        
       
      
    22    It is because of some inter-weaving of submissions that it is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    23    To assist the jury his Honour had prepared a document entitled “Essential Elements” which he distributed to the jury. The document encompassed both counts in the indictment. It was in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “’SUPPLY’ - can mean either  
        offering to supply  
        or  
        agreeing to supply 
         as well as  
        actual suppling 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        UNDER COUNT #1: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Time and place of the alleged offence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Identify of the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Correct name of the white powder (methylampheramine). 
        
       
       
        
        4. Existence of an agreement to supply that white powder to Neil Davies. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The weight of the powder which the offender agreed to supply was one kilogram more. 
        
       
       
        
        ALTERNATIVELY UNDER COUNT #2: 
        
       
       
        
        1, 2 and 3. The same as for Count #1. 
        
       
       
        
        4. An actual supply of that white powder to Neil Davies. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The weight of the white powder actually supplied to Neil Davies was 441 grams. 
        
       
       
        
        BY OPERATION OF LAW UNDER COUNT #2: 
        
       
       
        
        If not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the weight of the powder actually supplied was 441 grams but satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it weighed 250 grams or more then guilty on the alternative basis under Count #2.” 
        
       
      
    24    It was submitted that his Honour failed to give a clear direction in relation to count 2 in the manner in which the concepts of common purpose and/or joint enterprise could apply or in which way either of these concepts could apply. 
     
      
    25    Reliance was placed upon what had fallen from Hunt CJ at CL in R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556. There his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where - as in the present case - it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. This Court has been making that point for years, See, for example: Stokes (1990) 51 A Crim R 25 at 35-37; Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 400, and it is a pity that in many trials no heed is taken of what has been said. 
        
       
       
        
        So far as a straightforward joint criminal enterprise is concerned, the jury should be directed along these lines: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amount to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The present of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.” 
        
       
      
    26    It was submitted that there was no presence of the appellant and no evidence of any agreement. 
     
      
    27    His Honour in directing the jury as to inferences upon which the Crown relied said: 
     
      
       
        
        “One of them is that Garner and the accused, Mr Watson, were involved in a joint enterprise, namely having this common purpose, to supply the speed. You might say to yourselves ‘Well, that’s a serious allegation to make. Why can’t we have any better evidence than just drawing an inference?’ You use your common sense again. If it be the case that they were partners in this common enterprise you might say to yourself ‘It might be pretty hard, actually, to get direct evidence of it’, so the Crown says it is asking you to draw the inference that they were in this group of at least two to carry on this sort of activity.” 
        
       
      
    28    His Honour, earlier in his summing up, had directed the jury in terms of the burden of proof relating to the second count as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the first four essential elements under the second count but not the fifth but you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the weight of the powder was two hundred and fifty grams or more then he is guilty under the second count, so that if you find him not guilty under the first count you turn to the second count. If the Crown proves the five essential elements under the second count the answer is guilty.” 
        
       
      
    29    His Honour had also directed the jury in terms of how they should deal with the various elements as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… go back and work on what you might regard as the more substantial matters in dispute between the accused and the Crown such as whether or not Watson is tied up in this, namely essential element number two. Also, whether or not there was a common purpose or a joint enterprise between Watson and Garner. In other words essential element number four.” 
        
       
      
    30    He also directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown asks you to say if you accept that, if you come to that conclusion it is part and parcel or hand in glove with that proposition that Garner, in collecting the bag of white powder from Mr Watson at Olive Street, did so, as the lawyers say, in furtherance of a common purpose or as we might say in every day language as part and parcel of his joint enterprise or common purpose with the accused, and the Crown is saying to you, in effect they want a conviction. They want you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the essential elements in the particular charge they are relying on and they are saying that the net effect of that is they want you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Watson and Garner, and there might have been others, but Watson and Garner certainly, had this - if I can use the every day expression - had this thing going about the supply of speed, and on 6 May they took a particular step to get hold of it to give it from Watson to Garner and for Garner then to give it to Davies in the expectation that he was going to get twelve and a half thousand dollars there and then, back at Alamein Avenue.” 
        
       
      
    31    It must be borne in mind that in Tangye, Hunt CJ at CL commenced his analysis of what needs to be said to the jury in directions concerning joint criminal enterprise by stating that the Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise when it cannot establish, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant was the person who physically committed the offence charged. 
     
      
    32    His Honour in his directions clearly indicated that the Crown needed to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that for the appellant to be convicted the Crown must establish that it was he who had handed the subject package to Garner and that Garner, in turn, handed it to Davies. 
     
      
    33    In these circumstances his Honour did not err in failing either to direct the jury as to essential elements of the offence or in the relevant sense as to the concepts of common purpose or joint enterprise. 
     
      
    34    In relation to the question of supply his Honour adverted to the definition contained in the document entitled “Essential Elements” and reminded the jury that supply could either mean offer to supply or agreeing to supply as well as actually suppling something. 
     
      
    35    In the circumstance in this case I am of the view such a direction was entirely adequate and his Honour did not fall into error. Accordingly I am of the view that the appellant has failed to make out grounds 1 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
       
      (a) His Honour erred in admitting into evidence all or certain of the audio tapes - Ex D (telephone intercepts) and Ex G (listening device tapes) 
       
      (b) His Honour erred in failing to direct adequately or properly as to the tapes Ex D and Ex G. 
       
      
    36    Here it was submitted that evidence given by two policemen purporting to identify the voice of the appellant failed to establish: 
     
      
       
      (a) that they were sufficiently familiar with the appellant’s voice; 
       
      (b) failed to identify any distinctive features of the voice recorded on the subject tapes; and 
       
      (c) that too long a lapse of time had occurred between the last time either officer had heard the appellant’s voice and the time when they listened to the subject recording. 
       
      
    37    In Bulejcik v R (1994-95) 185 CLR 375 McHugh and Gummow JJ observed at 405-406: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since Smith, courts in New South Wales have held that evidence of voice identification is admissible only when the witness is very familiar with the voice or the voice of the accused is very distinctive. R v Brownlowe (1986) 7 NSWLR 461 at 466; R v Corke (1989) 41 A Crim R 292 at 296; R v Brotherton (1992) 29 NSWLR 95. 
        
       
      
    38    In R v Smith, [1984] 1 NSWLR 462 at 477, O’Brien CJ Cr Div said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “evidence of the voice of a person present at a crime as being the same as the voice of the accused can only amount to positive identification where the witness is very familiar with the voice before hearing it at the crime, or that the voice heard at the crime was very distinctive, which means that the witness need not have heard the voice before the crime but heard it as the voice of the accused for the first time after the crime and then noted it to have the same very distinctive features as had the voice at the crime.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39    In my view his Honour in finding that the police had an adequate familiarity with the appellant’s voice did not fall into error. Not only that, in two of the conversations recorded the person whom the Crown alleged to be the appellant made reference, on inquiry from the other person to the state of his father’s health, this reference as it happens and was established in evidence, referred accurately to the state of health of the appellant’s father at the relevant time. When this factor is coupled with the voice identification evidence given by two Victorian police officers there existed a situation in my view where sufficient identification of the subject voice had been made to enable the evidence to go before the jury. 
     
      
    40    The evidence was relevant because the subject conversations shows a preconcert between the parties to the conversations to commit the very offence with which the appellant was charged. This ground must also fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to put as an entity the Crown case and/or the defence case in respect of the second count. 
       
      
    41    It was alleged here that in the summing up his Honour failed to put the appellant’s case as an entity. See R v Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim R 459. 
     
      
    42    The criticism involved his Honour’s method in referring to the appellant’s case when dealing with what he described as an overview of the appellant’s case. The appellant had called no evidence but had made a statement from the dock in which he conceded an association with Garner but denied any involvement in the subject offence. 
     
      
    43    His Honour read that statement to the jury and identified the issue which it raised together with other challenges made to the Crown case in evidence. In my view his Honour put the defence case adequately to the jury. No complaint was made by counsel at the trial to the manner in which his Honour dealt with the appellant’s case and on reading his Honour’s summing up such absence of complaint does not surprise. In my view the appellant has failed to make out this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and failing to direct the jury adequately or properly and separately as to visual identification and voice identification. 
       
      
    44    It was submitted that his Honour failed to direct the jury in accordance with the High Court’s decision in Bulejcik. It was submitted that his Honour failed to identify the jury’s need to consider the distinction of the appellant’s voice; the time which had elapsed between the last time the witnesses had heard the appellant speak prior to listening to the subject tapes; whether sufficient was heard for either witness to be familiar with the voice and other matters relating to the witnesses ability to identify the voice in question. 
     
      
    45    No such objection was taken at the trial. His Honour in directing the jury told them that they needed to take great care in dealing with the voice identification evidence. He told them that they needed to consider: - 
     
      
       
      (a) how often the identifying witness had actually been exposed to the sound of the voice which he claimed to identify in the witness box; 
       
       
      (b) how long it was since the witness had last heard the subject talking; 
       
       
      (c) whether or not there was any particularly distinctive features in the voice that was being identified; 
       
       
      (d) whether it was actually the sound of the voice that was being identified or whether the witness was in effect concentrating on the words being spoken. 
       
      
    46    In my view the directions given were adequate and that this ground also fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The verdicts of the jury as to counts 1 and 2 were inconsistent. 
       
      
    47    Here it was put that the because the jury acquitted the appellant on the first count they must have found that there was no agreement as to the supply of the subject drug. However when one considers the Crown case it was open to the jury to find that they were not satisfied that the appellant was not a party to the agreement with Garner to supply 3 lbs of the subject drug. 
     
      
    48    However, it was also open to the jury to accept the evidence of Davies and the listening devices and surveillance evidence relating to the actual supply of the drug in question. That being so it was open to the jury to convict on count 2 while acquitting on count 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: There was a miscarriage of justice in that the verdict of the jury was not supported by the evidence and was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
    49    This ground was propounded principally on the accumulative effect of the other six grounds. In view of the fact that none of those grounds have been made good this ground must also fail. 
     
      
    50    Accordingly the appeal against conviction in my view should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: Sentence 
       
      
    51    His Honour sentenced the appellant to a minimum term of six years with an additional term of two years. As I have already mentioned, the maximum penalty is a fine of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for twenty years or both. 
     
      
    52    The co-accused, Garner, had been sentenced by another judge for a charge which corresponded to the first count on the indictment presented against the appellant. Garner had received a sentence of five years constructed as to a minimum term of one and a half years and an additional term of three and a half years. 
     
      
    53    At the time of committing the subject offence the appellant was on bail in Victoria in relation to a charge of trafficking in drugs of dependence (including amphetamine). This, of course, is an aggravating feature of the offence and properly should be reflected in any sentence passed. 
     
      
    54    Garner, unlike the appellant, pleaded guilty and was thus entitled to receive leniency following such a plea. 
     
      
    55    Sentence statistics presented to this Court by the Crown indicate that the sentence passed by his Honour upon the appellant was a very high one indeed. 
     
      
    56    While his Honour in his remarks on sentence adverted to the need to take into account parity considerations between Garner and the appellant, the penalty in fact imposed upon the appellant is so far in excess of that imposed upon Garner for a more serious offence that, ex facie, principles of parity in sentencing as adumbrated in the High Court in R v Lowe (1984) CLR 606 per Mason CJ at 610 have been contravened. 
     
      
    57    However, as I have mentioned the fact that the appellant’s offence was committed in circumstances of aggravation and the fact that Garner pleaded guilty are matters which should be taken into account in imposing a sentence upon the appellant. It must also be borne in mind that drug trafficking is an offence which does demand condign punishment. 
     
      
    58    The sentence imposed upon Garner even taking into account the most favourable of subjective circumstances is, ex facie, an extremely lenient one. So lenient that it should not be taken as a yard stick for the proper sentence to be imposed upon the appellant. 
     
      
    59    It must also be borne in mind that the appellant’s part in the transaction in question was a significant one. It was he who brought the drug to Garner. 
     
      
    60    Even taking all these matters into account I am of the view that the sentence passed particularly having regard to the statistics provided to the court is too severe and thus error has been established.  
     
      
    61    For myself I am of the view that a head sentence of six years should be imposed consisting of a minimum term of four years six months and an additional term of eighteen months is appropriate in this case. 
     
      
    62    Accordingly I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Application for leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      2. Appeal upheld 
       
       
      3. Sentence imposed on 20 November 1998 quashed and in lieu thereof a sentence consisting of a minimum term of four years six months commencing from 20 November 1998 and expiring on 19 May 2003 when the appellant will be eligible for release on parole and an additional term of eighteen months commencing on 20 May 2003 and expiring on 19 November 2004. 
       
      
    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 
     
     60732/98 
      
     NEWMAN J SIMPSON J HIDDEN J 21 December 1999 
     
     Regina v WATSON 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    63    SIMPSON & HIDDEN JJ: We have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Newman J, in which the relevant facts are set out. 
     
      
    64    We are unable to agree with his Honour’s disposition of grounds one and three (pars 22 ff of the judgment). The document supplied to the jury, setting out the essential elements of each offence, is reproduced at paragraph 23. It refers to an agreement (between the appellant and Garner) to supply in relation to the first count. However, there is no reference to any such agreement, or to any common purpose or joint enterprise between them, in relation to the second count. Clearly, the existence of a joint enterprise was an essential element of the case against the appellant on that count.  
     
      
    65    It is not clear whether the passage from the summing-up quoted in par 27 of the judgment of Newman J refers to the first count, the second count or both. It must be said that his Honour’s directions tended at times to blur the distinction between them. What is clear is that the passage set out at par 29 was referable only to the first count.  
     
      
    66    It is true that the next passage quoted (at par 30) correctly expresses the basis of the appellant’s liability for the second count, albeit somewhat laconically. The problem remains that the notion of joint enterprise did not find its way into the written outline of directions, which the jury had with them in the jury room. In those circumstances, we could have no confidence that the jury were aware of all the elements necessary to establish that offence. It must not be forgotten that it was the second count of which the appellant was found guilty. 
     
      
    67    It may be that there was abundant evidence from which the jury could have found joint enterprise in relation to that count. However, as it was not referred to in the written directions, it cannot be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. We would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

   IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL  60633/98 Wood CJ at CL Hidden J Smart AJ Monday 20 December 1999 
     
     Headnote 
    The appellant was convicted of 3 counts alleging that, with intent to obtain a financial advantage for a company, she made a statement which was false in a material particular and which she knew to be false. The false statements, which included creating a false impression, were made by her to three banks to obtain and maintain credit facilities and concerned the financial position of Linter Group Ltd of which she was a senior executive and director.Held: (1) The evidence of Mr Travers which showed her knowledge and involvement in the matters in question was admissible despite its prejudicial effect. The danger of unfair prejudice did not outweigh its probative value. Further, as the evidence was directly relevant to a fact in issue it was admissible and ss. 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act were inapplicable. (2) The summing up was not, in the circumstances, inadequate. It put the defence case sufficiently on each count, having regard to the facts in issue.(3) The judge did not impermissibly allow a conclusion as to guilt on one count to flow over to the other counts. He restricted the use of evidence on one count on which a conclusion of guilt had been reached to the consideration of the state of mind of the appellant on the other counts.(4) There was ample material to support the verdict on each count. 
     
      
    (5) The sentences comprising a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 2 years were excessive. This case fell a little short of the worst type of case of this kind which would justify the maximum penalty of 5 years. It was a bad case meriting substantial sentences. Concurrent sentences of 4 years comprising a minimum term of 2 years 3 months and an additional term of 1 year 9 months should be substituted. 
     
      
       
      (6) This case should stand as a stern warning to all company directors and company executives that they cannot simply go along with and implement the decisions of their superiors if their implementation involves them in dishonesty or making false statements to banks or others. Such directors and executives must refuse to engage in such conduct even if the result be that their services are terminated. Although that is hard, it is better than the alternative of a substantial period in gaol. The individual responsibility of each director and executive cannot be over emphasised. They should also realise that the Commonwealth Crown will prepare its case thoroughly making it hard to escape and that any trial is likely to be long and expensive.

       KATY RACHELLE BOSKOVITZ v. THE QUEEN 
       
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Acting Justice Smart. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     
      
    2    HIDDEN J: I agree with Smart AJ. 
     
      
    3    SMART AJ: Introduction  - Mrs. Boskovitz appeals against her conviction by a jury of three counts under s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, that with intent to obtain a financial advantage she made a statement which was false in a material particular and which she knew to be false. She seeks leave to appeal against the severity of concurrent sentences comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years. All 3 counts and statements related to an entry of $240 million cash recorded in the Linter Group Limited (LGL) financial statements for the year ended 31 March 1989. 
     
      
    4    The first count was based on a statement made by her to the Bank of Tokyo of Australia Ltd around 25 August 1989 that that entry represented a deposit of the balance of all available bank loans. The advantage sought was a cash advance facility of $10 million from that bank for Linter Textiles Corporation Ltd (LTCL). 
     
      
    5    The second count was based on a statement made by her to Westpac Banking Corporation around 13 September 1989 that the $240 million cash had been used to fund the takeover of Brick and Pipe Industries Ltd and to retire debt. The advantage sought was bridging finance of $20 million and/or an extension of an existing bill facility agreement of $50 million for LGL. 
     
      
    6    The third count was based on a statement made by her to Chase AMP Bank Ltd around 24 November 1989 that the $240 million was drawn down from Citibank backed financing secured on Tootal shares. The advantage sought was an extension of an existing bill acceptance and discount facility of $20 million from Chase AMP Bank for LTCL. 
     
      
    7    The trial had a number of features. The Crown case was well prepared with a large amount of oral and documentary evidence. The Crown went to the jury on the basis of the appellant’s falsity including creating false impressions, that is making the Banks think that the financial position of LGL was stronger than it was. The Crown endeavoured to and succeeded in negating innocent explanations for what occurred and possible defences. The Crown was put to proof of most facts. The trial was hard fought. The appellant did not give evidence but made an exceptionally long statement (extending over 125 pages) from the dock in which she admitted much of what had been alleged against her and previously not admitted. As a result the issues were narrowed considerably and the judge was able to sum up comparatively briefly. When the jury retired they were given the transcript. 
     
      
    8    At the trial the Crown led evidence as to the corporate history and the operation and financial position of LGL and subsidiary companies, and what they were trying to achieve, the accounts of LGL and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 1989, the corporate structure, the appellant’s role, the statements which she made to the banks to maintain and extend credit facilities and her knowing them to be false. 
     
      
    9    The appellant was a director and an experienced senior executive of LGL and other related companies. She knew the state of the finances of the various companies. She did not determine the strategies of the companies. The directing force was Mr. Abraham Goldberg, a corporate entrepreneur. She implemented his strategies and directions and those of directors and executives senior to her. 
     
      
    10    In about 1980 Mr. Goldberg had taken over a corporation called Entrad Ltd (Entrad). The appellant had been employed by that company for several years prior to the takeover and she continued after the takeover in a senior position. Her responsibilities involved dealing with banks in relation to finance for Entrad and related corporations. In mid-1988 companies controlled by Mr. Goldberg took over LGL, then the largest textile business in Australia, with a sound and profitable textile business employing around 6,000 people and generating a substantial cash income. Shortly after the takeover the appellant became a director of LGL. Her principal duties involved dealing with banks to obtain finance including maintaining and extending credit facilities and moving money around the various companies in the Goldberg and Linter Groups. There were sundry inter company loans. 
     
      
    11    In 1989 the financial position of LGL generally deteriorated. This was due in part to LGL lending hundreds of millions of dollars to a private company in the Goldberg Group called Gibraltar Factors Pty Ltd (Gibraltar). It was used as the internal banker and through it the funds in the Group were shifted. Gibraltar could not repay the loans. On 26 January 1990 LGL was placed in receivership. 
     
      
    12    When in August and September 1989 LTCL and LGL sought credit facilities they needed to and did submit the latest available accounts. The accounts for LGL and its subsidiaries were made up as at 31 March 1989, the close of the financial year for LGL. The balance sheet showed as a current asset, cash in the sum of $240,213 in the consolidated accounts and $220,863 in the LGL accounts. Note 7 to the accounts read: 
     
      
       
        
        “ Consolidated Holding 
         
         Company 
         
         
        Cash held on deposit $220,971 $220,861” 
        
       
       
       
      Not surprisingly this attracted the attention of the banks and caused them to inquire. They were misled as to this by false statements made by the appellant. 
       
       
      The Round Robin 
       
      
    13    This credit had been achieved as a result of quite a number of cheques being circulated around the various companies in the Group on 29 March 1989 and the involvement of 2 companies in the Elders Finance Group in what is colloquially called a round robin. The steps taken and the accounting entries made were: 
     
      
       
      (i) Entrad sought $220 million from Elders Finance & Investment Co. Ltd (Elfic) and by cheque paid it an establishment fee of $220,000 on 28 March 1989. 
       
       
      (ii) On 29 March 1989 a cheque for $220 million was drawn and presented on the Elders Finance Group Account payable to Westpac for a bank cheque payable to Entrad Ltd being the loan from Elfic. At settlement the Westpac bank cheque for $220 million was handed to Entrad which then handed the cheque to Westpac. 
       
       
      (iii) On 29 March 1989 a cheque for $220 million was presented on the Entrad Ltd bank account payable to Westpac for a bank cheque payable to LGL. At settlement the Westpac bank cheque for $220 million was handed to LGL which then handed the bank cheque to Westpac. 
       
       
      (iv) On 29 March 1989 a cheque for $220,000,001.60 was presented on the LGL bank account payable to Westpac for a bank cheque payable to Elders Finance Group Ltd (EFG). At settlement the Westpac bank cheque was handed to EFG by LGL ($1.60 represented the cost of the bank cheque). 
       
       
      (v) On 29 March 1989 a promissory note issued by EFG having a face value of $224,588,054 maturing on 12 May 1989 was handed to LGL. After the settlement the bank cheque payable to EFG was deposited into its bank account. EFG is the parent company of Elfic. 
       
       
      (vi) At the settlement the promissory note issued by EFG was pledged as security for $220 million due to Elfic by Entrad. 
       
       
      (vii) For 28 March 1989 the accounting records of Entrad record the payment of $220,000 to Elfic. 
       
       
      (viii) For 29 March 1989 the accounting records of EFG record the payment of $220 million to Entrad and those of Entrad the receipt of $220 million from EFG. 
       
       
      (ix) For 29 March 1989 the accounting records of Entrad record the payment of $220 million to Gibraltar and those of the latter the receipt of $220 million from Entrad. 
       
       
      (x) For 29 March 1989 the accounting records of Gibraltar record the payment of $220 million to LGL and those of LGL the receipt of $220 million from Gibraltar. 
       
       
      (xi) For 29 March 1989 the accounting records of LGL show the payment of $220 million to EFG for the purchase of the promissory note and those of the latter the receipt of $220 million from LGL. 
       
       
      Thus, $220 million was never available to LGL as it was fully pledged: see para. 6 above. The appellant was involved in the round robin and in making the misleading statements to the banks as to the $240 million. 
       
       
      The Accounts and Asset Quality 
       
      
    14    The Crown contended that the effect of the treatment of these transactions in the accounts of LGL as at 31 March 1989 was to create the false impression in those accounts that LGL had access to $240 million cash when in fact $220 million of this asset was never accessible but fully pledged. 
     
      
       
      Mr. Maxsted, a partner of KPMG and the liquidator of LGL , gave evidence to the effect that the $220 million transaction accounted for most of $240 million cash recorded in the LGL accounts and that there were no other funds available to LGL at the time. The $220 million transaction was not adequately disclosed in the LGL accounts because the promissory note should have been recorded as a receivable in the accounts (and not as cash on deposit) and its unavailability due to the pledge should have been noted. Mr. Laws, a former partner of Price Waterhouse, who had supervised the annual audit of LGL confirmed that a pledge should normally be recorded as a contingent liability. The former financial controller of LGL, Mr. Gale, said that pledged cash was different from free cash and that the offsetting liability arising from a pledge should be reflected in the financial accounts. That is obviously so. 
       
      
    15    Mr. Maxsted said that on the LGL accounts, the $220 million transaction had the effect of reducing the loan from LGL to Gibraltar from $303 million to $83 million and increasing the amount of cash on deposit from $861,000 to over $220 million. This can be verified from an examination of LGL’s accounts ledger and liquidity reports. The summary in graph form in evidence of the LGL ledger in relation to the loan by LGL to Gibraltar shows that in February 1989 the amount of the loan was about $240,000 million and that in March 1989 it was about $60,000. The accounts of LGL as at 31 March 1989 show the amount of the loan from LGL to Gibraltar as $83,844,000. It was classed as a receivable. 
     
      
    16    Mr. Maxsted explained that the description of an asset as cash, rather than a loan, was significant because of the lesser quality of an asset recorded as a loan, particularly a loan to a related company. Mr. Maxsted said that his initial assessment indicated that in January 1990 LGL’s liabilities exceeded its assets by $460 million. A significant part of this deficit was due to the inability of Gibraltar to repay its loan. The total owed by Gibraltar to LGL during the latter half of 1989 was in the region of $500 million. During the latter half of 1989 LGL’s external debt levels were consistently in excess of $600 million. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Knowledge 
       
      
    17    The Crown established the appellant’s knowledge of the $220 million transaction by tendering the minutes of a meeting of directors of LGL on 28 March 1989 at which she was not only present but appointed chairman. That meeting agreed to the arrangements outlined and authorised LGL completing the necessary documents. It authorised the appellant on its behalf to purchase a promissory note issued by EFG with an aggregate value of $220 million. On the same morning she chaired a meeting of the directors of Entrad which authorised the arrangements and the completion of the documents. It also appointed her and her fellow director, Mr. Roy Travers severally as attorneys to execute the required facility letter and other documents. The appellant signed a certificate that LGL was not prohibited by s.230 of the Companies (NSW) Code from giving security to Elfic in respect of financial accommodation being provided to Entrad by Elfic pursuant to a Letter of Offer dated 28 March 1989 from Elfic to Entrad. She signed a letter of 28 March 1989 on behalf of Entrad requesting an advance of $220 million by bank cheque in favour of the company. 
     
      
    18    Mr. Roy Travers was shown as the other director attending both the meetings of directors. He was a solicitor and adviser to Mr. Goldberg and a non-executive director of several companies in the Goldberg group. In evidence Mr. Travers said that he had no involvement in the $220 million transaction and that he neither attended the directors’ meetings nor signed documents which purported to bear his signature. The documents and the evidence of Mr. Travers showed that the appellant was closely involved in implementing the $200 million transaction. She must have appreciated that the pledge of the promissory note was inadequately disclosed in LGL’s accounts. 
     
      
    19    In her dock statement the appellant said: 
     
      
       
      (i) “Now one of the things the $240 million was primarily done for a reason, to shed the best light possible on Linter’s accounts” and 
       
       
      (ii) “… the $220 million was not done for the long term benefit … it was done … to enhance the look of the balance sheet because there was certain people out there to impress.” 
       
       
      She explained that the transaction was done to assist in Mr. Goldberg’s planned takeover of Tootal, a large company based in the United Kingdom with business outlets and interests throughout the world. 
       
      
    20    The appellant asserted and it was not disputed that she did not prepare the offending accounts. The gravamen of the complaints against her was that knowing all about the $220 million transaction and that the accounts created a false impression she made false statements about the entries relating to cash held on deposit. 
     
      
    21    There is one further background matter. On 12 May 1989 the promissory note fell due. On that day LGL, by letter, signed by the appellant, directed that all moneys due and owing to it by EFG under the promissory note be paid that day to Elfic in partial satisfaction of the loan facility granted by the latter company to Entrad. That was done and acknowledged. The outstanding balance of $265,206.27 was paid by Entrad to Elfic. It is not necessary to set out the many accounting entries made in the books of the various companies in the Goldberg Group. 
     
      
       
      Bank of Tokyo Count 
       
      
    22    As to the first count, in June 1989, Mr. Arkins, Senior Management Corporate Banking, Bank of Tokyo and two other senior executives of that bank met with Mr. Deans of LGL and discussed establishing a banking relationship between their companies. LGL was looking for a loan of $20 million. Mr. Arkins met with Mr. Deans and the appellant around 29 June 1989 for further discussions. The financial issues were dealt with by her and the corporate issues by Mr. Deans. She sought a cash advance with a bill option and suggested that the loan be to LTCL. 
     
      
    23    There was a further meeting with the appellant on 6 July 1989 when there was a fair amount of discussion as to the movements in balance sheet items, loans and the amount of cash shown in the balance sheet. By mid-July 1989 the bank had reduced the amount of any loan to $10 million. Approval was sought from the Bank’s Overseas Corporate Financial Division in Tokyo. It wanted the financial statements of the Linter Group which the latter supplied. On 24 August 1989 the Australian Division received a list of questions from Tokyo. Mr. Arkins prepared some questions of his own. One of his questions was “What’s happened to the $240 million cash?” This figure had been taken from the March 1989 financial statement. 
     
      
    24    Mr. Arkins met with the appellant on 25 August 1989. She told him that the bid to take over Tootal had been unsuccessful but that they had made a $20 million profit in that exercise and would be looking at repaying all the bank loans which had earlier been drawn down. Mr. Arkins asked the appellant what had happened to the cash on deposit on 31 March 1989 balance date. She replied that the cash on deposit had been reduced to repay the loans that had earlier been drawn down from all of the banks earlier in the year in relation to the Tootal acquisition. He asked her where the $240 million had come from and she responded that they (LGL and subsidiaries) had drawn down on the available lines of credit which they had with their existing bankers. She stated that the cash on deposit was part of a ploy to indicate to Tootal that their bid was serious and that they had the financial wherewithal to increase their offer if the first offer was not accepted. In the memorandum of 25 August 1989 to the bank’s Tokyo office Mr. Arkins stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, in anticipation of having to possibly increase its bid for Tootal, LGL drew the balance of all available bank lines and placed them on deposit ($240 m). The strategy was apparently part of a ploy which was necessary to disguise to Tootal shareholders, LGL’s liability to accommodate an increase in its pending bid.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant confirmed that this was in substance what she said to Mr. Arkins (T. 1372.15 and 1374.25). There appears to be some conflict between what Mr. Arkins said as to the object of the ploy but, importantly there is no doubt that it was a ploy. She further stated that they no longer needed the cash on deposit and that it had all been used to repay those bank lines so that the cash on deposit figure was basically negligible post that repayment of those loans. That answer was incorrect. The information obtained from the appellant by Mr. Arkins was transmitted to Tokyo. 
       
      
    25    By letter of 29 August 1989 the Bank of Tokyo offered LTCL a $10 million cash advance facility and that offer was accepted on 30 August 1989. A loan agreement was executed and the facility in the full amount was drawn down on 1 September 1989. 
     
      
    26    Mr. Arkins stated that if he had been told that the $240 million reflected a fully pledged promissory note by Linter to meet a slightly greater liability of Entrad to repay Elfic, that there had never been any cash available and a promissory note was used to meet Entrad’s liability to Elfic, the Bank of Tokyo would have been unlikely to proceed with the transaction. There had been a window-dressing exercise which did not truly reflect the financial position of LGL. The bank would also have taken a negative view of the company if he had known that the effect of the transaction was to reduce intercompany debt for a brief period until May 1989 from $340 million to $116 million. This was because the accounts would not portray the true position. He would have made inquiries about the recoverability of the loans to see whether the true value of such assets was as listed. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Westpac Count 
       
      
    27    The second count arose out of negotiations between LGL and Westpac concerning a new bridging facility of $20 million and the extension of an existing bill facility of $50 million. By a facsimile message of 5 September 1989 addressed personally to the appellant, Westpac sought “details on the following items in the audited 31/3/89 financial statements for Linter Group Ltd as soon as possible: 
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Linter Group Limited Consolidated 
        
       
       
        
        What has the cash of $240.2 million been used for?” 
        
       
       
       
      By letter of 13 September 1989 the appellant replied  
      “Since balance date, approximately $125 m of this cash has been used to fund the Brick & Pipe takeover, the balance used to retire debt.” 
       
      
    28    In answer to the request “List of banks included in Bank loans of $416 million and the use these funds were put to” the appellant replied, amongst other things “of these borrowings, $220 m was placed on deposit at balance date.” 
     
      
       
      In answer to the request about Entrad and guaranteeing subsidiaries and as to the increase in total tangible assets of $441 million from $168 million as at 30 June 1989 to $628 million as at 31 December 1989 the appellant replied: 
       
       
        
        “The increase in total tangible assets of $441 m results from 
        
       
       
        
        i) revaluation of investments in Linter Group Limited; 
        
       
       
        
        ii) rationalisation of all intercompany loans through a finance company, i.e. Gibraltar Factors.” 
        
       
       
       
      This was a flow-on effect. The reference to 31 December 1989 related, apparently, to a forecast as at this date. 
       
      
    29    The evidence of Mr. Maxsted (T.448-452) was that $220 million was used to purchase a promissory note and was not cash on deposit, that $125 million was expended on the Brick and Pipe takeover but those moneys came not from the non-existing cash on deposit but from moneys coming back from the failed Tootal bid. None of the $220 million listed as cash was used to retire debt. There was no evidence that there was $220 million placed on deposit at the balance date. The Crown also relied on the true nature of the $220 million transaction. 
     
      
    30    Mr. Myers said (T.305) that if he had known of the $220 million transaction he would have had to reassess the whole position and would have needed further information concerning the recoverability of the loans to Gibraltar. Mr. Tomlin, who during 1989 was a Manager and then Senior Manager, National Accounts, Corporate Division, Westpac said that if he had known of the $220 million transaction this would have affected his credit review of the Group Accounts. That sum was not available as suggested as it was already pledged. The recommendation which he made to the head office credit committee would have changed significantly. Similarly, his credit assessment would have been affected if he had been told that none of the borrowings from the banks had been placed on deposit but were fully drawn down or very nearly fully drawn down. This would mean that there was no cash available. His credit assessment would also have been affected if he had been told that the effect of the $220 million transaction was to reduce inter company loans from a figure of $340 million to $116 million but only to 12 May 1989 on the promissory note maturing (T.1197-1199). 
     
      
       
      Chase AMP Count 
       
      
    31    Count three concerned a false statement made on 24 November 1989 during negotiations with Mr. Brimo and Ms. Panditaratne of Chase AMP Bank Ltd for an extension of an existing $20 million bill facility to LGL. Ms. Panditaratne said that the main purpose of the meeting of 24 November 1989 was to clarify the entries in the financial statements as at 31 March 1989. Some information was missing and there had been significant changes in the accounts from the previous set and the bank wanted to find out what was happening. She recalled Mr. Brimo asking what were the reasons for the high levels of cash balances, intercompany loans and advances and debt. The appellant replied that they (LGL) were going to move on the Tootal acquisition and for that purpose they drew down on a Citibank loan. The cash balance represented the moneys so drawn down. The loan from Citibank was secured by the Tootal shares. Since the balance date the Tootal bid had aborted, the Citibank loan had been repaid and everything had been normalised. She took notes at the meeting and afterwards prepared a memorandum which accurately recorded what had been said (T. 504-508). She said that Mr. Brimo pointed to the sizeable amount of advances to associate companies, other risks and other receivables and asked what they related to and who they were given to. The appellant responded to that question but Ms. Panditaratne’s recollection of it was hazy. 
     
      
    32    In her memorandum Ms. Panditaratne wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Around the close of fiscal 89, Linter was positioning itself for the Tootal takeover and the Citibank back financing (secured on the Tootal shares) was drawndown in anticipation of launching the bid. Therefore, the sizeable $240 m cash balance at FYE 89. The bid having been since aborted the facility has been repaid and cash balances normalised. By 9/5/89 all Tootal shares were disposed of.” 
        
       
       
       
      It was false to state that the $240 million represented a draw down of Citibank financing of the Tootal takeover bid. 
       
      
    33    Mr. Brimo said that at the meeting he sought the reason for the large amount of cash held by LGL in March 1989 and the large level of intercompany loans. According to Mr. Brimo, Mr. Deans made most of the statements on behalf of LGL and the appellant supported his statements by nodding. It was stated on behalf of LGL that the cash was being held to facilitate or actually fund the acquisition of the shares in Tootal. However, when the acquisition did not proceed certain aspects of the financial statements which reflected finances put in place for the acquisition had been unwound. Mr Brimo said that after the meeting he checked the memorandum prepared by Ms. Panditaratne and found it to be correct. He said that he was told by Mr. Deans that after the Tootal bid aborted the cash was used to repay bank facilities and that the shares in Tootal were disposed of. 
     
      
    34    Mr. Brimo stated that in response to his questions Mr. Deans told him that the large level of intercompany loans was due to loans being advanced to subsidiaries within the group acquiring shares in Tootal. When the takeover bid did not proceed the intercompany loans to the subsidiaries were repaid consequent upon the sale of the shares in Tootal. Mr. Brimo said that he asked for interim September 89 financial statements to show that these transactions had taken place. They also wanted the explanations justifying the large upward revaluation of certain assets. Mr. Brimo stated that Chase AMP Bank would be moving away from general working capital financing into more project or cash flow based lending. 
     
      
    35    By letter of 28 November 1989 Ms. Panditaratne advised the appellant of the bank’s information requirement. She wrote that presumably most of the issues would be satisfactorily explained through the interim financials (accounts as at 30 September 1989). It is apparent from reading the evidence of Ms. Panditaratne that she had a preciser recollection than Mr. Brimo. She had written the memorandum. 
     
      
    36    Ms. Panditaratne said that if she had been told that $220 million of $240 million was a pledged promissory note to repay a loan due from Entrad to Elfic and of the transaction involved this would have affected any assessment she made as to the future of the bank’s facility. A promissory note is different from cash and she would have needed details of the pledge. She emphasised the liquidity provided by cash. If she had been told that the effect of the transaction was to raise the item described as intercompany loans by an extra $220 million from $116 million this would have affected her credit analysis. Intercompany advances involve a different risk as they are generally not funds used in the business to which the bank is directly lending. It is hard, if not impossible to make any assessment as to the quality of those assets, the returns to be derived from them and the return or recovery of those funds. She said that if the bank had known of the transaction and its effect instead of the information supplied by the appellant the bank would have re-appraised the credit quality of the company and then possibly looked at if and how the bank could have terminated the bill facility. She accepted that there could have been difficulties in doing that. 
     
      
    37    Mr. Brimo said that if he had been told of the transaction, the bank would have reconsidered the financial statements to determine whether the financial position of LGL was impaired in any way and whether there could have potentially been an event of default. He also said that if he had been told that the effect of the transaction was to reduce intercompany loans from about $340 million to about $116 million this would have set off all sort of alarm bells. This was because the bank was financing ostensibly a textile and garment business and the sudden appearance of a large component of intercompany loans would have raised questions as to what those loans were financing. 
     
      
       
      Other False Statements 
       
      
    38    The Crown sought to use the similar context and content of the false statements as evidence of a co-ordinated course of deception practised by the appellant on LGL’s banks. On this basis the Crown led evidence of another similar false statement by the appellant to Ms. Hui of Citibank on 23 October 1989. It was not the subject of a charge. In response to a question from Ms. Hui as to why LGL still had $240 million cash at bank on 31 March 1989 if it had lent $228 million to Harbour Bridge Holdings, the appellant said that LGL had called on all undrawn lines in case there was an increase in the bid price for Tootal and more funds were required. The appellant added that as the funds were not required they had been used to repay those credit lines. Ms. Hui said that she pressed the appellant further as to any amounts which had subsequently been drawn down and that the appellant ultimately conceded that at least $100 million had been drawn down for working capital purposes by LGL. 
     
      
    39    The falsity of the statements and the appellant’s knowledge were further underlined in an exchange of correspondence between Mr. S. McClay of Elfic and the appellant. By fax dated 11 September 1989 Elfic noted that the cash position as at 31 March 1989 for LGL was reported at $233,469 and asked “What is the current cash position? If it remains at these levels, why is the current additional loan being sought?” The appellant by letter of 13 September 1989 replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “$220 m short deposit 
        
       
       
        
        $18 m prepaid Bond interest due 1/4/89 
        
       
       
        
        Current cash position - nil on deposit.” 
        
       
       
       
       
      Mr Deans 
       
      
    40    By agreement, portion of a statement made by Mr. R.M. Deans to the Australian Securities Commission on 5 June 1999 and portion of his evidence given on 17 July 1992 were read to the jury. He was a former Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd and the former Chairman of LGL, LTCL, Entrad and Dinomino Investments Ltd and an associate member of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accounts. The effect of his evidence was that cosmetic exercises to enhance a company’s balance sheet at the close of the financial year were common and that banks understood this. He gave examples of how the enhancement occurred. 
     
      
    41    Mr. Deans stated that during March 1989 Mr. Goldberg spoke with him by telephone about once or twice per week. Mr. Goldberg wanted about $220 million drawn down as he was sure the moneys would be used in the takeover. The organisation of a transaction was discussed. Mr. Goldberg stated that he had spoken to the appellant about the transaction and would give her instructions. Mr. Deans said that he was told by Mr. Goldberg to keep out of it and to leave it to him. Mr. Deans was generally aware that the appellant and Mr. Goldberg spoke by telephone but not of specific conversations and how frequently they spoke. At some stage either before or after 31 March 1989 the appellant told Mr. Deans that Mr. Goldberg required the transaction to be completed and the facility drawn down by 31 March 1989. 
     
      
    42    Mr. Deans thought that a competent banker would be suspicious of the amount of cash disclosed on LGL’s accounts. The appellant was the person who could and would answer bankers detailed questions about the accounts. 
     
      
    43    According to Mr. Deans he had a heated argument on 18 August 1989 with Mr. Goldberg and other executives of LGL about $220 million being shown in the accounts as a cash item. It was a receivable. He regarded what had been done as unconscionable and said so. Further, it was important that the receivable was fully encumbered. Mr. Deans objected to having to sign the balance sheet, particularly on very short notice. He was placed under much pressure and eventually signed the accounts. It was Mr. Deans’ belief that the accounts which he saw about 3 August 1989 showed the $220 million as a receivable. 
     
      
    44    Mr. Deans believed that the appellant was probably present at the meeting at which he discovered that the $220 million had been changed to a cash item. 
     
      
      Some Funding Details 
       
      
    45    The Crown case was buttressed by further evidence, some of which I will mention briefly. This further evidence was necessary to negate any innocent explanation for what had occurred. There was a lot of movement of funds within the Group and associated companies and there were potentially a number of explanations. In late 1988 LTCL raised about $244 million from the issue of subordinated debentures by Drexel Burnham Lambert in the United States (the Drexel Funds). A summary of the movement of the Drexel Funds prepared by Mr. McLeod (a prosecution officer) rebutted the hypothesis that the Drexel Funds accounted for the $240 million cash recorded in LGL’s accounts. The summary revealed that the Drexel Funds were used to fund the attempted takeover of Tootal leading up to March 1989 and, after the failure of that bid, were used to purchase Brick and Pipe Limited in mid-1989. This evidence was corroborated by Mr. Maxsted. 
     
      
    46    Mr. Wormsley, a director of J. Henry Schroder & Co. Ltd, a London bank, which acted for LGL and Mr. Goldberg in the Tootal takeover bid said that Mr. Goldberg was the directing force and that the group of people closest to Mr. Goldberg included the appellant and Mr. Roy Travers. He met with the appellant in London in mid-January 1989 and attended quite a number of meetings with her, that is, more than two or three. They covered matters relating to the debt portion of the funding for Landmark Textiles, the bid company formed on behalf of Mr. Goldberg to make the takeover bid. Mr. Wormsley’s recollection was that the appellant, Mr. Fitzgerald and himself were the three principally involved in the negotiation of the Citibank facility. Major points of principle were addressed to the appellant. Where instructions were needed, they were obtained from either the appellant or Mr. Goldberg. 
     
      
    47    The Crown also relied on these answers given by the appellant in civil proceedings in Victoria in 1992. 
     
      
       
        
        “No money was borrowed for the acquisition of the Tootal shares. Not one cent was borrowed. The funds that were used by the Tootal shares were effectively sourced from Linter Group. When the shares were sold, Linter’s money came back, but there was never any borrowing to actually acquire any Tootal shares. We never got to the bid stage.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “Subsequently, the funds that came back from the sale of the Tootal shares were used in the acquisition of the shares in Brick and Pipe but in between you are asking me, at any particular day I wouldn’t know what those funds were used for, sir.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      Elders 
       
        
       
      
    48    The Crown relied on the evidence of Ms. M. O’Donnell, a solicitor employed in the corporate services and lending area of EFG, to establish the high degree of involvement and knowledge of the appellant in relation to the $220 million transaction. It did so in two ways. It elicited from Ms. O’Donnell the part played by the appellant in that transaction. It also elicited the part played by the appellant in a similar transaction in December 1988. The amount was different in that there was a $100 million loan to Entrad. The documents prepared and used in December 1988 were similar to those used in the March 1989 transaction. The differences were immaterial. There was a “round robin” with settlement taking place on 30 December 1998 with the appellant being present and actively participating and handing across some of the documents. Two days earlier Ms. O’Donnell spoke to the appellant about the documents which she would be sending to her and EFG’s security requirements. 
     
      
    49    In late January 1989 the transaction was reversed. Repayment was effected by what was tantamount to a set off. LGL directed that $100 million of the amount it was owed by EFG should be repaid to Elfic to partially discharge Entrad’s debt to Elfic. 
     
      
    50    In mid-March 1989 Ms. O’Donnell learnt that Entrad had requested a loan facility of $220 million. She spoke to the appellant about the transaction, initially, about stamp duty on the security document. Ms. O’Donnell did not attend on settlement. 
     
      
    51    Mr. S.A. McClay was a chartered accountant on secondment to Elfic from either LGL or AFP Investment Corporation which had been taken over by Mr. Goldberg. In late December 1998 he received a telephone call from the appellant to have a meeting to discuss a proposal. The meeting was held in late December but he could not recall all the details. What she sought was that one of the Elders Finance companies lend Entrad $100 million with LGL putting up cash security to cover the amount borrowed and that the transaction be completed by 31 December 1998. He prepared a memo dated 29 December 1988 and that contained information which she had supplied. He attended at settlement on 30 December 1988 with Ms. O’Donnell. The appellant was there representing LGL and associated companies. A number of items (documents) were handed by the appellant to Ms. O’Donnell who handed the appellant a Westpac cheque in favour of Entrad for !00 million. The cheque was handed to an officer of Westpac by the appellant. It is not necessary to further rehearse the details of the round robin and the transaction. 
     
      
    52    Mr. McClay said that he met with the appellant in mid-March 1989. She sought a loan of $220 million secured for 45 days and required the transaction to be completed by 31 March 1989. In general terms the transaction was to be similar to that of late December 1988. He prepared a memorandum containing the information which she had supplied and recommending the transaction. After Board approval a letter was sent to her offering the facility sought. The letter reflected the understanding reached between the appellant and Mr. McClay as to what was to take place. 
     
      
       
      Elders’ Settlements 
       
      
    53    Mr. P.G. Brindley worked in the Treasury Department of LGL. On 30 December 1988 the appellant told him of the proposed $100 million transaction. She said that there was to be a loan from Elders to Entrad which would allow the repayment of a loan from Gibraltar Factors to LGL, that LGL would put the money on deposit with Elders and that that deposit would be pledged with Elders to cover the first loan that occurred. It was described as a round robin transaction. He was in the appellant’s office. There were telephone calls with Elders as to some of the details of the transaction and its requirements. There was a telephone call to Mr. A. Goldberg and a Board Meeting of LGL was held over the telephone to attend to the Elder’s requirements, the directors present being Mr. Goldberg and the appellant. Mr. Brindley was appointed company secretary for the day. He filled in various parts of the minutes of LGL and subsequently of Entrad at the appellant’s direction. Mr. Brindley said that in the case of Entrad, R. Travers was shown as being present as a director. He did not see Mr. Travers. A bundle of documents was completed. Mr. Brindley said that he attended at settlement with the appellant. Mr. Brindley was about 22 years of age. 
     
      
    54    Mr. Brindley became aware of a similar transaction in March 1989 involving $220 million. He had discussions with the appellant about it around the time of settlement. She told him that he would be involved in the settlement with the process being similar to that in December 1988. His writing appeared on a cheque requisition seeking a bank cheque from Westpac in favour of Elders Finance Corporation Limited. He had been asked “to make the settlement occur for the $220 million Elders’ transaction” by the appellant. He was not told anything about the $220 million transaction. 
     
      
    55    Mr. Brindley said that the appellant was significantly involved in dealing with banks and financial issues but she was not involved in daily things like accounts and budgets. She was involved in discussions with banks regarding loans in a significant way as to LGL. She played a significant role in relation to the links between Linter group companies and Entrad and Gibraltar Factors. Mr. Brindley was wary of the $220 million transaction and careful not to respond to questions about the $220 million which appeared on the financial statements. He was not fully aware of the implications. It appeared to be balance sheet window dressing. 
     
      
    56    Ms. R.P. Robbins, an accountant with Entrad, had contact with the appellant every one or two days. They discussed the condition of the various bank accounts and what funds were flowing in and what payments had to be made on the various borrowings of the companies. If moneys were needed to meet any particular obligation she spoke to the appellant. She prepared liquidity reports for a number of companies. Those relating to the Entrad Group and Gibraltar Factors went to Mr Deans and the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
       
      LGL Accounts 
       
      
    57    There was a large body of evidence called as to how the $220 million came to be recorded in the LGL accounts. It was common ground that in an early draft set of accounts the item was shown as a receivable and not as cash on deposit. The early draft or drafts were prepared by officers of LGL. There were many drafts of the accounts. Mr. G.C. Laws, the audit partner of Price Waterhouse at the time pointed out that he was concerned with the audit of the LGL accounts and that his firm was not involved with the Entrad Group audits nor the audit of Gibraltar Factors and had no access to any of their books. His main contacts were with Mr. P.D. Thew, the company secretary of LGL and Mr. D. Gale, the Finance Director for LGL. They did not have any specific knowledge of the affairs of the Entrad Group and associated companies. Less frequently he spoke with the appellant. 
     
      
    58    Mr. Laws said that in one of the later drafts the item was shown as “Cash on deposit”. He discussed the accounting treatment of the item with Messrs. Thew and Gale. He was provided with a letter from EFG describing a $220 million promissory note on deposit. There was no mention in the letter of the $220 million being encumbered. Mr. Laws thought that he first learnt that the $220 million was pledged to meet a liability from Entrad to Elfic in about January 1990. Mr. Laws stated that he made a note, disclosure of cash $220 million short term deposit, not cash, amount able to be recalled except as cash, cash actually received mid-April. Mr. Laws said that he initially sought the accounts of Gibraltar Factors from David Gale. He eventually got them through Mr. Gale or the appellant. Mr. Laws said that he decided that the accounts were not misleading showing the item as cash because: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, primarily I was told by Gale that Linter could get the money back at any stage if they wanted to and that the time I signed the accounts the cash had actually been received back by Linter any way, so there was no doubt about it coming back.” 
        
       
       
      
    59    Mr. Werro, the audit manager from Price Waterhouse confirmed that at no time in 1989 was he aware that the promissory note was pledged. If he had known, the accounts should have shown that the asset was encumbered. He would have expected to have been told that the asset was encumbered. He was told that the money was available on call by Messrs. Thew and Gale. 
     
      
    60    Mr. Gale said that he had no knowledge of the $220 million transaction as it occurred. He first learnt that the $220 million promissory note was pledged to meet a similar liability of Entrad to Elfic when he was told by the receiver after the collapse of the Goldberg group. It was his belief that Gibraltar Factors had been able to liquefy some of the advances that had been made to it and return the moneys to LGL. Messrs. Gale and Thew paint the picture of not being fully informed by the appellant as to what was happening. 
     
      
    61    This short review of the evidence demonstrates that the Crown case was a very strong one. The appellant appears to have been one of the principal cohorts of Mr. Goldberg who has left Australia. 
     
      
       
      The defence case 
       
      
    62    This comprised an unsworn statement by the appellant and evidence from Mr. Durlacher, another former senior executive of the Goldberg group. The unsworn statement which lasted about 1½ days was discursive and repetitive. Some of the statement was irrelevant and other parts were of peripheral relevance. It was punctuated with extensive comment and argument. She was critical of counsel for the Crown, the senior investigator from the Australian Securities Commission, some of the witnesses and the conduct of the Crown case. She commented extensively upon the credit of some of the witnesses whose evidence was adverse to her. This was despite a number of instructions from the judge not to do so. She made many important concessions. 
     
      
    63    These points seem to emerge from her statement: 
     
      
       
      (a) $220 million was borrowed by Entrad and paid to LGL which brought an IOU (promissory note). Elders wrote out a paper saying IOU $220 million plus the specified interest and promised to pay the sum on 12 May 1989. 
       
       
      (b) This was all done to shed the best light possible on LGL’s accounts for the Tootal takeover bid. It was only a temporary expedient designed to last for the duration of that bid. It had no other purpose. 
       
       
      (c) Mr. Goldberg made an all out effort in his bid for Tootal. Its acquisition was of great importance to him and the businesses. The expenditure of $500,000.00 to have accounts which would impress was not high in view of what was at stake. 
       
       
      (d) There was very little difference in the context between a receivable and cash. In any event, the unavailability of the $220 million promissory note, due to the pledge did not mean that those funds could not fairly be described as cash. There were real funds behind the promissory note and the pledge did not change their character. However, she knew it was not accessible to LGL unless other security was substituted in place of the pledge. 
       
       
      (e) Everyone in LGL and Entrad knew that the promissory note was pledged and spoke about it, including the staff in the treasury and accounts departments. The majority opinion now is that the promissory note should have been classified as a receivable and not as cash. She had nothing to do with the classification. 
       
       
      (f) The “security” or pledge given by LGL for Entrad’s borrowing should have been shown as a contingent liability. It was an unfortunate accident by others in LGL that a note to the accounts was not inserted as to the contingent liability. (She explained the nature of a contingent liability.) She did not realise that such a note had not been inserted in the accounts until after all the questions were asked 7 or 8 years ago. 
       
       
      (g) The contingent liability notes were usually done by Mr. Thew and he was on holidays when the accounts were settled. He did not complete the contingent liabilities schedules. The person completing these schedules must have inadvertently omitted to include a note about the $220 million promissory note. It was not her responsibility to attend to such a matter or see that it was done.  
       
       
      (h) Messrs. Thew and Gow were told about the $220 million transaction by Mr. Brindley about the time it happened. Mr. Brindley also told one of the auditors that the promissory note was with Elders. 
       
       
      (i) There had been a poor investigation. The prosecuting authorities were more concerned about gathering material to support the prosecution case against her than carrying out a thorough and accurate investigation. 
       
       
      (j) In August 1989 LGL asked Westpac for a loan to tide it over a temporary hiccup in its cash flow. Mr. Goldberg had just finalised the takeover of Brick and Pipe, a very good business. 
       
       
      (k) She was not guilty of the Bank of Tokyo charge. She did not say anything to that bank which was false in any material way. What she told that Bank was absolutely true. 
       
       
      (l) She was not guilty of the Westpac charge. She did not make the statement charged. She was not the author of the letter of 13 September 1989. She signed the letter but at the time she did not read it. 
       
       
      (m) She was not guilty of the Chase AMP Bank charge. She did not make the statement alleged in the charge and she had absolutely no intention at the meeting on 24 November 1989 to extend any facility that Linter had with that bank at that time. 
       
       
      (n) What Mr. Arkins reported to the Head Office of his bank as to what she said was more or less correct but she believed that she would probably have said words to this effect: ‘In anticipation of having to possibly increase the bid for Tootal the balance of all available bank loans was drawn down and placed on deposit, i.e. $240 million. This strategy was part of a ploy which was necessary to disguise from Tootal shareholders the Group’s ability to accommodate an increase in the pending bid. Unfortunately, the Tootal bid was subsequently aborted. The 28 per cent parcel was sold at a profit of $18 million and all of the loans were repaid post 31/3/89 balance date.’ She never spoke in terms of Linter alone because she represented the Goldberg group. She claimed that she was an Entrad employee and never really associated with the Linter Group. She was an Entrad person working with Goldberg and Linter. 
       
       
      (o) Mr. Arkins was aware that each of the divisions operated on a stand alone basis. She insisted that when she spoke to Mr. Arkins she used the word “we” and he knew that she was referring to the Goldberg Group including Linter and Entrad. The Crown had seized on a small part of a whole conversation and thereby taken it out of context. She complained. “These two lines do not tell the reader that the drawing down of these loans was part of a ploy to show Tootal shareholders our ability to accommodate an increase in the bid price.” (There seems to be some ambivalence in the materials whether the ploy was designed to disguise that the Goldberg Group could increase its bid or to demonstrate its capacity to do so and its financial strength.) 
       
       
      (p) Elfic was a merchant bank and the transaction was sourced from an available bank loan. There was thus a bank which was willing to lend money to Entrad, so it had a facility and drew down the money and advanced it to Linter. Linter did what it wanted with this money. Accordingly the statement that $240 million cash recorded in the LGL financial statements dated 31 March 1989 represented a deposit of all available bank loans was completely true. (This contention smacked of sophistry). She insisted that the cash on deposit in the balance sheet represented actual funds. 
       
       
      (q) Nobody was misled about the entries because all the bankers were told about the Tootal ploy and that the funds had been reversed. They were put on notice that the entry mentioned could not be relied upon. The banks were not told of the round robin. 
       
       
      (r) She did carry out the transaction but she had the help of other people. She said “While this was real cash, I knew that it was pledged. While there was actual money, I knew that the Group could not access it without substituting security to EFG but that was never brought up”. 
       
       
      (s) The transaction was not an exercise to reduce the intercompany indebtedness between Gibraltar and Linter. Gibraltar was simply the financier for all the Goldberg companies. 
       
       
      (t) She relied on some accounts of LGL prepared as at 30 June 1989 which she asserted were given to the Bank. (This was disputed). She described it as a forecast balance sheet as at 30 June 1989. This corrected any incorrect impressions gained from the March Accounts of LGL. 
       
       
      (u) Neither she nor Mr. Deans made a statement to Mr. Brimo and Ms. Panditaratne of Chase AMP Bank on 24 November 1989 or at all that the $240 million cash recorded in the financial statements of LGL of 31 March 1989 was drawn down from Citibank backed financing secured on Tootal shares. The usual thing was said namely that LGL borrowed the money from the available facilities. The words alleged were not used because they never drew down on the Citibank facility. The Drexel Funds had been used to fund the Tootal bid and did not account for the $240 million recorded in the LGL accounts. 
       
       
      (v) The Chase AMP facility had been organised in about October 1989 by Messrs. Selig and Brindley. She and Mr. Deans had nothing to do with it. They had some meetings when Mr. Brimo and Ms. Panditaratne came to their office to sell products and/or services and to talk about general banking. About mid-October 1989 Chase AMP started pulling the money lines much to their Group’s annoyance. Relations became cool. On 24 November 1989 she, Deans, Brimo and Panditaratne chatted generally. Mr. Deans complained about what the bank had done. Mr. Brimo told them that Chase AMP was moving from the traditional lines the Goldberg Group was enjoying. There was no discussion about finance. Subsequently the bank’s letter and questionnaire were received. These were placed in the files. She denied that she had even signed an acceptance of a letter of offer issued by Chase AMP to Linter in 1988. 
       
       
      (w) As to the Westpac charge, she said that the Linter treasury officers told her that there were a few hiccups in the cash flow. Westpac (per Mr. Myers) was approached for bridging finance of $40 million, but told $20 million would probably do. She said that the bridging finance was originally $20 million but it was reduced to $10 million because the cash flow improved in the company. She handed Westpac’s request for information to the treasury department, probably to Mr. Brindley. She was very busy on the IEL takeover. She was handed a reply for her signature. She glanced at the document to ascertain its purpose and signed it. She did not read it carefully as she had every faith in her competent staff. She did not have the questions and she did not have sufficient knowledge to assess the correctness of the answers. She was not in a position to access the detailed information maintained in the Linter office. It was a very busy day for her and she relied on her staff. She often signed 50 letters per day, many of which the staff had prepared She said that she never turned her mind to the bank bills in any way. Her only purpose was to get over the temporary hiccup in the cash flow. 
       
       
      (x) Mr. Ludkin of Westpac was not concerned that the $240 million represented the result of a round robin. He was concerned to stabilise LGL and to obtain as much security as possible. 
       
       
      (y) Messrs. Ludkin and Tomlin of Westpac were aware that the $240 million had gone. He had also worked out what was involved in the loans to associated companies and the change in liabilities. 
       
       
      (z) She had no recollection of signing the letter of 13 September 1989 to Elfic in response to its fax of 11 September 1989. The letter of 13 September must have been prepared by one of her staff and she signed it amongst a lot of other letters. 
       
       
      (aa) Mr. Brindley drafted the Linter minutes for the meeting of LGL bearing date 28 March 1989 inserting her name as one of the directors and leaving a blank for the name of the other director. As a result of seeing certain documents in Court she was able to say that there was no meeting on 28 March 1989. Due to a combination of circumstances, the documents for the meeting were faxed to Mr. Travers probably on 29 March 1989 and they spoke on the telephone on that day. There was no meeting in the office. The original documents were sent to him by courier. The documents came back signed on the afternoon of 29 March 1989. If the document was not signed by Mr. Travers, it was nothing to do with her. To her it seemed like his signature. The directors of the company had a lot of telephone meetings. The company secretary was not sitting next to them. The directors had about one formal board meeting per year. The company did not send copies of completed minutes of directors’ meetings to each director. 
       
       
      (ab) The auditors had not spoken to her about the accounts and the $220 million transaction. She had no involvement in the way in which the matter was dealt with in the accounts. She had never knowingly made a false statement to the banks. The corporate structure was very fluid and complex and it was constantly changing. This and the amount of business being conducted prevented stories being made up. 
       
      
    64    Mr. Durlacher was an experienced accountant. In 1989 he was the financial controller for the Goldberg Group of companies. There were three distinct groups of companies, trusts and entities within the Goldberg empire. One group consisted of the private companies of Mr. Goldberg for which he (Durlacher) was responsible. No information from or about these was to be communicated to the Linter Group or the Entrad Group without Mr. Goldberg’s express consent. This rule applied to Gibraltar Factors. Mr. Goldberg kept his finger on the pulse of all companies in the Goldberg group and his consent was required for action taken by the directors of those companies. He said Mr. Goldberg often sought advice from Mr. Travers. Mr. Durlacher was involved in the distribution of moneys received back (about $250 million) after the failure of the Tootal bid. He conferred with Mr. Goldberg and made a list of the moneys to be repaid and the lenders of those moneys. About $125 million came back into Gibraltar Factors and arrangements were made to repay $115 million to $120 million. Much of the money was drawn back 2 or 3 weeks later to fund the Brick and Pipe takeover. The balance of about $125 million went to the Linter Group to pay out various facilities, some permanently and some to be redrawn later. 
     
      
    65    Mr. Durlacher was responsible for supplying certain information to the Bank of New Zealand in respect of the March 1989 accounts of the Linter Group. He obtained the information requested from Mr. Gale or Mr. Thew or Mr. Brindley. He prepared a draft letter which read: 
     
      
       
        
        “The cash on deposit was there at balance date to provide funds for the possible takeover of Tootal PLC. Since balance date, approximately $125 million of this cash has been used to fund the Brick and Pipe takeover. 
        
       
       
       
      Mr. Durlacher had asked the appellant to check the draft letter and confirm that the reply was correct. She did so and the letter was sent. 
       
      
    66    Appeal Grounds 1, 2 and 3 can be summarised thus: 
     
      
       
      1. In contravention of s.56 of the Evidence Act the judge erred in ruling that the evidence of Mr. Travers was admissible when it was irrelevant. There was no issue to which it related. 
       
       
      2. In contravention of s.137 of the Act the judge erred in ruling such evidence was admissible given that its probative value (if any) was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
       
       
      3. In contravention of s.101 of the Act the judge erred in ruling tendency evidence admissible which did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect. 
       
       
      
    67    The evidence of Mr. Travers was that he had not attended any meeting of directors of Entrad at 11.00 a.m. or LGL at 11.15 a.m. on 28 March 1989 as shown in the minutes of the meetings. (That was later confirmed by the appellant in her dock statement.) He also said that he had not signed the minutes, the power of attorney and the letter of 28 March 1989 from Entrad and LGL to Elfic requesting the immediate advance of $220 million to Entrad. He had not seen Elfic’s letter of 28 March 1989 to Entrad of the loan facility being made available, that of LGL of 29 March 1989 signed by the appellant irrevocably requesting Elfic make available financial accommodation to Entrad and the certificate of 28 March 1989 of LGL that it was not prohibited by s.230 of the Companies (NSW) Code from giving security to Elfic in respect of financial accommodation being provided to Entrad by Elfic. 
     
      
    68    The effect of Mr. Travers’ evidence was that he had no knowledge of the $220 million transaction and was not involved in implementing it, the signatures did not appear to be his and he did not attend the meetings. It also had the effect of establishing that the appellant set up and ran the whole exercise and ploy. It was her project. She was the director in charge. 
     
      
    69    The appellant contended that the evidence was irrelevant. She submitted that by the time Mr. Travers came to give evidence on the 12th day of the trial it had been conceded on her behalf that she was not attempting to distance herself from participating in setting up the $220 million transaction. Prior to his giving evidence the appellant objected to its admissibility on the grounds set out above, stressing that it was not relevant and that it was highly prejudicial. The Crown submitted that the non-presence of Mr. Travers went to the issue of the knowledge of the appellant as to the real nature of the transaction and perhaps some desire to keep it as secret as possible. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is relevant to the issue of knowledge as to the nature of the transaction and as to her knowledge of the transaction and as to her state of mind at the time she made the alleged statements to the various bank officers.” 
        
       
       
       
      There was some dispute as to exactly what had been submitted to the judge. The transcript contained a brief summary. In this Court the Crown stated that, before the judge, the appellant conceded that the transaction took place and that she had signed the various documents where her signature purportedly appears. However, her knowledge and the extent of it and her state of mind were live issues throughout the case until she made her statement. What the judge said in his ruling correctly stated the position. 
       
      
    70    Mr. Travers’ evidence was cogent, amongst other things, by a process of excluding himself, as to the extent of the appellant’s knowledge of and degree of involvement in the $220 million transaction which was behind the cash recorded in the LGL accounts. Such knowledge and involvement could and was likely to affect the jury’s assessment of the appellant’s state of mind at the time of making the false statement, in particular, her knowledge of the inaccurate disclosure of the $220 million transaction in the LGL accounts. Mr. Travers’ evidence was thus relevant in accordance with ss. 55 and 56 of the Evidence Act 1995. On the documents Mr. Travers was the only other director involved in the transaction. It was prudent and necessary for the Crown to call Mr. Travers to rebut any suggestion that he implemented the transaction and, more importantly to show that it was her project and that she understood the effect of the transaction. I reject the challenge to the admissibility of the evidence based on relevance. 
     
      
    71    The appellant submitted that the evidence had little or no probative value and in any event was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. The appellant submitted that probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (Lock 91 A Crim R 356 at 360). The main issue in the proceedings was whether she made a statement which she knew to be false in a material particular when she was asked about the entry of cash on deposit of $240 million. That entry was largely as a result of a transaction in which she was intimately involved. Material which established that she was deeply involved in carrying out the transaction and knew a great deal about it was of considerable importance in assessing whether she knew that the statements which she made to the banks were false in a material particular. The $220 million transaction accounted for nearly all of the $240 million recorded as total cash. The appellant’s knowledge of the true position, acquired through her involvement in implementing the $220 million transaction was of substantial probative value because it went to whether the appellant was consciously deceiving the three banks. 
     
      
    72    As earlier mentioned, the judge admitted Mr. Travers’ evidence as being relevant to the appellant’s knowledge and involvement and the degree thereof and to her state of mind when she made the statements. The evidence was neither tendered nor sought to be used to show any tendency by the appellant to act dishonestly. The judge was correct in holding that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    73    The appellant further contended that the evidence was tendency evidence, specifically evidence as to bad character. She submitted that the evidence did not have significant probative value, that is, that its degree of relevance to the events giving rise to the offence charged was not important or of consequence: Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459; Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356; AH 98 A Crim R 71 at 79; Fraser, CCA, unreported 10 August 1998. 
     
      
    74    However, the Crown did not seek to use Mr. Travers’ evidence to show any tendency on the part of the appellant. For example, in summing up the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr. Travers’ evidence was to the effect that he did not sign those minutes (Ex.1) and he was not present at any meetings and that he had no knowledge of that transaction. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence … is perhaps no longer of the significance it might otherwise have been because it was there to confirm the accused’s intimate knowledge and understanding of the transaction and its need to be completed before balance date, 31 March 1989.” 
        
       
       
      The judge then referred to her statement in which she “indicated that she knew the purpose of the transaction and certainly with regard to Tootal its object.” 
       
      
    75    The evidence was directly relevant to a fact in issue and therefore admissible. Accordingly ss. 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 do not apply. The appellant’s submissions focussed on one aspect of Mr. Travers’ evidence, namely that he was not present and did not sign the documents which purported to bear his signature. There were a number of possibilities of which forgery was one. It is a big jump to say that the appellant forged the signature or acquiesced in such a course. The Crown sought to use the evidence for the different purpose earlier mentioned. Appeal Grounds 1, 2 and 3 fail. 
     
      
    76    Appeal Ground 4 could be summarised thus: The judge erred in admitting, over objection, evidence on material issues which resulted from leading questions by the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    77    This was not pursued except to the extent that it refers to Mr. Travers’ evidence and is taken up in Grounds 1 to 3. It is not necessary to take this ground further. 
     
      
    78    I will defer Appeal Grounds 5 and 6 and deal with them in conjunction with Appeal Ground 9. 
     
      
    79    Appeal Ground 7 alleges that the summing up was defective and lacked fairness and balance. The Crown had to go to considerable lengths to prove its case. It called a lot of oral evidence and tendered many exhibits. The transcript and the exhibits run to over 2500 pages. The Crown led evidence showing that there was no substance in many potential explanations as well as proving its case. There were large numbers of dealings and inter-company transactions and the financial affairs of LGL and the Goldberg Group had some complexity. 
     
      
    80    When the trial started virtually every fact was in dispute. Painstakingly the Crown case was built up and what had happened was exposed. Some inroads were made into the evidence of some of the Crown witnesses but overall the Crown case could be described as very strong. Some of the witnesses called by the Crown were cross-examined at considerable length. It was put to some witnesses that in some sense and to some extent he or she was responsible for the way in which things had gone wrong. The appellant suggested that she carried out Mr. Goldberg’s instructions, Mr. Travers was senior to her and close to Mr. Goldberg. Other staff prepared letters and documents for her. She was so busy that she signed them without reading them and appreciating what they were saying. This applied to letters to banks. 
     
      
    81    In her statement the appellant made, amongst other things, many admissions and concessions and effectively removed most of the issues which had been raised earlier or not conceded. For example, she conceded that she knew what the $220 million transaction was, that the promissory note was pledged and that there was no cash unless a “white knight” came along. No one did. The judge, as a result of what she said, was able to tell the jury that the real issues lay within a relatively narrow compass. 
     
      
    82    She filled in some gaps in the Crown case. She explained the purpose behind the transaction of 29 March 1989. As she related this balance sheet enhancing exercise it became apparent out of her own mouth that the transaction which she implemented was a manoeuvre designed to deceive those dealing with LGL and associated companies. In moments of reflection she must have realised that making the balance sheet look better for the Tootal takeover by the ploy used was dishonest. Having acknowledged the ploy and its purpose nobody would accept that about five months later she was going to forget what had happened or that another gloss could be put upon it. She faced a massive Crown case which could not be circumvented. Her attempts to blame others were unconvincing especially as in some instances the relevant allegations had not been put to the witness called by the Crown. 
     
      
    83    It would not have assisted the accused if the judge had referred at length to the terms of the dock statement. That would only have cemented the appellant’s guilt. Instead, the judge selected the main points made by the defence on the central issues. He tried to keep the matter as simple as possible. I turn now to the detailed complaints. Complaints (a) and (b) read: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) His Honour presented as conclusions of fact matters which were material and at issue, namely: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The appellant had made the impugned statements and that the statements were false; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) The $220 million transaction had no commercial advantage for the company. The appellant and several Crown witnesses agreed that the commercial advantage of the $220 million transaction related to the attempt of Abe Goldberg to takeover a company called Tootal in the United Kingdom. Whether the jury accepted this as the original reason for the transaction was pivotal to the defence 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) His Honour erred in law by directing the jury that if they determined the questions posed by the banks as being important to the banks - and stating that in any view the amount of $220 million is a significant figure - then that is the context to determine if the answers were material in a false particular. 
        
       
       
      
    84    It is not correct to say that the judge presented as conclusions of fact that the appellant had made the impugned statements. The judge in explaining the elements of the offences told the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant with the intent to obtain for Linter Textiles (or LGL)an advantage of a financial nature made a statement which was false in a material particular, that is important or significant in the context in which the statement of fact was made. It must be material for the purpose for which the advantage is sought. Later, in the summing up the judge identified the statements which the Crown alleged were false referred briefly to the evidence in support. That evidence pointed strongly to the falsity of the statements (and I include creating a false impression). The judge then briefly outlined her defence and responses. The judge left it to the jury to decide whether she had made the statements and whether they were false and known by her to be so.  
     
      
    85    The judge reminded the jury that the transaction had cost Entrad about $500,000 and that it gained Entrad nothing by way of any financial or commercial advantage. He added that “it did … allow what you might think was a false picture of the state of the balance sheet as at the end of the financial year … by presenting two hundred and twenty million dollars as being in cash and reducing the Gibraltar loan”. What the judge said was accurate. The judge was highlighting that there was no legitimate commercial or financial advantage and that the only advantage was to enable deceptive accounts to be prepared in connection with a takeover. At the conclusion of the summing up and at the appellant’s request the judge further explained that when Mr. Maxstead said that there was no commercial rationale for the transaction he was talking in terms of dollars and cents and not the enhancing of the accounts for the Tootal bid. 
     
      
    86    The judge was only stating the obvious when he said that on any view the amount of $220,000 million is a significant figure. The judge told the jury that they had to decide whether the statements made were material and that they were entitled to take into account whether the banks regarded the statements as material. The judge pointed out that the banks were seeking information as to the accounts supplied to them. 
     
      
    87    I would reject the grounds contained in paragraphs (a) and (b). 
     
      
    88    In Ground 7 (c) the appellant complained that the judge did not direct the jury to consider all the evidence as a whole. While the judge did not use these words expressly, he did tell them that they had to consider all the circumstances of the case. It was implicit from the summing up that the jury had to consider all the materials. The jury would have understood this. I reject this complaint. 
     
      
    89    In ground 7 (d) and (e) the appellant complained that the judge directed the jury only to consider the examination in chief of witnesses for the Crown in relation to the issue of materiality and failed to direct the jury to consider their cross-examination which caused the witnesses effectively to abandon their evidence in chief. In ground 7 (k) the appellant complained that the judge did not relate any of the facts raised by the defence to the element of materiality although specifically requested to do so by way of re-direction. 
     
      
    90    The judge explained the concepts of materiality and “false in a material particular”. He referred to the evidence which was given in chief by Messrs. Arkins, Myers and Brimo on the question of materiality. He did not quote from their cross-examination. However, it must be remembered that the appellant denied responsibility for the statement in the letter signed by her and sent to Westpac and that the statements alleged by Mr. Brimo and Ms. Panditaratne were made by her. She admitted the essence of the evidence of Mr. Arkins as to what was said. The judge did not purport to summarise the evidence given but to state the contentions of the Crown and the appellant on each count and give a brief reference to the evidence. The judge was not obliged to do more. It was not a case where he was required to summarise the evidence at length. 
     
      
    91    The appellant requested the judge to refer to concessions obtained by her counsel in cross-examination of Mr Arkins, Mr Myers, Mr Tomlin, Mr Ludkin, Ms Panditaratne and Mr Brimo as to materiality. The Crown contended that it would be unwise to do so because the judge would have to refer to the Crown evidence-in-chief and re-examination which neutralised or wiped out any concessions. The Crown further contended that the issues had been highlighted and sufficiently covered and that going through all the evidence as to materiality would not assist the appellant. The matter was best left as it was. The closer the examination of the materials the stronger the Crown case appeared. It was virtually impossible for the appellant with her knowledge to mount an effective argument as $220m was not in truth cash and the pledge was not shown in LGL’s accounts. The issue of materiality was sufficiently covered in the Summing Up. I would add that this was not a case where the evidence of the bank officers as to materiality was necessary. LGL’s accounts were submitted to the banks to enable them to consider making or extending a loan. The correct position as to the accounting entry of cash, $240 million and the inclusion of a note as to the pledge were obviously important as were the statements as to how the sum of $240 million or $220 million had been applied. 
     
      
    92    I reject the challenges in Ground 7(d), (e) and (k). 
     
      
    93    Appeal Grounds 7(f), (g), (h), (I) and (j) contend that the judge: 
     
      
       
      (f) directed the jury to take a selective and simplistic view of the evidence when  
       
      that for the defence required issues of some complexity to be considered in the  
       
      light of a significant body of evidence; 
       
       
      (g) failed to properly put the defence case in not directing the jury to consider the 
       
       possibility of the defence’s alternative hypothesis to that of the prosecution; 
       
       
      (h) did not remind the jury of the evidence by way of cross-examination favourable  
       
       
       to the defence; 
       
       
      (i) referred to the accused’s statement in a summary and dismissive manner; 
       
       
      (j) failed to present the arguments on behalf of the accused at all, or in a fair 
       
       
       balanced and unbiased manner. 
       
      
    94    In amplification she submitted that the judge effectively ignored the defence case which was: 
     
      
       
      (a) The transaction by which cash was recorded on the balance sheet was a real transaction involving real cash. 
       
       
      (b) The recording of the proceeds of the transaction as cash was legitimate in the appellant’s mind, properly classified as a result of the auditors’ acceptance of it. 
       
       
      (c) The $220 million transaction was not carried out to manipulate the audited accounts (which would be ready by about August 1989) but to show a short term cashed up position for the Tootal bid. 
       
       
      (d) The Tootal bid having failed, the necessity to show “cash” on the balance sheet had expired. But the transaction had to be shown on the balance sheet. 
       
       
      (e) As to the Bank of Tokyo count, nothing she said to that bank was false in any material way. It was absolutely true. She put some of the conversation with Mr Arkins in slightly different terms. She said that the charge was confined to two lines in the balance sheet and that this did not put the matter in context. The bank was given the latest balance sheet available being the Executive Summary Budget as at 30 June 1989 which revealed no cash and told of the Tootal ploy. Thus it could no longer rely on the accounts as at 31 March 1989. 
       
       
      (f) As to the Westpac count, she was not the author of the letter containing the statement relied upon. She did not have time to deal with it as she was heavily involved in the IEL takeover. She did not have the information nor the access to the information to respond to the Westpac questions. The charge refers to two types of financial advantage. She sought bridging finance. She did not approach Westpac as to the existing bill facility. 
       
       
      (g) As to the Chase-AMP count, she said that she did not make the statement alleged and there was no intention at the meeting on 24 November 1989 to extend any facility LGL had with the bank. She believed that the note-taker had put together two ideas or two thoughts. One was that LGL was going to be financed by Citibank and the other was the question and answer as to the $220 million or $240 million. The discussions were not for the purpose of a “financial advantage.” The original loan, a bill facility, was in place and rolled over monthly. She did not arrange nor administer the loan. By November 1989 the bank had withdrawn some important facilities without prior notice. It was seeking legal advice whether it could pull out of the bill facility. Neither Mr Deans nor she addressed the roll over of the bills. They did not talk about the companies for the purpose of renewal of the facility. 
       
      
    95    Inherent in the appellant’s submissions is the notion that it was legitimate to enhance the accounts for the purpose of the Tootal bid. I do not agree especially as there was no note to the accounts about the pledge. The Tootal ploy was designed to mislead. The appellant has not been charged in respect of the transaction and the entry but in respect of the statements which she made about the entry and what lay behind it. To tell the banks that it was a ploy did not go far enough given what she said and wrote. Much of what the appellant said about the transaction in her dock statement is not a defence to the charges laid which focussed on what she said and wrote in August-November 1989. 
     
      
    96    It is true that in his Summing Up the judge reviewed the transaction critically, pointing out that it cost Entrad $500,000 and conferred no financial advantage save that of enhancing the balance sheet for the purpose of the Tootal takeover bid. All this was beyond argument as was the misleading nature of what had been done. 
     
      
    97    As to the Bank of Tokyo count the judge reminded the jury that the appellant had said in her dock statement that the account given by Mr Arkins of the statement which she had made was essentially accurate. The judge repeated her defence “As to the Bank of Tokyo, I am not guilty. I do not believe that I said anything to the Bank of Tokyo which was false in a material particular, in fact what I told the Bank of Tokyo was absolutely true.” He reminded the jury that she had given details as to why this was so. The judge continued “She said, well what I said really amounted to telling them about the $220 million transaction. That what happened was that money was paid down, or at least the promissory note was available as I understand it, as cash, although in my view it should not be there as cash… But it was there, it was drawn down and for that reason you would conclude that…. I didn’t have any state of mind that what I was saying about that transaction when I told Mr Arkins about it, was in any way false.” Later the judge said “The accused’s case is that yes she did make the statement set out in the first count but she did not believe it was false, I have already dealt with that aspect of the matter.” 
     
      
    98    In my opinion the judge has put the appellant’s case sufficiently on the Bank of Tokyo count. He has endeavoured to do so succinctly and to keep the issues as simple as possible. This was a case where the essential features were capable of being swallowed up in a mass of detail and words and lost. It should not be overlooked that the Summing Up followed shortly after the appellant’s statement in which she made her points several times over. Counsel had also addressed. Any further review of the materials was unnecessary. The details were fresh in the jury’s mind. 
     
      
    99    As to the Westpac count the judge pointed out that the Westpac request for information was addressed to the appellant and started off with the personal touch of “Dear Katy” and that the Crown’s case centred on this part of the reply, “Since the balance date approximately $125 million of this cash has been used to fund Brick and Pipe takeover and the balance to retire debt.” The judge touched on the evidence as to the effect on the bank of this statement and gave the jury the transcript references. The judge reminded the jury of her defence “I didn’t make the statement” and “I am not the author of the letter, I did sign the letter but I did not read it.” The judge elaborated, “So what she is saying is, she simply did not read the letter, it was prepared by somebody else and she said, in effect if she had read it she would not have signed it.” 
     
      
    100    Later the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was her case that she did not or was not responsible for….the letter to Westpac…all she did was sign the letter and had not seen the request which would have made it clearer if she had read them both as to what precisely was being referred to….” 
        
       
       
      At the request of the appellant the judge again reminded the jury at the conclusion of the Summing Up that she emphasised that she did not have the questions when she signed the Westpac reply. 
       
      
    101    In my opinion the judge put the essence of the defence case on the third count simply and clearly. It was not easy to accept that being responsible for organising loans and having spoken with Mr Myers from Westpac and having received a letter addressed to her personally she signed the reply without looking at its contents. It was not an unimportant matter. There was no point in complicating or obfuscating the issue. The appellant gave the jury an excellent opportunity to assess her in her statement. She was not a person who could not handle a mass of material. 
     
      
    102    The judge reminded the jury that the Chase-AMP count was based on the statement allegedly made by Mr Deans or the appellant at the meeting of 24 November 1989 recorded in the contact memorandum made shortly afterwards in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Around the close of fiscal ’89” that’s 31 March ’89 - “—Linter was positioning itself for the Tootal takeover and the City Bank backed financing secured on the Tootal shares was drawn down in anticipation of launching the bid. Therefore the sizeable two hundred and forty million cash balance as at the end of the financial year, the bid having since aborted, the facility has been repaid and the cash balances normalised. By 9/5/89 all Tootal shares were disposed of.” 
        
       
      
    103    The judge then directed the jury to consider the effect of the statements they found to be made and he referred them to some short passages in the evidence. The judge gave directions as to common purpose about which no complaint is made. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the third charge she said she did not make the statement and there was absolutely no intent at the meeting on 24 November to extend any facility that Linter had with a bank at that time.” 
        
       
       
      A little later he continued: 
       
       
        
        “With regard to the third count, she says: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Well I simply was not there when any such misrepresentation was made, that if I had been I would have said something. If it was said, it was said by Deans. If it was said, it was not said in my presence.”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    104    At the conclusion of the Summing Up the appellant’s counsel said as to the third count in the presence of the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “And in relation to the putting of the defence case the most important one is the alternative explanation offered about which there was cross-examination of both Mr Brimo and Miss Panditaratne, the elision of the two ideas. In other words the bringing together of two separate statements made, each of which was independently true but the combination of both gave the misleading impression.” 
        
       
       
      The judge replied: 
       
       
        
        “Members of the jury I think she’s referred to that and it certainly is part of Mr Glissan’s address that the recollection of Miss Panditaratne and Mr Brimo was it’s suggested not reliable because they were relying on notes which were made subsequently.” 
        
       
      
    105    Again, I am of the view that the judge sufficiently put the appellant’s case on the third count. It was very simple. There was no intention to extend the bill facility and neither she nor Mr Deans in her presence said what was alleged. There was powerful evidence to the contrary. 
     
      
    106    The judge reminded the jury that in her statement the appellant had said in effect that she was an honest person, that she did not make dishonest statements such as those alleged and that what she said she truly believed. The judge directed the jury that the law required them to take her good character into account on each of the counts both on the question of her guilt and on the question of her credibility. He explained that the evidence went to the improbability of a person of good character committing the offences alleged and the weight they would attach to her statement.  
     
      
    107    Later in the Summing Up the judge reminded the jury of her comments at T.1441: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just to sum up in answer to everything that has gone on here….I ask you to accept this, I am not a liar, I do not believe I have ever said anything wrong to any banks that I have dealt with. I have never told untruths…I did not always call them back because I did not always have the time but we always had an open door we spoke with them fairly freely and honestly.” 
        
       
      
    108    The judge also referred briefly to the evidence of Mr Durlacher called on her behalf. His evidence about the Bank of New Zealand letter and probably having spoken to her personally about it was adverse for the appellant. 
     
      
    109    The following further exchange took place between senior counsel for the appellant and the judge in the presence of the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “GLISSAN: The one other matter of fact your Honour was the very beginning of the summing up when your Honour was dealing with Mr Maxsted’s evidence. You said Mr Maxsted had given evidence there was no commercial rationale and we asked your Honour to remind the jury that there was cross-examination of other witnesses later in the case, that the commercial rationale was in relation to the Tootal bid and the matter that your Honour subsequently dealt with. That’s to say the $220 million transaction to give the appearance in relation to the Tootal bid at the availability of funds for the purpose of increasing the bid. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I should say perhaps when he said no commercial rationale he was perhaps thinking of dollars and cents and not its use in the proposed takeover of Tootal.” 
        
       
      
    110    Despite the many complaints about the summing up it was not objectionable and it did put her defences sufficiently. It was not deficient. It was given in the context of her comprehensive statement which contained many concessions and eliminated many sub- issues. The jury had the transcript and the judge gave them references to some important sections of it. The jury had the benefit of two capable addresses from senior counsel. The appellant’s case was at its best when put succinctly. Complaints of lack of fairness and balance and that the judge was dismissive of the defence case are without substance. The real trouble from the appellant’s point of view was the considerable strength of the Crown case and the feeble quality of the defence case. 
     
      
    111    The judge’s task was to identify for the jury the appellant’s case on the facts in issue: Domican (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-561; Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105; Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim R 459 at 460 and 463. That task he discharged. If the judge had gone into the details to the extent sought by the appellant’s counsel that would not have assisted the jury or her. Further, in order to place the evidence containing the details in context, the judge would have had to make additional detailed references to the evidence in the Crown case. That would have exposed more problems for the appellant. It was not necessary. 
     
      
       
      I reject the challenges to the Summing Up contained in Appeal Ground 7. 
       
      
    112    Appeal Ground 8 could be summarised thus:  
     
      
       
      The judge erred in directing the jury that they could use conclusions arrived at on one count to assist them in determining the guilt of the accused as to the other counts. 
       
       
      It was submitted that the jury should have been directed to consider each count and the evidence as to each separately and that any finding of fact as to a particular count was not able to be used by the jury when considering other counts. Further, the directions given invited the jury to engage in impermissible circular reasoning. 
       
      
    113    Early in his Summing Up the judge told the jury that it was important that they look at each of the counts separately. Further, the judge separated each of the counts and explained the Crown and defence cases as to each count separately. 
     
      
    114    The direction complained of was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown’s position is that it is clear that in each case the accused knew that the respective statements were false and that you would not need to consider other counts in the way that I have outlined. But let me give you an example of how you could look at these other counts on the question of what was her state of mind. 
        
       
       
        
        Assuming, members of the jury, that you were satisfied with regard to the second count that not only had she signed exhibit G, the letter setting out what was done with the two forty million dollars when she wrote to Westpac, if you find it was in fact her letter in every sense of the word, if with regard to that count you were satisfied that she made a false statement, knowing that it was false, to obtain the financial advantage for the Linter Group, if while considering the first count you were unable to decide whether in fact she did realise that what she was saying was false, you could turn to that second count and say, ‘Well does this demonstrate a pattern of conduct in which she is making false statements to various parties?’ And if that were the situation, you could use that evidence from the second count to confirm what would be open to you with regard to the first count, bearing in mind that the accused says, ‘Yes, I did make those statements to Mr Arkins but I had no state of mind that what I said was false, was untruthful.’ 
        
       
       
        
        So that is the way, members of the jury, in which you would be entitled to look at other counts, but that is the only way in which you should do so, and in other respects you should look at each of the counts quite separately, one from the other.” 
        
       
       
      Particular objection was taken to the passage in the second paragraph starting with the words “if while considering the first count” and ending with the words “with regard to the first count,” it being contended that it contained a marked error of logic. 
       
      
    115    Immediately before the direction complained of the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have told you that you must look at each count separately but this is subject to the following direction: if having regard to a particular count you were satisfied that the accused made a statement, or concurred in a statement, in respect of the fourth count, what you found was material and false and was made with intent to obtain a financial advantage and the question of the accused’s knowledge as to its falsity was not determined on the evidence relevant to that count, if you had made that determination with regard to another or others of the counts, you could use that fact if it led you to the conclusion that the accused was using different explanations, also false, but changed only to fit in with the known facts touching that particular bank.” 
        
       
      
    116    The judge then referred to the statement of Ms Hui which was read to the jury and its effect. Ms Hui recounted, as to the bank of New Zealand loan, the explanation of the appellant to her of the entry of $240 million cash in LGL’s accounts. As this statement was not the subject of a charge, its relevance was limited to its use as co-incidence evidence under s.98 of the Evidence Act 1995. Before addresses the Crown outlined how it sought to use the co-incidence evidence and addressed accordingly. (T.1501-2).  
     
      
       
      The appellant in her statement when dealing with the Chase-AMP count said that when asked about the $220 million or $240 million the usual thing was said “You borrowed the money from the available facilities.” The Crown contended that the usual story was the one which the appellant had been consistently telling other people with variations to accommodate events which happened along the way. 
       
      
    117    The judge’s example of how evidence as to one false statement may be used in deciding her state of mind when she made another false statement was a sufficient and simple explanation of co-incidence reasoning applied to the facts of the present case. In the context, the direction was focused on the evidence supporting the different counts. It would not have misled the jury into using a conclusion of guilt on one count as a basis for finding the appellant guilty on other counts. The judge expressly limited the use of the co-incidence evidence to the appellant’s state of mind, that is, whether she knew what she was saying was false. I reject Appeal Ground 8. 
     
      
    118    Appeal Grounds 5, 6 and 9 
     
      
      These cover some of the same ground. Grounds 5 and 6 assert that the judge erroneously refused to direct verdicts for the appellant on counts 1 and 3. Ground 9 is that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. That means in the present case they were not supported by the evidence and that there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    119    As to the Bank of Tokyo count the appellant submitted that there was no evidence fit to go to the jury in that the statement by the appellant was true, was not false in a material particular and was not knowingly false in a material particular. Both at the trial and on appeal the appellant relied on substantially the same matters. Mr Arkins had been told that the cash on deposit had been reduced to repay the bank loans that had earlier been drawn down from all of their bankers in relation to the Tootal bid, that as a result the cash on deposit figure was basically negligible and that the cash on deposit on LGL’s balance sheet was a ploy. As at 25 August 1989 when the appellant allegedly made the statement that the $240 million represented a deposit of all available bank loans it was not a material statement given what else Mr Arkins had been told and that the transaction had been unwound. Further the complaint in the Indictment was a deposit of all available bank loans rather than a deposit of an available bank loan. 
     
      
    120    There was a case to answer. The whole tenor of the appellant’s replies was to create the false impression that LGL had access to $240 million cash to be used as necessary for the purposes of the company. In doing so she actively concealed the true effect of the $220 million transaction. The representation of the $240 million as borrowed funds does not render the falsity immaterial. There was no $240 million cash borrowed or otherwise accessible to LGL as at 31 March 1989. The references to the cash being able to be used to fund further the acquisition of Tootal shares implies that the funds were available for LGL’s purposes. 
     
      
    121    The references to available lines of credit being drawn down and repaid suggests rather strongly a movement of funds from banks to LGL which could be used by LGL during the period of the loan. There was also the implication that LGL had access to substantial amounts of existing credit and was a good credit risk. The bankers would reasonably have understood that on repayment of the loans the liabilities of LGL would be reduced accordingly. 
     
      
    122    The accounting treatment of the $220 million in LGL’s accounts had the effect of substantially reducing the amount shown as lent to Gibraltar Factors, a related company. There is a significant difference between cash and a substantial loan to a closely related private company.  
     
      
    123    Although she had knowledge of the $220 million transaction and what it involved and of the misleading impression created by the accounts of LGL, the appellant said nothing about the promissory note and it being pledged to Elfic. She knew that there was no available cash. 
     
      
    124    LGL and the appellant were intent on obtaining and maintaining credit facilities. The accounts of the various companies reveal that these were much needed. The false statements were significant and relevant to obtaining and maintaining credit facilities. See Maslen v Shaw (1995) 79 A Crim R 199 at 202 and Kylsant [1932] 1 KB442. In the latter case the Court said: 
     
      
       
      “The falsehood in this case consisted in putting before intended investors, as material on which they could exercise their judgment as to the position of the company figures which apparently disclosed the existing position but in fact hid it. In other words, the prospectus implied that the company was in a sound financial position and that the prudent investor could safely invest…”  
       
      
    125    Earlier reference had been made to these remarks of Lord Halsbury LC in Aaron’s Reefs Ltd v Twiss  AC 273 at 281: 
     
      
       
        
        “…….I think one is entitled to look at the whole document and see what it means taken together…. It is said that there is no specific allegation of fact which is proved to be false. Again I protest, as I have said, against that being the true test. I should say, taking the whole thing together, was there false representation? I do not care by what means it is conveyed - by what trick or device or ambiguous language: all those are expedients by which fraudulent people seem to think that they can escape from the real substance of the transaction. If by a number of statements you intentionally give a false impression and induce a person to act upon it, it is not the less false although if one takes each statement by itself there may be a difficulty in showing that any specific statement is untrue… The whole of this transaction seems to me to have been fraudulent to the last degree.” (p.284). 
        
       
       
      I follow this approach. 
       
      
    126    The Bank of Tokyo count should undoubtedly have been left to the jury. The evidence amply supported the conviction. There was no miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    127    It was not suggested either at the trial or in this Court that the judge should have directed a verdict for the appellant on the Westpac count. The grounds of appeal contended however that the verdict on this count was unsafe and unsatisfactory. There is no substance in the contentions that on the whole of the evidence it was not open to the jury to conclude that the impugned statement in this count was false in a material particular and was known by the appellant to be false. She received the request for information, she signed the reply and she wanted very much to obtain and maintain credit facilities with Westpac. This was a matter of importance. Her explanation was not credible. The appellant further submitted that the jury may have entered a verdict of guilty in relation to the Westpac count based on conclusions reached on counts 1 and 3 which were not open. This is not so. The Westpac count was based on the reply signed by the appellant whereas the other counts were based on statements made orally to the bankers. In dealing with Appeal Ground 8 I have explained why there is no substance in this complaint. The verdict on the Westpac count was amply supported by the evidence and there was no miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    128    As to the Chase-AMP count the appellant contended that there was no evidence fit to go to the jury that the statements alleged to be made by the appellant or by Mr Deans in her presence and with her concurrence were false in a material particular and false to her knowledge. Both before the trial judge and this Court the appellant relied on arguments which were substantially similar to those relied on as to the Bank of Tokyo count. The appellant contended that it appeared from the prosecution evidence that whatever statement was made as to drawing down $240 million from Citibank for the Tootal bid secured on Tootal shares, Chase-AMP were told that the money was drawn down. It made no difference whether the drawing down was from a Citibank loan or from an EFG loan. The appellant contended that Chase-AMP were made aware that the money drawn down was not free and unencumbered but tied up in the Tootal bid and secured. In any event the money had been paid back as Chase-AMP knew. The matter had historical interest only. It was submitted that the Crown case on materiality had to fail as the matter was not sufficiently significant. The reasons given earlier in relation to the Bank of Tokyo count apply in respect of this count. LGL did not have access to $240 million such as it claimed. 
     
      
    129    The Chase-AMP count (count 3) should have been left to the jury as the false statement alleged was material. Chase-AMP was not told the true overall position. The verdict was well supported by the evidence and there was no miscarriage of justice. I reject the appellant’s challenge. 
     
      
       
      The evidence led by the Crown as to guilt was overwhelming. The appellant’s convictions were inevitable on the evidence. She has not lost any reasonable possibility of being acquitted. 
       
      
    130    Each of the appeals against conviction on counts 1, 2 and 3 must be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Severity Appeal 
      
    131    The concurrent sentence imposed on each count was the maximum penalty of 5 years, comprising a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 2 years. Each of the offences arose out of the appellant forwarding the March 1989 accounts (or a draft thereof) to the banks and her oral or written statements as to those accounts to the banks. The appellant was the director responsible for organising credit facilities but she always acted at the behest of and under the direction of Mr Goldberg, the owner of the companies. He was the dominating force. She had staff under her. 
     
      
    132    The credit facilities involved large sums of money. She was not acting to secure financial advantages for herself but rather for the companies under Mr Goldberg’s control. She was a salaried employee. That is not the only consideration. The Bank of Tokyo advanced $10 million. 
     
      
    133    The appellant had an understanding of her duties and obligations which was seriously deficient. She lacked honesty and failed to tell the true story, which she knew, to the bankers. She was prepared to deceive them and did so. 
     
      
    134    The judge correctly proceeded upon the basis that the appellant had no previous convictions. He noted the evidence from three persons of repute who spoke of her in the highest terms. They spoke of her reputation for honesty and integrity, her devotion to her family and friends and her loyalty. 
     
      
    135    In his report of 21 October 1998 Dr John Phillips wrote that she was a 49 year old woman married with a fifteen and a half year old son. She comes from a relatively protected and comfortably placed middle class background. She is of high average or better intelligence. She has a University degree in accounting. She told Dr Phillips that she remained relatively unaware of the major problems faced by the Goldberg Group until fairly late in her employment with that organisation. She described herself as a creature of habit. In effect she had worked for the one organisation most of her life. She felt that her life had been on hold for the 7 years prior to the trial. Dr Phillips concluded that there were strong obsessional features in her personality and that she has a strong need to control any situation in which she finds herself. A lengthy custodial sentence may lead to significant psychological symptoms or at worst a frank psychiatric disorder. She is likely to be very lonely in prison. Most of the female prisoners are much younger and have a very different social, economic and cultural background. The appellant is not interested in drugs.  
     
      
    136    The remuneration received by the appellant was modest. For example, for the year ended 30 June 1988 her taxable income was $64,777 and that for the year ended 30 June 1989 was $63,351. She did not receive generous bonuses, shares or options. Her remuneration did not match her responsibilities. 
     
      
    137    The judge observed that it was not possible to determine if the true and parlous state of the Goldberg Group had been disclosed in August 1989 and thereafter what actions the banks and other creditors could have taken, but it was not unreasonable to conclude that the continuation of lines of credit and the granting of new lines of credit must have had an adverse effect on the position of the creditors. 
     
      
    138    The judge concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        “Despite the positive matters adverted to I regard the need for general deterrence to be essential. Directors of large commercial organisations have a great social responsibility to act honestly and responsibly, particularly when dealing with lending institutions. Commercial dealings are based on the need for trust and breaches of that trust can have and have had significant effect on the economic health of the nation. These offences are individually to be regarded as amongst the worst examples of this class of criminal activity. The maximum penalty applicable, as I have said, is one of five years imprisonment. I regard it as appropriate to impose such maximum sentences on each on a concurrent basis in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        As indicated I bear in mind the lack of any contrition. I do find however special circumstances being the prisoner’s previous good character, and the unlikelihood of further offences.”  
        
       
      
    139    The appellant submitted that the sentences were manifestly excessive and that the judge failed adequately to take into account that there was no evidence of any advantage, financial or otherwise which was received by the appellant as a result of the impugned false statements. She was a mere functionary answerable to Mr A Goldberg, the effective owner of the company. She submitted that the sentence was outside the range for the subject offences and was one more appropriate to an offender who had made the false statements for substantial personal gain.  
     
      
    140    The appellant further contended that the offences did not reveal a “worst case” situation because the Crown neither established nor sought to establish that anyone had suffered financial loss, she had not received any personal financial benefit, she had no prior criminal history, there were strong subjective factors and the case did not require personal deterrence. Her conviction would preclude her from holding further Directorships in companies and from obtaining employment in fields in which she had worked. 
     
      
    141    It was not an ingredient of the offence that someone had suffered financial loss or received a personal benefit. It is, however, reasonable to conclude that loss was probably suffered at least by the Bank of Tokyo. It advanced $10 million. 
     
      
    142    The appellant submitted that the judge was influenced by irrelevant factors. There was, she argued, no evidence that she was the instigator of the round robin transaction. The judge accepted that. She was not charged in relation to the round robin transaction. The judge regarded it as a device to deceive. This was a correct description. From the judge’s remarks, he regarded the transaction and some other matters as part of the context in which the offences occurred. She negotiated with the Banks knowing all about the transaction. I do not accept her submission that the judge dealt with her as if she was on trial for her participation in the round robin and for her role as a director of LTCL and LGL. Her directing role meant that she was the person with the knowledge to whom requests for information were directed. She responded to those requests. 
     
      
    143    The appellant submitted that in sentencing her the judge took into account irrelevant matters such as the appellant making no attempt to limit the issues and leaving most matters at large until her statement from the dock. The judge also referred to the procedural steps taken on her behalf including her initial pleas of guilty, her being given leave by the Court of Criminal Appeal to withdraw her pleas, the substitution of fresh charges and the failed application for a stay including a failed application or appeal from that refusal. 
     
      
    144    These were no more than observations designed to reform and shorten criminal trials and the reasons for the delay in the charges being finalised. For many years judges have dealt with matters of general importance in criminal trials in their remarks on sentence. This enables the community to become aware of deficiencies in the criminal justice system which need attention. The judge did not let these matters affect the sentences. 
     
      
    145    The appellant contended that the judge had attached undue weight to considerations of general deterrence and that this had led him to attach insufficient weight to the subjective factors and the special feature that she was in a subordinate position and had felt bound to carry out the instructions of the dominating Mr Goldberg. Reliance was placed on McDonald, (FCA), (1994) 71 A Crim R 370 at 380 and Corbett, (1991) 52 A Crim R 112 at 117. In the latter case the Court (Gleeson CJ, Priestley JA and Mathews J) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…once it has been decided to inflict a significant gaol term, it is not likely to be useful, in fixing its precise length, to increase it by refusing to give due weight to factors such as a plea of guilty, previous good record, previous positive contribution to the community, real prospects of rehabilitation; the impact upon a prisoner’s family, and the heavy weight of punishment inevitably involved in the loss of professional position and livelihood. These matters should be given real weight;, and it is only in the sense that the need for general deterrence will not normally allow them to reduce the sentence below a significant period of incarceration that it is right to speak of giving ‘the greatest weight to the element of general deterrence’”. 
        
       
      
    146    Corbett highlights the need for balance when dealing with general deterrence. Other matters favourable to a prisoner should not be ignored. 
     
      
    147    The Crown submitted that the judge was entitled to find that the appellant was much more than a mere functionary and held a position of considerable responsibility as one of the senior executives subordinate only to Mr Goldberg. I doubt if there is a great deal to be gained in trying to attach labels. What is clear is that the appellant had to carry out Mr Goldberg’s instructions. This does not mean that she could not discuss matters with him, or use her own initiative. Her task was to obtain and maintain credit facilities in accordance with his instructions. He needed money to keep his companies going. 
     
      
    148    The Crown submitted that in making each of the three sentences concurrent the principle of totality was properly applied. The Crown emphasised correctly that general deterrence is of particular importance in sentencing for serious white collar crime. In the course of dealings seeking the provision of extremely large sums in credit facilities to a major corporate group, the banks were, the Crown contended, entitled to rely on the accuracy of the information which they received from the appellant in her capacity as a senior executive, subordinate only to Mr Goldberg. The appellant’s false statements constituted an egregious abuse of this position of trust: Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330 and 338. I agree. 
     
      
    149    The Crown correctly pointed out that the offences involved very large sums of money as to both the subject of the false statements ($240 million recorded as cash in the accounts) and the financial advantage sought (new facilities of $10 million and $20 million and continuation of existing facilities of $20 million and $50 million): Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435. Further, these offences disclosed a deliberate, co-ordinated and recurring course of deception. 
     
      
    150    The Crown submitted that having regard to the matters outlined in the preceding three paragraphs it was open to the judge to find that the offences were among the worst examples of this class of criminal activity. It contended that the appellant’s subjective case was properly reflected in the finding of special circumstances and the proportional increase of the additional term. 
     
      
    151    The question of the correct sentence in the present case was and is a very difficult one. The materials leave me with the strong impression that the appellant was swept along by a dynamic entrepreneur with a dominating personality in a period of much activity and excitement. She had to do what she was told or resign. She became too pre-occupied with doing what he wanted, namely, to obtain money for his group of companies from the banks to achieve his personal ends. In this headlong rush, honesty and truthfulness were casualties. This is always a danger when the business methods employed sail too close to the wind. Her subordinate position was emphasised by her modest salary.  
     
      
    152    While the offences are serious I do not think they can fairly be regarded as amongst the worst type of offences of the kind in question warranting the maximum penalty. The setting in which they occurred, the dynamism and dominance of Mr Goldberg and the lack of any prospect of personal benefit or advantage cannot be ignored. There were also strong subjective factors. She had no prior convictions and was well thought of by people of good repute. She is now 50 years old, married with one child. Her career in the finance world has effectively been brought to an end. On the other hand credit facilities in large amounts were involved. The three offences occurred within a period of three months. General deterrence and the insistence upon honest conduct by company directors and executives is of prime importance. 
     
      
    153    I am persuaded that the sentences do not maintain the right balance between general deterrence and the other features of the case. To reflect the gravity of the offences which are a little below the worst type of cases a concurrent sentence of 4 years should be imposed on each count with a minimum term of two years three months. There are special circumstances. These include the appellant’s previous good character, the unlikelihood of further offences and this being the appellant’s first gaol sentence.  
     
      
    154    This case should stand as a stern warning to all company directors and company executives that they cannot simply go along with and implement the decisions of their superiors if their implementation involves them in dishonesty or making false statements to banks or others. Such directors and executives must refuse to engage in such conduct even if the result be that their services are terminated. Although that is hard, it is better than the alternative of a substantial period in gaol. The individual responsibility of each director and executive cannot be over emphasised. They should also realise that the Commonwealth Crown will prepare its case thoroughly making it hard to escape and that any trial is likely to be long and expensive.  
     
      
    155    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction on each count dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
        
       
      3. Appeal against sentences allowed; sentences quashed. 
       
       
        
        4. In lieu of the sentences imposed, the appellant is sentenced on each count to a minimum term of 2 years 3 months starting on 2 October 1998 and ending on 1 January 2001 and an additional term of 1 year 9 months starting on 2 January 2001.

     SPIGELMAN CJ DUNFORD J HIDDEN J FRIDAY, 10 DECEMBER 1999 
     
     R v Meliton PIMENTEL 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    2    DUNFORD J: On 12 February 1999, following a trial in the District Court of New South Wales, Meliton Pimentel (""the appellant"") was found guilty by a jury of an offence against s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       ""That between 1 September 1996 and 5 January 1997, at Port Stephens in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, was knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports to which s 233B of the  
       Customs Act 1901 
        applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cannabis resin, being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cannabis resin."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    3    Pursuant to s 235(2)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 the maximum penalty for such an offence is life imprisonment. The prescribed commercial quantity for cannabis resin is 50 kg. 
    4    On 25 February 1999 the appellant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Kinchington QC to imprisonment for a period of 6 years with a non parole period of 3 years and 9 months, to date from 9 January 1997. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    5    In about June or July 1996, Anton Verheggen (""Verheggen""), a resident of Belgium who conducted business as a shipping broker, was approached by a person named Van Dam with a request that he find a 2,000 tonne cargo ship for a proposed voyage to Manila. Following that contact, Verheggen inspected various vessels, after which he again met with Van Dam and informed him of the results of his inspections.  
    6    Subsequently, in about July/August of the same year, he was contacted by Thomas Cassidy (""Cassidy"") who described himself as a colleague of Van Dam and informed Verheggen that a vessel had been located, and asked him to assist in undertaking an inspection and survey. Following that conversation, Verheggen travelled from Belgium to Scheveningen in the Netherlands where he met with a number of people including Van Dam, and inspected the vessel referred to by Cassidy, which had originally been named the ""Annette J"" but which was later renamed the ""Hiddensee"", following which he informed Van Dam that in his opinion it ""looked good"". 
    7    Van Dam then requested Verheggen to attend to those matters which were necessary in order to register the vessel and to recruit a crew. In this regard, Verheggen telephoned the appellant (with whom he was previously acquainted from an earlier shipping contract) and thereafter travelled to Spain where the appellant then resided. The appellant and Verheggen met in Barcelona, at which time Verheggen asked the appellant to assist in finding crew members. The appellant indicated on that occasion that he would be able to do so as he had details of crew members with whom he had worked in the past. 
    8    The appellant proceeded to recruit the initial crew members in Spain. Once he had done so, Verheggen arranged air tickets for the crew to travel to the Netherlands. He also arranged to pay the crew members advances on their salaries, such funds having been made available by Van Dam. 
    9    Following these arrangements being made, Verheggen returned to Belgium and reported to Van Dam that the crew had been arranged. He subsequently met three of the crew members on their arrival in Belgium, and transported them to Scheveningen where they joined the vessel with others. Verheggen then returned to Belgium. 
    10    Some weeks after his return, Verheggen was contacted by the appellant who informed him that the vessel had been found to have a number of technical problems, to the extent that the Dutch engineer who had been recruited did not wish to remain. On the same evening Van Dam telephoned Verheggen and confirmed the difficulties which had been encountered. He then asked Verheggen to join the vessel and remain with it until it reached Gibraltar or Oman. Verheggen agreed and on the following day, 1 October 1996, he joined the vessel in Scheveningen. Upon arrival, Van Dam spoke to Verheggen and informed him for the first time that there would be a ""special cargo"" collected on the voyage, for which all members of the crew would be paid a ""bonus"" of 100,000 Dutch Florins. 
    11    Verheggen then took command of the Hiddensee which sailed from Scheveningen with the appellant and six other crew. The vessel initially sailed to Gibraltar, where it underwent repairs. During that initial part of the voyage the appellant remained the captain of the vessel, however in view of the mechanical problems which had already been encountered, Verheggen was largely responsible for its navigation due to his particular experience in sailing in the English Channel. 
    12    Whilst in Gibraltar, Verheggen met with Cassidy who confirmed the ""special cargo"" information which had previously been provided by Van Dam, and who also confirmed that a bonus would be paid to the crew. At the same time, Verheggen purchased a number of navigational charts for the balance of the voyage, including charts of Australia and adjacent waters. During this time in Gibraltar, the appellant was absent from the ship on leave. 
    13    After a period of 12 days in Gibraltar the Hiddensee sailed to Majorca where it underwent further repairs. After four days in Majorca, it sailed to Port Said, Egypt and it was in the course of that part of the voyage that Verheggen told the appellant, and five of the six crew members, that a ""special cargo"" was to be taken on board, for which a bonus would be paid. On that occasion Verheggen gave no precise indication of what the ""special cargo"" might be. 
    14    The Hiddensee reached Port Said before continuing on to Oman where it arrived at the end of October 1996. Further mechanical repairs were carried out whilst the Hiddensee was in port in Oman, prompting Verheggen to contact Van Dam and inform him of the repeated mechanical problems which were being encountered. Upon being made aware of the situation, Van Dam asked Verheggen to remain with the Hiddensee until the completion of its journey. At that time, Van Dam informed Verheggen that the ""special cargo"" to which he had previously referred was in fact four to five tonnes of cannabis. Having done so, he provided Verheggen with co-ordinates for a position approximately 300 miles off the coast of Pakistan at which the cargo was to be collected. He then directed Verheggen to proceed ""south west to Cape Leeuwin and then to the 33rd latitude"" where another boat would be waiting onto which the cargo was to be unloaded. 
    15    The Hiddensee remained in Oman for a total of 12 days, before sailing to the position nominated by Van Dam off the coast of Pakistan, where another vessel was waiting. The two vessels came together and having done so, large bags of cannabis resin were transferred to the Hiddensee with the assistance of the crew, including the appellant. 
    16    Having taken the cargo on board, the Hiddensee sailed directly to Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia, following which it sailed south of Tasmania before proceeding north along the East Coast to the position representing the ""33rd latitude"" which had earlier been nominated by Van Dam. The Hiddensee remained at that position for a period of 8 days, during which period Verheggen was in regular contact with Cassidy by telex who kept him informed of the arrangements for the transfer of the cargo. In preparation for the transfer, the bags of cannabis were placed on the deck of the Hiddensee by the crew and the appellant and on 4 January 1997, the Hiddensee made contact with another vessel, the ""Southern Cross,"" before meeting with that vessel at a location east of Port Stephens. The two vessels then tied together and the bags of cannabis were unloaded onto the Southern Cross. During that operation, the appellant assisted by transferring bags of cannabis resin to the Southern Cross with the assistance of a crane which was on the Hiddensee. 
    17    On 5 January 1997, Australian Federal Police and Customs Officers boarded the Southern Cross when that vessel was 0.093 nautical miles off Nelson Head and within Port Stephens, New South Wales. After the vessel was boarded, it was taken to the Fisherman's Co-operative Wharf at Nelson Bay in Port Stephens where a search of the vessel by federal agents and Customs officers revealed a quantity of bags containing packages of a resinous substance. All the bags and packages were taken ashore from the vessel by Australian Federal Police and Customs officers. Upon analysis the resinous substance was found to be cannabis resin. 
    18    Following the transfer of the cargo, the Hiddensee travelled to Noumea where the appellant, along with the crew and Verheggen, were arrested and later extradited to Australia. 
     
      
     Ground of Appeal 1 
      
    19    It was submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the facts relied on by the Crown to prove that there had been an importation into Australia. 
    20    This submission was based on the fact that the Southern Cross was boarded in Port Stephens by Customs officers and police before the cannabis resin was unloaded and before the vessel had docked, and it was the Customs officers and police who took it to the wharf and themselves unloaded the cannabis resin, thereby completing the importation. 
    21    In The Queen v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203 at 220 Barwick CJ said that to constitute importation the goods in question must have been brought within the limits of a port with the intention of landing them or must have been landed in Australia. Similarly, Gibbs J with whom Mason J agreed said (at 254) that goods are imported if they are brought into port with the intention of being discharged there. These goods were clearly brought into Port Stephens with the intention of being unloaded there, but the appellant argued, and the Crown conceded, that the references to ""port"" in Bull's case were references to a ""proclaimed port"" within the meaning of s 15 of the Customs Act and that as Port Stephens is not a ""proclaimed port"" the fact of the goods being brought into that port with the intention of them being unloaded was insufficient to constitute an importation in the absence of them actually being unloaded. 
    22    I am not sure that this concession was properly made. Bull's case, which involved the cargo being jettisoned after the crew was alerted by a surveillance helicopter and the ship being boarded out at sea, although within 3 nautical miles off the coastline and hence within territorial waters, was a very different factual situation to the present, and although for the purposes of that case, references were made to ""proclaimed ports"" I am by no means satisfied that the High Court was intending to define the point of importation differently in respect of ""proclaimed"" and other ports. Bearing in mind that illegal goods are not infrequently landed in remote locations away from proclaimed ports, it would create anomalies if importation were complete when the goods were brought into a proclaimed port with the intention of them being unloaded, but not if brought into another port with the same intention. It is however unnecessary to consider this matter further because of the concession made by the Crown, and I express no concluded view on it. 
    23    Having made its concession, the Crown relied on the evidence of unloading by Customs officers and police to prove the importation. No authority had been obtained under Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1912 and accordingly, so the argument ran, the unloading and hence the importation was illegal, being contrary to s 233B(1)(b). The Crown accepted that this was the position but asked the judge to exercise his discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 to admit such evidence, which application his Honour acceded to. 
    24    Counsel for the appellant submitted that the discretion was wrongly exercised and referred to Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19, but that was a very different case in that the police there instigated, organised and took part in the whole operation leading to the importation which would not otherwise have taken place, whereas here the police merely intervened at or near the very end of the importation process to prevent the narcotic goods being landed and becoming available to the Australian population. Moreover, there was no deliberate flouting of the laws. Detective Superintendent Tinker believed (it is conceded erroneously) that because the Southern Cross was within 12 nautical miles off the coast the importation was complete and he was entitled to board the vessel and arrest those on board. If he waited a little longer the crew of the Southern Cross would undoubtedly have brought it to rest and commenced to unload the cannabis resin. The importation, on any definition of that word, was virtually complete and the most that can be said is that he intervened a little too early. He was also concerned that there may have been violence when the Southern Cross was boarded and its crew arrested and in the interests of safety he wanted the issue resolved before darkness was complete. In these circumstances it was highly proper for the discretion to be exercised as it was, and his Honour was correct to admit the evidence. It could have been argued that to refuse to admit the evidence in the circumstances of this case would have been a perverse and erroneous exercise of the discretion. 
     
      
     Ground of Appeal 2 
      
    25    The second ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had a case to answer. In particular it was submitted that there had to be evidence from which it could be inferred that the appellant had actual knowledge that the cargo was destined to be imported into Australia and admissible evidence of an actual importation into Australia. 
    26    In relation to the latter point, it was submitted that, absent the acts of Customs and police officers, there had been no completed importation by the Hiddensee or the Southern Cross; and that although at the time the Southern Cross was boarded it was well within Port Stephens, there was nothing to prevent its crew turning it around, taking it somewhere else and not landing its cargo in Australia. Put another way, the only importation was that completed by the Customs officers and police unloading the Southern Cross, and the appellant was not concerned in that. As to knowledge, it was submitted that there was no evidence the appellant knew the destination of the cargo and the off-loading from the Hiddensee to the Southern Cross amounted to no more than the cargo being in transit to a destination unknown to the appellant, and we were referred to the dictum of Gibbs CJ in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 531. 
    27    There is an air of unreality about these submissions. Once the evidence of the police and Customs officers was admitted there was evidence of an actual importation (see ground 1). The appellant may not have been aware of the destination of the cannabis resin when it was taken on board in the middle of the Arabian Sea (although such ignorance is probably unlikely), but after that he was party to navigating the ship on a course south to Cape Leeuwin on the south western tip of Western Australia and then easterly south of Australia and Tasmania (where the ship was buffeted by storms and discussions took place with Verheggen on whether to abandon the cargo and put into port), after which the ship sailed north to the 33rd parallel and stood 200 nautical miles off the New South Wales coast waiting for its rendezvous with the Southern Cross. 
    28    In those circumstances there was in my opinion no other reasonable inference open to the jury but that at least by that time, if not before, the appellant knew the cargo was destined for Australia, and the evidence establishes that at the end of the 8 days and with such knowledge, he took an active part (operating the crane) in the transhipping of the cargo to a smaller vessel so that it could be landed in Australia. This was an active step in furtherance of the importation, and it does not matter that he was not actively involved at the time the importation was completed. To suggest that the Southern Cross might have turned around after entering Port Stephens and headed somewhere else to discharge its cargo begs the obvious question ""where else?"" 
    29    I am satisfied that on the Crown case it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an importation and that the appellant took part in that importation. 
     
      
     Ground of Appeal 3 
      
    30    The third ground of appeal relates to the failure of the trial judge to leave the issue of duress to the jury. Defence counsel made a specific request, which was refused, although his Honour did leave the issue of voluntariness to the jury. 
    31    The appellant, as was his right, declined to be interviewed by police and did not give evidence at his trial, so to raise the possibility that the appellant acted under duress, it was necessary to rely on such inferences as might reasonably have been open from the Crown case, particularly the evidence of Mr Verheggen. 
    32    Counsel for the appellant relied particularly on evidence that, although they had been told before passing through Port Said that there was to be a ""special cargo"" and the crew would share in a bonus of 100,000 Dutch florins which, having regard to the decrepit nature of the ship, must at least have excited suspicions that the cargo was some form of illegal substance, they were not told in advance of the nature of the cargo, the dhow from which the cannabis resin came was armed, and that an attempt was made by the appellant to stop the loading from the dhow onto the Hiddensee, but after Verheggen spoke to the skipper of the dhow, he told the appellant and the crew that they could not refuse to take the cargo. 
    33    Moreover, during the voyage it appears that the option of throwing the cargo overboard was discussed, but Verheggen told some crew members, including the appellant, a story about how a Dutch mariner who had thrown a cargo overboard was the subject of a revenge attack at his home, and on another occasion he told the appellant and other crew members: ""If they find out we throw it overboard without any reason, they will have revenge and [the family] will be in trouble or in danger"". 
    34    In relation to the suggestion that the appellant attempted to stop the loading from the dhow to the Hiddensee, the evidence is not that clear. The transcript of Verheggen's evidence (pp 49-50) discloses that after the vessels tied up and the lights were turned on the crew of the dhow commenced to throw the bags of cannabis resin onto the bridge and Verheggen who was on the bridge told the appellant to go down and tell them to stop whereupon he went and spoke to the skipper of the dhow and they stopped loading the bags and called Verheggen who went down himself and spoke with the skipper with the appellant at his side. The skipper told Verheggen they had to take the cargo or they would ""be in a big problem"", so Verheggen agreed, told his crew they could not refuse to take the cargo and the loading resumed, the appellant assisting. As I read the evidence the appellant only attempted to stop the loading on the instructions of Verheggen and there is nothing to suggest that this was because of the nature of the cargo, rather than because of the way it was being thrown on board. 
    35    The accused does not have to establish that he acted under duress. The Crown must establish that he acted voluntarily and in order to do so must eliminate any reasonable possibility that he acted under duress. 
    36    The matters which the Crown must negative when an issue of duress is raised are: 
     
     1. The making of an actual threat, 
      
     2. That the threat must be of death or serious injury to the accused or his family, 
      
     3. That the threat was of such gravity that a person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same sex and maturity as the accused, would have yielded to the threat in the way that the accused did, and 
      
     4. That the accused acted as he did because of the threat which was still acting on his mind at the time of the criminal act:  
     R v Abusafiah  
     (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 544-5. 
      
    37    For such a threat to be effective it must be continuing and be seen to be continuing and such threat will not be continuing and effective if the accused has a reasonable opportunity to render the threat ineffective: R v Williamson [1972] 2 NSWLR 281 at 283, 300.  
    38    In the present case the evidence established that the appellant was prepared to engage in the carrying of some ""special cargo"" in a vessel which was hardly seaworthy in return for a share of 100,000 Dutch florins. There was no evidence that his motive in trying to stop the loading was that he objected to the nature of the cargo, but the evidence rather suggests that he acted on behalf of Verheggen who objected to the manner in which the cargo was being thrown on board. There was no suggestion that the stories told by Verheggen of what had happened to other persons who had thrown a cargo overboard was at the hands of people connected with the present voyage, no evidence of any actual threat of death or serious injury made to the appellant, no evidence that he could not have stopped the operation by sending a radio message or such like and, most of all, no evidence that any alleged threats induced him to do something which he would not have been happy to do if no such threats had been made. In these circumstances there was no material proper to be considered on the issue of duress and his Honour was correct in not leaving it to the jury. This ground is not made out. 
     
      
     Ground of Appeal 4 
      
    39    This ground, which was that the judge failed to adequately put the defence case to the jury, was not pressed. 
     
      
     Crown Appeal Against Sentence 
      
    40    There is also an appeal by the Crown against the sentence of 6 years imposed on Mr Pimentel (to whom I shall continue to refer to as ""the appellant"") on the ground of inadequacy. In sentencing the appellant, his Honour found that although not initially aware of the nature of the ""special cargo"" for which the crew was to receive a bonus at a later stage of the ship's voyage the appellant became aware that such special cargo was to consist of a large quantity of cannabis resin and that the cargo was destined for Australia and that thereafter he knowingly and willingly participated in the journey and the transportation of the narcotic good and willingly participated in the illegal operation for reward by way of the bonus earlier referred to and in particular that off the Australian coast he helped discharge the cargo onto the Southern Cross in order to facilitate its importation into Australia. His Honour said that he had no doubt that the appellant took his orders from Verheggen but went on, 
     
      
       
       ""I have no doubt that you ascertained the nature of the cargo from Verheggen and the destination of the cargo and that you freely, consciously and knowingly participated in the venture thereafter."" 
       
      
      
     His Honour also noted the size of the cargo, approximately 10 tonnes, the damage it would have done to the community if it had been successfully landed, the needs for specific and general deterrence and the need to reflect the community's abhorrence for this type of criminal activity. His Honour noted a number of subjective features favourable to the appellant but also noted that he had three prior convictions for narcotic type offences in Germany for which he had been sentenced to periods of incarceration for up to 7 years, but that he had apparently served little or none of that time and would be incarcerated if he returned to Germany.  
      
    41    The co-offender, Verheggen had previously been sentenced by his Honour Judge Howie QC for his part in the importation. Judge Howie had assessed the criminality of Verheggen as warranting a term of imprisonment of 8 years but he had reduced that by 25% because of the matters which he identified including Verheggen's plea of guilty, that he had no prior convictions, that he had co-operated with the authorities prior to the sentencing process and had undertaken to continue such co-operation which he had subsequently demonstrated by giving evidence for the Crown in the appellant's trial. It was conceded by the Crown that the appellant's criminality was less than that of Verheggen but his Honour correctly observed that the principles of parity required that he look at the sentence of Verheggen to determine an appropriate sentence in respect of the appellant, as his Honour did. He took into account the lesser degree of criminality on the part of the appellant and balanced this factor against Verheggen's plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, and ultimately determined that those factors cancelled each other out and accordingly he imposed on the appellant the same sentence as Judge Howie had imposed on Verheggen, namely 6 years imprisonment.  
    42    The Crown's submission was that in approaching the matter in this way, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that unlike Verheggen, the appellant did not plead guilty, did not assist the authorities and had three prior convictions for narcotic related offences committed overseas. The second of these matters (that the appellant did not assist the authorities) can be simply disposed of because his Honour made considerable reference to this aspect of distinction between the two offenders. In discussing the parity issue his Honour did not specifically refer to the fact that unlike Verheggen the appellant had not pleaded guilty or to his prior convictions, but he did refer in his Remarks on Sentence to the prior convictions and as an experienced trial and sentencing judge I am satisfied that he must have had the appellant's prior convictions and Verheggen's plea of guilty in mind in making his overall comparison of the two offenders. The sentence imposed, for an offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, is on the face of it at the lower end of the scale, but having regard in particular to the sentence imposed on Verheggen and the principles of double jeopardy as they relate to Crown appeals I am not satisfied that the sentence is such as to justify the intervention of this Court. 
    43    I would therefore dismiss both the appeal against conviction and the Crown appeal against sentence and confirm the conviction and the sentence.

     1      
     HANDLEY JA:  
     I agree with Grove J. 
      
     2      
     GROVE J 
      : 
       
     I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hidden J in draft form. His Honour has extracted a sketch of the relevant facts from the remarks of the learned sentencing judge and I would gratefully adopt them and refrain from repetition. 
      
       
      
     3      
     I do not share the conclusion of Hidden J that this Court should intervene to reduce the sentence and it is convenient to state my reasons by reference to his Honour’s ultimate view that the sentencing judge “fell into error in holding that the applicant’s psychiatric history provided no explanation for the crime”. 
      
       
      
     4      
     The relevant psychiatric evidence consisted of a report from a psychiatrist Dr Peter Klug. He saw the appellant once whilst the latter was in custody. Mental state examination was reported as disclosing no evidence of psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, an organic brain syndrome, a traumatic brain injury, confusion, delirium, intoxication, withdrawal, agitation or cognitive impairment. He was said to have provided a coherent and internally consistent history. As Hidden J has noted, the appellant gave a demonstrably false explanation for the shooting to Dr Klug and was otherwise an apparently undependable historian. There would be no error manifest in the sentencing judge so regarding him. What were collated as relevant psychiatric issues (emerging from an unreliable historian) were in summary described under six point headings. Possible convulsions as a child was the first, followed by disturbed dynamics within developmental years, a history of inability to control anger and aggression, the intensive use of anabolic steroids over one to two years (1990-91), poly drug abuse and dependence and a history of extreme irritability and violence to property. The details elaborated in relation to these points need not be recounted.  
      
       
      
     5      
     The summarized opinion of Dr Klug was that the appellant was a twenty three year old man who had a significant past psychiatric history and a long history of poly drug abuse and dependence. He thought, upon the history related to him, that at the time of the commission of the offence the appellant was probably intoxicated with a variety of drugs. He went on to note an opinion that the appellant was aware of the nature and quality of his actions and the possible consequences of them but probably had some lengthy amnesic episodes. 
      
       
      
     6      
     In his remarks the learned sentencing judge stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “I cannot see that the prisoner’s previous irrational behaviour or his abuse of steroids, cannabis and LSD played any real part in his initial decision to take a pistol and to attempt to rob the complainant of his money or in his subsequent decision to kill the wounded victim of the attempted robbery.” 
         
        
       
      
     7      
     I consider that that conclusion was open to his Honour and no error such as to attract the power of this Court to intervene has been shown. Further I am of the view that the psychiatric material did not mandate an element of particular leniency in the assessment of sentence. Explanatory material is of limited utility unless in a case such as the present it is attractive of mitigation. The essential question is whether sentencing discretion has miscarried. It did not. 
      
       
      
     8      
     Undoubtedly the sentence is capable of being viewed as severe but as Hidden J has noted the facts of the offence are grave indeed. In the terms of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act I am unpersuaded that a less severe sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed and I would dismiss the appeal.

     HIDDEN J 
     : The applicant, Adriano Guiseppe Manna, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him at the Penrith District Court after he pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding with intent to murder. He was sentenced to penal servitude for twenty years, comprising a minimum term of fifteen years and an additional term of five years.  
      
       
        
       Facts

     The facts of the offence are grave indeed. They were summarised by the learned sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         At about 4pm on 17 February 1997 the complainant, who had a contract with Coca Cola Amatil to restock Coca Cola vending machines, attended the Werrington TAFE College to restock the college’s vending machines. He was alone, but he was to meet his wife and their children at the college. He went to one of the machines, unlocked it, counted the remaining stock to determine the number of cans needed to refill the machine, removed the money from the machine’s money box, re-locked the machine and returned to his truck with the money from the machine. At his truck, he placed the money in the truck’s safe, gathered together a number of cartons containing cans with which to refill the machine and returned to the machine with the cartons. At the machine, he unlocked the machine and was placing cans from the cartons in to it when he was joined by his wife and children. After using all of the cans that he had taken to the machine, he realised that he needed another carton and so returned to his truck, leaving his wife to guard the unlocked machine. He opened the middle roller shutter of three shutters on the side of the truck and jumped onto the truck’s tray to obtain another carton and was about to jump from the tray to the ground with the carton when he was confronted by the prisoner who was standing alongside the truck and who was holding a silver pistol in his right hand and who demanded that he give him his money. He told the prisoner that he could not give him any money as he did not have the keys to the safe. Then the prisoner demanded that he give him the keys to the machines. He told the prisoner that he would give him the keys and he put his hand into his pocket to get the keys. Then the prisoner fired one shot from the pistol at the complainant. The bullet struck the complainant in the chest and he fell from the truck’s tray onto the ground. Then the prisoner aimed the pistol at the complainant and fired another four shots from the pistol at him. These bullets struck the complainant in the face, left elbow, right hand and left thigh. Then the prisoner ran away from the scene of the shooting. 
         
        
       
      
     11      
     As one would expect, this incident has had serious consequences for the victim and his family. As his Honour observed, “it was only by the grace of God” that the victim was not killed. He required extensive surgery and follow-up medical treatment. He has been left with significant disabilities. His lifestyle has been gravely affected, as has that of his wife and children. Of particular concern is the impact of this event upon one of the children, a boy then aged seven, who witnessed the shooting. 
      
       
      
     12      
     The applicant was arrested two days later. When interviewed by police, he admitted having shot the victim but would not disclose why he had done so. Some months later, when interviewed by a psychiatrist for forensic purposes, he said that the shooting occurred in the course of a confrontation with the victim who, he believed, had been supplying heroin to a young girl whom he knew. Clearly, this account is false. It was not advanced as an explanation in the sentence proceedings and, as his Honour observed, it was inconsistent with the known circumstances of the case. The applicant did not give evidence, and his Honour was unable to assess whether he believed what he had told the psychiatrist. 
      
       
        
       Subjective case 
        
       
      
     13      
     The applicant was twenty-three years old at the time of the offence, and is now twenty-six. He has a criminal record, primarily for driving and dishonesty offences, but it includes convictions for supplying a prohibited drug, malicious damage and possessing a shortened firearm. At the time of the offence he had not long completed serving a short prison term. He was then living with his father, who was separated from his mother. His relationship with his mother had been poor for a long time. 
      
       
      
     14      
     His father’s evidence about his background, and his behaviour in the period leading up to the offence, is significant. He was given to disruptive and violent behaviour at school, such that his schooling came to an end at the age of fifteen without his obtaining his School Certificate. In his later teens he began to use steroids to achieve muscle growth. His abuse of those drugs escalated over the ensuing years, to the point where he was taking them in tablet form and by injection in large quantities. His behaviour was aggressive, and he would frequently damage items of property in bursts of anger. He refused to cooperate with his parents’ efforts to arrange for his treatment and counselling. He also drank heavily at times and used other drugs: in particular, cannabis, ecstasy and LSD. 
      
       
      
     15      
     The situation worsened late in 1995, when his girlfriend left him after a relationship of some years. His aggressive behaviour became even more bizarre. It included incidents when he stabbed a CD player with a knife and took to the family car with a mattock. On one occasion his father found him in the car with a piece of hosepipe leading from the exhaust to the interior, apparently trying to asphyxiate himself. On another, he threatened to shoot himself with a rifle. While the second occasion may have been no more than a gesture, the first occasion appears to have been a serious suicide attempt. 
      
       
      
     16      
     There were further exhibitions of this kind of behaviour in the period leading up to the offence. One morning, saying that he needed to do something to occupy himself, he tried to cut the lawn with a machete. On another occasion he threatened to shoot himself with a hand-gun, which may have been the weapon used in the offence. On the night before the offence he was very angry, apparently believing that his girlfriend had had an abortion. 
      
       
      
     17      
     He told the psychiatrist, who prepared a report for the sentence proceedings, that he was under stress at the time of the offence for a number of reasons, including the fact that he was unemployed, was arguing with his father about work and money, and was unsuccessful in attempts to re-establish a relationship with his girlfriend. He was using LSD, and his Honour accepted that he was affected by that drug “to some degree” at the time of the shooting. At the time he examined him in custody, the psychiatrist found no indication of a psychosis or an organic brain disorder. However, he noted in his report that abuse of steroids “can cause persistent alterations of personality and behaviour”. He saw the applicant as a man having “a significant past psychiatric history and a long history of poly-drug abuse and dependence”. He added that he “appears currently well but may have suffered the residual effects of long-term steroid dependence…”. 
      
       
      
     18      
     The author of a pre-sentence report was concerned about the applicant’s mental state, noting that he “at times has little self-control and yet on other occasions is able to act in a very appropriate manner”. The probation officer considered it necessary that he have “ongoing psychiatric/psychological intervention” whilst in custody, and that “his eventual release should be contingent upon him being assessed as no longer a homicide risk”. 
      
       
        
       Remarks on sentence 
        
       
      
     19      
     His Honour accepted the evidence of the applicant’s father and the material contained in the reports about his history of irrational behaviour and drug abuse. However, he saw no direct relationship between that history and the offence, except in so far as “the way in which he has lived his life may have played a part in his decision to attempt to rob the complainant when armed with the pistol”. Having rejected the false account the applicant gave the psychiatrist to the effect that the shooting occurred during a confrontation with a man he believed to be a drug dealer, his Honour concluded that the applicant “shot the complainant four times intending to kill him simply because the armed robbery of the complainant… had gone wrong”. 
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
      
     20      
     The principal argument for the applicant in this Court was that it was not open to his Honour to find that the history of irrational behaviour had no bearing upon the commission of the offence. As this is a matter of inference from the whole of the material, and does not depend upon the assessment of the credibility of any witness in the sentence proceedings, it is something which we are as well placed as his Honour was to determine.  
      
       
      
     21      
     In my view, the submission is sound. His Honour appears to have reached the conclusion he did primarily because he rejected the explanation of the shooting which the applicant proffered to the psychiatrist. Certainly, that explanation is false. In other respects, which I need not set out, the applicant appears to have been an unreliable historian. However, it does not follow from the rejection of that account that this was simply an armed robbery gone horribly wrong, to which the applicant’s psychiatric history is irrelevant. The true picture is more complicated than that.  
      
       
      
     22      
     It may be that, as the victim put his hand in his pocket to get his keys, the applicant thought he was reaching for a weapon of some kind. To have shot him once at that stage, as he did, is one thing. To have shot him another four times while he was on the ground is quite another. It is not without significance that the victim told a psychologist, who prepared a victim impact statement, that he remembered “the look of hatred” in the applicant’s eyes as he was firing the gun. He expressed his difficulty in understanding that “someone who did not know him could appear to hate him”. For my part, I am satisfied that the repeated shooting is consistent with the applicant’s history of mindless and aggressive behaviour over the years. Indeed, it appears to be the dreadful culmination of an escalating pattern of behaviour of that kind since the breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend, a pattern which endured right up to the time of the offence. 
      
       
      
     23      
     I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error in holding that the applicant’s psychiatric history provided no explanation for the crime. Accordingly, leave to appeal should be granted and this Court should determine for itself the appropriate sentence. The question remains, however, whether that sentence should be different from that which his Honour passed: s6(3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     .  
      
       
        
       Re-sentence 
        
       
      
     24      
     The familiar principles governing the sentencing of an offender who is psychiatrically disordered were summarised by Gleeson CJ in  
     R v Engert  
     (1995) 84 ACrim R 67 at 70-1. Among other things, his Honour said that the relationship between a mental disorder and the commission of an offence is one of the circumstances of the case to be taken into account when applying general sentencing principles. His Honour continued (at 71): 
      
       
        
         
         The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence 
         … . … 
          the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. 
         
        
       
      
     25      
     I have referred to the admonition of the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report of the need to assess the risk which the applicant might pose to society before releasing him on parole. The psychiatric report is silent about his long term prognosis. The sentencing judge, after referring to his background, his criminal record and his need for appropriate treatment and counselling in prison, commented that it was “impossible to say whether or not he will change his ways but everything that he has done in the past suggests that he is unlikely to do so”. Senior counsel who appeared for him in this Court acknowledged that he could not challenge that conclusion. 
      
       
      
     26      
     In the result, the applicant’s psychiatric history provides some explanation for this violent offence and, to that extent, reduces his culpability for it. This, however, is substantially offset by the need for particular deterrence and, above all, the protection of the public. His condition should be taken into account but, in the circumstances, it cannot afford him any marked measure of leniency. On the other hand, of course, it must not lead to the imposition of a sentence more severe than that which would have been appropriate if he were not suffering from any mental abnormality:  
     Veen v The Queen [No 2]  
     (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 477. 
      
       
      
     27      
     Senior counsel for the applicant referred us to a number of decisions of this Court in more or less comparable cases, together with sentencing statistics provided by the Judicial Commission. A summary of the cases is set out in a schedule to this judgment. The statistics are derived from a relatively small sample, twenty-three cases, but the pattern of sentence which they disclose is much as one would expect. Against a statutory maximum of twenty-five years, a sentence of twenty years penal servitude is exceptional and right at the top of the range. 
      
       
      
     28      
     This is consistent with the sentences in the cases set out in the schedule. This Court upheld a sentence of twenty years in  
     Applebee  
     but, quite apart from the high level of criminality involved in the offence, that sentence was partly concurrent with a lengthy existing prison term. In the related cases of  
     Papalia 
      (wound with intent to murder) and  
     Azzopardi  
     (solicit to murder), this Court accepted that twenty years was an appropriate starting point before allowance was made for subjective matters favourable to the applicants. However, that was a case of a contract killing which was unsuccessful, but which left the victim permanently and seriously disabled. 
      
       
      
     29      
     The present case is very serious but, upon a proper balance of the objective and subjective factors, it does not call for a sentence of that order. Nevertheless, a lengthy sentence is inevitable. Clearly, there are special circumstances warranting an extended additional term. It will remain to be seen whether the applicant could responsibly be released at the expiration of the minimum term which I propose. Obviously, it is in the community’s interest that he be rehabilitated and, in my view, that would best be achieved by his being at liberty for a lengthy period with the benefit of supervision and subject to the sanction of parole. 
      
       
      
     30      
     In arriving at what I consider to be the appropriate sentence, I have had regard to evidence tendered in this Court of the applicant’s completion of various courses since he has been in custody. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentence in the District Court quashed. I would re-sentence the applicant to penal servitude for eighteen years, comprising a minimum term of twelve years, commencing on 19 February 1997 and expiring on 18 February 2009, and an additional term of six years. 
      
       
        
        
       Schedule 
        
        
       Sindoni  
       (unreported, 27 April 1993): The applicant was convicted at trial of wounding his sister’s husband with intent to murder him. He believed that the victim had been violent to his sister. He shot the victim in the abdomen and, after he had fallen to the ground, shot him two or three more times. He then struck him on the head with the butt of the pistol. The victim underwent surgery and made a substantial recovery. The applicant presented a very favourable subjective case, and the offence was seen as an isolated act of criminality. 
        
        
       He was sentenced to 8 years penal servitude (MT 6 years, AT 2 years). An appeal against sentence was dismissed, McInerney J observing that the sentence was “to the bottom of the range”. 
        
        
       Cool  
       (unreported, 2 June 1994): The applicant was convicted at trial of wounding with intent to murder, having stabbed a passenger on a train in the neck. He was affected either by liquor or drugs at the time, and there was no apparent motive for the crime. 
        
        
       For that offence, and taking into account several less serious offences, he was sentenced to 10 years (MT 7 years, AT 3 years). That sentence was accumulated upon a minimum term of 6 years imposed by another judge in respect of a serious drug offence, and the sentencing judge assessed it with an eye to totality. An appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
        
        
       Merritt  
       (unreported, 26 February 1996): The applicant pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to murder, maliciously shoot at to prevent lawful apprehension, maliciously discharge a firearm with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, and common assault. The applicant entered a hotel and shot the publican, wounding him in the right shoulder. Shortly afterwards, he pointed his rifle in a threatening manner at a woman in a motor vehicle (the common assault charge). Later again, when police tried to apprehend him, he fired a shotgun in their direction, narrowly missing one of them (the charges of shoot and discharge firearm with intent to prevent lawful apprehension). The applicant was grossly affected by alcohol and drugs at the time, and the sentencing judge had regard to his Aboriginal background. 
        
        
       His Honour passed concurrent sentences designed to reflect the totality of the applicant’s criminality, the effective sentence being 13 years penal servitude (MT 9 years, AT 4 years). An appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
        
        
       Nguyen 
        (unreported, 13 June 1991): The appellant was convicted at trial of wounding with intent to murder in the course of a violent incident in a restaurant. In the course of that incident, he was wounded when a gun held by a man seated at a table in the restaurant accidentally discharged. He himself was armed, and he shot another man seated at the same table at close range. Despite the circumstances, this Court held that the trial judge had correctly characterised that shooting as a “cold-blooded attempt at murder”. Nevertheless, the judge had taken into account the fact that he was affected by alcohol at the time and was himself injured, requiring extensive hospital treatment. 
        
        
       The sentence, passed under the regime prior to the  
       Sentencing Act  
       1989, was penal servitude for 17 years with a non-parole period of 13 years. An appeal against that sentence was dismissed. 
        
        
       Papalia  
       (unreported, 18 July 1996): The applicant pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to murder and another offence of no present consequence. He was engaged to murder the victim, who was not known to him. He shot the victim three times, causing him to fall to the ground, whereupon he shot him two more times. The victim’s injuries were life-threatening, he was hospitalised for many months, and was left a paraplegic. He was in his mid-forties, married with two children. The applicant had a criminal record, including convictions for armed robbery. 
        
        
       The sentencing judge considered that, but for some assistance which the applicant offered to the authorities in the prosecution of others involved in the affair, the appropriate sentence was penal servitude for 20 years. Because of the offer of assistance, he reduced the sentence to 13 years (MT 9 years, AT 4 years). An appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
        
        
       Azzopardi  
       (unreported, 1 October 1998): This appellant was convicted at trial of soliciting Papalia to murder the victim referred to in the previous case. He was a man in his mid-fifties, having no criminal record and suffering from a life-threatening disease. 
        
        
       He was sentenced to the term which the judge would have imposed upon Papalia but for his offer of assistance: 20 years penal servitude (MT 15 years, AT 5 years). Given his subjective circumstances, this Court reduced that sentence to 17 years (MT 12 years, AT 5 years). 
        
        
       Applebee  
       (unreported, 16 July 1991): The applicant was convicted at trial of wounding with intent to murder, and robbery with corporal violence, the charges arising out of the same incident. He was one of two men, both of them armed, who robbed the licensee of a hotel. As they fled, they were pursued by one of the hotel’s patrons. The applicant’s accomplice fired a shotgun at that man twice, on the second occasion causing a serious and life-threatening wound. In this Court, Grove J considered the case to be “one of the most serious of its type”, noting “the deliberate robbery and the final act of shooting a concerned citizen who sought to do something about this violent crime”. 
        
        
       He was sentenced on the charge of wounding with intent to murder to penal servitude for 20 years (MT 15 years, AT 5 years) and on the robbery charge to a lesser concurrent term. However, those terms themselves were partly concurrent with terms of imprisonment, effectively of 10 years, which had previously been imposed upon the applicant for other offences in the Australian Capital Territory.

     BORIS MENDOZA-TORRICO v REGINA (NSW) 
       
     
     JUDGMENT 
     1   JAMES J: Boris Mendoza-Torrico has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court by his Honour Judge Freeman, after he had pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years and two counts of committing an act of indecency with a child under the age of 10 years. 
     
      
    2   All of the offences were committed against the same victim, a girl, who was apparently nine years old when the offences were committed. The victim was a daughter of a sister of the applicant's de facto wife. 
     
      
    3   On the third count Judge Freeman imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for nine months to date from 23 April 1999, which was the day, or the day before the day, on which Judge Freeman passed sentence. 
     
      
    4   On the second count, Judge Freeman imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months, also to date from 23 April 1999. 
     
      
    5   On the first count his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years, consisting of a minimum term of two years, also to date from 23 April 1999, and an additional term of two years. The third count was the count alleging sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    6   As all the sentences were made to commence from 23 April 1999, the effective sentence was the sentence imposed on the first count. 
     
      
    7   The objective facts of the offences can be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    8   In about 1996 the applicant formed a de facto relationship with the victim's aunt. The applicant consequently came in contact with his de facto wife's sister, the victim's mother. The two sisters then had a close relationship. At one stage they lived together and when not living together they frequently visited each other. 
     
      
    9   The facts of the offence charged in the third count, which was the first of the offences to have been committed, were stated by the sentencing judge in his remarks in sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The first offence in time is said to have taken place at the prisoner and his partner's unit, when the two women had gone, he thinks, to get a video. The prisoner was watching television in his bedroom. The child came in and lay on the bed. He began to kiss her on the mouth inserting his tongue. He certainly moved her clothing, if not entirely removed it, kissed her on the body from the neck and then kissed her on the vagina and placed his hand on her."" 
        
       
      
    10   The facts of the offence charged in the second count, which was the next offence to have been committed, were stated by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""at the unit occupied by the child and her mother, with the women apparently both present within another room, the applicant engaged in open mouth kissing [of the child] which he describes as like the way he would kiss a girlfriend."" 
        
       
      
    11   The facts of the offence charged in the first count, which was the most serious offence and which incurred the heaviest penalty, were stated by the sentencing judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The first count, that of sexual intercourse, occurred at the prisoner's unit. He had showered and dressed in the same room as the child and then again removed his shirt ... He began to kiss the child again. She protested, identifying her appreciation of the wrongfulness of the prisoner's approach by telling him that he had ""V"" (the applicant's de facto wife). The prisoner proceeded with kissing the child's face, mouth, inserting his tongue. He pulled up her t-shirt, kissed her breasts, her belly and finally pulled down her pants and underclothes and licked her vagina and inside of her vagina."" 
        
       
      
    12   His Honour regarded the offences as objectively serious. His Honour observed that this was not a case of a one-off yielding to some spontaneous urge but a case of a repeated pattern of behaviour. The applicant was, in effect, a member of the victim's family who had been entrusted with the supervision of the victim and who had breached that trust. On the other hand, in favour of the applicant, his Honour accepted that the offences did not involve penile penetration, nor had there been violence or overt aggression. 
     
      
    13   At the time he was sentenced the applicant was 35 years old. He had been born in Bolivia. He had had what his Honour described as a wretched childhood. He had been subjected to physical violence and sexual abuse. When he was six years old his father had committed suicide in his presence by dousing himself with petrol and then setting himself alight. 
     
      
    14   The applicant had married an Australian woman in Bolivia and had migrated to Australia in 1994. However, after they had arrived in Australia, he and his wife had separated. In about 1996 the applicant entered into his relationship with the victim's aunt. 
     
      
    15   The applicant had qualified as a mechanic in Bolivia but his qualifications had not been recognised in Australia. In Australia he had worked regularly in such jobs as a cleaner and a carpark attendant. His Honour found that he was a hard-working and productive member of the community. 
     
      
    16   In his remarks on sentence his Honour accepted that on 4 October 1998 the applicant had voluntarily gone to the police and had taken part in a long electronically recorded interview in which he had made extensive admissions, including admissions of offences, which, at least up to that time, had not been disclosed by the victim. It was suggested by the Crown in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant had gone to the police so as to put on record his version of what had happened, the applicant knowing that it was probable that the victim's mother or grandmother would soon report him to the police. The sentencing judge observed: ""That may detract, to a certain extent, from the willingness displayed by the prisoner but in my view it is a marginal matter. The fact is that instead of hiding his head in the sand he did go and make full disclosure"". 
     
      
    17   His Honour also noted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, that the applicant's pleas of guilty had a utilitarian value, evinced contrition and had saved the child victim the ordeal of giving evidence. 
     
      
    18   As further evidence of the applicant's contrition, Judge Freeman referred to evidence given by a number of witnesses in the proceedings on sentence, including his de facto wife who had continued to support him. After going to the police and while he was on bail, the applicant took a number of steps showing both contrition and his ability and willingness to engage in rehabilitation. The applicant had had grave difficulties with alcohol and had often engaged in binge drinking. With a view to overcoming his problems with alcohol, the applicant had undertaken counselling at a clinic conducted at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. After his arrest he had entered into counselling and group programs run by the Child Abuse Prevention Service. 
     
      
    19   The sentencing judge said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I accept that the prisoner is doing what he can to cure himself"". 
        
       
      
    20   On this ground his Honour found that there was special circumstances within s.5 (2) of the Sentencing Act. 
     
      
    21   In the proceedings on sentence some attention was devoted to what had been the effects upon the child victim of the conduct of the applicant. His Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Some evidence was led concerning the observable effects upon the child and that evidence from the child's grandmother and from the prisoner's partner relating to their periodic, occasional, but not ongoing, contact with the child, is relied upon as indicating that there is no discernibly grave manifestation of damage to the child in a psychological or emotional sense. It may of course be, as Mr Norton himself conceded, that the full effect upon the child may take some time to appear. I am certainly not about to find that this child has somehow escaped damage as a consequence of the prisoner's action. One does not need to sit very long in these courts, regrettably, to see that there is a pervasive form of affect on child victims and, as I understand the authorities, this court is not only entitled but is indeed obliged to approach matters such as this on the basis that all children will show some, if not all, of the following constellation of problems: Children feel fearfulness as a result of offences of this nature; illogically, but nonetheless keenly, they feel guilt and this is frequently compounded by a feeling of guilt about seeing the effects upon their family of their disclosure; children can tend to shoulder the blame for the split which occurs in families frequently in circumstances like this although it is both wrong, and as I say, illogical for them to do so. Nonetheless, it is a real consequence. All children feel a sense of loss of worth, of ""emptiness"" as it is frequently described. Such a disturbance of the normal process of sexual maturation, frequently leads to difficulties in trusting adults and often their own age peers. The ability to form and maintain relationships is frequently damaged and these effects may, if not permanent, certainly be of very long lasting duration. No child is ever the same once their innocence has been taken from them by a sexual predator."" 
        
       
      
    22   A number of grounds of appeal were stated in an annexure to the Notice of Appeal but all of the grounds really amounted to assertions that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive and that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account at all, or at any rate not sufficiently, the circumstances making the offences less objectively serious and various subjective circumstances, including the applicant's pleas of guilty, his going voluntarily to the police, his cooperation with the police, his contrition, his lack of any previous convictions, the steps taken by him to rehabilitate himself, his good prospects of rehabilitation, the unlikelihood of the applicant re-offending, and certain other favourable subjective circumstances. The court was also referred in written submissions to a number of parts of the evidence given in the proceedings on sentence by the applicant himself and by other witnesses. However, none of these matters were overlooked in the sentencing judge's careful and quite lengthy remarks on sentence. I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge did not take into account any material consideration. The remaining question is whether the sentences, and particularly the sentence on the first count, were manifestly excessive. It may be that the sentencing judge could properly have imposed a less severe sentence. However, I am unable to conclude that the sentences passed by his Honour, even allowing for the circumstances favourable to the applicant, were manifestly excessive. The offence under s.66 A of the Crimes Act committed against a child under the age of 10, to whom the applicant stood in a position of trust, was a grave offence. The offence carries a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty years. The offence was not an isolated aberration. The good character of an offender is of less significance in child sexual assault cases than in cases of other types of offences. 
     
      
    23   We were furnished with statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of sentences passed between January 1990 and December 1998 on offenders with no previous criminal convictions who had pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 in contravention of s.66 A of the Crimes Act. There are 42 such instances. 
     
      
    24   As has been said by this Court on other occasions, the use to which statistics kept by the Judicial Commission can be put is limited. However, it seems to me that the statistics furnished to us show that the sentence passed by his Honour fell well within the range of sentences which were within a sound exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. His Honour was of course also sentencing the applicant for the two offences of committing an act of indecency, the sentences for which he made fully concurrent with parts of the minimum term of the sentence for the offence under s.66 A. 
     
      
    25   I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    26   SPERLING J: I agree. 
     
      
       
      JAMES J: The orders of the court will be as proposed by me.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: On being arraigned for the murder of Hayden Lee Wederell, the prisoner pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment, the basis of the plea being death by unlawful and dangerous act without any intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
    2    Between 2 am and 3 am on Sunday 12 October 1997 the prisoner, with a group of friends from the Pascoe Vale Soccer Club in Victoria, went to the Sydney Harbour Casino to watch a televised soccer World Cup qualifying match between England and Italy. The matter concluded a little after 6.30 am and England qualified to continue to the next round. 
    3    A large group of people who had been watching the match began to cheer and chant. This group included English tourists among whom was the victim. Some of the prisoner's friends supported England and some supported Italy. There were some verbal exchanges between some of the prisoner's group and some of the English tourists. A glass was thrown from the area occupied by the English tourists into the area occupied by the prisoner and his friends. This then led to a confrontation between the prisoner's group and some of the English tourists. Blows were exchanged. 
    4    The victim became engaged in a verbal exchange with a friend of the prisoner and while he was looking at and concentrating on that person, the prisoner mounted a small stage on which the victim was standing and struck him with a very heavy punch to the side of his neck near his left ear. The victim then appeared to stagger. He walked a short distance and collapsed unconscious on the floor. As the victim was falling to the floor, the prisoner threw a punch at him. The prisoner then kicked at the head area of the victim while he was on the floor in an unconscious state. There was no physical evidence that either the second punch or the kicks connected with the victim. 
    5    The prisoner then punched two other persons to the head area and kicked one of those persons in the head area when that person was on the floor. 
    6    Casino staff subdued the prisoner and held him until the arrival of police. The incident was recorded on the Casino security video and clearly shows the prisoner carrying out the assaults upon the victim and other people as described. 
    7    The prisoner was conveyed to the City Central Detectives' Office where he later consented to take part in an electronically recorded interview in which he stated he could not remember the events of earlier that morning. He was shown the video of the incidents and adopted his actions as seen on the video. He said that he had a drinking problem which he offered as an explanation for his behaviour. 
    8    He was then charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and affray. 
    9    The victim stopped breathing whilst at the Casino and received treatment from Casino and ambulance personnel before he was transported to St Vincent's Hospital where he survived in a coma until he died on 15 October 1997. When the prisoner was informed of his death and that he would be charged with murder, he said he was very remorseful and did not intend to kill anyone. 
    10    It is true that the prisoner went to the Casino with his friends for the purpose of watching the telecast of the World Cup football match, and immediately before the glass was thrown, he can be seen on the video calmly minding his own business, watching the video screen and sipping his drink, but once the glass landed in the vicinity of the prisoner and his friends, all hell broke loose and an all in brawl quickly developed involving a large number of persons into which the prisoner charged with enthusiasm, and he jumped up onto a small low stage to throw a haymaker punch at the victim. 
    11    Not only was the blow delivered with considerable force (which can be seen on the video) but it struck the victim in the upper left sterno mastoid muscle behind the left ear which resulted in a basal subarachnoid haemorrhage leading to a loss of blood flow in the artery beyond the atlas and thus caused his death. 
    12    The prisoner clearly had no intention to kill or seriously injure the deceased or anyone else, but could not resist the chance to join in the fight and went out of his way to deliver the fatal blow. Although the death was not deliberate or intentional, the unlawful dangerous act, namely the assault, certainly was. 
    13    There is no evidence that the deceased or any of his friends threw the glass that led to the brawl, and even if he or one of them had, it would be no excuse for the prisoner's actions. The result is that a young man in the prime of his life, aged 26 years, a visitor to this country, has had his life cut short and his family have been left without him and saddened by such loss. The prisoner must bear responsibility for what has happened which is indeed a tragedy for both the victim and the prisoner, but for the victim and his family the tragedy is permanent. 
    14    Although no weapon was used and only a single blow caused the death, the whole of the surrounding circumstances must be taken into account including the prisoner's attempts to further punch the deceased and his efforts of kicking at him whilst he was on the ground. 
    15    The prisoner was born on 16 March 1975 and he was aged 22 at the time of the offence and is now 24 years. He resides in Preston, a suburb of Melbourne, with his parents and brother. At the time of the offence he was an apprentice cabinet maker and he has since completed that apprenticeship and is in permanent employment in his trade. His employer gave evidence and spoke highly of him as an employee. His brother also is a cabinet maker employed by a different employer, although the two of them have hopes of eventually going into business on their own account. 
    16    In the meantime they have jointly purchased a house as an investment to provide for their futures. His mother and father are both in regular employment and I am satisfied that he comes from a close knit family and has their support. They were all present for the sentencing proceedings as were a number of his friends from the soccer club. He has played club soccer for a number of years and in the season just completed before this tragedy, was named best and fairest in the club's reserve grade. 
    17    He was previously before the courts in 1994, when aged 19, on charges of theft and attempted theft for which he received a community based order for twelve months without convictions being recorded, and on 14 March 1996 for driving with excess of the prescribed concentration of alcohol, 0.134 percent, for which he was fined and disqualified from holding a licence.  
    18    I do not regard the former as relevant for present purposes but the latter is indicative of excessive drinking, at least when driving, and is consistent with his answers in the recorded interview that he was drunk at the time and also that when he drinks he cannot remember (A. 68). 
    19    When asked why he acted as he did, he replied: ""Too much alcohol"" (A. 142), and that he had an alcohol problem (A. 163). The alcohol does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence or excuse it, although it does go some way to explaining it. 
    20    The prisoner was discharged at committal because the Magistrate had reservations as to whether the pathologist's evidence could establish that the cause of death was the blow thrown by the prisoner, and he was arraigned pursuant to an ex officio indictment. I am informed that although the Crown had offered to accept a plea to manslaughter, the cause of death remained a live issue and it was only on the morning of the trial, after being shown further material by the Crown, that a plea was indicated. Such plea acknowledges that the death did not result from an accident but that the act which caused the death, that is the punch, was deliberate, unlawful and dangerous: R v MacDonald (unreported - CCA - 12 December 1995). 
    21    Although late, the plea indicates acceptance of responsibility for the death and demonstrates remorse. It also saves the State the expense of a trial and saves the victim's mother, who has travelled from England, the ordeal and stress of sitting through detailed evidence and I give credit for the plea, although not as much as if it had been indicated earlier. 
    22    The prisoner was arrested on 12 October 1997 and remained in custody until allowed bail on 26 November 1997. He was returned to custody on the 2nd of this month and has therefore spent the equivalent of eight weeks in custody to date. 
    23    Manslaughter is always a serious crime as it involves the felonious taking of a human life: R v Blacklidge (unreported - CCA - 12 December 1995) per Gleeson CJ. The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice, and the value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system: R v MacDonald supra. It is therefore necessary to impose a sentence that takes into account the community's denunciation of such conduct and general and personal deterrence, as well as having regard to the rehabilitation of the prisoner. Deterrence (general and personal) is relevant, notwithstanding the lack of pre meditation and intention, because it must be demonstrated to the community generally, and to the prisoner in particular, that persons must not get into brawls, lose their temper or throw punches at other people lest tragic and disastrous, though unintentional, consequences result as happened here. 
    24    I have read the letter from the deceased's mother and note the sadness and devastating effects on the family. However, in accordance with authority, the sentence has not been increased on account of the effects of his death on his immediate family. 
    25    I have been referred to a number of cases and also had regard to the statistics kept by the Judicial Commission, but bearing in mind that manslaughter covers such a wide range of criminal responsibility, such statistics can only be of very limited assistance. With these reservations in mind, I note that in the case of prisoners pleading guilty with no prior convictions, 80 percent of them received minimum terms of between 18 months and 6 years, and full terms of 3½ to 10 years. 
    26    In addition to the matters referred to above, I consider the prisoner's prospect of rehabilitation excellent because of his close and supporting family, his trade qualification and prospects of gainful employment on release, his involvement in competitive sport and the support of his friends. 
    27    Nevertheless, I consider that special circumstances exist justifying a variation from the ratio of additional to minimum term referred to in s 5(3) of the Sentencing Act 1989 because of his youth, as the fact that it is his first time in prison, and because, his parents live in Melbourne and due to limited means will be unable to travel to New South Wales to visit him regularly, his time in custody will be more onerous unless and until he is moved to Victoria under the Prisoners (Interstate) Transfer Act 1982. 
    28    In all the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate sentence is one of a minimum term of 3½ years with an additional term of 2 years, but I will make allowance for the period of nearly 2 months spent in custody prior to today. 
    29    Steve Risteski, for the manslaughter of Hayden Lee Wederell, I sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term of 3 years and 4 months which shall date from today. I fix an additional term of 2 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 12 April 2003. The exhibits may be returned.

    HIS HONOUR: 
     
      
       
      
    1    By the amended summons filed in these proceedings, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), as plaintiff, appeals pursuant to s 104 of the Justices Act 1902 against an order of the Burwood Local Court dismissing informations laid against the defendant, Anthony West. Such an appeal is confined to questions of law. 
     
      
       
      
    2    Relevantly, pleas of not guilty were entered on 27 April 1999 and the informations were adjourned to 21 May 1999. The prosecution brief was delivered to the defendant’s legal representatives on 10 May 1999, that being less than 14 days before 21 May 1999. On 21 May 1999, the proceedings were marked “not reached” and adjourned to 27 July 1999. On that date, the court ruled that because of late service of the prosecution brief the prosecution was precluded from adducing evidence. The informations were accordingly dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The legislative context is as follows. By the Justices Amendment (Briefs of Evidence) Act 1997, subdivision 6A was introduced into Div 2 of the Justices Act 1902. So far as is presently relevant the new sections were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       “66B. Brief of evidence to be served on defendant unless otherwise ordered 
        
        
        
        
         
         (1) If a defendant pleads not guilty to a prescribed summary offence being prosecuted by a prosecuting authority, the prosecuting authority must, unless the Justice or Justices otherwise order in accordance with section 66E, serve or cause to be served on the defendant a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence. 
          
         
         
         (2) The copy of the brief of evidence is to be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution unless the defendant consents to a shorter period or, in the opinion of the Justice or Justices, the circumstances of the case otherwise require. 
          
         
        
        
         
        
       66E Discretion to order that copy of brief of evidence need not be served. 
        
        
        
        
         
         (1) The Justice or Justices may order that all or part of the copy of the brief of evidence need not be served if the Justice or Justices are satisfied. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) that there are compelling reasons for not requiring service, or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) that it could not reasonably be served on the defendant. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The Justice or Justices may make an order under this section on their own initiative or on the application of any party. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) An order may be made subject to such conditions (if any) as the Justice or Justices think fit. 
         
        
        
         
        
        
       66F Evidence not to be admitted 
        
        
        
         
         (1) The Justice or Justices are to refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecuting authority in respect of the prescribed summary offence if, in relation to that evidence, this Subdivision, or any regulations made for the purposes of this Subdivision, have not been complied with by the prosecuting authority. 
         
        
        
         
          
         (2) The Justice or Justices may, and on the application of or with the consent of the defendant must, dispense with the requirements of subsection (1) on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable. 
         
        
        
         
          
         (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to any requirement referred to in subsection (1) that is declared by the regulations to be a requirement that may not be dispensed with under subsection (2). 
         
        
        
       66G Adjournments 
        
         
          
         Without limiting the power of a Justice or Justices to adjourn proceedings, the Justice or Justices are to grant such adjournments as appear to be just and reasonable if the copy of the brief of evidence is not served in accordance with this Subdivision, and may extend accordingly the time for hearing the matter.” 
         
        
       
      
    4    It is common ground that s 66B applied in the present case. The objectives of s 66B are obvious enough and are confirmed by the second reading speeches in the parliament: first, to further the just and efficient conduct of trials by advance notice of the prosecution evidence; and, secondly, to provide an adequate opportunity before trial for informed reconsideration of the decision to plead not guilty. Section 66F(1) prescribes the sanction for non-compliance with s 66B. Other provisions introduce flexibility to guard against s 66B and s 66F(1) operating unjustly to the prosecuting authority, without injustice to the defendant. 
     
      
       
      
    5    When read as coherent scheme, designed to serve the purposes to which I have referred, the sections are to be construed as follows. 
     
      
       
        
       (a) Section 66E is designed to operate prospectively. The language is not apt for retrospective relief against non-compliance. The time for operation of s 66E is before the date on which the brief is required to be served. 
        
        
       (b) The time for operation of the sanction prescribed by s 66F(1) is when evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecution. If, at that time, s 66F(1) has not been complied with, the prosecuting authority is precluded from adducing evidence, unless the obligation of compliance has been or is then dispensed with or relevantly modified. 
        
        
        
       (c) Section 66F(2) speaks of the requirements of s 66F(1). That is the requirement to refuse to admit the prosecution evidence on the particular occasion if there has been non-compliance with s 66B and no relieving order has been made under s 66E or s 66F(2). The time for operation of s 66F(2) is at or before the occasion on which the prosecution evidence is sought to be tendered. 
        
        
       (d) Section 66G empowers the court to adjourn the proceedings where there has been non-compliance with s 66B. The time for operation of this section is the same as for s 66F(2). The purpose and effect of an adjournment pursuant to s 66G is to postpone the time when the prosecution evidence is sought to be adduced or will be sought to be adduced to an occasion when there will have been compliance with s 66B. 
        
       
      
    6    It follows that, in the ordinary case, these sections are designed to operate as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) On the occasion when a plea of not guilty is entered, the magistrate may, on his own initiative or on the application of a party, order that all or part of the brief need not be served (s 66E). 
        
        
       (ii) On the same occasion, the court may shorten the 14 days referred to in s 66B(2) (s 66B(2)). 
        
        
       (iii) The prosecution then serves the brief at least 14 days before the trial fixture or within any abridged time (s 66B(2)). 
        
        
       (iv) On the occasion fixed for the trial, the magistrate may, or on the application or with the consent of the defendant must, on such terms and conditions as are just and reasonable, dispense with the requirement in s 66F(1); that is, the requirement to refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution if the brief has not been served as required (s 66F(2)). 
        
        
       (v) Alternatively, the magistrate may adjourn the proceedings thereby providing (if the brief has not been served) or enlarging (if the brief has been served late) the time for consideration of the brief (s 66G). 
        
        
       (vi) If the obligation to serve a brief pursuant to s 66B has not then been dispensed with by an order under s 66E or s 66F(2) and an adjournment has not been granted under s 66G, and if there is then seen to be non-compliance with that obligation (as may have been modified by an order under s 66E or s 66F), the magistrate must ( 
       on application by the defendant? 
       ) refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution (s 66F(1)), and the information will necessarily be dismissed. 
        
       
      
    7    I have left open whether, in relation to s 66F(1), the magistrate is required to refuse to admit the evidence irrespective of whether an application is made to that effect by the defendant. I am strongly inclined to think that there is no obligation on the magistrate to give consideration to orders under s 66E, s 66F(1) or s 66G of his or her own motion. (There is express power to do so under s 66E, but that does not imply an obligation. Application of the principle of expressio unius suggests that there is not even the power to act of the court’s own motion under s 66F(2) and s 66G. Under our adversarial system, the courts do not perform an investigative function. It would be a strange thing if a magistrate were held accountable for error in failing to investigate whether there were grounds for such an order, or for failing to make such an order on whatever materials may have fortuitously come into his or her hands without the assistance of a moving party. 
     
      
       
      
    8    In the present case, the matter was listed for hearing on 21 May 1999 and adjourned “not reached”. Section 66F(1) did not operate on that occasion because evidence was not sought to be adduced by the prosecution. The proceedings were adjourned to 27 July 1999. On that occasion, the prosecution sought to adduce evidence. Section 66F(1) operated then if there was non-compliance with s 66B. But there was compliance with that section. The brief had been delivered on 10 May 1999, more than 14 days before 27 July 1999. That was the relevant occasion on which the prosecution sought to adduce evidence, indeed the only occasion in this case when the prosecution sought to adduce evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The learned magistrate was constrained by the decision of this court in DPP v Milgate  (Sully J, 19 February 1999, unreported) to hold that  
     
      
       
       s 66F(1) operated as at 21 May 1999 when the matter was first listed for hearing, with the result that he was bound to refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution on 27 July 1999, notwithstanding that on the latter occasion the brief had been served more than fourteen days previously. That approach does not accord with the construction of the sections I have propounded. In 
        Milgate 
       , Sully J propounded a construction of the relevant sections which is very different from my own. In my view, the learned magistrate should have held there was compliance with s 66B and should not have refused to admit the prosecution evidence. 
        
       
      
    10    In my opinion, the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       (2) Order dismissing the informations for the offence of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty and for two offences of assaulting a police officer quashed. 
        
        
       (3) The proceedings be remitted to the Local Court for determination according to law. 
        
       
      
    11    It is unsatisfactory for the Local Court to be confronted with conflicting decisions on such a matter. The daily workings of those courts are affected. Accordingly, the present proceedings should be referred to the Court of Appeal to settle the correct construction of these provisions. 
     
      
       
      
    12    The orders I make are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) Proceedings removed into the Court of Appeal. 
        
        
       (2) Reserve the costs of the hearing before me.

     REGINA v. SANDRA CLOGHER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: An appeal is brought from convictions of the appellant on three counts of having by way of statutory declarations made statements, false or misleading in material particulars with intent to obtain for Esenmette Pty. Limited (""the company"") certain monies with reckless disregard as to whether those material particulars were true, false or misleading. The offences charged are provided for by s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty is provided of five years' imprisonment. 
    2   The appellant had been tried in the District Court at Newcastle on 3 June 1998 and had pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
    3   In summary, the Crown case was that the appellant was the secretary of the company, she and her husband both being directors of it. It had entered into two contracts with the Department of Public Works, one for the construction of the sewerage pumping station at Morisset and the other for pumping stations and sewerage reticulation at Fishing Point. Under those contracts the company was entitled to claim progress payments for work completed at the end of each month. Fourteen days after the claim, the Department would issue a progress payment certificate and 14 days thereafter the Department was required to pay the amount specified in the certificate. 
    4   Under clause 43 of the contracts the Department required, with progress claims, statutory declarations that all workers, sub-contractors and suppliers had been paid all monies in respect of work performed under the provision of the contract that were due and payable up until the time of the claim. There was evidence from the Department's civil engineer of the amendment of the standard form contract wording of clause 43 to provide a discretion in the Department to withhold monies until the receipt of the declaration and that if monies were shown as outstanding in the declaration the process and the contract involved obtaining the contractor's direction for payment of those monies. In that last circumstance, even if the contractor refused to allow payment of outstanding claims it could still claim from the Department the amount certified as due to it. 
    5   Three progress payment claims in relation to the contract with the Department with statutory declarations in support executed by the applicant were lodged. Those declarations were in common form. I set out the declaration in respect of one claim by way of example:- 
     
      
      
      ""STATUTORY DECLARATION 
       
      OATHS ACT (NSW) NINTH SCHEDULE 
      
      
       
        
       I, Sandra Clogher of 59 the Promenade, Guildford in the State of New South Wales do solemnly and sincerely declare that:- 
       
      
      
       
       1. I am the representive (sic) of Contractor Esenmette Pty. Limited ACN 002 586 825 in the Officer Bearer capacity of Director the said Contractor having a contract for Hunter Sewerage Project Construction of Sewers, Rising Mains and P/S at Fishing Point C/N 9201324. 
       
      
      
       
       2. All workers who have at any time been engaged by Esenmette Pty. Limited or a sub-contractor, in respect of their employment under the Contract, have been paid all monies payable to them, with the exception of the workers and amounts listed below:- 
       
      
      
       
        NIL 
       
      
      
       
       3. All sub-contractors and suppliers have been paid all the monies payable to them in respect of materials supplied and work performed under the Contract, with the exception of the sub-contractors, suppliers and amounts listed below:- 
       
      
      
       
        NIL 
       
      
      
       
       4. From the monies due to the Contractor, the Contractor request the Principal to pay the following amounts to the following persons to whom they are owed:- 
       
      
      
       
        NIL."" 
       
      
    6   The declaration appears executed. Following receipt of the claims and the supporting statutory declarations, large amounts of money were paid to the company. Complaints, however, were later received from sub-contractors and suppliers. Contact with the company produced a letter from the appellant in which she indicated the company had been experiencing cash flow problems. In due course the company was placed into provisional liquidation and then went into liquidation. Evidence was called from various witnesses that sub-contractors, suppliers and workmen were owed substantial monies at the time the appellant made each of the three statutory declarations. 
    7   The appellant, who gave evidence, admitted that she had operated as bookkeeper and accounts keeper for the company, maintaining the payroll and the registers of creditors and debtors, with the assistance of a financial adviser who came in once a week to oversee the accounts. She gave evidence that in 1995 the Department provided a new format of declaration which she referred to her husband, Tom, and he arranged for a meeting between himself, the main engineer and the financial adviser, following which she was told to type the declarations in the form provided and to insert the world ""Nil"" after each paragraph, keeping a copy. 
    8   She confirmed that she was in charge of the accounting paperwork, including the invoices that came in. She said that the procedure in relation to claims involved the engineer on each job preparing the claim for payment and requesting a statutory declaration. Sometimes these declarations were requested urgently and she would have to attend an all-night chemist to have them executed by a Justice. 
    9   She discussed the receipt of invoices with her husband, would prepare a spreadsheet of the invoices and ask her husband who was to be paid. Suppliers and such would ring about outstanding amounts and she would speak to her husband about complaints and her husband would tell her what monies were available to meet the claims. 
    10   She said she understood all the monies payable in respect of the matters referred to in the statutory declarations meant all the monies that the company had to pay as were due at the time in the view of the company. In the event that an extension of time or an accommodation were able to be negotiated, she did not understand that the monies were payable. Essentially it was her case that as far as she was aware, the declarations were not false nor reckless. She was cross-examined to suggest she either knew or was reckless as to the truth. 
    11   Her husband gave evidence of his understanding of what monies were due and payable as did the engineering manager. 
    12   The notice of appeal in its first three grounds asserts in respect of each count that the trial judged erred in failing to direct an acquittal. Ground 6 asserts that his Honour erred in directing the jury that the contents of the statutory declarations must have had the effect of misleading the Public Works Department. Ground 6 asserts that his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that the Public Works Department had a discretion to pay monies without the need for the statutory declaration. 
    13   Grounds 4 and 7 are abandoned. 
    14   A common submission is made in support of the remaining grounds. It is asserted that since under the contract, so it is contended, the statutory declarations were not absolutely required to be supplied and that, so it is asserted, the contract allowed the Department in its discretion not to require a statutory declaration, neither the provision or otherwise of the statutory declaration, nor the truth or otherwise of its contents at least so far as it related to the naming of sub-contractors could ever amount to ""a material particular"". It was asserted that his Honour's directions amounted to withdrawal of the issue of fact as to whether the relevant particulars were material from the jury and that this asserted misdirection was compounded by his Honour's failure to direct the jury that within the context of the contract the principal had a wide discretion to make payments to the contractor. 
    15   His Honour directed the jury that the statutory declarations required a truthful statement of all sub-contractors and suppliers who were unpaid and whose debts were due. He directed the jury that what was meant by a material particular was to be looked at in that context:- 
     
      
       
       ""If you are satisfied that such credit as existed when these particular declarations were made, you could regard the statement that no such creditors existed as a material particular. 
       
      
      
       
       Since a misstatement of that nature would of course mislead the Public Works Department, the principal, as to what the situation was between the contractor Esenmette, and the sub-contractors and suppliers. And that, of course, is information which the principal is entitled to have. It is entitled to know whether the contract as it is ongoing is one that is still viable. As one which the contractor can continue and carry on. And to mislead the principal, the Department, you could regard in those circumstances as being matters of a material particular. And of course if you simply look at the declaration itself, the fact, the very matter sought to be sworn to, if you are satisfied there are outstanding amounts due to sub-contractors and suppliers, that very statement itself is a material particular because that is the very matter which the information is sought and required in terms of the contract."" 
       
      
    16   His Honour went on to refer to the particulars as being material in the context of the clause in the contract which enabled payment direct to sub-contractors who had obtained court orders and consequent deduction from payments to the company. He referred to the arguments put by the appellant's counsel which turned particularly upon what amounts were actually payable and whether payment would have been made to the company in the event that the statutory declarations had set out the truth. 
    17   On the face of the material it would appear that the statements in the statutory declarations were material in that plainly they were capable of influencing the Department's attitude to the progress claim. The Department had a contractual right to require them under an express term. The stipulation of a contractual entitlement to require them and the very requiring of them by the Department showed that they were regarded by the Department as being themselves or containing matter capable of being of moment or significance and hence they were themselves not merely trivial or inconsequential (Regina v. Maslen & Shaw (1995) 79 A Crim R 199; Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v. Dela Cruz (1992) 34 FCR 348 at 352; Regina v. Gervaise & Preece (CCA, unreported 13 November 1997)). The evidence clearly shows that the supply of them and the contents were realised by the appellant and the other representatives of the company to be of considerable importance to the company's cash flow. At least the information required was such as to have had the capability to influence the decision to make prompt payment. It is not necessary that the statement be one which must or will be taken into account (see Maslen & Shaw (supra at 202-203)). A statement, the truth of which goes directly or indirectly to influence whether not an action is performed is a material statement (Regina v. Traino (1987) 27 A Crim R 271)). 
    18   The contest at trial was not over whether or not the statements were material. Necessarily, whether or not they had to be supplied under the contract was not the point. They provided significant relevant information which could influence the course the Department might take. The submission made here is that unless the statement directly affected whether payment was made or how much the company might receive in payment of its claim, the statement was inconsequential but materiality is not so narrow. 
    19   The clear evidence from Mr. Walker, the civil engineer with the Department of Public Works, showed that the information was important to the Department in considering claims. It is plain that the appellant, her husband and the company's engineer considered the information important in order to have the claim met. There was no real issue as to this. Nor was there any issue on the related matter that the declarations were made in the form they were and supplied with the intent that the company would obtain the monies in question.  
    20   His Honour, in his summing up, dealt with the matter to the necessary extent when he referred to the contractual provisions and to the evidence concerning the importance true statements in the statutory declarations would have to the Department. 
    21   In his directions, his Honour did not remove from the jury the issue of whether the statements in the statutory declarations were true, false or misleading. He did not direct the jury that it was necessary that the statements be untrue before they could influence the Department, or that it be necessary to deceive the Department before the statements could be material as the appellant's written submissions appear to contend. 
    22   I do not consider that his Honour incorrectly removed the relevant factual issues from the jury in the passage of the summing up I have set out. He did direct the jury as to how the statements could, in the factual context of this case, be material otherwise leaving the issue of materiality for them. 
    23   In the context of these issues as they were posed at the trial, I see no misdirection. Further, in my view, the evidence that the declarations and the statements in them were material was overwhelming. I consider that this appeal cannot succeed. 
    24   I would grant leave to appeal, but propose that the appeal should be dismissed. 
    25   MEAGHER, JA: I agree. 
    26   NEWMAN, J: I agree

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISION BELL J Wednesday, 1 December 1999 70109/98 - REGINA v Son Thai TRAN SENTENCE  1    HER HONOUR: On 8 September 1999 the prisoner, Son Thai Tran, was arraigned upon an indictment charging him with two counts: (i) the murder of Sanh Thi Nguyen at Yagoona on 21 April 1998 and (ii) the malicious wounding of Minh Trang Pham on the same date. He entered pleas of not guilty to both counts and a jury was duly empanelled. On 29 September 1999 the jury returned verdicts convicting the prisoner of manslaughter on the first count and of the offence charged in the second count.2    At about 5 am on 21 April 1998 the prisoner broke into the home of his estranged wife, Minh Tran Pham, at unit 2/123 Dutton Street, Yagoona. He smashed the window to the main bedroom where his wife, mother-in-law and son were sleeping. At the time his mother-in-law, the deceased, was attempting to make contact with the police by telephone. The prisoner took hold of the telephone. The deceased ran from the room. Shortly thereafter the prisoner followed her into the hallway of the house and stabbed her repeatedly with a broken pair of scissors. During the course of the assault upon the deceased the prisoner's wife attempted to intervene. In the course of so doing she sustained a stab wound to the back of her left shoulder. The deceased managed to walk back to the main bedroom where she collapsed and died.3    Following the stabbing the prisoner took his wife and young son into the bathroom adjacent to the main bedroom. He bound their wrists and ankles. He tied his wife to the toilet and placed the boy in the shower recess. The prisoner put his jacket over the boy's head to prevent him seeing the body of the deceased. After a little time the prisoner untied his wife and attempted to dress her wound. Thereafter he re-tied her wrists.4    He remained in the house for about 12 hours following the killing. During this time he was in a state of considerable distress. He appears to have entertained thoughts of killing himself and possibly his wife. He wrote out a list of his possessions with a view to giving them to his son.5    Ultimately, his wife suggested that she would tell the police that the family had been the victim of a home invasion; intruders had broken into the house and killed her mother. She suggested that the prisoner might obliterate the traces of his presence by wiping surfaces to remove fingerprints. He did this and in the late afternoon of 21 April he left the home.6    The wife and son broke free of their restraints and sought assistance from neighbours.7    The wife was admitted to Bankstown Hospital for treatment for her injuries. She initially gave the investigating police an account that three men had invaded the home and stabbed her mother.8    On 23 April 1998 Mrs Pham supplied the police with a statement nominating her husband as the killer. The prisoner was arrested on that day and agreed to be interviewed by the police. In the course of that interview the prisoner denied knowledge of the killing of his mother-in-law and supplied an alibi. It is to be noted that the prisoner had made no attempt to persuade any person to support him in his alibi. It was easily disproved.9    The deceased sustained twenty-five wounds to her body. Of these four were potentially lethal.10    The prisoner had consumed a substantial quantity of full strength beer prior to attending at the Dutton Street premises in the early hours of the morning of 21 April. Intoxication as bearing on the formation of the intent for murder was left to the jury. Provocation and the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind were also left. Mr Ierace SC, who appears for the prisoner, submits that I would sentence the prisoner upon the basis that his partial defence of substantial impairment was made out. The Crown agrees, having regard to the way the evidence unfolded, that this is the appropriate course. I consider it is.11    Before turning to the medical evidence bearing on the prisoner's mental state at the time of the killing, it is appropriate to refer to the facts of this somewhat unusual case in a little more detail.12    The prisoner was born in South Vietnam. He is aged 37 years. He was 14 years old when the government of North Vietnam came to power in South Vietnam. After he left school, in 1979, he was placed in a labour camp. He remained in that camp for more than five years. During this period of imprisonment he made an escape attempt. He was caught and placed in solitary confinement where he was kept for a number of months in a darkened room with his legs chained.13    The prisoner was released from the labour camp around 1984 or 85. While he was at liberty he met and married his wife, Minh Tran Pham. She was then aged 19. Following his marriage the prisoner was re-arrested after an unsuccessful attempt to leave Vietnam. He spent a further year in custody on this occasion. His wife was pregnant with their child.14    Following the prisoner's release from custody on this second occasion, he and his wife and child escaped from Vietnam on a refugee boat. They ultimately landed in Indonesia where they were detained in an immigration camp. The conditions were described as being very poor. The family remained in that camp for five years. At the end of that period they were repatriated to Vietnam. Mrs Pham gave evidence at the trial that she and the prisoner had formed a strong relationship through the hard years.15    A year after the family returned to Vietnam they were sponsored to come to Australia by the prisoner's family. They arrived in Australia on 13 November 1996. Initially they lived in Melbourne with the prisoner's family. After about three months Mrs Pham and their son, Tu Tai Tran, left the prisoner and moved to Sydney. At the time of that move Mrs Pham had it in mind to separate from her husband. She and the child lived for a time with some relatives at Bonnyrigg. After ten days the prisoner joined them in Sydney. They reconciled and thereafter lived together as a family in Sydney. They moved to premises at 45 Harrington Street, Cabramatta. The prisoner obtained employment with Minh Diep Doan, a clothing manufacturer. He worked on a steam press ironing garments. Both the prisoner and his wife made up garments for Mr Doan at home on a piecework basis. They were a hard-working couple.16    In late 1997 the prisoner and his wife arranged for her mother, the deceased, to come to Australia from Vietnam.17    The deceased arrived in Australia around November 1997. She moved into the home at 45 Harrington Street, Cabramatta.18    Mr Doan closed his factory for the Christmas holiday break. At this time the prisoner went to Melbourne to see his mother. While he was away a male boarder, Vanny So, moved into the Harrington Street premises. It is clear that Mr So's presence became a source of tension when the prisoner returned. It also appears that the deceased started, for whatever reason, to actively subvert the marriage.19    There was evidence of a statement made to police by a woman named Hoang Hoa Pham who appears to have been on friendly terms with the deceased. On her account the deceased had complained that the prisoner did not buy her anything while the boarder, Vanny So, showered her with gifts. Ms Hoang Pham told the police, ""The boarder openly took Trang and her mother out from time to time without any regard for Trang's husband"".20    About two months after the deceased arrived in Australia Mrs Pham separated from the prisoner. This was around February 1998. The prisoner moved out of home and stayed with a friend in Canley Vale.21    Mrs Pham gave evidence that after the separation at night when her son and mother were in bed she would steal away from the home to meet her husband whom she still loved. Her husband would come to the Harrington Street house every day. On occasions he slept outside the home. She described the prisoner as repeatedly telling her that he loved her very much and was not able to live without her. Mrs Pham felt torn between her loyalty to her husband and her loyalty to her mother. She told her husband to stay where he was for the time being and that when her mother returned to Vietnam he could move into the home. In the course of giving evidence-in-chief Mrs Pham proclaimed, ""My husband is the only man that I love"".22    It was Mrs Pham's evidence that on occasions when her husband would call to see her at the Harrington Street premises her mother would contact the police. The mother intercepted the prisoner's telephone calls to her.23    On two occasions when the prisoner called to see his wife he was assaulted by the deceased. On one occasion she struck him with a hammer and on another occasion with the flat side of a meat cleaver.24    At her mother's prompting Mrs Pham agreed to move from the Harrington Street premises. This appears to have been done with a view to breaking off contact with the prisoner. After they relocated to a townhouse in Dutton Street the deceased moved into the main bedroom with her daughter. Mrs Pham explained: ""She moved to my bedroom and we stayed in one bedroom and I could not go out to meet my husband any more"".25    The deceased persuaded her daughter to apply for an apprehended violence order to prevent the prisoner calling to the home. Mrs Pham described her predicament in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""My mum told me to go to court to apply for the apprehended violence order so my husband would not be able to come to see me any more. I loved my mother but I also loved my husband and I was in the middle of two of them, but I loved my mother and I listened to her. Wherever she told me to go I would go."" 
        
       
        
      
    26    On Friday, 17 April 1998 Mrs Pham obtained an apprehended violence order from the Local Court at Fairfield. After taking out the order, and before the mother's death a matter of days later, it appears that Mrs Pham again initiated contact with the prisoner.27    Following the move to Dutton Street it also appears that Vanny So was a regular visitor.28    On the night prior to the killing the prisoner went to the townhouse and stood outside. He overheard a telephone conversation between his wife and a friend. In that conversation he learned that his wife had been taken by Vanny So to Parramatta to file for a divorce. From things Mrs Pham said to her friend Mrs Nga in the course of that telephone call, the prisoner inferred that she had formed an intimate relationship with Vanny So. He left the premises and returned to the home of a friend where he consumed some alcohol.29    There was a body of evidence tending to establish that in the period following his separation from his wife the prisoner had been depressed. In the past he had been a hard-working man interested in earning money. After the separation he became uninterested in work and his output at the factory dropped markedly.30    I accept that the prisoner loved his wife and child and was devastated by the loss of them.31    In the period immediately prior to the killing the prisoner had been living at Mr Doan's house. In early April Mr Doan left to return to Vietnam in order to marry. This left the prisoner even more isolated and conscious of his loss.32    The prisoner described his response to hearing his wife's telephone conversation with Mrs Nga in this way: 
     
      
       
        
         ""I just felt that I fell off from the sky to a very deep pit. I was agonising."" 
        
       
        
      
    33    After consuming more alcohol at the home of his friend Mr Lee and elsewhere the prisoner returned to the Dutton Street premises in the early hours of the morning of Tuesday, 21 April 1998. The prisoner gained entry to the garage of the premises. It was his evidence, which I accept, that he tapped on the internal wall between the garage and the main bedroom in the hope of waking his wife. He wanted to talk to her before he either left Sydney and returned to his family in Melbourne or killed himself. I accept that was his reason for returning to the Dutton Street premises.34    The Crown advanced its case upon the basis that the prisoner had become enraged with the deceased and that he went to the Dutton Street premises that morning carrying the broken pair of scissors in order to kill her. I do not accept that view of the facts as established beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, I do not consider it a probable view of the facts. It was clear that whilst in the garage of the premises the prisoner had free access through an open interconnecting door to the premises. The evidence showed that the deceased got up while the prisoner was in the garage and that he, having been disturbed, left the premises. The deceased was suspicious that someone was outside the premises. She picked up the phone by the window of the main bedroom to make contact with the police. It was at this time, when I accept that the prisoner had resolved to leave the premises, that he broke through the window and grabbed the phone from his mother-in-law.35    Thereafter it was the prisoner's account that he ran into the hallway of the house in an attempt to persuade the mother-in-law not to raise the alarm. He was in breach of the apprehended violence order by his presence at the premises and knew that he would be in trouble if the police were called. He said that in the darkened hallway of the home the deceased had struck him with something which he subsequently realised to be the broken pair of scissors. He had taken hold of the scissors and did not remember the killing.36    Medical evidence, both called in the defence and the Crown case, was to the effect that people involved in highly emotional and violent incidents of this type not uncommonly suffer amnesia for some or all of the incident. I accept, on balance, that the prisoner does not recall the detail of the killing.37    As I have already indicated, I do not find that the prisoner came to the premises armed with the pair of broken scissors.38    A week after the killing Mrs Pham disposed of a broken set of scissors which was recovered from the garbage bin by police. She was examined about this in some detail at the trial although it was not suggested that this was the weapon used to kill the deceased. I found her answers perplexing and I did not consider she was being completely frank in this portion of her evidence. When questioned about the instances involving her mother's assaults upon the prisoner both with the hammer and the meat clever, Mrs Pham's evidence was also somewhat unconvincing. In each instance she seemed to me to be concerned, as best she could, to protect her mother's memory.39    Mr Ierace invites me to find as a fact for the purpose of sentence that the deceased was the one armed with the broken scissor and that she struck him with it precipitating the attack. This was the accused's account in his evidence. It was not consistent with his wife's version of the fatal attack. I have not found it easy to determine this factual issue. Mrs Pham was tested at some length at trial as to whether she had been present in the hall throughout the incident. She was emphatic that she had been. On her account, although she had not seen the scissors until the three of them were back in the bedroom, she saw nothing to suggest that it was the mother who had first struck the prisoner. However, as I have indicated, I consider that Mrs Pham may be at pains to show respect for her mother's memory. I have regard to the fact that on two previous occasions the deceased had attacked the prisoner with a weapon when he came to the house. On balance I accept that it was she who first took up the scissors on this occasion.40    Dr Lucas gave evidence that the prisoner was suffering from a major depressive episode of considerable severity at the time of the killing. He described the events preceding the killing as major psychosocial stressors.41    Dr Carne gave evidence that the prisoner's depression, growing out of his belief that his wife was having an affair with another man and that his mother-in-law was conspiring in the breakdown of his marriage, led him to become profoundly depressed.42    Dr Wong, who was called by the Crown in a case in reply, was of the view that there were undoubtedly stressful life circumstances prior to the killing which were capable of resulting in a severe depression. The prisoner's account given to him, and to the other psychiatrists who interviewed him, described symptoms indicative of a severe depression. Dr Wong was not disposed to accept that the prisoner's account of his symptoms was reliable. To my mind the evidence of the prisoner's wife, Mr Doan and others was strongly supportive of the prisoner's account of his symptoms. Once one accepted the reliability of the prisoner's account in this regard I did not consider Dr Wong to be greatly at odds with either Dr Carne or Dr Lucas.43    As I have already indicated I approach the matter of sentence upon an acceptance that the prisoner's culpability was reduced to manslaughter by reason of his substantial impairment arising out of his mental condition. In a case where a verdict of manslaughter is returned on the ground of substantial impairment (formerly the partial defence of diminished responsibility) it will frequently be appropriate for the court to have regard to the risk that the prisoner's mental abnormality may lead him to kill again. In such cases considerations of the protection of society will be to the fore in the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476-477. The Crown supplied me with a schedule setting out details of a number of sentences imposed on persons convicted of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility in the period 1991 to 1995. In the majority of the cases set out in that schedule real concerns were raised as to the protection of society. That is not a consideration which to my mind is raised by the evidence in this case.44    The prisoner was subject to a remarkable combination of stressors in the period leading up to the killing. I do not find the evidence of any of the psychiatrists who were called at the trial to support a view that the prisoner's mental condition is such as to carry with it an appreciable risk that he would offend again in the future.45    The prisoner is a person of good character. He has had a sad and difficult life. He maintained a stable relationship with his wife until shortly before the tragic event. He appears to be a loving father who sincerely cares for his son. Minh Trang Pham gave evidence at the sentence hearing. Following the death of her mother she had proceeded with her application for a divorce. It should be noted that the application was commenced at the mother's prompting prior to the killing. Mrs Pham has visited the prisoner during the trial. She has taken her son to see him. He has been in custody since his arrest on 23 April 1998. It is Mrs Pham's evidence that she will continue to see the prisoner following his release.46    I consider the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation. While in custody he has undertaken adult education, successfully completing a reading and writing course. At the time of his incarceration his English was very limited. He is presently working at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre in Cortex 1 (Textile Industries). He has been made what is described as an essential worker due to the competence he demonstrated as a quality control supervisor. He is currently undertaking an after-hours textile course in clothing production. He is performing to the satisfaction of his teachers. Generally he is described by the Manager of Employment and Centre Services for the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre as ""an excellent worker who performs his duties well"".47    In the light of Mrs Pham's evidence to which I have made reference I think the likelihood is that the prisoner will ultimately resume his family life upon release. However, this will not be an easy transition given all that has happened.48    I accept that the killing of the deceased occurred at a time when, by reason of his major depressive condition, the prisoner's ability to control himself was substantially impaired. I accept that he has no recollection of the frenzied attack himself. I accept that he has suffered real remorse. During the course of the trial the prisoner broke down both when his wife was describing the killing and in the course of his own evidence of the events leading up to it. His distress was evident.49    The prisoner has mounted a powerful subjective case. It is appropriate that I mitigate the sentence to take account of these matters.50    In the light of the acceptance that the prisoner's culpability for this crime was significantly reduced by reason of his mental condition Mr Ierace submitted that I would place relatively little emphasis on considerations of general deterrence:  Regina v Anderson [1981] VR 155. In Regina v Letteri (unreported, NSW CCA, 18 March 1992) the authorities were summarised thus: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The principle then is clear enough. It is correctly stated as follows - that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise."" 
        
       
        
      
    51    I accept in the light of the evidence of the prisoner's impairment flowing from the major depressive episode that general deterrence should not have the weight which would otherwise be called for. 52    The sentence must nonetheless reflect that the unlawful take of a human life is always viewed as a serious matter:  Regina v Macdonald (unreported, NSW CCA, 12 December 1995).53    The malicious wounding of Minh Trang Pham was occasioned in the course of the attack upon the deceased. It is appropriate that the sentence that I impose in relation to that matter be concurrent with the sentence in respect of the manslaughter.54    The prisoner had not lived for long in this country at the time of the commission of this offence. He had relatively few social supports available to him. He has suffered from major depression while in custody and entertained thoughts of suicide. Although he has made commendable efforts while in custody in terms of both education and employment, I consider that his readjustment into society at the completion of the custodial portion of his sentence may be difficult and that he will benefit from supervision for a relatively lengthy period. These considerations in my view constitute special circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 and make it appropriate that I impose an additional term that exceeds one-third of the minimum term.55    The pressures to which the prisoner was subject in the weeks prior to the killing while he was in the throes of depression were remarkable and have led me to the view that the sentences in respect of both matters should reflect a substantial measure of leniency.56    In sentencing the prisoner in respect of the charge of manslaughter I am asked to take into account the offence of contravening the apprehended violence order which was imposed by the Fairfield Court on 17 April 1998 and breached by the prisoner attending at the Dutton Street premises on 19 April 1998. This offence is recorded on a Form 1 pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. I take this matter into account. In the light of the wife's evidence that she procured the issue of the order to appease her mother while continuing herself to seek out her husband, I do not propose attaching the weight to this offence that the breach of a protective court order would ordinarily attract.57    Son Thai Tran, in relation to the conviction for manslaughter of Sanh Thi Nguyen I sentence you to a minimum term of three years and six months penal servitude to commence on 23 April 1998 and to expire on 22 October 2001. I specify an additional term of two years and six months to commence on 23 October 2001 and to expire on 22 April 2004.58    In relation to the conviction upon the charge of malicious wounding I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months backdated to 23 April 1998. Accordingly, that sentence expired on 22 April 1999.

    1   GREG JAMES, J: This appeal was brought against a conviction in the District Court of New South Wales at Tamworth on 11 June 1999 on one count that on or about 2 December 1985 at Kempsey in the state of New South Wales the appellant did unlawfully take KD out of the possession and against the will of TID, a person having the lawful charge of KD, she being an unmarried girl under the age of 16 years. Leave to appeal against sentence is also sought. 
    2   The offence is under s.90 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty is prescribed of three years imprisonment. The appellant was sentenced to a total term of two years and six months to date from 10 June 1999 and a minimum term of one year and three months was prescribed. 
    3   He had also been charged with offences of having sexual intercourse with KD and carnally knowing her but was acquitted of those offences by the verdict of the jury. 
    4   I take the summary of the Crown case from the Crown submissions on this appeal:- 
     
      
       
       ""In 1985 the complainant moved to Kempsey with her family. The appellant moved with them and stayed for about a month. On 2 December 1985, four days before her birthday, the complainant and her brother, D, were waiting for the school bus at the bus stop near her home when the appellant drove up in his ute and offered to give them a lift to school. The complainant said that neither she nor her brother wanted to go with the appellant and they told him that they wanted to catch the bus. He told them not to worry about the bus and made the complainant sit in the middle and D near the window. The appellant dropped D at school (Melville High School) and gave him a note to give his mother. The complainant said that she was not aware of the contents of the note. The appellant did not allow the complainant to get out of the car, even though she told him that she wanted to go to school. He told her that he was taking her home to her mother. 
       
      
      
       
       The appellant then drove away from the school but he did not return to the complainant's mother's house. Instead, he drove to his daughter, Muriel Fay Jackson's place at Woolgoolga."" 
       
      
    5   Additionally, evidence was given that was, strictly speaking, irrelevant to that count that the complainant and the appellant remained at the daughter's house for a time then moved into a flat in Coffs Harbour. They were thereafter living at various locations around the north coast area. Acts of intercourse between them took place over the succeeding years and it was the evidence of the complainant that the appellant had not allowed her to make contact with her family. 
    6   The complainant and the appellant remained together until April 1994 and during this time the complainant gave birth to four children by the appellant. It was her evidence that in 1994 she left the appellant for a year and thereafter commenced custody proceedings for the four children. She had complained to the police in the expectation that might assist her in obtaining custody of the children. There was evidence notwithstanding various letters and birthday cards admitted into evidence asserting the contrary from her, that she did not wish to remain with the appellant and that these were written under duress. 
    7   TID, her mother, gave evidence that when she left home her daughter was unmarried and under the age of 16 and that she had given no permission to the appellant to take her away. 
    8   Evidence had been given also by the appellant's daughter that the day prior to her father bringing the complainant to her home, he had discussed with her the possibility of taking one or other of TID's children away from her because, so he alleged, TID was not a fit and proper mother. She told the appellant that the children were not his concern. The appellant told his daughter that he had made arrangements with the complainant to leave the back door of the house unlocked. The daughter gave evidence that he left her place about 2.30 am to 3.00 am following that conversation and returned later that day with the complainant who was in school uniform, had her school bag and jumper and some items of underwear. She said that she attempted to dissuade the complainant from staying with the appellant but that the complainant said she was in love with the appellant and, although she tried to persuade the complainant to return to her mother, the complainant declined her assistance. 
    9   The appellant, who gave evidence at the trial, admitted driving the complainant from her mother's home but said that he had done so at the request of the complainant; that the complainant told him that she did not want to stay at her mother's house because her mother's friend was coming to live there and she was afraid of him; and that he had received from her a letter requesting him to pick her up from the bus stop. He said that at the time he picked her up from the bus stop, it was his understanding that she had already left home. He then wrote a note for the complainant's mother indicating his intention of taking the complainant to his daughter's place and gave it to her brother to give to his mother. 
    10   He said that the complainant went willingly with him and willingly stayed with him until 1994 and that he had not attempted to prevent her from contacting her family. 
    11   The complainant's mother gave evidence that the note said:- 
     
      
       
       ""By the time you receive this letter, we will be in Sydney. Don't worry about (KD), she's better off with me. I'll get her some new clothes, don't get the law because we'll only just disappear further into hiding."" 
       
      
    12   The complainant's mother said it read:- 
     
      
       
       ""Something similar to that. Actually, that's more or less the words that I read in the letter. As I said, it was only a small piece."" 
       
      
    13   There were other versions of the note referred to. 
    14   The complainant had given evidence that when the appellant picked her up at the bus stop, she had wished to wait for the bus rather than go with him. When they went to the school, she wanted to go to school but he said: ""Well, I'll take you back home to your mother"", but instead, drove her to his daughter's place. 
    15   In cross-examination she denied that she had decided to leave home or that she had asked the appellant to pick her up. The appellant's daughter had given evidence that the complainant said, on arrival at her place, that ""she wanted to go away with him, she was in love with him and all the rest of it..."", and that the complainant had told her that the complainant had left her mother. 
    16   The appellant admitted making a prior arrangement with the complainant to pick her up from the bus stop, but asserted that it was for the purpose of simply transporting the complainant to his daughter's place. He further asserted that she had already left home and that leaving home was her own idea; that she had arranged the pick up by letter. He asserted that he did not recall the specific terms of the note but admitted giving it to the brother to transmit to the mother. 
    17   At the conclusion of the Crown's cross-examination, the learned trial judge raised with the Crown Prosecutor a failure to cross-examine the accused on his assertion that he had picked up the complainant after she had already left home, raising the suggestion that, in those circumstances, the complainant might not have been in the mother's possession at the relevant time. He granted leave to the Crown to resume the cross-examination. It does not appear that course was consented to, but nor does it appear that it was opposed. 
    18   During that further cross-examination, the appellant asserted that the complainant had already made the arrangements to leave home with him for the purpose of seeing if she could stay at his daughter's house. He asserted:- 
     
      
       
       ""I didn't take her away for your information either. She left of her own free will, she wasn't chained or roped up and taken away. Well I couldn't help - well if she wants to go she goes."" 
       
      
    19   At the close of the Crown case his Honour raised the question of whether the mere taking of the complainant away from the bus stop might not amount to taking her from the possession of her mother and, in consequence, there was some debate concerning appropriate directions. 
    20   In this regard it is important to note that the appellant was not charged with any offence of having sexual intercourse with the complainant either with or without her consent on the occasion on which it was alleged he took her away. He was not charged with the offence under s.86 of the Crimes Act which deals with the taking away of a female of any age who has an interest in property or is a presumptive heiress or next of kin, from motives of lucre with intent to marry or carnally know her or to cause her to be married or carnally known. Nor was the offence under s.87 involving the fraudulent allurement, taking away or detention of a female under the age of 21 years out of the possession and against the will of the person having the lawful charge of her with intent to marry or carnally know her, nor the offence under s.89 which requires the application of force in taking away, again with intent that she be married or carnally known. It was not the offence under s.90A of taking away or detaining a person with intent to hold them for ransom or for any other advantage. 
    21   The discussion in respect of the proper directions on the elements of the relevant offence tended to turn on cases of some degree of antiquity concerning the elements of various of this group of offences now appearing in the Crimes Act 1900 and their statutory predecessors. In particular, the debate dealt with the question of whether or not at law, a girl under 16 could, by absconding, renounce the protection of her lawful guardian. It appears that because of this discussion, his Honour concluded that the submission put by counsel for the defence to the jury that there was a factual matter for them to decide in these circumstances was incorrect, although the submission itself was not precisely identified. 
    22   Nonetheless, the reference to Regina v. Livens (1907) 23 WN 15; Regina v. Charman (1910) 10 SR 540; Regina v. Prior (1898) 15 WN 171 suggested that the submission put by counsel for the defence was that a factual question remaining for the jury on the issue of whether or not his client had done what was necessary to unlawfully take the complainant from her mother's possession, but his Honour appears to have rejected that there was any valid argument to that effect open. 
    23   His Honour directed the jury that if TID was caring for the complainant and if the accused had no court order entitling him to custody of or access to the complainant, then, to remove her, as he had been alleged to have removed her, would very clearly amount to the unlawful taking of KD out of her mother's possession. He directed the jury that the defence submission that if the complainant had decided to leave home before going to the bus stop, she would not have been in the possession of her mother at the time the accused picked her up, had, as a matter of law to be rejected. 
    24   He directed the jury that the attitude of girl had nothing to do with the charge and that it did not matter whether she wanted to go, or did not want to go. 
    25   Subsequently, on an application for redirection, trial counsel asked his Honour to give a direction focusing on whether or not what the accused did was a taking of the victim. He submitted that his Honour's earlier directions had appeared to cover the circumstance of the taking such that his Honour had just directed the jury that, as a matter of law, the complainant was in the mother's possession and there was nothing left for their consideration at all. 
    26   The Crown Prosecutor conceded that there was an issue for the jury as to whether he had taken her out of her mother's possession. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
       ""Well, Mr. Parker, I think perhaps I should give it, but only because your client himself, in his evidence, raised the suggestion that he was no more than a taxi driver."" 
       
      
    27   His Honour directed that the jury that:- 
     
      
       
       ""Members of the jury, there are just a couple of matters that I should expand on, very briefly I should say. The first is this, the third charge includes an allegation that the accused did unlawfully take (KD). It follows that an actual taking must be proved by the Crown. I remind you of this because the accused has told you in his evidence that he was no more than a taxi driver. All he did, he says, was to drive her to Woolgoolga. It follows, he says, that he did not take her from her mother's possession. 
       
      
       
      
       
       In response to that, of course, the Crown says that it is plain as day that he was not just a taxi driver because the only acceptable evidence is that, having arrived at Woolgoolga, he immediately formed a relationship with (KD) and, shortly thereafter, travelled with her all over the countryside and remained with her for nine years. Nevertheless, I just want to make it plain to her that it is an essential element in the Crown case that the Crown prove that there was this unlawful taking, the taking."" 
       
      
    28   This was the whole of the relevant directions. The jury were offered no assistance even as to whether being ""no more than a taxi driver"" would exculpate the accused. The reference to the formation of the relationship and the subsequent conduct was, at the least, likely to obscure a proper appreciation of the essentially undescribed necessary element. 
    29   The grounds of appeal are as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. His Honour, at the end of the Crown case, should have directed a verdict of acquittal. 
       
      
       
      
       
       2. Alternatively, there was a miscarriage of justice in that the verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
       
      
       
       3. His Honour erred in law in misdirecting and/failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to the element of unlawfully taking (KD) out of the possession of (TID). 
       
      
       
      
       
       4. His Honour erred in law in not directing the jury in accordance with Jelf, J. in  
       Regina v. Jarvis 
        20 Cox CC 249 and  
       Regina v. Jenkins 
        23 WN 5. 
       
      
       
      
       
       5. His Honour erred in law in rejecting the submission of the defence counsel as set out on page 15 of the summing-up. 
       
      
       
      
       
       6. His Honour erred in law in not directing the jury as to the facts supporting ground 3 for the appellant. 
       
      
       
      
       
       7. The sentence was excessive:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) in all the circumstances; 
       
      
      
       
        (b) by sentencing in effect for facts supporting a charge under s.87 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which he had not been convicted."" 
       
      
    30   I consider Ground 1, that is that his Honour should have directed a verdict of acquittal, cannot be upheld. Although, as I shall show, a relevant and material issue existed in relation to the taking of the complainant from the possession of her mother, nonetheless the evidence on the matter was not all one way. As to the other elements of the offence, there was either no issue posed by the appellant at all, or the matters were admitted. Plainly, therefore, it would not have been open to his Honour to direct a verdict of acquittal (see Doney v. The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207). 
    31   Similarly, there was sufficient evidence so that it was open to the jury to find guilt. The ground that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory or unsupported by the evidence (Fleming v. The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379) is not made out. 
    32   Turning to the remaining grounds, the submission of the appellant as to the necessity for blandishments must be rejected. 
    33   ""Blandishments or persuasion"" are not necessary to constitute the seducing of a girl from one having charge of her, a taking away under the section. Nor is the decision of Jelf, J. in Regina v. Jarvis (1901-1906) 20 Cox CC 249 to that effect. His discussion of persuasion and blandishment was in the context of posing for the jury the question of whether or not the active part in the going away together was that of the prisoner. He held that an actual physical taking away was not necessary if the girl was induced to leave by seduction. If, on the other hand, she determined to leave home, showing him that was her determination and insisted on leaving with him (his Honour even gave the illustration of her being so forward as to write and suggest to him that he should go away with her) and he yielded to her suggestion, taking no active part in the matter, then he was to be acquitted. 
    34   The direction in Charman (supra) was that the prisoner should be acquitted if the girl herself, of her own accord, removed herself without any inducement by the appellant out of possession of the mother. No criticism of that direction was suggested on appeal. 
    35   Jarvis (supra) was expressly followed in Regina v. Jenkins (1906) 23 WN 5. Regina v. Davis (1897) 23 WN 144 is to a similar effect. More recently in Regina v. Macney (1903) 29 VLR 22 on a special case reserved for the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria by Madden, CJ., the court embarked on an examination of the correctness of the views of the Chief Justice when he directed the jury as to what would constitute a taking of the girl in respect of a similar statutory offence which included the element of intent that she should be carnally known. 
    36   Counsel had argued that there must be a display of some activity on the accused's part and that he must have done something by way of inducement or persuasion, or must have, in some way, conduced to the girl leaving her home. The Chief Justice rejected that contention and directed the jury that the girl's willingness to go with the prisoner was immaterial. 
    37   It was held that the girl's willingness would have been quite immaterial if the jury had concluded that the prisoner was the moving spirit but that the Chief Justice's refusal to direct as to the necessity that he be an active party was in error. 
    38   In Regina v. Stanton (1981) 3 A Crim R 294, the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, for the purpose of examining sections 330 of the criminal code 1913 (WA), looked at the various common law provisions and authorities. Wallace, J. concluded there must be a causal link between the activity of the prisoner and the leaving of the possession of the person entitled to her custody by the girl. To similar effect, he noted, was the judgment of Crisp, J. in Regina v. Mejac (1994) Tas. SR 26 in relation to section 189 of that State's Criminal Code (1924) Tas. 
    39   Brinsden, J., noting as Wallace, J. had, that the intent of the girl in itself has always been held to be immaterial, nonetheless noted that the question the jury should have been invited to consider was whether the accused did that which had the requisite effect. He specifically cited Jarvis (supra) as an illustration of his view of the correct criterion. 
    40   Although the issue as to whether or not the appellant had performed some such act as relevantly occasioned the removal by the girl from the possession of the person entitled has been referred to in different factual circumstances as relating to the question of whether or not, at the relevant time, the girl was in possession or there was a taking, nonetheless, the concept has consistently underlain the construction of the statutory provisions providing for this and similar offences. 
    41   So strongly has that element been regarded that in Regina v. Alexander (1912) 7 Crim. App. R. 110 is reported the upholding of the appeal from a plea of guilty by an unrepresented accused whom a Commissioner had told that there was no defence in circumstances that there might be some evidence that the girl left the custody of her parents voluntarily. 
    42   This was really the issue also in this case. Until his Honour's attention was drawn to the specific matter at the close of his summing-up on this charge, there had, because of the confusion generated by the different ways in which the concept had been referred to in the cases, been, in my view, a failure to put at all the true defence (Regina v. Downs (aka Piggott) (1985) 18 A. C Crim R 75 at 93). 
    43   The re-direction did not draw the jury's attention to the relevant evidence as bearing upon the essential question. It did not expressly, at that point of the summing-up, re-direct the jury as to the standard of proof and, in particular, the evidence of the appellant's daughter which may well have had a bearing upon the jury's decision in the context of a direction as to standard of proof. It is clear that there was evidence that the jury might have accepted of a taking within the section. It is clear also, however, that there was evidence such as might have cast doubt upon the jury finding that element. 
    44   For these reasons I am of the view that grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 should be upheld and that, in the absence of full directions on such an essential matter, there has been a material miscarriage of justice as is referred to in s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Such a miscarriage, relating as it does to the central issue at the trial on this charge, is not one to which the proviso might run. 
    45   I turn to consider whether there should be a new trial. 
    46   In sentencing the appellant his Honour appears to have regard to matters of aggravation which were not part of this offence and which, if proved, would have established relevant elements of more serious offences. That is to say he appears to have concluded that the appellant abducted the complainant for the purpose of carnally knowing her. That would amount to an error (see The Queen v. de Simoni (1981) 148 CLR 383). Regard seems also to have been had to many events subsequent to the offence. The sentence may have been in error. 
    47   The events occurred in December 1985. The appellant has been in custody since 10 June 1999, having been arrested and charged and on bail subject to conditions since 14 March 1996. Although he has prior record, it is not for any offence of this nature and he was at the trial acquitted of the other charges. 
    48   I have already referred to the circumstances in which this complaint came to be laid so long after the event. There was, prior to this trial, apparently, an aborted trial. The appellant is now 74 years of age and in ill health and has had no significant prior offences for over 18 years. In all the circumstances, I do not consider that a new trial should be ordered, having regard to the principles in King v. The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423; Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v. Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627; Parker v. The Queen (1997) 186 CLR 494. 
    49   I propose the appeal should be upheld and an acquittal entered. 
    50   I would not, however, leave the matter without recommending that the legislature give consideration to reconsidering this group of offences in the Crimes Act 1900 in consequence of changes in modern community attitudes. I would propose that the appeal be upheld and an acquittal entered. 
    51   HANDLEY, JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Greg James and the reasons he has given. 
    52   BARR, J: I also agree. 
    53   HANDLEY, JA: The orders of the court are appeal allowed, conviction quashed, acquittal entered and the appellant is ordered to be released forthwith.

      REGINA v ALFONSO PULIDO 
       
       
      CRIMINAL LAW - Customs Act - s 233B(1) - possessing prohibited import - cocaine - quantity not less than trafficable quantity  
       
       
      SENTENCING - whether head sentence outside range appropriate for offence - whether non parole period excessive in relation to head sentence - whether quantity of prohibited import a relevant factor in sentencing 
      
      
      The applicant had agreed to receive a parcel sent by post from Columbia which was intercepted and found to contain pure cocaine equivalent to 600 gms. He pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 233B(1) of the  
     Customs Act  
     of having in his possession a prohibited import consisting of a quantity of cocaine not less than the trafficable quantity of 2 gms, and the sentencing Judge imposed a sentence of 6½ years’ imprisonment with a non parole period of 4½ years. An application for leave to appeal challenged the Judge’s exercise of his sentencing discretion on the grounds that the head sentence was outside the range appropriate for a courier involved in the importation of cocaine, and that the non parole period was manifestly excessive in relation to the head sentence. The relevance of the quantity involved in the offence was also in issue. 
      
     HELD 
     : refusing the application for leave to appeal: (1) The sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was not outside the relevant range. (2) The difference between the non parole period imposed by the sentencing Judge and the normal non parole period did not involve an error calling for appellate intervention. (3) Whilst the quantity involved in an offence can be important there is no necessary correlation between quantity and criminality. In the present case the applicant who had agreed to receive a parcel sent by others, had no control over the quantity involved in the offence. It was therefore inappropriate to emphasise the quantity involved in this case, although it may be more relevant in other cases.

      REGINA v ALFONSO PULIDO 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HANDLEY JA: This is an application for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ on 16 September 1998. The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 233B(1) of the Customs Act of having in his possession a prohibited import consisting of a quantity of cocaine not less than the trafficable quantity of 2 gms. 
    2    The applicant had agreed to receive a parcel sent by post from Columbia which was intercepted and found to contain 296.9 gms of pure cocaine, approximately 600 gms in bulk. The contents were extremely valuable on the street. 
    3    The offence carried a maximum of 25 years’ imprisonment. His Honour imposed a sentence of 6½ years, 4½ years being the non parole period. The sentence was back-dated to commence on 4 February when the applicant was taken into custody. 
    4    Ms Burgess, who appeared for the applicant, has drawn attention to every matter relevant to the exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion and this Court’s task in reviewing that exercise. Her principal submission is that the head sentence was outside the range appropriate for a courier involved in the importation of cocaine. A second submission was that the non parole period was manifestly excessive in relation to the head sentence. 
    5    Many of the cases to which we have been referred, including those noted in the schedule to a judgment in R v Michael John Spiteri, have focused on the precise quantity involved in the offence. While the precise quantity is important for legal reasons, because of the scale in the Customs Act which distinguishes between the commercial quantity, a quantity less not than a trafficable quantity and a lesser quantity, there is no necessary correlation between the quantity involved and the subjective or objective criminality of the accused. 
    6    The applicant agreed to receive a parcel to be sent to him through the post from Columbia and had no advance knowledge of the quantity or quality of cocaine in that parcel. He signed up for an enterprise which, as far as he was concerned, within the limits imposed by regulations covering parcels sent through the post, was open-ended. It seems to me that any emphasis on the precise quantity in a case such as this is inappropriate, although in other cases it may be a relevant factor. 
    7    I am therefore unpersuaded by submissions based on a comparison between sentences imposed in other cases graduated by the quantity of heroin or cocaine involved in the offences as a basis for comparison with this sentence. The real question is whether the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing Judge was outside the relevant range. That may be discerned from the cases that have been decided since the Crimes Act (Cth) was amended following the Sentencing Act being passed by the Parliament of this State. 
    8    Ms Burgess has referred us to a number of cases and sentences reviewed in those cases but I have not been persuaded that those cases, which are fully dealt with in her written submissions, establish that this sentence was outside any relevant range. In may be conceded that the sentence imposed by his Honour was at the high end of the range, but I have not been persuaded that it is outside that range. 
    9    The other matter relied upon by Ms Burgess was the fact that the non parole period was approximately 68% of the head sentence, whereas it is said, and indeed conceded to be normal, that it is between 60 and 66% of the head sentence. I have not been persuaded a difference of the order of two percentage points demonstrates an error calling for the intervention of this Court. 
    10    I would, therefore, propose that leave to appeal be refused. 
    11    BARR J: I agree. 
    12    GREG JAMES J: I also agree. The range of sentences open to a particular sentencing Judge in a matter such as this is wide. There is a great deal of room for legitimate difference in the sentences passed by individual Judges. It is only where the sentence so far exceeds that which is open to the individual sentencing Judge that error may be discerned, and an application for leave to appeal on this ground should be upheld. 
    13    HANDLEY JA: The order of the Court will be leave to appeal refused.******

     70201/98 Regina v James Allen Huntington 
      
       
    Remarks on Sentence1     HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, James Allen Huntington, has pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory after the fact of the manslaughter of Mr James Kelly. The circumstances of this unusual offence can be stated fairly briefly.  
     
      
       
      
    2     The prisoner was only sixteen years of age at the relevant time. He was aquainted with the deceased, Mr Kelly, as he was with one Paul Suters. In May 1992, Suters telephoned the prisoner asking him to go to the deceased's home. When he arrived there he saw the deceased lying on the garage floor, bleeding, apparently dead. It is the Crown case that Suters killed the deceased and indeed he has yet to stand trial upon a charge of murder. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The prisoner assisted Suters to bury the deceased's body in a park. Suters threatened to kill him if he told anyone what had happened and on subsequent occasions he gave the prisoner small amounts of money. 
     
      
       
      
    4     Police investigations led to the prisoner in 1992 and it is sufficient to say that the prisoner told police a false story which did not disclose Suters' involvement in the death. The result was that the prisoner was charged as a juvenile with unlawful disposal of a body and some related offences for which he was dealt with in a children's court and placed on probation. 
     
      
       
      
    5     As I understand it it was not until 1997 that further police investigations led them to Suters and back to the prisoner and it was in February of that year that the prisoner told the police the truth of what had occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    6     As Mr Byrne SC, for the prisoner, realistically pointed out, the seriousness of the offence lies not merely in assisting in the disposal of a body but also in maintaining silence about Suters' involvement over a period of years. 
     
      
       
      
    7     On the other hand there are some factors tending to mitigate the prisoner's behaviour at the time the body was disposed of. It does appear, and I accept, that Suters held some sway over the prisoner. As I have said, he was only sixteen years old at the time. The material before me discloses a disturbed family background and the offence was committed in that context. Indeed, at the time in question he was virtually fending for himself because of the difficulties which he faced at home arising from the behaviour of his stepfather. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Much has happened since that time. There are a number of reports before me. I have a Department of Juvenile Justice report and a psychiatric assessment which were obtained for the purpose of the proceedings in the children's court in 1993. I have an up-to-date psychological assessment of Doctor Wendy Louise Walker. I have impressive testimonials from responsible citizens who know him, together with a statement from his mother attesting to the difficulties he faced in his childhood and the extent to which he has overcome them in his young adulthood. I also have the benefit of a pre-sentence report recently prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
       
      
    9     The effect of all that material is that the prisoner has truly turned his life around since the early 90's, thanks in large part, it would seem, to his close relationship to his mother and to his siblings and thanks also to a stable and beneficial de facto relationship which he now enjoys. The material speaks very highly of him as a worker and as a person. 
     
      
       
      
    10     I accept that at the time of the burial of the body he was revolted by what he did. I accept that for many years he has lived with the guilt of it and that has weighed heavily upon him. I accept that the fact that the matter has finally come to light has been a relief to him. 
     
      
       
      
    11     He presents now as a young man who is completely rehabilitated. In my view, neither his interests nor those of the community would be served by his being imprisoned or even by his being subject to some other form of punishment such as periodic detention or community service.  
     
      
       
      
    12     I do not deny for one moment the seriousness of the offence but in the light of all the evidence in this case I am satisfied that the proper result is a recognizance. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Would you stand up please Mr Huntington. I defer passing sentence upon your entering into a recognisance without security in the sum of $1000 to be of good behaviour for a period of two years.  
     
      
       
      
    14     Gentlemen, do either of you suggest that there should be conditions of that recognizance? It does not appear to me that there should be. Very well, that is the order I make and the recognizance may be entered before any Justice.

     NSW CRIME COMMISSION v SHARYN ALLANA GARDINER 
      
       
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1    HIS HONOUR: An order was made by Newman J of this Court on 12 December 1996 pursuant to the powers residing in this Court under s10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (the Act). In accordance with usual practice those orders were made ex parte in reliance upon an affidavit of Michael Charles Luland sworn 12 December 1996. 
    2    The essence of the case put to his Honour on behalf of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) was that on the search of property occupied by the present applicant money and drugs were found. Orders were sought and obtained relating to a number of items of property, funds in various bank accounts and $40,000 in cash. None of the property was shown to have been owned, in any sense, by Sharyn Allana Gardiner from whose criminal activities alone Mr Luland suspected they were derived. 
    3    As I understand it, the reasonable suspicion necessary to the exercise of the Court's discretion under s10 of the Act was engendered by the relationship of Sharyn Allana Gardiner to the applicant, namely, she was his ex-wife, and to James Keith Gardiner in particular, their son, added to her conviction in respect of the possession and cultivation of a large quantity of Cannabis plants. 
    4    Although this evidence was exiguous it seems to me, with unfeigned respect for his Honour, that it was sufficient to engender the reasonable suspicion to which s10(3)(b) of the Act refers. Indeed Mr Steirn SC for the applicant did not seek to maintain the contrary. 
    5    This application is brought to permit the applicant to show by other evidence, including his own and that of an accountant, that no reasonable suspicion could presently exist that the property is relevantly derived. 
    6    Without conceding that the applicant is in a position to call such evidence Mr Temby QC for the Commission submits that even were such evidence available this Court either could not or should not permit the question to be litigated. He submits, and rightly, that even if the order made by Newman J was in error this could be corrected only by appeal. He submits that the power to make ancillary orders or vary a restraining order conferred on the Court by s12 of the Act cannot permit an enquiry of the fundamental kind sought by the applicant directed to undermining the continuance of the restraining order and hence cutting short the appropriate succession of hearings involving an application for a forfeiture order under s10, the making of a forfeiture order under s22 and the consideration of any application under s25 of the Act. 
    7    The significance of this point is of some real substance. Having regard to the questions posed for consideration by ss22 and 25 of the Act and the differing onus which those provisions place upon the parties, the scheme of the Act appears to be that if there is a reasonable suspicion of criminal derivation of assets, a restraining order may be made ex parte which will subsist for more than 48 hours, providing, amongst other things, an application for a forfeiture order is made. That application is determined by the considerations in s22 of the Act which contains two significant elements. The first is that the onus of proof of the relevant crime-related activity is on the Commission, though the standard of proof is the civil standard, namely, a matter of probability; the second is that this enquiry does not concern itself with any link between the crime-related activity and the property in question but, rather, with the existence of a specified criminal history. 
    8    A person who wishes to obtain relief from an asset forfeiture order must (for relevant purposes) proceed under s25. That provision enables such a person to establish that the property was not illegally acquired. If the person succeeds in establishing this more probably than not then, in substance, it must be returned to the person.  
    9    The philosophy underlying the Act appears to be that if it is established, first of all, that there is a reasonable suspicion that property is derived from crime-related activity and that some crime-related activity - not necessarily that to which the suspicion attaches - occurred within six years of the application under s22, it is reasonable and appropriate that the property should be forfeited unless the person with an interest can show more probably than not it was innocently acquired. 
    10    It will be seen, therefore, that a reasonable suspicion under s10(3) of the Act is not only an essential legal requirement to the continuation of proceedings but also provides a basis in justice for requiring a person to establish innocent acquisition of property which is their own and which the Act seeks to expropriate. I refer to the justice of the scheme, not because the Act requires consideration of any such requirement as such, but because in the exercise of any available judicial discretion the justice of the order sought, or sought to be amended in the light of subsequent circumstances, is in a shorthand way material to a consideration of its due exercise. 
    11    It is not sought to be controverted and could not be controverted that an order which restrains the property of any person is a most serious interference with their civil rights. To go to the next step of expropriating that property is a fortiori so. Accordingly, one should not approach the exercise of the jurisdiction given to this Court under s10 of the Act on the basis that the order is of trivial significance, to be looked at only as a trigger for setting the procedure of the Act in motion.  
    12    Section 10(2) of the Act permits the Commission to apply to this Court ex parte for a restraining order in specified circumstances. It is conceded by Mr Temby QC for the Commission, if I might say so properly, that the Commission is not required so to proceed and that in an appropriate case the person affected by any restraining order might well be given notice of the application and be present and participate in the hearing at which the order is sought. Indeed, as is accepted, the Act itself envisages the possibility that a person interested in property sought to be restrained might be notified of the application before the order is made: see s11 (2)(b). 
    13    It was weakly suggested by Mr Steirn SC for the applicant that the Commission in this case should have given notice of its application to the present applicant but this submission did not long survive examination. In order to protect the assets sought to be restrained it is clear that proceeding ex parte was appropriate. Mr Steirn SC submits that by analogy with similar proceedings arising otherwise in the Court an ex parte order should be interim or temporary only and that a person affected by a restraining order should be able to be heard on its continuation in respect of the issues raised by s10(3) in particular. 
    14    A difficulty facing this submission is that there appears not to be, in terms, any jurisdiction for that to occur if the Judge when first making the order did not so qualify it. Mr Steirn SC concedes that he cannot argue that the order made by Newman J erred in failing so to do. Rather he says there is a prima facie basis upon which those orders are now seen to be inappropriate in an unqualified form and should be varied, pointing to the provisions of s12(1) of the Act as a source of power to do so.  
    15    Mr Temby QC, for the Commission, rightly points out that if the restraining order be not continued then the application for a forfeiture order upon which it depends must fall since it is a necessary condition of such an application that a restraining order be in existence. I do not find this argument persuasive since it would only be in the event that there was no relevant reasonable suspicion that the restraining order would not be continued and if there were no reasonable suspicion the basis for the proceedings under s22 of the Act would be rightly removed. 
    16    The more substantial argument is that the scheme of the Act envisages that once the initial obstacle is past and an order obtained so that the reasonable suspicion as to the derivation of the property is established, though only ex parte the resolution of any outstanding questions must be left, as the Act, it is argued, clearly envisages, to the procedures provided in s22 and (relevantly) s25. 
    17    Where the relevant criminal activity is that of the person whose interest is sought to be expropriated this argument is fairly strong. However, where the person who is the owner of the property must answer for the actions of another which is the effect in this case of s25 it is, to my mind, somewhat weakened. Of course, the specific provisions of the Act must override any such misgivings which, in the end, are based upon policy considerations, admittedly both longstanding and very important but which the Legislature has undoubted power to qualify, especially so where it is grappling with an extremely dangerous attack upon the integrity of the civil community. 
    18    The judicial approach to this legislation has been set out both eloquently and accurately, if I may say so with respect, in DPP v Logan Park Investments Pty Limited & Anor (1995) 37 NSWLR 118 by Kirby P (as he then was) at 125, the correctness of which is not in question in this case, and which was heeded by Studdert J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Davies (unreported) [1999] NSWSC 354, a case in which the Act in question before me required consideration. 
    19    If Mr Steirn's application is to succeed it can only do so if s12(1) of the Act permits it. That subsection relevantly is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
       “12(1) The Supreme Court may, when it makes a restraining order or at any later time, make any ancillary orders (whether or not affecting a person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order) that the Court considers appropriate and, without limiting the generality of this, the Court may make any one or more of the following orders: 
       
      
       
      
       
       (a) an order varying the interests in property to which the restraining order relates, 
       
      
       
      
       
       (b) an order for the examination on oath of: 
       
      
       
      
       
        
         
         (i) the owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining order, or 
         
        
       
      
       
      
       
        
         
         (ii) another person, 
         
        
       
      
       
      
       
       before the Court, or before an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court, concerning the affairs of the owner, including the nature and location of any property in which the owner has an interest. 
       
      
       
      
       
       (b1) an order for the examination on oath of a person who is the spouse or a de facto partner (as defined in the  
       De Facto Relationships Act 
        1984) of the owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining order, before the Court or before an officer of the Court prescribed by the rules of court, concerning the affairs of the person, including the nature and location of any property in which the person or that owner has an interest, 
       
      
       
      
       
       (c) an order with respect to the carrying out of any undertaking with respect to the payment of damages or costs given on behalf of the State in connection with the making of the restraining order, 
       
      
       
      
       
       (c1) an order directing a person who is or was the owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining order or, if the owner is or was a body corporate, a director of the body corporate specified by the Court, to furnish to the Commission or Public Trustee, within a period specified in the order, a statement, verified by the oath of the person making the statement, setting out such particulars of the property, or dealings with the property in which the owner has or had an interest as the court thinks proper, 
       
      
       
      
       
       (d) if the restraining order requires the Public Trustee to take control of an interest in property: 
       
      
       
      
       
        
         
         (i) an order regulating the manner in which the Public Trustee may exercise functions under the restraining order, or 
         
        
       
      
       
      
       
        
         
         (ii) an order determining any question relating to the interest, including any question affecting the liabilities of the owner of the interest or the functions of the Public Trustee, or 
         
        
       
      
       
      
       
        
         
         (iii) (Repealed) 
         
        
       
      
       
      
       
       (e) an order requiring or authorising the seizure or taking possession of property."" 
       
      
    20    The order sought by the applicant is to vary the orders made by Newman J by the addition of the words ""pending a hearing as to the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of s10 as at the date of such hearing"" so that the commencing words of the orders would then read:  
     
      
       
       ""Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor being noted) pending a hearing as to the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of section 10 as at the date of such hearing, the Court orders"". 
       
      
    21    It is submitted by Mr Temby QC that such a variation is not an ancillary order within the meaning of s12(1). He submits that ancillary means supplementary and subordinate to the principal matter, citing McCleary & Ors v The Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) (1998) 157 ALR 301 at 332. In that case, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia considered a restraining order against a third party's property made pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) and in particular s6K(c)(i) which extends the definition of an exempt proceeding to ""a proceeding by way of application for a restraining order or an order that is ancillary to a restraining order"". The application concerned proceedings to enforce an undertaking for damages and it was submitted that they were ""ancillary to a restraining order"" and hence were exempt proceedings with the result that certain evidence was admissible.  
    22    The Court said (at 332) - 
     
      
       
       ""In  
       Koala Motels Pty Limited v Chief Licensing Inspector 
        (1977) 18 ALR 12 at 14, Muirhead J pointed out that the word 'ancillary' has a special meaning.' ""It means less than supplementary or supplemental to - it means 'subservient' or 'subordinate'..."" According to the Macquarie Dictionary 'ancillary' means 'accessory; auxiliary', and 'ancillary relief' means supplementary or incidental relief sought in addition to the main relief as in matrimonial causes, proceedings for maintenance, custody, settlement of property or damages for adultery"". 
       
      
    23    The Court found that the proceedings were brought because the undertaking was given in support of an application for a restraining order and was able to be enforced because the order expired and accordingly the giving of the undertaking had ""a close and direct connection with the restraining order"". Ipp J (with whom the other judges of the Court agreed) went on to say: 
     
      
       
       ""While proceedings for the enforcement of the undertaking are not supplementary or incidental to the main relief (the latter being the obtaining of the restraining order), the enforcement proceedings are incidental and subordinate to the restraining order as they are dependent on the grant of the restraining order and the expiry thereof."" 
       
      
    24    I do not consider that the ""ancillary orders"" to which s12(1) refers mean ancillary only to the restraining order. This is made clear by the language concerning both the time (“at any later time”) and the character of the order, which must be ancillary but may affect a person whose interests are subject to restraint. Rather, I consider they are ancillary to proceedings undertaken pursuant to the Act and accordingly ancillary to proceedings under s22 where an application for forfeiture is made and also to proceeding under s25. Since the continuing existence of the restraining order is a necessary precondition to the application for a forfeiture order under s22 of the Act, I consider that whether it should continue is ancillary to proceedings under s22 and, if it were necessary for me to so decide, ancillary to the order made under s10. 
    25    I must confess that during argument my mind has wavered upon the question posed by the application but I consider that as this matter had been left in a state of ambiguity or at least uncertainty by the Act, s12 should be construed as giving ancillary power to permit a hearing, where there has been an order made ex parte under s10(2) and proper grounds are shown, in respect of the continuance of the restraining order, that is to say concerning the continuance of the reasonableness of the suspicion, providing that by so doing the power is not so exercised, as it were, to allow an appeal from the order made under s10(2) and, in this case, by Newman J. 
    26    The status of ex parte orders is well-known and takes place in a context which is the subject of well-ploughed forensic fields. Indeed, in McCleary v DPP the Court noted that the similarity in purpose and terms of undertakings for damages provided for under the Commonwealth legislation (and of course in the case here) to those given in civil litigation in support of an interlocutory injunction indicated that Parliament intended that the rules and practices applying to undertakings be followed as far as is reasonably and practically possible in dealing with undertakings under the Act. To my mind such considerations apply also to the approach that should be taken to orders made ex parte for the restraint of private property. Of course such an interpretation must give way to the specific provisions of the Act but I am not persuaded in the end that the Act has the effect contended for by Mr Temby QC although there is much to be said for such an interpretation. 
    27    Accordingly, I propose to order under s12(1) that the applicant may apply to terminate the effect of the restraining orders made on 12 December 1998 upon grounds directed to the question whether as at the date of such hearing there are reasonable grounds for a suspicion that the applicant's interest is serious crime derived property for the reasons specified in section 10(3)(b) of the Act. 
    28    I do not think it appropriate to amend the orders made by Newman J since the jurisdiction which I presently apprehend I am exercising is that specifically given by section 12 of the Act, subject to which, necessarily, his Honour's orders were made. 
    29    I direct the applicant to take out an order in accordance with my reasons by Wednesday next, 8 December 1999. A copy of that order is to be provided to the respondent by the end of next week. Liberty to apply if required. I stand the matter over generally for directions. I reserve the question of costs.

     MONDAY 6 DECEMBER 1999 
      
      
      REGINA v GARRY MICHAEL McNALLY 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
     1     
     JAMES J 
     : The Court is in a position to give judgment and I will call on Sperling J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     SPERLING J 
     : The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of affray and one count of assault before Bell DCJ at the Moruya District Court on 22 October 1998. He was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and three months penal servitude and an additional term of nine months on the first of those counts, together with a fixed term of six months on the second count, to be served concurrently. 
      
      
     3     
     The crime of affray is codified in section 93 C of the 
      Crimes Act, 1900 
      as threatening unlawful violence by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety. 
      
      
     4     
     The maximum penalty for that offence is five years penal servitude. The maximum penalty for assault pursuant to the  
     Crimes Act, 1900 
      (section 61) is two years imprisonment. 
      
      
     5     
     The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
      
      
     6     
     The background to the offences is common ground to a large extent. The applicant had been employed on a property owned by Mr and Mrs Saunders. He had left personal effects and furniture on the property. The offences were committed when the applicant returned to the property to collect his possessions. He arranged for friends to accompany him. These included Aaron Rudolph McHamish and Ronald Keith Cole. 
      
      
     7     
     There was nothing particularly sinister about that in itself because there was a good deal to be removed. However, on being admitted to the property, the Saunders were harassed and terrorised. Mr McHamish produced a gun which was pointed repeatedly at the Saunders. On the account of events given by Mr Saunders, Mr McHamish appeared to have played the more active role in what then occurred. However, on any view of the facts, the applicant engaged in serious verbal abuse directed towards the Saunders and, on any view of the facts, both men threatened the Saunders with death. 
      
      
     8     
     In the course of these events, the applicant also threatened to strike Mr Saunders with a crow bar. The harassment and threatening went on for some hours. Mr and Mrs Saunders believed they were in serious physical danger. I do not doubt that they believed they could die. Mrs Saunders was crying and was plainly terrified. Both suffered continuing deleterious effects. 
      
      
     9     
     Bell DCJ also sentenced Mr Cole, on the same date as the sentencing of the applicant. On an earlier occasion, Mr McHamish was sentenced by Howie J. 
      
      
     10     
     On 22 October 1998, Mr McHamish was sentenced by Howie DCJ for certain unrelated offences, as well as for offences arising out of the subject episode. For supplying a prohibited drug, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of twelve months. For possession of a prohibited weapon, he was sentenced to a fixed term of one month to be served concurrently, and for assault he was sentenced to a fixed term of four months to be served concurrently. Mr McHamish was then sentenced by Howie DCJ for offences arising from the subject episode, which were cumulative on the minimum term of twelve months for supply a prohibited drug. The additional sentences were: for affray, a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of twenty months; for assault, a fixed term of nine months to be served concurrently; for possession of a firearm, a fixed term of six months to be served concurrently; for possession of a firearm and entering land, a fixed term of nine months to be served concurrently. Howie DCJ made clear that he had applied the principle of totality and that the sentences should not be regarded as appropriate for the respective offences if considered in isolation. 
      
      
     11     
     Mr Cole was sentenced by Bell DCJ to 300 hours community service for affray. 
      
      
     12     
     The applicant submits that the sentencing judge erred in the following respects: 
      
       
       (a) in giving too much weight to the evidence of the co-offender Mr Cole concerning responsibility for use of the gun; 
        
       (b) in attributing a greater role and criminality to the applicant than to Mr McHamish; 
        
       (c) in imposing a sentence upon the applicant heavier than that imposed upon the co-offender, Mr McHamish, contrary to the principle of parity and such as to give the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance; 
        
       (d) failing to find special circumstances in respect of the applicant's sentence. 
       
      
      
     13     
     As to the relative responsibility of the applicant and Mr McHamish, Bell DCJ found as a fact that, as the group was preparing to depart, the applicant directed Mr Cole to open the gate and to get the gun from Mr McHamish which Mr Cole did, passing the gun to the appellant who put the gun on the parcel shelf at the back of one of the vehicles. 
      
      
     14     
     In the course of his remarks on sentence, his Honour recorded a concession by the solicitor who appeared for the applicant at the sentencing hearing to the effect that the solicitor accepted on his client's behalf that the applicant was the leader of the group. I would not over emphasise that concession. It does not necessarily imply that the applicant exercised the dominant role in everything that happened at the property. 
      
      
     15     
     Bell DCJ drew certain inferences from his finding concerning the replacement of the gun in the car. The inferences were that the applicant was entitled to possession of the gun and therefore had knowledge of the gun's presence at the outset of the episode. The applicant submits that those inferences were unjustified. 
      
      
     16     
     If error in the sentencing process is established by the applicant, this Court would set aside the sentence and would resentence the applicant unless it were of the opinion that a lesser sentence is not warranted. Section 6 (3) of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 
      provides that, on an appeal against sentence, the Court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Relevantly, for the purposes of this appeal, it is only if a lesser sentence is warranted that this Court has jurisdiction to allow an appeal against the severity of sentence (see  
     Oestler 
     , NSW CCA 7 October 1992 unreported);  
     Astill 
      (2) (1994) 64 A Crim R 289;  
     Cocking 
      (1999) NSW CCA 311;  
     McDermott  
     (1999) NSW CCA 379.) 
      
      
     17     
     In the present case there is, in my opinion, no need to resolve the question of error in the sentencing process, because I am of the opinion that a lesser sentence would not be warranted if the applicant were resentenced afresh by this Court. 
      
      
     18     
     The offence of affray is a serious offence. It carries a maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. This was a serious instance of that offence, a very serious instance. The victims were terrorised over a period of some hours and were threatened with physical violence and death. The applicant was complicit in everything that occurred. He knew the gun had been produced and continued to participate in the harassment of the victims under those circumstances. 
      
      
     19     
     There was some evidence before his Honour that Mr McHamish had in fact been hired to do what he did on the occasion. On the basis of that evidence, it would be reasonably open to infer that he had been hired to do what he did by the applicant. But even without that factor, the whole of the operation on the property was for the applicant's purposes. He could have called it off if he did not like the way it was going, assuming that it developed in a way he had not intended. The fact that he did not take that course or object to Mr McHamish's conduct at any stage is affirmative evidence that the applicant was complicit in the way Mr McHamish behaved. 
      
      
     20     
     It does not seem to me in the circumstances that the applicant's criminal responsibility for what occurred can be regarded as materially less than that of Mr McHamish. 
      
      
     21     
     As to the principle of parity, the sentence imposed on Mr Cole is not of any material relevance because of his much lesser role in the episode. As to the relativity between the other two sentences, two things are to be observed: First, the criminal histories of the applicant and Mr McHamish are very different. The applicant had been convicted of the following serious offences: Drive in a manner dangerous; possess unlicensed pistol; malicious injury (for which the applicant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment with a non parole period of nine months); high range prescribed concentration of alcohol; possess unlicensed firearm (three counts of the same offence); assault; and breach of an apprehended violence order (for which the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of one month imprisonment). This criminal history demonstrates an unruly and irresponsible attitude characterised by a propensity to violence. By contrast, Mr McHamish had not been convicted of any offence involving violence and the most serious offences of which he had been convicted were high prescribed concentration of alcohol and being a disqualified driver (for which he was fined and disqualified for a period of years). He had never been sentenced to imprisonment. 
      
      
     22     
     Secondly, the sentence imposed by Howie DCJ on Mr McHamish had been reduced under the principle of totality because of the cumulative nature of the offences imposed on that occasion. As Howie DCJ pointed out, the sentence was less than would have been imposed in isolation. 
      
      
     23     
     Another distinguishing factor was that Mr McHamish had come to suffer epilepsy to such a degree that Howie DCJ took that into account as a factor requiring leniency. 
      
      
     24     
     I have had regard to subjective considerations which arise from the material which was before the sentencing judge. I have also noted the affidavit producing further material to be taken into account in the event that this Court were to resentence the applicant. I have had regard to those additional matters. 
      
      
     25     
     I would give credit for the plea of guilty, insofar as it saved the community the expense of a trial. I have also had regard to the fact that the applicant has obviously made earnest efforts to overcome a long standing problem with alcohol, that he has been a cooperative prisoner, and that he has participated in personal rehabilitation programs. He is to be commended for those efforts. There is, in my view, notwithstanding a shocking criminal history, a good prospect of rehabilitation if the applicant adheres to his present attitude. 
      
      
     26     
     I do not regard the sentence imposed on the applicant as disproportionate to the sentence imposed on Mr McHamish, having regard to the considerations which I have mentioned in that regard. 
      
      
     27     
     Counsel for the applicant has advanced a very thorough and a very carefully prepared argument. Nothing has been left unsaid that could possibly have been said in the applicant's favour. However, in my opinion, a sentence less than the sentence imposed on the applicant in the Court below for the offences for which the applicant has been convicted is not warranted. 
      
      
     28     
     I do not find special circumstances. It seems to me that the additional term under the existing sentence, which complies with the statutory formula, is adequate for supervised rehabilitation following the minimum term of imprisonment.  
      
       
      
     29     
     my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. The orders I propose are as follows: Grant leave to appeal, appeal dismissed. 
      
       
      
     30     
     JAMES J 
     : I agree with the judgment of Sperling J. To the authorities relating to section 6 of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      mentioned by his Honour, I would add  
     R v Isaacs 
     , (1997)90 A Crim R 587. In  
     R v Isaacs 
     , the Court was constituted by a bench of five Judges, including the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the Chief Judge at Common Law. In that case the Court found that the sentencing Judge had erred in the manner in which he ascertained the facts for the purpose of ascertaining an appropriate sentence. However, the Court dismissed the appeal against sentence, observing: 
      
       
        
         
         ""If we had to undertake the task of sentencing afresh and resentencing the appellant, we would impose a sentence no less than that imposed by Newman J."" 
         
        
       
      
     31     
     If it were necessary to decide whether the inference drawn by the sentencing Judge that the applicant had prior knowledge of the gun's presence prior to departing from Moruya was an inference which was capable of being drawn, then I would be of the opinion that, even if the inference was not capable of being drawn solely on the basis suggested by his Honour, then the inference was capable of being drawn when regard is had to certain parts of the evidence of Mr and Mrs Saunders which was drawn to our attention by counsel for the Crown. It is apparent from his Honour's remarks on sentence that his Honour generally accepted the evidence of Mr and Mrs Saunders. 
      
      
     32     
     As I have said, I agree with the judgment of Sperling J and with the orders proposed by his Honour. 
      
      
     33     
     The orders of the Court will be that leave to appeal is granted but that the appeal against sentence is dismissed.

    2    Briefly, the Crown case was that on 6 May 1989 the complainant, who was then aged 20, attended the Punchbowl RSL Club with a group of friends with whom she sat at a table, talking to her friends and at times drinking and dancing. Whilst dancing with a friend she noticed a man dancing in a circle around her. She did not know him. He asked her if she would like to go outside for a talk and she agreed. There was no dispute at the trial that that man was the appellant. 
    3    The two of them went outside and walked to the bottom of a staircase outside the club. The appellant put his arm round the complainant's shoulders and they walked along the side of the club. Shortly after, he lent the complainant up against a fence, and asked her would she like to be his boyfriend (sic) for the night, to which she replied, ""No, I've already got a boyfriend."" The appellant then kissed the complainant and gave her a love bite. He then led her further down the side of the club, past a bowling green to a small veranda on a church. 
    4    A short time later - and I will not go into the intervening details - he pushed her down onto the ground and took his clothes off. He tried to remove the complainant's underpants and she tried to pull them back up. Shortly after that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her. The complainant said, ""Stop, you are hurting me"" and tried to get away from him by grabbing onto a fence and pulling away from him. She felt herself being dragged along the ground. She repeated, ""Stop, you are hurting me."" She tried to yell out for help, but the appellant said, ""Shut up or I'll shoot you,"" and he put his hand over her mouth. 
    5    After sexual intercourse was completed, he said to her, ""If you tell anybody, I know where you live, I'll come after you with a gun and shoot you."" She said she would not tell anybody and walked quickly back to the club. The appellant followed behind her. When she arrived back at the club she went to the ladies toilet, her elbow was sore and there was blood on her underpants. She then told her friends what had happened. The complainant and her friends left the club and they saw the appellant and his friends outside laughing in a red car. 
    6    The complainant's friends took her home where she told her mother what had happened. The police arrived. She was taken to St George Hospital where she was medically examined and the doctor found evidence consistent with the facts as she related them, including evidence of abrasions on her left elbow and her buttocks, and a bruise consistent with a love bite on the front of her neck. 
    7    On 5 June 1989 Sergeant Wynne spoke to the appellant. He questioned him about the alleged sexual assault and the appellant replied, ""It wasn't me."" He said he did not frequent the Punchbowl RSL Club and he denied that he had danced with the complainant. When the allegation of sexual intercourse was put to him he said, ""I wasn't there."" When informed that the complainant had told her attacker she was a virgin, the appellant said, ""I've had lots of virgins. I'm not saying any more."" 
    8    Later that day, he took part in a typed record of interview. In the course of that record of interview, he specifically said he did not recall attending a disco at the Punchbowl RSL on Saturday 6 May 1989 (A.9); he did not know a person with the complainant's name (A.10); he had attended the RSL on the ""3rd of the 2nd, he did not remember, somewhere around that time and a few times from years ago when he used to live around the area"" (A.12); he did not know anything about a suggestion that he had been at the club at about 12.15 am on Sunday, 7 May, and that he had left in the company of the complainant (A.13); and he did not know anything about going to the area where intercourse had taken place and having non-consensual intercourse with the complainant, (A.14). The sergeant was not cross-examined.  
    9    Later on and prior to his trial, evidence became available to the Crown which was led at the trial that a check of the Punchbowl RSL's register of visitors indicated that the appellant had attended the club on 6 May 1989 and DNA testing of fluids recovered from vaginal swabs of the complainant could have originated from the appellant. 
    10    At his trial, the appellant admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, but stated that such intercourse was consensual. He said that after dancing with the complainant, the complainant kept looking and smiling at him. She then came over and asked for another dance, which he accepted. It was hot dancing and they decided to go outside for a walk, and whilst outside they hugged each other, and then took each others clothes off and had consensual sex.  
    11    Although Sergeant Wynne had not been cross-examined, the appellant claimed that when spoken to by the police he said, ""No, it wasn't rape"" and ""I didn't do it"". In cross-examination, he stated that he told lies to the police because he was a Muslim and did not want his mother to know that he had had sexual intercourse with the girl before marriage. 
    12    The only ground of appeal relied on was in relation to the directions by the trial judge in his summing-up on the use which the jury might make concerning lies told out of court. In relation to this issue his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""As to telling the police all the lies, he said he was worried about his family. He was thinking about his mother. He said his mother had come with him to the police station and he just did not want to admit that he had actually had intercourse with a woman before he was married.  
       
      
      
       
       Members of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor made reference to the fact of the accused telling lies to the police and argued to you that that is a factor you can take into account, first of all, as to his general credibility when he gives evidence; and secondly, as showing that the reason he lied to the police was because he knew he was guilty of the offence. If a person does tell lies in circumstances such as that, it is open to the jury to draw that conclusion that the reason they told lies in those circumstances was because they wanted to avoid being implicated in the offence. But before you jump to that conclusion of course, you bear in mind this, that the accused was 18 years of age, he may well have been in some sort of state of panic, or concern. We all know that people tell lies for all sorts of reasons. So you would have to consider that carefully before you jump to the conclusion that the reason he told lies was because he knew he was guilty of having sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    13    Later, in summarising defence counsel's submissions to the jury, his Honour said:  
     
      
       
       ""As to this matter of his having told lies to the police, you would bear in mind he was 18 years old, he was fearful his mother would find out he had had sex, which was something he would be concerned that she did not know, and he did frankly concede here that he had told the lies and you will find there is nothing much in that aspect of the proceedings."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    14    At the conclusion of the summing-up, the Crown Prosecutor (not defence counsel) sought a further direction that telling lies on its own was insufficient to prove the charge against the accused, and his Honour further directed the jury as follows:  
     
      
       
       ""There is just one matter counsel want me to bring to your attention. When I was giving you that direction concerning the fact that the accused admitted he told lies to the police and I said to you that you can take that into account if you are convinced that the reason he told lies was because he believed he was guilty of the offence. But I do not mean by that that if you are satisfied he told lies then that proves the charge. It is just a matter you can take into account. If you are satisfied he told lies to the police, as he admitted he has, if you are satisfied he told lies because he knew he had done the wrong thing, well then that is a matter you take into account in accordance with the rest of the evidence, but of itself it does not prove the charge. You simply use that as one factor in the case."" 
       
      
      
     Defence counsel was apparently satisfied with the directions as he sought no further directions.  
      
    15    The appellant's submission was that the jury were never directed in terms that they could use the lies as evidence supporting guilt only if they concluded they were told because of a consciousness of guilt, and in oral submissions this morning, it was further submitted that the summing-up was defective unless they were told that if they accepted that a possible explanation for the lies being told was the explanation put forward by the appellant, they could not use the lies as evidence of a consciousness of guilt. 
    16    Before a lie can be relied on as evidence in a consciousness of guilt, the jury must be satisfied: 
     
      
      (1) that it was a deliberate lie; 
       
      (2) that it related to a material issue; and  
       
      (3) that the motive for the lie was a consciousness of guilt and a desire to conceal the truth, that is, that there may not be some other reason for the telling of the lie. 
      
      
    17    In cases where the lie is relied on, not only as circumstantial evidence supporting other evidence of guilt, but as evidence corroborating the complainant, it is also necessary that the statement be proved to be a lie by evidence independent of the complainant. Juries must also be told that whilst the telling of lies may be evidence of a consciousness of guilt, such lies standing alone cannot, of themselves, establish that the accused is guilty of the offence charged. See generally Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193; R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234; R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 560; R v ST (1997) 92 A Crim R 390. 
    18    In the present case, all these matters were, in my view, made clear to the jury. The appellant denied being present at the RSL Club, dancing with the complainant and having sexual intercourse with her, but when confronted with irrefutable evidence of those things he admitted them, but said it was with her consent. There was no issue that he had told lies. The lies were deliberately told and they clearly related to a material matter. He gave an explanation, namely that he did not want his mother to find out he had had sexual intercourse outside marriage. 
    19    In the passages quoted above from the summing-up, his Honour told the jury in clear terms that there may be other reasons for telling lies, and that they had to consider that carefully before concluding that the reason for telling lies was because he knew he was guilty of the offence. In my view, his Honour's directions on this issue were correct and sufficient, and the appeal is without merit. This point was not taken at the trial and accordingly rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules requires leave to argue it at this stage. As it is without merit, I would refuse leave and propose that the appeal be dismissed, the conviction and sentenced confirmed.  
    20    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
    21    HIDDEN J: I agree.

    The trial judge excluded scientific evidence relating to the identification of the complainant’s blood on the accused’s clothing. Without this evidence, it was not possible for the Crown to make its case.Held:1 An order which, in substance, prevents the Crown putting a case to the jury is an “interlocutory judgment or order” within the meaning of s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. R v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 ACrimR 296 applied. Jago v The District Court of New South Wales(1989) 168 CLR 23, R v Steffan [1993] 67 ACrimR 506, R v Baily & anor (1988) 36 ACrimR 30 considered.2 His Honour applied the wrong test in exercising the discretion under s137 of the Evidence Act. That section requires a real risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant by reason of the admission of the evidence complained of. The requirements of the section are not satisfied if there is a mere possibility of prejudice.The fact that scientific evidence is complex does not mean that to leave such evidence to a jury would result in unfair prejudice within the meaning of s137 of the Evidence Act. The conflict of scientific evidence was not such as to justify a conclusion that a jury could not decide whether or not the Crown had demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that its evidence should be preferred.

     THE COURT: 
       
      
      
     Introduction 
      
    1   Before the Court is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). So far as is at present relevant, s.5F provides as follows: 
     
      
       
       “(1) This section applies to: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) proceedings …………………… for the prosecution of offenders on indictment …………………… in the District Court, ……………. 
         
        
        
       (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.  
       
      
      
       
       (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, …………………… 
          
         …………………… 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal may  
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) affirm or vacate the judgment or order appealed against, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) give or make an interlocutory judgment or order instead of the judgment or order appealed against. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (6) If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related.” 
       
      
    2   The matter now before this Court originated with the filing on 11 August 1999 of a document described as a “Notice of Appeal”. The body of the document describes the “Judgment or Order Appealed Against” as being a judgment or order made by his Honour Judge Goldring in the District Court on 9 August 1999, being a judgment or order: “That all scientific, expert or other evidence relating to the identification of the complainant’s blood on the Accused’s clothing not be admitted in purported exercise of a discretion under s.137 of the Evidence Act”. Relief is sought, thereupon, in the form of an order vacating such judgment or order made by Judge Goldring; and the making of such further or other orders as this Court might think appropriate. 
     
      
     The Relevant Facts 
      
    3   The Crown has presented in the District Court, and before Judge Goldring, three accused persons for trial by jury upon an indictment charging them with having maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a named victim with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon that victim. (That victim is the person described as the “complainant” in the Notice of Appeal earlier described.) Such an offence contravenes s.33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and attracts upon conviction a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for 25 years. It is not necessary to say more about the particular attack than that it was, by any reckoning, a savage and cowardly attack by three assailants upon an individual victim. It needs no extended emphasis that such an attack is a crime of great objective culpability; and is a most serious affront both to public order and to the rights of the individual victim. Nor does it require extended emphasis that there is the clearest and most compelling public interest to ensure that those who commit such assaults are detected, apprehended, and brought resolutely to public justice. 
    4   The Crown case against each of the three accused persons involves, obviously, the presentation by the Crown of evidence sufficient, if accepted by a jury acting reasonably and properly instructed, to identify, beyond reasonable doubt, each of the three accused persons as an assailant. In the case of the present respondent’s two co-accused, there is clear identification evidence fit to go to the jury, being direct evidence from the victim himself. In the case of the respondent himself, the victim is unable to give that direct and personal identification. The Crown has, accordingly, cast about for any other identification evidence of a kind that might properly be placed before the jury in support of the Crown case against the respondent. With one exception, the evidence that the Crown has been able to piece together on the issue of the identification of the respondent, does no more, so far as we can judge the fact from the material available to the Court, than point up the futility of the relevant police investigations. Subject to the one exception to which we have referred, we are of the view, as at present advised, that the evidence available to the Crown so clearly fails to identify the respondent as one of the victim’s assailants as to entail that, absent any other evidence of real probative value, the Crown case could not properly be left to the jury. This Court was informed by affidavit filed on 17 September 1999 that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that should the DNA evidence remain excluded, “there are to be no further proceedings against the accused”. 
    5   The one exception of which we have spoken concerns evidence of blood said to have been detected upon clothing admittedly worn by the respondent on the day on which the assault in question took place. The particulars, as now relevant, of that evidence are summarised as follows in the written Crown submissions: 
     
      
       
       “4.5 The respondent gave to police the track suit pants and boots he said he was wearing on the day of the assault. These were written up as an exhibit and visually examined by detectives (who did not see any blood) but they were then forwarded to the Crime Scene Examination Unit for closer examination. There Detective Senior Sergeant Horne identified spots of blood on the track suit pants and some blood on one of the respondent’s boots. These were sent to the government laboratory where DNA testing established that the blood on the track suit pants and the boots had the same genetic profile as …….. (the victim’s) ……… blood, which occurs in the general population in the ratio of 1:340,000. This analysis was done by Mr. Goetz, head of the biology laboratory in the Division of Analytical Laboratories. 
       
      
      
       
       4.6 The defence sought a voir dire from his Honour as to the admissibility of the evidence relating to the blood. The Crown called Mr. Goetz and a number of police officers to establish the integrity of the blood sample taken from ………..(the victim). This blood was collected by police from the hospital and was stored in a refrigerator in the same exhibit room at the Crime Scene Unit as the track suit pants and boots were stored. Detective Senior Sergeant Horne gave evidence as to the security at the Crime Scene Unit.  
       
      
      
       
       4.7 The respondent’s counsel seeks to assert that the blood on the track suit pants is “post transfusion blood”, ( (the victim ) had transfusions at the hospital) and therefore implying that the blood was “planted” on the track suit pants by police. They called evidence from Dr. McDonald who was of the opinion that DNA testing that he did indicated foreign DNA material in the blood on the track suit pants consistently with the post transfusion blood taken from ………..(the victim). However he conceded as a possibility that what he considered were alleles may not have been, but could have been “artifacts”. He considered his testing process was more sensitive than that carried out by Mr. Goetz. 
       
      
      
       
       4.8 The Crown relied on Mr. Goetz, who did a different array of tests, and found no foreign DNA in the blood on the track suit pants. He conceded as a possibility that there could be, but considered this unlikely because he would have expected it to show up in at least one of the 16 tests he performed and it did not. There was therefore a dispute between the experts, which it is submitted ought to have been left for determination by the jury. 
       
      
      
       
       4.9 The Crown also relied on the police evidence as to the integrity of the blood and track suit pants/boots exhibits and the denial by police that any tampering occurred. The Crown further relied on the evidence of Snr. Constable Clarke that the blood stained pattern on the track suit pants was consistent with having been caused by blood spatter caused by medium impact with a blunt implement. He also agreed that such a pattern might be caused by a wide-bored syringe.” 
       
      
    6   Counsel for the respondent at trial submitted that the foregoing DNA evidence should be excluded by the trial Judge in the exercise of either or both of the discretions in that behalf that are conferred by ss.135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). His Honour granted an application for a voir dire hearing directed to the question whether either or both of those statutory discretions should be exercised in the manner sought by the present respondent.  
    7   Section 135 of the Evidence Act provides, so far as is now relevant, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
         
        
       
      
    8   Section 137 of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
       “In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
       
      
    9   On 9 August last the learned trial Judge published detailed reasons explaining his Honour’s decision to exclude, pursuant to s.137, the whole of the Crown’s DNA evidence. 
     
      
     The Reasons of Goldring DCJ 
      
      
    10   His Honour canvasses the evidence that he had heard on the voir dire. It is not necessary to repeat the detail of this part of his Honour’s published reasons.  
    11   His Honour then says this: 
     
      
       
       “I take the starting point that disputes about facts are ordinarily for the jury to decide, and if those facts depend on expert evidence, it is still the case that the jury should decide that, and there might have to be specific directions which make it clear what the dispute about the expert evidence is.” 
       
      
    12   His Honour bolsters what he has said, by reference to particular authorities. Of one of those authorities his Honour observes: 
     
      
       
       “Their Honours decided in that case there was a conflict of expert opinion, and it was for the jury to decide. I endorse this. Jurors are endowed with common sense, and if properly directed can decide most complex issues.” 
       
      
    13   After some further comments which are of no particular present relevance, his Honour proceeds as follows: 
     
      
       
       “It was argued by the prosecution that two questions should be left to the jury: namely, first, the conflict of evidence between Mr. Goetz who found no difference between the DNA profiles taken from the various samples and Dr. McDonald who did; and secondly, the question of whether the police evidence permitted an inference that the blood had been placed on the trackpants before the trackpants were taken from ………. (the respondent)……….. and placed in police custody. 
       
      
      
       
       In ordinary circumstances, subject to some comments that I will make, both these questions are questions of the type that individually should be left to the jury. I would do so in this case if they were the only questions and they were not closely connected.” 
       
      
    14   His Honour then makes extensive reference to comments made by various members of the High Court of Australia in Chamberlain & anor. v The Queen (1984) 153 CLR 521. His Honour quotes extensively from the dissenting judgment of Jenkinson J, to which Gibbs CJ and Mason J had referred with approval, in that same case when it was before the Federal Court of Australia. His Honour then continues: 
     
      
       
       “That passage does not mean that juries are incapable of deciding conflicting expert opinion even in the difficult circumstances of  
       Chamberlain’s 
        case. What that passage relates to is the question of whether a jury is entitled to form a reasonable doubt on the basis of expert evidence, given the relative lack of expert knowledge that jurors can be assumed to have. It is that relative lack of knowledge that is particularly significant when considering the danger of unfair prejudice to a defendant because in relative ignorance a jury may place constructions on evidence which it does not deserve or which ought not to be placed there.” 
       
      
    15   His Honour then proceeds to a citation of the decision of Hampel J in Reg. v Lucas [1992] 2 VLR 109. His Honour picks up from that judgment extensive references made in it to an earlier decision of Maurice J in the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory in the matter of Reg. v Lewis  [1987] 29 A Crim R 276. These extensive citations culminate in the following passage taken by his Honour from the judgment of Hampel J: 
     
      
       
       “DNA testing is widely regarded as extremely reliable and discriminating. Its limitations and particularly limits as to the conclusion which can be drawn from the tests are not generally appreciated. The jury has no basis on which it can evaluate the evidence. There is no way the jury can properly weigh the value of such evidence if there is no evidence before it as to the frequency of a match in the general population.” 
       
      
    16   There follow, in the reasons published by Goldring DCJ, the following passages which crystallise his Honour’s process of reasoning and the conclusions to which that process has led his Honour: 
     
      
       
       “Now, here of course, that is not an issue because it does not apply. But when I apply the principles behind that reasoning to this case, I find that there are two questions, namely, that of the effect of the DNA profile evidence and that of the evidence relating to the custody of the clothing and the blood and if they are to have probative value cannot be separated. Taken together, if accepted, they would assist in proving the presence of the accused ………….. at the crime scene. That is clearly probative value. 
       
      
      
       
       While I have said taken separately the issue relating to the expert evidence and that relating to the security of the exhibits might be left to a jury, in my view there is a real danger that because of the combination of the circumstances, namely, the complex nature of the scientific evidence, the complex relationship of that evidence to the evidence relating to how the blood might have come to be on the tracksuit pants and the blood spatter evidence, a jury, even if properly directed, could fail to appreciate either the complexity of the inter-relationship of the various pieces of forensic evidence or the limits that might be placed on the forensic evidence. There is a real danger that the fact finders might be unduly swayed by the “scientific” nature of the evidence to make a decision on an improper basis, particularly to require a lower degree of probability than they would otherwise require.  
       
      
      
       
       I therefore rule that under s.137 of the Evidence Act the evidence must not be admitted.” 
       
      
    17   What is thus said gives rise to the following questions for this Court: 
     
      
     1. Has Goldring DCJ made an  
     “interlocutory judgment or order” 
      so as to enliven the jurisdiction of this Court at the particular instance of the Crown and pursuant to s.5F of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     ? 
      
      
     2. If so, should this Court affirm the decision of Goldring DCJ; vacate it; or make some other, and if so what, orders? 
      
     Question 1 
      
    18   There have been in the past various attempts made by various Benches of this Court, and in the Court of Appeal, to give some practical definition to the concept, as relevant to s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, of “an interlocutory judgment or order”. Some of those expressions of opinion can be regarded properly as obiter dicta; and others of them are properly to be regarded as rationes decidendi. A helpful starting point for a consideration of the relevant authorities is the decision of this Court in Reg. v Steffan [1993] 67 A Crim R 506. The judgment of the Court is that of summarises clearly and helpfully the earlier decisions in Reg v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; Reg. v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; Reg. v. Anderson (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 12 October 1989); Reg v Rogerson (1990) 45 A Crim R 253; Reg v Groves (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 2 April 1990); Reg v Waterhouse (1992) 62 A Crim R 59; Reg v Baker (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 5 April 1993); and, in the Court of Appeal, Chow v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 593. 
    19   The judgment refers, also, to an earlier decision of this Court: Reg v Baily & anor. (1988) 36 A Crim R 30. The decision in that particular case turned upon the view of this Court that proceedings which purported to have been brought regularly pursuant to Part 53 r.10 of the District Court Rules, had in fact been brought irregularly and not in compliance with that Rule. In that regard, Gleeson CJ, speaking for the Court, made these observations: 
     
      
       
       “I, for my part, am of the view that even if the proceedings had occurred pursuant to r.11 with complete regularity, there would be a large question as to whether the rulings on evidence made by the learned judge constituted an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s.5F of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
       . Further, even if they did, there would be a serious question to be addressed as to the principles which this Court ought to follow in considering whether to grant leave to appeal against any such interlocutory order or judgment. However, those important questions do not appear to me to arise in the present case because of the fundamental irregularity of the proceedings before the learned trial Judge; ……………..”  
       (36 A Crim R, 32) 
       
      
    20   The Court, having picked up the foregoing reference to a potential “large question”, says: 
     
      
       
       “That question was raised squarely in this present case for determination. We can see no distinction between a ruling on evidence made in advance of the trial and one made in the course of the trial. It still cannot be entered in the records of the court as a judgment; nor does it command that anything be done (or not done) in the sense of an order of the court. It remains as no more than a ruling, one which can be tested on appeal to this Court after a conviction. ……………..(R)ulings on evidence may always be altered - although the necessary consequence of such an alteration may sometimes be the discharge of the jury. They may be altered because the circumstances in which the ruling was first made have altered, or simply because the judge has had a change of mind.” 
        (67 A Crim R, 511) 
       
      
    21   After some further comments which are not now particularly relevant, the judgment continues: 
     
      
       
       “Accordingly, in our opinion, a ruling on evidence made in advance of or in the course of the trial, in either the Supreme Court or the District Court, is not an interlocutory judgment or order within the meaning of s.5F of the  
       Criminal Appeal Act 
       . Even if we were wrong in that conclusion, the fact that the ruling can always be altered means that the circumstances would have to be unusual for leave to appeal to be granted prior to conviction. No such circumstances exist in this case. It was those reasons which led us to decide that leave to appeal against the ruling on evidence should be refused.” 
        (67 A Crim R, 512) 
       
      
    22   There are, in our opinion, two points, each of some significance in the present particular case, to be made about the foregoing authorities.  
    23   The first point is that each of those decisions concerned an application by an accused person and not by the Crown. In the case of such an application by an accused person, it is always possible to take logically the view that, if the challenged ruling is allowed to stand and a conviction is the ultimate outcome of the trial, then the accused person is entitled as of right to bring on appeal to this Court any challenge made, by reason of asserted error of law, to the conviction. It is worth remembering that the bases upon which, in the case of such an appeal, this Court is required to allow the appeal, are cast by s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act in very wide terms. This Court must set aside the conviction if it is of the opinion “that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, ………”. 
    24   The Crown has, of course, no comparable right, (indeed, no right at all), to challenge on appeal to this Court an acquittal. 
    25   The second point concerns the consideration, to which the Court makes specific reference, that “rulings on evidence may always be altered”. That consideration has an obvious significance in the context of an unsuccessful attempt by an accused person to have evidence either admitted or rejected, the practical consequence of that lack of success being that the trial continues so that there is, in a real sense, continuing opportunity for a proper re-visiting of the particular ruling.  
    26   That particular consideration does not seem to us to run logically in the very different context of a ruling, the practical effect of which is to exclude the whole substance of a particular Crown case.  
    27   There is, as it happens, one reported decision of this Court concerning a Crown application brought purportedly in pursuance of s.5F of the Criminal Appeal Act: Reg. v Bozatsis and Spanakakis (1997) 97 ACrimR 296.  
    28   In that matter, this Court was asked to entertain a Crown application in connection with a trial, during the course of which the presiding Judge had ruled inadmissible, as having resulted from illegal or improper conduct of police officers, the whole of the proposed evidence in the Crown case. The presiding Judge had buttressed that ruling by making an order granting a permanent stay of proceedings. The order staying proceedings was plainly “an interlocutory judgment or order” of the kind contemplated by s.5F. It was, therefore, not strictly necessary, in order to establish the relevant jurisdiction of this Court, to consider whether the evidentiary ruling, apart from the order for a permanent stay, was susceptible to appellate review pursuant to s.5F. 
    29   Nevertheless, Gleeson CJ, speaking for the Court, dealt with that question in a section of his Honour’s judgment, headed: “The jurisdictional issue”. So far as is now relevant, the following points seem to us to emerge from the Court’s approach as explained in the judgment of Gleeson CJ: 
    30   First, although the initial legislative impulse behind section 5F concerned a perceived need to deal with interlocutory applications for stays of proceedings in criminal cases, there is no warrant for reading down section 5F as in fact enacted, so as to confine its operation to appeals against decisions concerning such applications. 
    31   Secondly, there is no simple and absolute test for discriminating between judgments or orders, on the one hand, and rulings which do not constitute judgments or orders, on the other. In particular, it is not simply and absolutely the case that a judgment or order is always to be characterised as: “a judicial act which decides the question or one of the questions which is raised for decision in the particular proceedings”. Gleeson CJ observes in the latter regard that: “……..(R)ulings also decide questions. It is the character of the question, and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference”. 
    32   Thirdly, and referring to a statement made by the primary Judge that he was making an order excluding “all prosecution evidence”, Gleeson CJ says: 
     
      
       
       “What is important is not his Honour’s use of the word ‘order’, but the character and effect of the decision he was making. He was not merely deciding that some particular piece of evidence was admissible or inadmissible. He was making a discretionary decision not to receive any evidence tending to prove the guilt of the respondents of the offences charged. He was, in substance, refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the appellants. Such a decision is properly characterised as a judgment or order.”  
       (97 A Crim R, 304) 
       
      
    33   At the hearing before this Court learned counsel for the respondent sought to distinguish Bozatsis and Spanakakis on the following grounds: 
     
      
     1. That the present case involves the rejection of a discrete area of evidence, and not the rejection of the entire Crown case; 
      
      
     2 That in the present matter there has been no order for a stay of proceedings; 
      
      
     3. That sections 135 and 137 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , being the sections of that Act upon which Goldring DCJ expressly relies, do not involve a balancing of competing public interests such as is required by s.138 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , which latter section, it was submitted, was critical to the reasoning that underpins the decision in  
     Bozatsis and Spanakakis 
     ; and 
      
      
     4. That Goldring DCJ, unlike the trial Judge in  
     Bozatsis and Spanakakis 
     , has given detailed and comprehensive reasons for his Honour’s decision to exclude the relevant Crown evidence. 
      
    34   As to submission 1, we are of the opinion that this submission is wrong in fact.  
    35   During the course of argument before this Court, there was a deal of to-ing and fro-ing as to the correctness in fact of the proposition, fundamental to the case put to this Court by the Crown, that the practical effect of the ruling of Goldring DCJ is to prevent the Crown case from going to the jury. 
    36   In answer to a question: “Is it your case that the present application of the Crown cannot succeed because the foundation on which it is built is demonstrably wrong in that the ruling now challenged does not have the final effect for which the Crown contends?”, learned counsel for the respondent replied that he: “………didn’t understand the Crown to be putting that proposition in those terms as being fundamental”. Pressed that the Crown submission had been precisely to the effect suggested in the earlier question, counsel submitted that the challenged ruling “…….. does not in fact destroy the Crown case, there remains other evidence available to the Crown”. Asked whether the written submissions that he had previously put in on behalf of the respondent pointed out the nature and scope of the additional evidence, counsel responded as follows: 
     
      
       
       “………… I don’t believe it is. As I say, I understood the Crown’s submission as conceding that a prosecution would inevitably fail and that that is a different thing to saying as a result of this ruling there is no evidence. I understood the Crown’s submission that the jurisdiction of this court was based upon the practical effect of denying the Crown any possibility of obtaining a conviction. My own opinion is I agree with the Crown, the evidence which remains available to the Crown I don’t think would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. However, there remains other evidence available.” 
       
      
    37   These passages are supplemented usefully by a reference to an exchange between learned counsel for the respondent and Goldring DCJ in the immediate aftermath of the publishing by his Honour of the reasons for his Honour’s decision to exclude the relevant Crown evidence. Learned counsel for the respondent, and the Crown Prosecutor, had various things to put to his Honour concerning the practical effects of his Honour’s exclusion of the Crown evidence. His Honour himself remarked: 
     
      
       
       “………….. (I)f what …………(counsel) ……….. says about  
       Bozatsis 
        is right, if there ……….(the trial judge in that case) ……… excluded all the Crown case on the ground it was improperly obtained, that may be a ground for distinction.  
       It may be substantially what I’d done 
        but that was not my understanding on the basis of it.”  
       (see transcript for 10.8.99 at 12(10) - emphasis added) 
       
      
    38   It seems to us that a fair view overall of the material to which we have referred justifies the drawing of a rational inference that the substance of what Goldring DCJ has done is to destroy, in every real and practical sense, any prospect of the Crown's presenting to the jury the substance of a case available to it and tending, if accepted, to the proof beyond reasonable doubt of the respondent’s guilt as charged.  
     
      
     In  
     Bozatsis and Spanakakis 
      the form of the order there made was the rejection of the entire Crown case. However, as stated by Gleeson CJ in the passage extracted above, the trial Judge  
     “was,  
     in substance 
     , 
      refusing to permit the Crown to seek to make a case against the appellant”  
     [emphasis added]. As the Chief Justice emphasised, the issue is one of substance rather than form. The substance of the order made by his Honour in the circumstances of the present case was the rejection of the entire Crown case. 
      
    39   As to submission 2: we reject this submission. The short answer to it is to be found, in our opinion, in the passage already quoted at paragraph 32 from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Bozatsis and Spanakakis at 97 A Crim R, 304. 
    40   As to submission 3: it is, in our opinion, plain on the face of sections 135, 137 and 138 that each of those sections propounds a discrete judicial discretion. And it is correct, in our opinion, to say that the discretions are not only discrete, but involve different balances of different nominated factors. It remains the case, however, that each of section 135 and 137 speaks in precise terms of weighing probative value, on the one hand, and other stipulated dangers, on the other hand. In our opinion, the decision in  Bozatsis and Spanakakis, insofar as it deals with the approach of the trial Judge in that particular case to the requirements of section 138 of the Evidence Act, is not dealing with the jurisdictional issue which we are now discussing. It deals, rather, with the proposition that, granted jurisdiction in the first place to inquire into the sustainability of the trial Judge’s decision, there was no assistance forthcoming from the expressed reasons for judgment, which failed entirely to expose any coherent process of reasoning on the issues arising for decision upon the proper application to the particular facts of the particular requirements of section 138. 
    41   As to submission 4: we reject this submission for the reason that it is the right answer to the wrong question. The right question is not whether Goldring DCJ exposed, in coherent form, his Honour’s process of reasoning. The right question is, rather, whether that process of reasoning, and the decision to which it gave rise, had such an effect upon the Crown case at trial as would enliven the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
    42   For the whole of the foregoing reasons, we have come to the conclusion that, on the particular facts of the present case, the Crown has established jurisdiction in this Court to review, in accordance with section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, the ruling made by Goldring DCJ on 9 August last. 
    43   In the light of that conclusion, it is, in our opinion, important to add some additional observations. 
    44   It is trite that this Court will not interfere, save in the most exceptional circumstances, with the orderly course of proceedings at trial in criminal cases, whether the court of trial is the Supreme Court or some other court. It is, on the one hand, manifestly in the interest of an accused person that his or her trial should proceed according to law and in an orderly, disciplined and efficient fashion, uninterrupted by what are no more than opportunistic appeals to the jurisdiction, real or imagined, of this Court. It is, on the other hand, of no less importance to the Crown, as representative of the public interest to see that justice is done in criminal cases, to have prosecutions conducted in the same orderly, disciplined, efficient and uninterrupted way. Nothing in what we have said, - (and, for that matter, nothing in what we will hereafter be saying), - should be understood as giving any countenance to attempts, whether by the Crown or by those representing accused persons, to obscure those fundamental principles by mere forensic artifice. 
    45   The following observations of Brennan J in the course of considering the circumstances in which a court should order a stay of proceedings are also applicable to identification of circumstances in which a court by its rulings effectively deprives the Crown of the ability to put a case against a particular accused. His Honour said in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 49-50: 
     
      
       
       “Moreover, although our system of litigation adopts the adversary method in both the criminal and civil jurisdictions, interests other than those of the litigants are involved in litigation, especially criminal litigation. The community has an immediate interest in the administration of criminal justice to guarantee peace and order in society. The victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances. If a power to grant a permanent stay were to be exercised whenever a judge came to the conclusion that prejudice might or would be suffered by an accused because of delay in the prosecution, delay in law enforcement would defeat the enforcement of the law absolutely and prejudice resulting from delay would become a not unwelcome passport to immunity from prosecution. Refusal by a court to try a criminal case does not undo the anxiety and disability which the pendancy of a criminal charge produces, but it leaves the accused with an irremovable cloud of suspicion over his head. And it is likely to engender a festering sense of injustice on the part of the community and the victim. The reason for granting stay orders, which are as good as certificates of immunity, would be difficult of explanation for they would be largely discretionary. If permanent stay orders were to become common place, it would not be long before all courts would forfeit public confidence. Granting of orders for permanent stays would inspire cynicism, if not suspicion, in the public mind.” 
       
      
    46   Had it been clear, in the present case, that the Crown case had been weakened, but not at all effectively destroyed, by Goldring DCJ’s relevant decision, we would have followed unhesitatingly the approach of Hunt CJ at CL in Steffan. 
    47   We are persuaded, however, that what Goldring DCJ has done in the present particular case goes beyond, and well beyond, the giving of a mere ruling on evidence, the effect of the ruling being to inconvenience, or even to weaken, the Crown case, but in an overall context that is sufficiently fluid to permit of a subsequent review , and if appropriate reversal, of the ruling. 
     
      
     Question 2 
      
    48   In dealing with this question, it is, of course, important to bear in mind that what the Court is now being asked to do is to review, and to reverse, a discretionary decision of Goldring DCJ. This is not something to be done lightly. The relevant principles are not in doubt, and they can be re-stated sufficiently for present purposes in the form of the following extracts from the judgment of this Court in Reg. v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290: 
     
      
       
       “An appeal based upon the judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment is thus one against the exercise of a discretion, and it will be allowed only where it has been established that the judge has erred in the proper exercise of that discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion. An appellate court may not, however, substitute its own findings of fact for those of the primary judge unless there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence is all one way or the judge has misdirected himself in relation to those facts. If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge’s exercise of discretion, it is under a duty to review the order made.” 
       
      
    49   The essence of Goldring DCJ’s reasoning has been set out earlier at paragraph 16. In applying to that essential reasoning the principles enunciated in Alexanandroaia, it is, in our opinion, necessary to be clear about certain fundamental propositions which we would express as follows: 
     
      
     1. The status in our system of criminal justice of a jury at trial is of absolutely fundamental constitutional legitimacy and importance. The empanelling of a lay jury, chosen at random from the general body of citizens, to be the sole tribunal of fact is not some irksome survival from a feudal past, whether real or imagined. The contribution of lay juries to our system of criminal justice is the lynch-pin of that system. The importance of the jury in our criminal justice system is such as to justify attributing to the jury a constitutional significance even where there is no express constitutional protection such as that provided by s.80 of the Commonwealth Constitution. Statutes will not be interpreted, therefore, as impinging on the right to trial by jury unless there is clear and unambiguous language to that effect. 
      
      
     2. It would be to close one’s eyes to what is going on in contemporary society not to recognise that there is a body of articulate opinion which holds that a lay jury drawn at random in accordance with current principle and practice is, more or less as of course, unable to be entrusted safely with the decision of questions of fact which are said to be complex, or of a highly technical nature. There is, more often than not, more than just a touch of elitism and of intellectual condescension in the point of view. But the real flaw in the point of view is that it fails wholly to take account of the everyday practical experience of the courts in their dealings with juries empanelled in criminal trials. 
      
      
     3. That experience would, in our own observation and understanding of these matters, have to acknowledge, and to make allowance for, the case of the jury that fails, as a collegiate body, to do its sworn public duty. The same would have to be said about individual jurors in particular cases. But it seems to us that the fair position is that such departures from proper jury standards are very much the exception rather than the rule. It is, in our opinion, demonstrably true as a general proposition that the average jury, if properly assisted and directed, will do diligently and conscientiously what the law asks of it. 
      
      
     4. That any jury in any criminal trial requires proper direction as to the relevant law, and proper practical assistance otherwise, entails a significant burden upon all the professionals who are engaged in the conduct of the particular trial. The brunt of that responsibility will be borne by the presiding judge whose duty it is to see that the jury receives proper direction and assistance, and receives it with a proper patience and courtesy. There is a different, but no less compelling, professional duty resting upon those who prosecute and defend in the particular case.  
      
      
     5. It is one thing to say that, in such a case as is exemplified by the present particular case, it will be, obviously, difficult to put into simple lay language the concepts which the jury must have firmly in its grasp; and to assist the jury with a similar clarity and simplicity to apply those concepts to the evidence adduced in the trial, both by the prosecution and by the defence. It is, however, an entirely different thing to take it as, more or less, self-evident that the jury, even if given that assistance, will be either unwilling or unable, or both, to carry out in a proper way the jury’s critical fact-finding function. 
      
    50   The way in which practical expression is to be given in a particular case to the foregoing general propositions is exemplified by the decision of Mullighan J, of the Supreme Court of South Australia, in Reg v Jarrett (1994) 73 A Crim R 160. Mullighan J’s analysis of relevant principle and practice is, in our respectful opinion, clear and correct. It is not necessary for present purposes to quote in particular more than the following brief excerpt: 
     
      
       
       “…………………. (T)here can be no reason to exclude admissible evidence except in the exercise of discretion. The resolution of conflicts in expert testimony and the assessment of the weight to be attached to it is the function of the jury. If there is no reason to exclude evidence in the exercise of discretion, it should be admitted and appropriate directions given to the jury as to how any conflicts in the evidence should be approached and what use can be made of the evidence which is accepted.”  
       (73 A Crim R, 173) 
       
      
    51   In the present particular case, Goldring DCJ recognised, correctly in our respectful view, that the challenged DNA evidence had clear probative value. Indeed it did. If accepted by the constitutional tribunal of fact, it was capable of leading to a conclusion, reached beyond reasonable doubt, that the present respondent had been present at, and, to whatever particular extent, involved in, a vicious physical assault by three assailants against one victim.  
    52   Against that probative value, Goldring DCJ was required, insofar as s. 137 of the Evidence Act was concerned, to consider whether the clear case in favour of admitting the evidence was, so far as is at present material, “outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to ………..(the respondent)”. In connection with the proper exercise of that statutory discretion, his Honour was required to bear in mind, among other things, a proposition that cannot be put more clearly and succinctly than is done in the relevant portion of the Australian Law Reform Commission Report which is quoted in Odgers: Uniform Evidence Law: 3rd Edition at 447: 
     
      
       
       “There is some uncertainty over the meaning of ‘prejudice’. But, clearly, it does not mean simply damage to the accused’s case. It means damage to the accused’s case in some unacceptable way, by provoking some irrational, emotional response, or giving evidence more weight than it should have.” 
       
      
    53   If it be asked, next, quite how his Honour saw the admission of the challenged evidence as giving rise to prejudice in the senses described by the Australian Law Reform Commission, then, with all due respect to his Honour, we cannot see any convincing explanation except for his Honour’s expressed perception that there was something so complicated about what the jury would have to decide that it would be in some way unfair to leave the decision to the jury at all.  
    54   In our respectful opinion, this approach over-stated the complexity of the essential questions for the jury; and failed to take into proper account the fundamental principles which are canvassed in the preceding paragraph 49. 
    55   The essential questions for the jury, if properly formulated and explained by reference to the available evidence, were in our opinion no more essentially complex or difficult than questions of fact that are routinely, and correctly, left to juries in criminal cases. 
    56   The first question for the jury was whether, upon the whole of the evidence, the jury thought that it was a reasonable possibility that the blood spots on the track pants and shoes of the respondent had been placed there by the investigating police after they had taken possession of those items from the respondent. We would think that few jurors of ordinary good sense and worldly wisdom would not understand, especially in the wake of the revelations of the Royal Commission recently conducted by Wood CJ at CL of this Court, (as his Honour now is), that there is nothing inherently fantastic or incredible in the proposition that investigating police have been known to fabricate evidence, both oral and physical. The resolution of the question whether that had happened in the present case, depended essentially, as it seems to us, upon what the jury made of the evidence of the relevant police witnesses. We cannot see anything unusual, or prejudicial in any relevant sense, in leaving such a question to a properly instructed jury. 
    57   Assuming that the jury was prepared to accept that there was no reasonable possibility of fabrication of the blood spots, then the remaining question of fact for the jury was whether the Crown had persuaded the jury beyond reasonable doubt that two inferences, adverse to the respondent, were rationally available: first, that the blood spots came from the victim of the assault; and secondly, that the only rational explanation for the presence on the respondent’s clothing of the victim’s blood was that the respondent had been one of the three assailants. We acknowledge that there was, as to the first of those matters, a conflict of expert opinion evidence. We are unpersuaded, however, that there is anything extraordinary about the conflict in the sense that a careful and sensible jury, properly directed as to the relevant law and as to the relevant evidence, could not have decided in a reasoned and responsible way whether or not the Crown had demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the body of evidence supporting the Crown case should be preferred to the opposed body of evidence. 
    58   Quite apart from Goldring DCJ’s expressed view about the capacity of the jury to understand the DNA evidence, and the errors to which we have pointed in that connection, we are of the opinion that his Honour applied, in any event, the wrong test in connection with the exercise of the discretion arising under s.137.  
    59   When at the conclusion of his judgment his Honour came to apply s.137, he did so in the passage quoted above at paragraph 16. In that passage, his Honour made it clear that he was applying a test as to what a jury might do as satisfying the statutory formula of “the danger of unfair prejudice”. This appears clearly from his Honour’s references: 
     
      
     -  
     “A real danger that the fact finders  
     might 
      be unduly swayed by …………” 
     .[emphasis added] 
      
      
     -  
     “A jury, even if properly directed,  
     could 
      fail to appreciate ………………” 
     . [emphasis added] 
      
    60   In our opinion, by applying to the statutory formula, - “the danger of unfair prejudice”, - a test of mere possibility, his Honour erred in law. Section 137 requires a real risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant by reason of the admission of the evidence complained of. It is not sufficient to establish that the complexity or nature of the evidence was such that it created the mere possibility that the jury could act in a particular way. His Honour applied the wrong test.  
    61   The focus of s.137 is evidence proposed to be “adduced by the prosecutor”. In the present case, the evidence of that character was contradicted by scientific evidence to the contrary. Even if we were to apply a test of mere possibility to the situation that presented itself to his Honour, it is not clear to us how his Honour came to the conclusion that he reached.  
    62   The test that a jury “might be unduly swayed by the ‘scientific’ nature of the evidence to make a decision on an improper basis” was derived from the judgments quoted by his Honour earlier in his decision. Those references were concerned with the undue weight that may be given to scientific evidence by reason of its very concreteness. They were not concerned with a situation such as that presented to his Honour where there was a real conflict of scientific evidence. That is quintessentially a jury question. 
    63   It is not, in our opinion, appropriate to infer that a jury even “might” be affected in a prejudicial way by reason of the “scientific” nature of the evidence, where such evidence is contradicted by other “scientific” evidence.  
    64   There is nothing so extraordinary about the conflict in the evidence presented in this case which would justify the conclusion that a careful and sensible jury, properly directed as to the relevant law and as to the relevant evidence, could not decide in a reasoned and responsible way whether or not the Crown had demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the body of evidence supporting the Crown case should be preferred to the opposed body of evidence. 
    65   We have come, therefore, to the conclusion that the statutory discretions exercised by Goldring DCJ miscarried. We are satisfied that the result of that miscarriage has been such an injustice to the Crown at trial as would warrant the intervention of this Court.  
    66   In considering what practical steps should now be taken by this Court, we have had regard to the approach taken by the Court in Bozatsis and Spanakakis. In that case, the orders made by the Court vacated the relevant order of the primary Judge and remitted the matter to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. That approach was taken because, as Gleeson CJ explains in the concluding paragraphs of his Honour’s judgment, it had not been demonstrated “that, on a proper approach to the facts of the case and the relevant discretionary considerations, a judge would necessarily reach a conclusion contrary to that of …..(the primary judge)”. 
    67   The present particular matter is not, in our opinion, on all fours in that respect with Bozatsis and Spanakakis. We are, however, of the opinion that the proper course is to make orders of the kind made in Bozatisis and Spanakakis.  
    68   We make, therefore, the following orders: 
     
      
     1. That the appeal be allowed. 
      
      
     2. That the order made by Goldring DCJ on 9 August 1999 excluding, pursuant to s.137 of the  
     Evidence Act 1995 
     , the evidence sought to be led at trial by the Crown on the subject of the location and DNA analysis of blood spotting on the respondent’s clothing, be vacated. 
      
      
     3. That the trial of the respondent proceed in conformity with the foregoing orders and otherwise according to law.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
      
    1   GROVE J: I agree with James J 
     
      
    2   JAMES J: This is an appeal brought by Elia Toma against his conviction after a trial in the Supreme Court before Hulme J and a jury on a charge that on 5 September 1996 at Fairfield he murdered Fouad Eskaria (the victim’s second name is variously spelt in the court papers). The appellant was sentenced by Hulme J to a sentence of penal servitude for eighteen years, consisting of a minimum term of thirteen and a half years and an additional term of four and a half years. In the event of his appeal against conviction being unsuccessful, the appellant had applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by Hulme J. 
     
      
    3   The appellant, the victim and many of the witnesses at the trial were Assyrians who had lived in Iraq and who had ultimately come to Australia. The appellant had married a woman named Shokriya, who was one of the daughters of a man named Eanoel Odisho. The victim Fouad Eskaria was married to another daughter of Mr Odisho, who gave evidence at the trial under the name Jaklin Shlemon. Another daughter of Mr Odisho named Janet was married to a man named George Hanna. In 1996 all of the three married couples, that is the appellant and Shokriya, George and Janet Hanna and the victim and Jaklin Shlemon, lived within short distances of each other at Fairfield. Mr Hanna and his wife lived in a unit on the top floor of a block of units at 73 Nelson Street, Fairfield. 
     
      
    4   Mr Odisho and his daughters and Fouad Eskaria and George Hanna were related by blood, as well as by marriage. The appellant, on the other hand, was not a blood relation and was to some extent treated as an outsider. 
     
      
    5   On Friday 30 August 1996 there was a wedding, which was attended by the appellant and a number of members of his wife’s family. After the wedding the appellant drove his father-in-law home, together with some of the other relatives. In the course of the journey an argument arose between the appellant and his father-in-law. This argument continued after they had arrived at the father-in-law’s home. That night the appellant’s wife and their children stayed with her parents and did not return to the appellant’s home. The appellant’s wife and children subsequently went to stay with George and Janet Hanna at their unit. Between 30 August and the night of 4 September the appellant did not see his wife or children.  
     
      
    6   A fairly large number of witnesses gave evidence in the Crown case at the trial about what they said had happened on the night of 4-5 September 1996. The evidence of the various Crown witnesses contained a number of inconsistencies. The following statement of what happened on the night of 4-5 September 1996 is taken mainly from parts of Hulme J’s remarks on sentence in which his Honour made findings about the objective facts of the offence. These parts of his Honour’s remarks were not the subject of any complaint on the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
    7   On the evening of 4 September 1996 the appellant drove into the driveway of the block of units at 73 Nelson Street. He had armed himself with a knife, which had a blade about eighty-five millimetres long. All of Mr Hanna, Janet Hanna, the appellant’s wife and Jaklin Shlemon were at the Hannas’ unit. The appellant sounded the horn of his vehicle and there was an exchange of words between the appellant and his wife and some of her relatives, who came on to the balcony of the unit. The appellant spoke angrily. He said to Jaklin Shlemon that he would make her “a widow to-night”. Jaklin Shelmon told the appellant that if he wanted to fight her husband, her husband could be found at a nearby shop. The appellant’s wife agreed to go with the appellant and the appellant and his wife departed on foot from 73 Nelson Street. Mr Hanna drove to the shop where Mr Eskaria was and warned him that the appellant would be coming.  
     
      
    8   The appellant arrived at the shop, which was patronised by men of Assyrian extraction for drinking coffee and playing cards. At the shop the appellant sought to fight Mr Eskaria but other people present physically restrained both the appellant and Mr Eskaria. The owner of the shop told the appellant that he did not want any trouble at the shop and the appellant agreed to leave the shop. He returned to 73 Nelson Street and collected his children. He then drove home with his wife and children.  
     
      
    9   Subsequently Mr Eskaria and a number of the other men who had been at the shop went to the Hannas’ unit. Mr Eskaria himself became incensed against the appellant. Mr Eskaria left the unit, got a metal steering wheel lock from his car and went on foot to the backyard of a property which adjoined the property where the appellant lived. Mr Eskaria called out to the appellant. He used insulting words and challenged the appellant to fight him. Some of Mr Eskaria’s friends and then the appellant’s wife sought, unsuccessfully, to dissuade Mr Eskaria from fighting the appellant. 
     
      
    10   The appellant, having heard Mr Eskaria’s insulting and challenging words, armed himself with two steak knives, a rock and a table leg (in addition to the knife he already had), went into the yard of the property where he lived and jumped over a fence into the backyard, where Mr Eskaria was.  
     
      
    11   The appellant and Mr Eskaria evaded the grasp of persons seeking to restrain them and started to fight each other. Hulme J found that both the appellant and Mr Eskaria were aggressors. In the fight Mr Eskaria hit the appellant with the steering wheel lock. The appellant threw the rock at Mr Eskaria but missed him. In the fight the appellant used all of the three knives he had. Mr Eskaria sustained two stab wounds, one of which penetrated his heart and which led a few days later to his death. Mr Eskaria also sustained some incised wounds and lacerations.  
     
      
    12   In his remarks on sentence Hulme J found that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the fatal stab wound was inflicted the appellant had the intention of killing Mr Eskaria. In finding the appellant guilty of murder the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant at least had the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Eskaria.  
     
      
    13   At the trial the appellant did not give evidence or call evidence. He had been interviewed by the police in a long electronically recorded interview on 5 September 1996 and edited tape recordings of this interview were admitted into evidence during the Crown case and played to the jury. At the trial the appellant raised issues of voluntariness, intent, self-defence and provocation, all of which the jury resolved adversely to the appellant. 
     
      
    14   At the hearing of the appeal a number of the grounds of appeal against conviction which had been filed were abandoned by counsel for the appellant. The only grounds of appeal against conviction which were not abandoned were grounds 1, 2 and 5, which were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned trial judge erred in law by misdirecting the jury that the death could have occurred as a result of an accident. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned trial judge erred in law by removing the issue of accident from the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The learned trial judge erred in law in his direction on provocation in that he substantially removed it from the jury”. 
        
       
      
    15   The application for leave to appeal against sentence, in the event of the appeal against conviction being dismissed, was maintained.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 
       
      
    16   Counsel for the appellant dealt with the first and second grounds of appeal against conviction together and it is convenient to follow this course. Only one submission was put in support of the two grounds. I observe in passing that the first ground of appeal is not felicitously worded (it was not drafted by counsel who appeared for the appellant at the hearing of the appeal) but nothing turns on how the ground is worded. 
     
      
    17   At the trial the trial judge, as well as orally summing-up to the jury, gave the jury written directions. In both the written directions and in the oral summing-up the trial judge identified the act on which the Crown relied on the charge of murder as being “the thrusting of a knife into Mr Eskaria”. The jury were directed that the appellant should be found guilty of murder, if, but only if, the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt each of a number of ingredients, including:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) That Fouad Eskaria had died.  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) That his death was caused by a deliberate act. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) That the deliberate act was an act of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) That at the time the act was done it was done with an intention to kill or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
      
    18   It was not submitted by counsel for the appellant that any of these directions were wrong. However, it was submitted that they were inadequate.  
     
      
    19   Counsel then referred to a part of the oral summing-up in which his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There was considerable attention given by Mr Nicholson (counsel for the appellant at the trial) to the issue of whether there was any deliberate act of the accused which caused the deceased’s death. You will remember that one of the points he made was that the entry of the knife into the deceased could have been the result of movement by the deceased, or others. He referred to, among other things, the dynamics of the fight; indeed, of any fight”. 
        
       
      
    20   After referring to what Mr Nicholson had said, the trial judge gave two further directions, which had not been included in the written directions. 
     
      
    21   The first of these further directions was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…if a person creates a situation intended to kill and it does kill, it is no answer to a charge of murder that it caused death in a way that was, to some extent, unexpected”. 
        
       
      
    22   The second of these further directions was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “.. the question of cause you have to decide under paragraph (ii) of the murder directions is to be determined by applying your commonsense to the facts as you find them, appreciating that the purpose of the inquiry is to decide whether to attribute legal responsibility in a criminal matter”. 
        
       
      
    23   It was not submitted by counsel for the appellant on the appeal that either of these further directions was wrong. The first direction was taken verbatim from the joint judgment of McGarvie J and O’Bryan J in R v Demirian (1989) VR 97 at 113 and was quoted with approval in Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378 by Mason CJ at 392, Brennan J at 400, Deane J and Dawson J at 411 and McHugh J at 452. The second direction is a standard direction on causation.  
     
      
    24   Although it was not submitted that any of the directions given by his Honour were wrong, it was submitted that, in the circumstances, they were inadequate. The direction which, it was submitted, his Honour should have given, and had not given, was a direction to the effect that if the jury thought it was reasonably possible that the force, which caused the stabbing motion of the knife and thereby the entry of the knife into the victim’s body so as to occasion the fatal wounding, was an intervention of a third party, then the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant or a person in his position could reasonably have foreseen the intervention of the third party. It was conceded that at the trial the trial judge had not been asked to give any such direction. 
     
      
    25   In support of the submission that this direction should have been given, counsel referred to a passage in the judgment of Brennan J in Royall v The Queen at 398-399. In Royall the appellant had been charged with the murder of a woman who had fallen from the bathroom window of her sixth floor flat. There was evidence at the trial that she and the appellant had had a violent argument in the flat. The Crown case was that the appellant had murdered the woman in one or other of three ways, namely:- 
     
      
    26   (i) He had pushed her out of the window. 
     
      
    27   (ii) He had attacked her and she had fallen out of the window in the course of avoiding the attack. 
     
      
    28   (iii) Having a well founded and reasonable apprehension of life threatening violence, she had jumped from the window. 
     
      
    29   At pp398-399 Brennan J said inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The basic proposition relating to causation in homicide is that an accused’s conduct, whether by act or omission, must contribute significantly to the death of the victim. It need not be the sole, direct or immediate cause of death. However, when the death is not caused directly by the conduct of the accused but by something done by the victim or by a third person in response to the conduct of the accused, there is a question whether the chain of causation has been broken” 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        “Nevertheless, an accused cannot be held criminally responsible for a death that has been caused in fact by his conduct, if the final fatal step taken by the victim was neither foreseen nor reasonably foreseeable. Foresight or reasonable forseeability marks the limit of the consequences of conduct for which an accused may be held criminally responsible.” 
         
        
       
      
    30   It was submitted that this statement of principle was equally applicable, whether the final fatal step was taken by the victim or a third party. 
     
      
    31   I do not consider that the direction suggested by counsel for the appellant was a direction which the trial judge was required to give.  
     
      
    32   In the first place, the views expressed by Brennan J in Royall about reasonable forseeability would not appear to have been shared, or at any rate fully shared, by other members of the High Court. For example, Mason CJ said at p390:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the English cases the natural consequence test has been linked to the concept of foreseeability. Because the natural consequence test inevitably invites conjecture about the likelihood of an occurrence, it is impossible to divorce completely the application of the test from the concept of foreseeability. However, in my view, to invite the jury to consider foreseeability would be more likely, at least in the majority of cases, to confuse than to clarify the issue of causation”. 
        
       
      
    33   At p412 Deane J and Dawson J in their joint judgment said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On occasions forseeability may play some part in a jury’s inquiry into the cause of death but, in directing a jury, it is, for practical purposes, desirable to keep causation and intent separate as far as possible and to avoid the introduction of questions of foreseeability in relation to causation”. 
        
       
      
    34   In the second place, even if a direction of the kind suggested would sometimes be required, it was not required in the present case. In the present case, the trial judge in both his written and his oral directions unequivocally identified the act on which the Crown relied on the charge of murder as being the act of thrusting a knife into Mr Eskaria’s body so as to cause the fatal wound. The jury were directed, both orally and in writing, that they could find the appellant guilty of murder, only if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that act was a deliberate act of the appellant, done with the intent required for murder, which had caused the death of the victim. If the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of those matters, then the jury would necessarily have been satisfied that Mr Eskaria’s death had been caused directly by a deliberate act of the appellant, and not by something done by either the victim or a third party, for example some movement by the victim in the fight or some movement by a third person perhaps done in an endeavour to stop the fight or disarm the appellant. Given the way in which the act causing death was identified in the Crown case and by the trial judge, there was no final fatal step taken by a person other than the appellant and hence no need to direct the jury about whether some step taken by a person other than the appellant was reasonably foreseeable by the appellant or by someone in the appellant’s position. Given the way in which the act causing death was identified by the Crown and by the trial judge, there was no real issue about causation at all. 
     
      
    35   The submission made by counsel for the appellant may have had more force, if the act of the appellant relied on by the Crown had been identified (solely or in the alternative) as some act antecedent to the thrusting of a knife into the victim’s body so as to occasion the fatal wound, for example the act of holding a drawn knife close to the victim’s body. If the act of the appellant had been so identified and the knife had entered the victim’s body as a result of some movement of the victim or a third person and not as a result of a willed act of stabbing by the appellant, then issues would have arisen which might have called for further directions than those given by his Honour. 
     
      
    36   I would reject the first and second grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal 5 
       
      
    37   At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant did not put any submission on ground 5 but he did not formally abandon the ground. 
     
      
    38   In the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant a part of the summing-up was criticised in which his Honour, in the course of giving directions on provocation, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Most of you have probably lost your temper at some stage but nowhere near the extent that you were inspired to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the person who is the source of your irritation”. 
        
       
      
    39   It was submitted that by making this remark his Honour had “taken away” the defence of provocation from the jury. 
     
      
    40   I do not consider that this submission should be accepted. His Honour made the remark in the course of explaining to the jury the requirement of provocation set out in s23(2)(b) of the Crimes Act that the conduct of the deceased should have been such “as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased”. After stating this requirement his Honour told the jury “you would appreciate that self control can be lost to an extent significantly less than is envisaged by those words”. His Honour then made the remark which has been criticised. 
     
      
    41   It is important that a trial judge, in giving directions on provocation, should make clear to the jury the extent of the loss of self control which is required for provocation and, read in its context, I consider that his Honour’s remark was unobjectionable and did not have the effect of eliminating provocation as a matter which the jury had to consider. His Honour gave careful directions on provocation, which occupy three pages of the transcript of the summing-up. 
     
      
    42   I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    43   I turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    44   I have already summarised the objective facts of the offence. In his remarks on sentence his Honour regarded as an aggravating circumstance that the appellant had used knives in the fight.  
     
      
    45   The appellant was born in Iraq in September 1966 and was accordingly thirty-one years old when he was sentenced. He had an unfortunate early life. His father died when he was five years old and his mother deserted her children. The appellant was brought up by an older brother. From the age of about twenty the appellant spent six years in a refugee camp in Iran. He went to New Zealand in 1992 and arrived in Australia in 1994. At the time he was sentenced he was married with two children. He had a good employment record. He had no previous criminal convictions. Hulme J accepted an opinion by a psychiatrist that the offence the appellant had committed was “very situationally specific” and that the risk of the appellant re-offending was low.  
     
      
    46   It was not suggested by counsel for the appellant that the sentence imposed by his Honour, on the facts found by his Honour, was outside the range of sentences within a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. What was submitted by counsel for the appellant was that Hulme J had made a specific error in the sentencing of the appellant. It was submitted that his Honour had erred when, in the proceedings on sentence, he had rejected part of a report by Beverley Spiers of an Aboriginal mental health organisation, in which Ms Spiers said that when the appellant first came to gaol he was “full of remorse for his actions”. It was submitted that the rejection of this evidence was important, because in his remarks on sentence Hulme J commented that there was nothing in the electronically recorded interview of the appellant which would persuade him that the appellant had any significant remorse for the victim’s death and his Honour clearly sentenced the appellant on the basis that there was no evidence of remorse or contrition.  
     
      
    47   This part of Ms Spiers’ report was objected to by the Crown Prosecutor, when the report was tendered by counsel for the appellant in the proceedings on sentence. After the objection was taken, his Honour made an order under s4 of the Evidence Act  that the Evidence Act should apply to the proceedings on sentence. His Honour then upheld the objection.  
     
      
    48   Hulme J gave reasons for his ruling rejecting the evidence. He held that the statement that the appellant was “full of remorse for his actions” was an expression of an opinion by Ms Spiers and the basis on which Ms Spiers had formed the opinion was not disclosed in her report or elsewhere. 
     
      
    49   His Honour noted a submission by counsel for the appellant that the statement was admissible under s65(8) of the Evidence Act. His Honour doubted whether this was correct but said that it was unnecessary to decide the point, because, even if the statement was admissible under s65(8) of the Evidence Act, he would reject it in the exercise of his discretion under s135 of the Evidence Act (in the Court papers the relevant section of the Evidence Act is referred to as being s15 but this is obviously a transcription error). His Honour regarded the statement in the report that the appellant was full of remorse for his actions as having no probative value, in the absence of a statement by the author of the report of the basis on which the conclusion had been drawn and in the absence of any evidence from the appellant himself. The appellant did not give evidence before his Honour either at the trial or in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    50   I do not consider that any error has been shown in his Honour’s reasoning. Apart from the reasons given by his Honour, I am of the opinion that the statement was not admissible under s65(8) of the Evidence Act. Under subs(1) of s65 the section applies, only if the person who made the out of court representation (that is Ms Spiers) was “not available” to give evidence. There was no evidence that Ms Spiers fell within any of the classes of persons who are taken to be “not available” to give evidence (see para4 of Pt2 of the Dictionary at the end of the Evidence Act). 
     
      
    51   I would give leave to appeal against sentence but I would dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    52   DOWD J: I agree with James J.

      REGINA v. MANDIE TANYA JANCEK 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner has pleaded guilty before me to one offence under s.97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, a subsequent offence under s.97(2) as an accessory before the fact and an offence under s.33B committed at the same time and place as the latter offence. The offence under s.97(1) is punishable by a maximum of 20 years penal servitude, the further offence under s.97(2), by a maximum of 25 years penal servitude. The offence under s.33B is punishable by 12 years penal servitude. 
    2   It will be necessary in this case of multiple offences to have regard to the totality principle and also the principles referred to by the High Court in The Queen v. Pearce (1998) 156 ALR 684. 
    3   The facts of these offences are as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
       Assault with intent to rob being armed with an offensive instrument at Blacktown on 4 August 1997 
       
      
      
       
       ""At about midday on Monday 4 August 1997, the prisoner went to the Blacktown East Totalizer Agency Board (the ""TAB"") with an unknown male person, where she had a brief conversation with the 26 year old TAB manager Neil Flockhart. The male accomplice of the prisoner was seen to flick through results books whilst the prisoner looked around at security cameras. The prisoner and the male accomplice were in the TAB for about five minutes. 
       
      
      
       
       A regular patron of the TAB who was there at the time took particular notice of the prisoner. The patron was still in the TAB with about eight other adult male customers when two bandits entered the TAB about 4.15 pm the same day, one being an unknown male, the other being the prisoner. 
       
      
      
       
       Both of the bandits wore dark coloured full face balaclavas, gloves, padded clothing on the top half of their bodies, track pants and shoes. The male offender carried what resembled a hand gun. He threatened customers in the TAB with the gun upon entry to the TAB, demanding that they lie on the floor. The prisoner said 'get down, get down on the floor'. 
       
      
      
       
       The TAB manager was working alone at the time, but was behind an enclosed, secure area which accessed the back of the premises. He saw the offenders. Fearing that he was about to be held up, he made good his exit into the back room. He was able to activate hold up alarms. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner and her accomplice banged on the outside of the enclosed area. Her accomplice was heard to say words to the effect of 'I need the money'. The prisoner was heard to say 'come on let's get out'. They were unable to obtain money or other property. There was cash on the premises at the time. 
       
      
      
       
       As the prisoner and her accomplice were leaving the TAB, her accomplice said words to the effect of 'We ought to pop one of these cunts off', referring to the customers who were lying on the floor of the TAB. The prisoner said words to the effect of 'No fuck that, fuck that, let's go'. They then ran off, but were photographed by TAB security cameras. 
       
      
      
       
       It is unclear how the prisoner and her accomplice travelled to and from the TAB. A subsequent search of premises at Lethbridge Park which had been occupied by the prisoner led to the seizure of footwear and clothing, some of which appears to be the same as items worn during the TAB robbery. 
       
      
      
       
       Enquiries led to the prisoner being identified from photographs as the female who was in the TAB earlier in the day prior to the robbery. It has not been established who the male accomplice was. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner was electronically interviewed at Blacktown Police Station on 30 December 1998. During the interview, the prisoner admitted that she went to the TAB wearing a balaclava with an intent to rob, but she denied being armed herself. She stated that her role in the robbery was to keep watch if anyone came into the TAB. She was otherwise non-specific about details of the incident and did not name her accomplice, allegedly due to fears for her safety."" 
       
      
      
       
       Assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon; use offensive weapon to prevent apprehension at Lurnea on 26 October 1997 
       
      
      
       
       ""At about 5.30 pm on Sunday 26 October 1997, the prisoner Mandie Jancek and a co-offender Frank Petrinovic drove to the vicinity of the Liquorland Bottle Shop, located at the corner of Hill Road and Reilly Street, Lurnea. Both Petrinovic and Jancek travelled there in vehicle MOW-739, a 1983 Holden Commodore sedan owned by Petrinovic. 
       
      
      
       
       Petrinovic got out of the vehicle in Reilly Street. He put on a black balaclava and surgical gloves and armed himself with a loaded .32 calibre Argentina brand revolver. At the time he was also carrying a red plastic Grace Bros. shopping bag. The prisoner remained in the vehicle in Reilly Street. 
       
      
      
       
       Petrinovic walked into the Liquorland Bottle Shop through the Reilly Street entrance. He walked towards the cash register and confronted the two employees on duty, Ian Hagarty and Troy Stephens. 
       
      
      
       
       Petrinovic ordered the two employees to the ground. Both complied. Petrinovic stood over both employees and pointed the loaded revolver in their direction. Petrinovic threw the Grace Bros. bag he was carrying behind the counter and said 'fill up the bag'. Mr. Hagarty stood up and said 'Alright mate, I'll do it'. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point a struggle started between Petrinovic and Mr. Hagarty. During the struggle, two shots were discharged from the revolver by Petrinovic. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Hagarty continued to struggle with Petrinovic after the shots were fired, eventually taking the revolver off Petrinovic and staggering away. 
       
      
      
       
       Around this time, a number of the customers in the shop came to the aid of Mr. Hagarty. Petrinovic was restrained by the customers in the driveway area. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point the prisoner entered the shop on foot and attempted to pull away the customers who were restraining Petrinovic. She was unsuccessful and she left the shop. The prisoner then returned a short time later driving vehicle MOW-739. She drove the vehicle into the bottle shop via the exit into Reilly Street, and drove at Petrinovic and the customers, narrowly missing a number of people. 
       
      
      
       
       This resulted in Petrinovic breaking free of the customers for a short time. Petrinovic attempted to get into the vehicle driven by the prisoner, but was unable to do so. Petrinovic then picked up a house brick and threatened the witnesses who were trying to detain him. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner remained in the vehicle whilst all of this was happening. A witness removed the keys from the ignition of the vehicle, preventing the prisoner from driving away. The prisoner's vehicle was surrounded by a number of witnesses, preventing her from escaping. 
       
      
      
       
       Petrinovic ran out onto the footpath of Reilly Street where he was again restrained by customers until police arrived. The prisoner was taken into custody by police, together with the co-offender Petrinovic. 
       
      
      
       
       Located at the scene was the loaded revolver used by Petrinovic, the balaclava worn by Petrinovic which was removed by one of the witnesses who tried to detain him, surgical gloves worn by Petrinovic, and the Grace Bros. shopping bag. 
       
      
      
       
       A search was made of the vehicle which the prisoner was driving. Located in the vehicle was a radio scanner which was set on the police channel for the Liverpool area, and a box of surgical gloves. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner was taken by police to Liverpool Police Station where she was interviewed. The prisoner stated that she did not wish to comment about what had occurred."" 
       
      
    4   Although on the plea there were tendered numerous statements, that recital of the facts was unchallenged. It is notable that the statement ""we ought to pop one of these cunts off"" by the prisoner's accomplice on 4 August 1997 presaged the death of Mr. Hagarty on 26 October 1997. It must be remembered that the present prisoner is not charged with any complicity in the murder or death of Mr. Hagarty. 
    5   I have had the benefit of substantial documentary material and extensive written submissions from both the prisoner and the Crown. By consent I was to have regard to that written material as provided on behalf of the prisoner in that form. There was no challenge by the Crown to its content. 
    6   The prisoner was arrested on 26 October 1997 and although released for a time on bail, has been in custody for this offence for a period of almost one year. Since there has been a broken period of custody, the appropriate course will be to give the prisoner the credit for that time as affecting both the minimum and additional term components of the total sentence and I will do so. 
    7   The prisoner was born on 11 September 1973 and her prior criminal record commences with the imposition of a recognizance for assault on 5 November 1990. On 1 October 1993 she received a recognizance for stealing and was ordered to perform 150 hours community service and to pay compensation in respect of an offence of break, enter and steal. In 1994 she was found to be in breach of a community service order and was the subject of a further community service order. She has been fined for entering enclosed land and possessing prohibited drugs. She has not previously received a gaol sentence. 
    8   Although her co-offender on 4 August 1997 has not been affirmatively identified and she did not admit it to be Frank Petrinovic, her co-accused in respect of the attempted robbery at Lurnea on 26 October 1997, when interviewed, she did assert that she was not identifying the person in question in that interview because of fears of that person's violent nature and for her own safety. Considering the violence that person showed and threatened, and that this prisoner attempted to dissuade her accomplice from the further act he suggested, I can see a real basis for her fears and I consider that her reticence should not be held against her.  
    9   Although some of the evidence suggests she was the more talkative of the two on 4 August, nonetheless, it does not appear that I could be satisfied that she had the replica firearm charged. That she successfully dissuaded her associate from carrying out any further violence to the persons present is a matter which should be held to her credit. 
    10   The Crown has put forward her culpability as being involved on two occasions in joint criminal enterprises to rob and in attempting to rescue her associate when the robbery went wrong. Although jointly responsible with her co-offender(s) for the crimes, I accept her role as less culpable. 
    11   She had originally been charged with more serious offences in relation to the events of 26 October 1997 but shortly before trial a plea was offered and accepted by the Crown to the offences of which she has presently been indicted. 
    12   She is entitled to some benefit under s.439 of the Crimes Act because of the pleas and her co-operation, particularly in relation to the offence of 4 August 1997, to which she confessed. Although one at least of the victims of that offence was easily able to identify her, without that confession she may have had some argument such that the Crown case against her on that offence was not as strong as it was against her on the other. But, as to the events of 26 October 1997, she was apprehended at the scene. The offences had been committed in the presence of many witnesses. The case against her was overwhelming. 
    13   She is also entitled to some more substantial benefit for the pragmatic value of her pleas avoiding lengthy and costly proceedings and in all the circumstances, entered, if not at the first available opportunity, at a time such as to avoid the costs to the community and early enough to support its use as indicating contrition. Indeed, as was submitted on her behalf, the fact of her pleading guilty may go some way to acknowledging the harm caused in these offences to the victims. 
    14   I have been provided with the Judicial Commission Sentencing Statistics for offences under s.97(2) and s.33B. Whilst I have had regard to those statistics, I have also had regard to the guideline judgment of this court in Regina v. Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111, not only in relation to the appropriate ranges of sentence for offences of armed robbery and attempted armed robbery, but also with respect to the issue of the relevance of drug addiction for the reasons to which I shall refer later. 
    15   The prisoner did not give evidence on her plea but without objection I was provided with a two page statement from her. In that statement she refers to her two small children aged 10 and three respectively; her addiction and her lack of a similar record in the past. She asserts that she has undergone a tremendous change whilst at the Mulawa Detention Centre and expresses deep remorse at the harm she has caused to others. She informed me that she had chosen not to go on the methadone programme and had, whilst in gaol, been selected to work in telemarketing, having obtained a certificate in that regard. 
    16   The prospect of her rehabilitation is attested to by a school friend, Catherine Trent, who had visited the prisoner in gaol and noted her health improvement. A reference was provided by the general manager of Call Centre Services Pty. Limited as to her commitment, ability, effort and her bright and cheerful personality. The welfare officer at Mulawa has provided a statement that she has assisted the prisoner attend to the placement of her two children with family members and arranged through the Department of Housing to ensure that the prisoner may be re-housed at the completion of her sentence. 
    17   Reports from the Department of Corrective Services show that she has enrolled as a full-time student in a range of courses including painting and decorating trade course, information technology, desktop publishing and adult further education at TAFE but has not yet managed to develop a consistent approach to study or a level of development which would define her as an adult learner. A further report indicates that her behaviour within the system is acceptable, it having shown a marked change from the initial problems she had adjusting to the environment. I am informed that she seems to have made an effort to address her alcohol and other drug problems, childhood, family and related social and psychological issues, although in the circumstances with which I was provided with those reports by that Department, very little detail has been given. She has attained her TAFE qualification by way of Outreach Access certificate and other course completion certificates. 
    18   Major Hindle of the Salvation Army had assessed the prisoner for bail purposes and found her to be highly motivated to break her life on drugs. Her motivation had been watched and assessed over a period of two months whilst in Mulawa. He confirmed her family support. He offered the Salvation Army Bridge Programme to assist with rehabilitation. That programme deals with all aspects of rehabilitation and is a residential programme conducted through the William Booth Institute. 
    19   In consequence of that assessment, the prisoner was bailed to that programme but developed withdrawal and psychological reactions to a 30 milligram daily dose of methadone and left the programme on 6 February to reside in full-time Salvation Army care under medical supervision, returning to custody on 2 March 1999. She had previously attempted residential anti-addiction programmes with the Salvation Army at Selah Farm and with WHO's at the New Beginnings Therapeutic Community. 
    20   A report from Dr. Lucas was provided. He elicited a most useful history.  
    21   The prisoner had been born to Aboriginal parents but fostered from the age of six weeks. Unfortunately the marriage of the foster parents also failed. She had other placements but when pregnant at 15, left foster care. Her education was only to Year Nine level. She has the two children to whom she referred in her statement. Her relationship with her co-offender was referred to as relatively brief. She has tested positive to Hepatitis C but, otherwise than having been a heroin addict whose use of the drug is reported as recently increased prior to her entering custody, especially after her association with her co-offender, she apparently has no significant medical or psychiatric problems. 
    22   She had confirmed to Dr. Lucas that the offence which resulted in the death of Mr. Hagarty had occurred when she and her co-accused were experiencing the effect of lack of heroin, having no money with which to get it. Her role in the expected robbery apparently was as driver of the vehicle and lookout. When things went wrong and her associate was being forcibly attacked by the people at the bottle shop, they were also yelling at her and, she told the doctor:- 
     
      
       
       ""Without even thinking she got into the car wondering what to do and how to get heroin. She drove the car to where people holding her companion (sic) and dragged him into the car. Someone threw a brick through a car window and a woman took the car keys."" 
       
      
    23   She confirmed that the previous hold up at the TAB was an attempt to get money to remedy a lack of heroin. She told Dr. Lucas she was ashamed and felt sick in her stomach talking about the offence and believed she had done something really wrong:- 
     
      
       
       ""She thought it was time to pay back for the wrong so she could get out and start with a clean slate. She would make sure she would not do anything like this again."" 
       
      
    24   She had also said to Dr. Lucas that the longest she had been off heroin had been seven months but that she had managed periods of abstinence on methadone. Dr. Lucas expressed the view that her educational level did not represent a true measure of her abilities. The impression he gained was that she was of good intelligence and could well pursue further education and training. She told Dr. Lucas that she did not feel emotionally mature and that she had sustained considerable physical abuse from her male partners. 
    25   Dr. Lucas refers to the interaction of her heroin dependence and her involvement with Mr. Petrinovic in the light of her emotionally deprived upbringing and personal difficulties. He has expressed the view that he was in no doubt that she was ashamed and contrite and accepting of the fact that she would be punished. He expressed the view that she was forward looking, willing to better herself and strongly attached to her children. He believed that with support, supervision and abstinence from drugs she could do well and benefit from education and training. He was of the view that a substantial period of supervision on release combined with appropriate drug counselling would be necessary. 
    26   She has participated in drug counselling programmes whilst in custody and although she is anxious about her children, has apparently acted appropriately in the view of Dr. Sefton, the Director Womens' Corrections Health Service. There have apparently been no incidents relating to illicit drug use. 
    27   Dr. Lisa Brown, consultant psychiatrist at the Mulawa Correctional Centre also provided a report which was to the same effect as that of Dr. Sefton in noting the prisoner's anxiety and concern for her family. Dr. Brown noted expressions of remorse and the attendance at psychological and drug and alcohol counselling.  
    28   Subsequently, additional material was provided to me by consent in written form. That material included numerous Mulawa Correctional Centre reports by various officers including classification, vocational, welfare and other reports. There was in addition a psychologist's report and a letter from her former partner dealing with the disruptive effects of her custody on her children. The material establishes that although the prisoner's case suits the profile of the mother's and children's Programme, she is not eligible for the options which would permit more contact with her children whilst she is in custody until sentenced and her present status is producing a negative effect on her children such that by reason of her deep concern for them, is affecting her. The material is confirmatory of what she put in her letter to which I have referred and of her recent history in custody as given to the psychologist and the psychiatrist. She is plainly deeply concerned for her relationship with her children and to be reunited with them. She is currently, apparently, off both heroin and methadone and has shown an ability to stay off for an extended period. She is actively pursuing obtaining vocational qualifications and is engaged in a degree of employment. It is said that she has some insight into her prior relationships and that a combination of all these factors are such as to indicate some positive prospects that she might be able to deal with her addiction and the personality the psychologist describes as dependent. 
    29   To some considerable extent the views of the psychologist and psychiatrist appear borne out by the primary material by way of report from the various Corrective Services officers. The history given to the psychiatrist and the psychologist is similar. The deprived and disrupted childhood, her foster placements and her difficulties with foster parents appear to underlie the predilection to addiction  
    30   The effect of the professional assessments of the medical practitioners is that there is a basis for a real prospect of rehabilitation if the prisoner is able, with support to deal with her drug addiction and no doubt that involves her avoidance of such associates as might also have access to that drug. It is clear that upon release from the custodial portion of her sentence the prisoner will require substantial support and supervision. Her position is complicated by the apparent lack of supportive immediate family. The evidence before me does not disclose that the prisoner is likely to resume the relationship which had been of some duration with the partner with whom she lived prior to meeting Mr. Petrinovic. In the circumstances, perhaps it is unlikely that that relationship will be resumed. 
    31   The prisoner's lack of prior record and the fact that these offences were committed during the time of her association with Mr. Petrinovic (even though the evidence does not allow me to hold that Mr. Petrinovic was her associate in the TAB robbery) leads me to the conclusion that, notwithstanding her lengthy involvement with heroin, Mr. Petrinovic was a substantial influence in the relationship and had a substantial effect in causing this prisoner to act in a way out of accord with her prior behaviour. In this regard the views of the psychologist that she has a dependent personality and Dr. Lucas' observations are most relevant. 
    32   I would not, however, regard her criminality in the context of her heroin addiction as completely aberrant. The consequences of heroin addiction and the likelihood of embarking on serious crime in order to feed it are all too well known to everyone in the community, including those so affected, even if their habit prevents them having the usual moral restraints from involvement in serious crime. I am also satisfied that the prisoner is motivated and has been trying to address the very problem of her addiction which has led her into this substantial criminality and divorced her from her children. 
    33   The offences are now two years old and during that time, which for her has been apparently attended by some degree of anxiety in relation to the children, she has, by her behaviour, given an indication that she has the potential to avoid the drug addict's usual life of criminality. It appears to be accepted that the delays in the disposition of the matter are not her fault. 
    34   In my view she falls within that class described by Spigelman, CJ. in Henry & Ors (supra):- 
     
      
       
       ""It may be inferred in many cases (and the present case is very much in point) that the offender would almost certainly never have become a thief but for loss of control of an ordered life through drug addiction. The propositions the results of drug addiction are self-inflicted is half true and therefore dangerous. The offender must, of course, be held responsible for his or her own actions. The drug addiction is not an excuse; but it is a factor that may tell the court that the real weakness of character is that of a drug addict rather than that of a robber. That may be by no means inconsequential. It is, however, a two edged factor; it may also tell the court that rehabilitation is going to be difficult."" 
       
      
    35   The circumstances of this prisoner can be considered in the light of her drug addiction according to the principles laid down by Wood, CJ. at CL. in Henry (supra) as including an apparently impulsive offence with limited planning; an impairment of judgment under the influence of the drugs, a condition that would render rehabilitation more difficult but which in this case professional opinion considers the offender will try to achieve and that the addiction was attributable at least to a substantial extent to circumstances for which the prisoner was not primarily responsible. Although the Crown submitted that in respect of the first offence, that of 4 August 1997, the prisoner would fall within the guideline promulgated in Henry & Ors (supra), it also submitted that the second offence took the matter outside the guidelines and required a more severe penalty be imposed for that offence. I do not consider that the circumstance that I am dealing with two offences disqualifies these observations from applying here. 
    36   Her prior circumstances clearly enough raise the very matters that his Honour also considered in Regina v. Fernando (1992) 76 A. Crim. R. 58 at 62 to 63 albeit in the context of heroin rather than alcohol. 
    37   The prisoner's attachment for and regard to her children, insofar as hardship is occasioned to them by reason of the absence from their mother, is not a matter which would normally mitigate sentence (see Regina v. Day (1998) 100 A. Crim. R. 275). However, it is also clear that because of her separation from the children in the circumstances the prisoner will serve the time she spends in custody away from them in circumstances more onerous than others. Although she may be able to resume that contact in custody, nonetheless the impact upon her of that separation is a matter that has to be considered. 
    38   Further, it is important from a point of view of rehabilitation to have regard to the closeness of her association and concern for her children particularly since it appears to be a factor which strongly points towards a willingness on her behalf to avoid the drugs and other criminality if given sufficient support, that is, her relationship with her children can operate under supervision as a support mechanism. I was asked to recommend to the Department of Corrective Services that she be considered for any appropriate programme that would, in the Department's view, be available to support her contact with and care of the children. Plainly in her case if such a course is considered to meet the various exigencies including the views of the childrens' present carers, it would be appropriate for the Department to put it into effect in her interests and, insofar as it assists with rehabilitation, the community's also. 
    39   My attention was drawn also to the fact that in her attempts to achieve rehabilitation, she had spent in residential programmes a period of some six months and 18 days. I do not feel that there should be any mathematical application of the time thus spent to the period of sentence that I must otherwise pass. However, I am prepared to take into account, particularly as showing her willingness to attempt to achieve rehabilitation, the time she has spent in residential programmes. 
    40   The Crown submitted that whilst an appropriate sentence had to be fixed for each offence and then the question of cumulation or concurrence considered (see Pearce v. The Queen (supra)) nonetheless it accepted that it was open to me ultimately to impose concurrent sentences. I am not aware that the Crown was in any way contending that the sentences in this case should be other than concurrent. I am of the view that in this case, bearing in mind the underlying common factors, despite the fact that the offences were some months apart, it would be appropriate that the armed robbery offences as well as the offence of using the vehicle with intent to avoid apprehension be the subject of concurrent sentences. 
    41   It is submitted that this prisoner is ""at the crossroads"". Such a submission is often made and in the case of heroin addicts committing serious crimes of violence, is one which the courts must understandably treat with very great caution. It would only be where experienced professional assistance has been provided to a court and that assistance itself expresses what appears to be a firm basis for the prospect of rehabilitation that such a submission might find favour. In this case I have that experienced professional assistance apparently firmly based upon the efforts the prisoner has made and the reports available in respect of those efforts within the gaol system. I have reached the view that in this case it would be appropriate in passing sentence to put substantial emphasis on the prospects of rehabilitation of this prisoner in the light of the material to which I have already referred. 
    42   Nonetheless, the crimes were of considerable seriousness and although she should not be sentenced on the basis that she caused or was liable for the death of Mr. Hagarty, that matter cannot be put aside entirely. Armed robberies have the potential to kill. They do cause terror. Those who participate in them, even in a lesser role, must realise that the courts are required to pass sentences which are not disproportionate to the gravity of the crime. In this case I accept that as part of the sentencing complex, proportionality requirements may be met by reducing a sentence from what it might otherwise have been by reason of the mitigatory factors I have referred to above and more importantly the prospects of achieving, by the rehabilitation of this prisoner, the avoidance of further crime. 
    43   There seems to be a real basis to believe, in this prisoner's case, that it will be in the best interests of society if she is permitted to be at liberty with her children under supervision for an extensive period of time. I take into account both on the minimum term and on the additional term the time in custody pending sentence and the periods in residential rehabilitation to which I have referred. She has either been in custody or in restrictive rehabilitation schemes for the greater part of the past two years comprising a period in actual custody of almost 12 months and a period in residential programmes. 
    44   There are plainly here special circumstances under s.5(2) of the Sentencing Act including the need for supervision during an extended period arising from her addiction, her comparatively young age, her children, her attempts at rehabilitation and obtaining education and employment. In the light of her dependent personality and earlier deprived circumstances, such a longer period of supervision would appear highly desirable.  
    45   Mandie Tanya Jancek, on the first charge, you are sentenced to penal servitude for four years. On the second charge, you are sentenced to penal servitude for six years. On the third charge, you are sentenced to penal servitude by way of a fixed term for two years. That fixed term is imposed having regard to the other sentences I am imposing, in respect of each of which I impose a minimum term of two years. I impose in respect of the first charge an additional term of two years; in respect of the second charge an additional term of four years. 
    46   Mandie Tanya Jancek the effect of those sentences is that you are sentenced to penal servitude for a total of six years. The sentences are to be served concurrently and are comprised as follows. There will be a minimum term of two years commencing today, 23 November 1999 which will expire on 22 November 2001 and an additional term thereafter of four years which, having commenced on 23 November 2001 will expire 22 November 2005. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 22 November 2001.

     REGINA v SCOTT ANTHONY GRIGGS 
      
       
      
       
     JUDGMENT 
      
     
      
       
      
    1    SPERLING J: The applicant stood trial before a judge and jury in the District Court on two charges, one of break, enter and steal and the other of receiving. On 9 February 1999 the trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the first charge. The jury convicted the applicant on the second charge. 
     
      
       
      
    2    On the same date, a sentencing hearing was held. The applicant was sentenced to two years penal servitude, consisting of a minimum term of 12 months commencing 9 February 1999 and an additional term of 12 months. 
     
      
       
      
    3    In July 1999, the applicant lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence with an application for extension of time.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The reasons given for the application for extension of time are that previous appeal applications were lost or not lodged and that there was a delay in obtaining materials from the Local Court. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The applicant has since filed a notice abandoning the appeal against conviction but wishes to proceed with an appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The charge of receiving related to a gold bracelet. The charge of break, enter and steal, on which the applicant was acquitted by direction, related to a larger quantity of jewellery including the bracelet. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The applicant's grounds of appeal were written by himself personally and he appeared at this hearing without legal representation. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""In relation to my notice of appeal, I do wish to proceed on the severity of my sentence on the grounds that my case should of been held in a Local Court rather than District, as at the time of my trial I was charged with break, enter and steal along with receiving stolen goods and the reason I believe it was moved up to District was because the goods from the break, enter and steal amounted to $40,000. Being over $15,000 means a District Court hearing, but because there was no evidence to convict me on break, enter and steal the charge was dropped in court, leaving the charge of receiving outstanding. But the only goods I received were one gold bracelet and one gold necklace amounting to no more than $3,000 meaning that they were under $15,000. So the case should have been referred back to Local Court unless I'm wrong. In any case this is my first custodial sentence and my last, and I believe for a charge of receiving I was dealt with quite harshly and I hope for a reduced sentence as an outcome of this appeal."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    9    It is necessary to consider only one aspect of the present proceedings. In that regard I quote from the written submissions of the Crown Advocate. 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The real complaint of the applicant, although not articulated in these terms, appears to be that the learned sentencing judge did not take into account when sentencing him the maximum penalty which would have been available had the matter nevertheless proceeded in the Local Court. Given that the applicant is unrepresented it seems appropriate that the merits of his claim should be examined. 
          
         Pursuant to s33K(2)(c) of the  
         Criminal Procedure Act 
         , the maximum penalty which would be applicable had this offence been heard in the Local Court is 12 months' imprisonment or a fine of 50 penalty units or both. It is clear that the learned sentencing judge was not referred to, and did not consider, this particular submission. The only reference to the matter was the learned sentencing judge's indication that the maximum penalty available for the offence was one of 10 years' imprisonment. 
          
         In  
         R v Crombie 
          [1999] NSWCCA 297 this Court said: 
          
          
         '...the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge, see  
         Dalton-Morgan 
         , Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 December 1989,  
         Jason Clyde Smith 
         , Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 September 1991, and  
         Shepherd 
          (1991) New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 162. 
          
         None of those decisions go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Moreover, where it appears that in the circumstance  
         (this factor) 
          has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal.' [At paras 15-16]  
         (Words added) 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         The Court then concluded: 
         
        
        
         
         'The appeal comes down to a single point, in my view, as to whether sufficient allowance was made for the circumstance identified, namely that the case could properly have been prosecuted in the Local Court, and also, the circumstance that the Crown Prosecutor conceded that to be so, but in the exercise of his discretion had decided to proceed with a lesser charge of supply in the District Court. If that circumstance is properly to be given weight in this case, particularly against the circumstance that the applicant, who had reached the age of thirty-nine, and was making some attempt to rehabilitate himself, was facing a first term of imprisonment, then it appears to me that the sentence has been shown to be manifestly excessive.' [At para 22]. 
          
          
         There appears to be no reason why the principle enunciated in  
         Crombie 
          should not apply here even though in the present case there was no scope for the prosecuting authority to make an election because the value of the goods in respect of the break, enter and steal offence exceeded $15,000. It is not clear what attitude would have been taken by the prosecuting authority had the receiving matter stood alone and it had been able to make an election. It must be conceded however that in all the circumstances it was well open to either the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide that the matter should proceed summarily. 
          
         Given that the learned sentencing judge did not take into account the fact that had the matter proceeded in the Local Court then the maximum penalty available would have been one tenth of that available in the District Court and in view of the fact that he imposed a sentence which was twice that which would have been available if it had been disposed of in the Local Court, then it is acknowledged, notwithstanding the matters raised in paragraph 3 of these submissions that the Court would be entitled to take the view that a different (and lesser) sentence was 'warranted in law'. It is of course recognised that it is a matter entirely for the Court to determine whether or not it ultimately comes to that view."" 
         
        
       
      
    10    It would be unfair to be critical of the trial judge, the point was not brought to his attention either by the crown prosecutor or counsel for the accused. Without such points being brought to attention, they are easily overlooked, as occurred in this case. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Justice requires that this Court should now intervene.  
     
      
       
      
    12    I take the view that a different sentence is warranted in law, having regard to the foregoing considerations and the obligation which now arises for this Court to consider afresh the sentence that should be imposed. Accordingly, the application for extension of time and for leave to appeal against sentence should be granted. The sentence should be set aside and the applicant should be resentenced by this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    13    The trial judge, in his remarks on sentence, reviewed the objective circumstances of the offence and subjective considerations bearing on penalty. I consider that his Honour's observation in those respects were comprehensive and correct with the sole exception that his Honour did not take into account the consideration which vitiates the result. With that exception, I adopt his Honour's remarks on sentence as my own. In addition, this Court has the applicant's statement in his submissions today concerning efforts which he has made while in prison to rehabilitate himself and to change his attitude in respect of his past course of criminal behaviour. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Having regard to these matters and the additional consideration to which I have referred, namely, the point which vitiates the result, I would sentence the applicant to penal servitude for a total period of one year and six months, consisting of a minimum term of ten months and an additional term of eight months. 
     
      
       
      
    15    I mention at this point that on 24 March 1999, at Hornsby Local Court, the applicant was sentenced for breach of a recognisance which was current at the time of committing the offence with which we are now concerned. The penalty imposed for that breach of recognisance was a fixed term of twelve months commencing from 9 February 1999, that being the date of commencement of the minimum term fixed by his Honour, the District Court judge. It is reasonable to assume that the learned magistrate before whom the matter came on 24 March 1999 would have been influenced by the circumstance that, as things stood at that time, the applicant would be in prison for a twelve months minimum term commencing 9 February 1999 and, accordingly, that no finer attention was given to the duration of the term fixed for breach of recognisance. Had the District Court sentence been for a lesser minimum term I do not doubt that the penalty for breach of recognisance would likewise have been for the lesser term. But for this complication the applicant would be entitled to be released from custody on 8 December 1999 pursuant to the orders which I propose for adoption by this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    16    It follows that, if the orders which I propose are adopted, there is special need for urgent action to be taken in relation to the sentence for breach of recognisance. I note that the Crown has taken an initiative which hopefully would lead to that result in the event that what I propose is what occurs. 
     
      
       
      
    17    I mention that, in proposing the division I do of the total term into a minimum and an additional term, I, like the trial judge, find special circumstances, having regard in particular to a continuing need for supervision and expertise in the rehabilitation of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    18    The orders that I propose are as follows:  
     
      
       
       1. Grant application for extension of time for leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       3. Appeal against sentence allowed and sentence set aside. 
        
        4. The applicant resentenced to a term of penal servitude of one year and six months consisting of a minimum term of ten months commencing on 9 February 1999 and expiring on 8 December 1999 and an additional term commencing on 9 December 1999 of 8 months, 8 December 1999 being the date on which the applicant is entitled to be released on parole in relation to that sentence. 
        
       5. The applicant is to subject himself to all directions that may be given by officers of the Probation and Parole Service, in particular with regard to any course of drug rehabilitation, including attendance at a residential rehabilitation course, and he is to subject himself to urinalysis. 
        
       6. The applicant is to pay compensation to Charles Doherty in the sum of $300. 
       
      
    19    SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed. 20    HULME J: Subject to three matters I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour's reasons. 
     
      
       
      
    21    The three matters are these; I would myself have left the minimum term at twelve months but in view of the opinion of my brothers I am content to agree with the ten months suggested. 
     
      
       
      
    22    Secondly, the applicant suggested that the penalty imposed on him was severe given that his offence was only possession of a bracelet known to have been stolen. 
     
      
       
      
    23    Prior to his conviction for the current offence he had been convicted of four previous offences of dishonesty and was on a recognisance at the time of commission of the subject offence. He was not to be again punished for his earlier offence but he should realise that persistence in actions of dishonesty is an approach which the courts will not entertain. I by no means regard the sentence which was imposed upon him, given the chances he had and ignored, as severe. 
     
      
       
      
    24    The third matter to which I would mention is this, the applicant also in his submissions suggested that there would be no need for him, given a degree of rehabilitation which he has embarked upon in gaol, to be subjected to further supervision on his release. 25    If that is so his is an unusual case because my experience of many other offenders is that they need far more assistance than the applicant can have had in the period which he has so far had in gaol. The terms which have been imposed concerning his parole are there for his benefit. He would be well advised to ensure he complies with them. 26    SULLY J: The orders of the Court will be therefore the orders proposed by Sperling J.

        REGINA v Lance McDERMOTT @ Lance MAXWELL 
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPERLING J: On 16 November 1994 the applicant was arrested for supplying a prohibited drug (being a $20 bag of cannabis) and was found to be in possession of a further two bags of that drug. A search warrant was executed. The applicant was then found to be in possession of a large quantity of motor vehicle parts which proved to represent approximately three quarters of a disassembled vehicle which had been stolen and which had a value, before being broken up, of $20,000 or thereabouts. The applicant had paid $2,500, or thereabouts, for the parts. He admitted that he knew that they had been stolen. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of receiving, for which a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude is prescribed by s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900. He was committed for sentence to the District Court. However, on 26 May 1995, he failed to appear. A pre-sentence report ordered earlier was never prepared because of his disappearance. A bench warrant was issued. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The applicant had in fact gone to the United States. There he was apprehended for trafficking in cocaine and served a sentence in South Carolina between September 1996 and April 1999. There was a relatively small amount of cocaine involved, 12 grams. Following that term of imprisonment, the applicant was held in a detention until he was deported to Australia. While in detention, the applicant notified the Australian Federal Police that he would be returning to Australia, that he wished to clear up outstanding matters, and that he had changed his name by deed poll some ten years earlier. On arrival in Australia, the applicant was apprehended by the Australian Federal Police. 
     
      
       
      
    4    On 19 July 1999, the applicant appeared before Ford DCJ for sentence. He asked that the offences of supplying a prohibited drug and being in possession of a prohibited drug (to which I have earlier referred) be taken into account. 
     
      
       
      
    5    His Honour imposed a sentence of penal servitude for one year and four months, consisting of a minimum term of twelve months and an additional term of four months. His Honour backdated the sentence to 7 April 1999, which marked the commencement of the applicant's period of detention, pending deportation, following his discharge from prison in the United States. The effect of the sentence was that, on becoming entitled to be released on parole, the applicant would have served some three and a half years continuously in prison and in detention. 
     
      
       
      
    6    His Honour noted the applicant's statement that conditions in prison in South Carolina were, in the applicant's terms, pretty tough (a statement which his Honour appears to have accepted). On the evidence, conditions in prison and in detention were harsh. His Honour described the applicant's record as not being a substantial criminal history. I note, however, that, although the applicant had not previously been sentenced to a term of full-time custody, the history included convictions for similar offences. 
     
      
       
      
    7    His Honour further noted that, having paid $2,500 for the motor vehicle parts, the applicant no doubt expected to realise a profit when he disposed of them. 
     
      
       
      
    8    His Honour further noted that the applicant stated he had had a long time to reflect on his position and had learnt his lesson. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal are: 
     
      
       
       (a) That his Honour failed to consider the principle of totality. 
        
       (b) That his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances. 
        
       (c) That the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    10    The offence of receiving stolen goods is a more serious offence than larceny, the maximum sentence for receiving being ten years and for larceny five years. It is the trafficking in stolen goods which makes larceny worthwhile and which thereby contributes substantially to the incidence of larceny. The seriousness of the offence has been recognised by the courts: Phillips (NSW CCA 11 December 1991, unreported); Daly (NSW CCA 14 July 1997, unreported). 
     
      
       
      
    11    The principle of totality applies. The principle is not restricted to offences which are part of the same activity: Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743. The aggregate of the sentences should reflect an appropriate penalty for the criminality involved, having regard to the consideration that the person concerned will be in custody continuously under the two sentences. This may require a sentence to be less than it would have been if considered alone: Holder (1993) 3 NSWLR 245 and Close (above). That is usually so. The principle is, however, more difficult to apply when little is known about the circumstances of the first offence, as in this case. Nonetheless, the principle operates and is a relevant consideration in the present case. 
     
      
       
      
    12    Special circumstances within the meaning of s 5 (2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 may exist where a court imposes a cumulative sentence. It may then be appropriate to structure the total sentence by increasing the additional term at the expense of the minimum term in order to provide an appropriate relationship between the total of the minimum term to be served and the effective additional term: Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 and Close (above). Such an adjustment is, however, not necessarily appropriate: Leon (NSW CCA, 30 November 1994, unreported). 
     
      
       
      
    13    It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that, because his Honour did not mention the topics, he should be taken to have overlooked the principle of totality and the need to consider whether there were special circumstances arising from accumulation. A failure to mention such matters may indicate a failure to consider them: Bo Too (NSW CCA, 16 July 1992, unreported); but not necessarily so, Close (above); Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289; Campbell (NSW CCA, 20 October 1999, unreported). In this case - as will appear - it is unnecessary to resolve that question, although I would doubt that an experienced judge, such as this trial judge, did overlook considerations so obviously relevant. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Affidavits by the applicant's solicitor and by the applicant and the documentary material annexed to them show that the applicant has made good progress in rehabilitating himself. Certificates from the prison demonstrate that he has participated enthusiastically in employment and rehabilitation programmes. The prospect of complete rehabilitation is promising in this case. 
     
      
       
      
    15    Appeals to this Court against sentence are governed by ss 5 and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Section 5 provides that such an appeal is by leave. Section 6 (3) provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""6(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    16    It is only if a different sentence is warranted that this Court has jurisdiction to interfere with a sentence. Otherwise, in terms of s 6(3), this Court is bound to dismiss the appeal; see Oastler (NSW CCA, 7 October 1992, unreported); Astill (No 2) (1994) 64 A Crim R 289; Cocking [1999] NSW CCA 311. 
     
      
       
      
    17    In the present case, the principle of totality, the cumulative nature of the two sentences and other subjective considerations which I have mentioned are to be put in the balance in favour of leniency. It is necessary, however, that the total sentence and the minimum term should be proportionate to the objective criminality involved. 
     
      
       
      
    18    I have considered the objective circumstances of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced by the District Court judge and the objective circumstances of the cocaine trafficking offence (so far as these are known). I have regard to the principle of totality. I would find special circumstances arising from the factor of accumulation which would justify but which do not mandate departure from the statutory relationship between the additional and the minimum terms. I have regard to the subjective considerations I have mentioned relative to the applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    19    Far from regarding the present sentence as excessive, I would not impose a lesser sentence on the applicant, either in relation to the total sentence or in relation to the minimum term, if the present sentence were set aside for error. A lesser sentence not being warranted, irrespective of whether there was error in the sentencing judge's reasons for the sentence he imposed, this Court is bound by s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    20    The orders I accordingly propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
       (1) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       (2) Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
        
       
      
    21    DUNFORD J: I agree. The orders of the Court will, therefore, be as proposed by Sperling J.

   IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSTUDDERT JThursday 25 November 1999 
     
      
    070031/99 REGINA v LMWJUDGMENT(On admissibility of evidence of Dr Wotton)1. HIS HONOUR: Counsel raised a matter concerning the admissibility of certain of the material covered in a report served by the Crown upon the defence. This was a report of Dr Wotton, psychiatrist, who assessed the accused on behalf of the Crown. In the course of that discussion the Crown indicated that endeavours would be made to obtain a supplementary report but, in any event, I indicated I would entertain an application for the doctor’s evidence, or those parts the subject of concern, to be taken first on the voir dire. That course was indeed followed yesterday and the doctor was examined and cross-examined in the absence of the jury at some length. Mr Zahra then called Dr Waters, a psychiatrist qualified in the case for the defence.  
     
      
    2. The focus of the objection taken to the evidence of Dr Wotton was the following: 
     
      
       
      (i) a passage of page 8 of his report: 
       
       
        
        “[LMW] now seemed to have dropped his guard, and was quite enthusiastic when I asked him what sort of music he liked. He told me excitedly that he liked ‘Two Pack - he died 2 years ago!’ I asked [LMW] how this had happened. He told me importantly: ‘He died in a drive-by shooting. It was a gang killing. He bashed the hell out of another gang dude.’ I asked [LMW] how he had come by this information, and he told me that his sister had told him. He added ‘Me Mum’s boyfriend said about Two Pack: “He’s shit and he’s dead!”’” 
        
       
       
      (ii) a passage on page 10 under the head “Spontaneous play”: 
       
       
        
        “The two figures that [LMW] had chosen to play with were both fighting-action type figures. One was a figure from ‘Star Wars’, the other was a heavily-muscled warrior. [LMW] told me that one of the figures was ‘Predator’. I professed ignorance about this. [LMW] told me: ‘He’s invisible - he goes around killing everyone.’ He engaged the two figures in a fight, looked pleased as he did so. I asked what he liked about Predator. [LMW] told me: ‘I like the way he killed him. The dude was laughing and then they had ten seconds to get away and then the bomb went off!’ 
        
       
       
        
        [LMW] continued engaging the two figures in a fight. I asked him which one would he choose to be. He told me (pointing to ‘Predator’): ‘This dude. He can never be killed - he’s invisible.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [LMW] was staring at the figures, and seemed to have some realisation of what he was saying. He suddenly dropped the figures back into the box. I asked him if what he had been playing had reminded him of something. [LMW] told me ‘I just put it away.’” 
        
       
       
      (iii) a passage on page 13: 
       
       
        
        “This shows a large tiger springing into mid-air towards its intended prey - a monkey. [LMW] said in a sing-song way: ‘He’s goin to get a monkey to eat…he’s hungry.’ I asked how the tiger would be feeling. [LMW] told me: ‘Hungry!’ I asked about the monkey. [LMW] put on a funny voice: ‘What you doin’ man? You gonna eat me?’ I asked how the monkey would be feeling. [LMW] told me: ‘Sad - because he will die.’” 
        
       
       
      (iv) a further passage on page 13: 
       
       
        
        “This picture shows two adult bears asleep in a cave, with a younger bear at the mouth of the cave, awake. [LMW] said: ‘Bears in the cave asleep.’ I asked if he could see anything else. [LMW] looked again, telling me that: ‘There’s a baby lying with its eyes open.’ I asked what it might be able to see. [LMW] told me that: ‘It might be looking at an animal or a human.’ I asked why a human would be coming towards the cave. [LMW] told me: ‘For a bear skin.’ I asked if this meant the bear would be killed. [LMW] said cautiously: ‘Probably.’” 
        
       
      
    3. Each of these passages records events in the course of the doctor’s assessment that had been prompted by measures taken by the doctor in an endeavour to draw the accused out. 
     
      
    4. The first passage appeared in the context of the doctor having asked the accused about his sister and he told the doctor that the sister let him borrow her songs on CD and tape. The second passage followed upon the child reaching into a play box which the doctor had available and selecting the two figures from Star Wars. The third and fourth passages appeared in the context of the doctor having provided for the child a series of cards used in what the doctor described as a standard projective test administered to children. 
     
      
    5. As opposed to the tests conducted on behalf of the defence by Dr Langeluddecke and commented upon by Dr Waters, what is recorded in the passages above set out relates essentially to subjective responses. Dr Waters was critical of the usefulness of these procedures as compared with what he said in effect were the generally accepted and reliable objective tests that Dr Langeluddecke had carried out. However the criticisms by Dr Waters of the probative value of the responses recorded by Dr Wotton would not, in my view, alone warrant the exclusion of the evidence contained in the passages, assuming such evidence was otherwise relevant and probative. It seems to me that any question of a disagreement between Dr Wotton and Dr Waters as to the usefulness of testing could ordinarily be left for a jury to determine.  
     
      
    6. However, yesterday, having considered the evidence and the submissions of counsel, I determined that the evidence in the above passages and any opinion evidence that might otherwise be based upon it should be excluded and I now state my reasons for the conclusion I reached. 
     
      
    7. The objections taken to the evidence warranted careful consideration of the relevance of the evidence, and assuming its relevance, its probative value, but on the other hand, assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused in the event of its admission. 
     
      
    8. In the course of questioning yesterday, Dr Wotton gave the following answer to the following question directed to the significance of the matters reported upon in passages (i) to (iv): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do I understand then from the responses you have just given to counsel, that those various tests which you conducted, and the responses that he gave, did not tell you anything about this issue of doli incapax? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not really, no.” 
        
       
      
    9. Further, in his evidence on the voir dire, Dr Wotton said that the evidence in passage (i) did not assist him in forming any opinion as to whether or not the accused’s behaviour indicated some understanding of life and death. In these circumstances no basis of relevance was established for the introduction of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused is self-evident from the narrative of the accused’s behaviour and comments. Hence, in my opinion, s 137 of the Evidence Act required the exclusion of evidence concerning passage (i). 
     
      
    10. As to each of the remaining three passages, Dr Wotton was of the opinion that they indicated some understanding in the accused of the meaning of life and death. To prove such an understanding would be relevant for the jury’s consideration in the context of determining whether the accused was aware that what he was doing was seriously wrong. On that issue, of course, the Crown has the onus of proof and evidence going to establish this element in the Crown case is plainly admissible. 
     
      
    11. The difficulty, however, with the evidence is that the responses which Dr Wotton recorded were all made some nineteen months or more after the event. In that period not only had the accused grown older but much more importantly he had undergone very unhappy experiences resulting from the death of the deceased. He had experienced threats from those who obviously believed he was responsible for what had occurred, he had undergone the ordeal of proceedings in the Children’s Court and he had been subject to much attention by the media. My attention was drawn to this on the earlier application for a permanent stay of proceedings. 
     
      
    12. In the light of events since 2 March 1998 and by reason of them, the accused could well have developed an understanding of life and death such as the responses observed by Dr Wotton indicated. It does not follow however that such an understanding was present on 2 March 1998. The Crown looks to other evidence to prove such understanding at the time that the deceased died. That evidence concerns the observed behaviour of the accused at the relevant time. 
     
      
    13. The responses recorded in the passages the subject of objection do not afford any basis for assessment of the cognitive ability of the accused. Those responses and the opinion which the doctor formed on the basis of them that there was indicated some understanding of life and death do not undermine or go to the objective findings made by Dr Langeluddecke. 
     
      
    14. It seems to me that the introduction of the evidence referred to in the three remaining passages and the opinion evidence which Dr Wotton would have been asked to give involved the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. It involved attention to the accused’s reactions to death in a variety of circumstances. In my opinion the probative value of evidence based on the passages would be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In these circumstances s 137 of the Evidence Act was enlivened and required the exclusion of this evidence. Hence I so ruled.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60444/98 DUNFORD J SPERLING J WEDNESDAY, 24 NOVEMBER 1999 
     
     R v Kevin CARTER 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is an application brought by Kevin Carter for leave to appeal against the sentence of penal servitude for a minimum term of 2 years with an additional term of 2 years, imposed on him by his Honour Judge Twigg QC in the District Court at Sydney on 7 August 1998, following his plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in company contrary to s 97, Crimes Act 1900, which offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. 
    2    The facts as found by his Honour were as follows. In the early hours of the morning of 14 February 1996 the victim was assaulted and robbed of $150 cash in a park in Hay, by three young men, one of whom was the applicant. The victim was subsequently admitted to hospital with numerous facial cuts requiring stitches, with extensive facial bruising and with bruising and soreness to his torso.  
    3    The victim was on his way from Perth to Queensland and was forced to stay in Hay because of mechanical difficulties with his car. He was drinking at the Commercial Hotel there and later accompanied some young men, including one of the co-offenders, Simon Haigh, the applicant and some girls to a house apparently belonging to the applicant in Hay. There they all, including the victim, consumed alcohol and the victim himself indicated that he drank ten Bourbon and Cokes. In due course the victim left the house accompanied by two of the girls. In Hay Park the two girls left him and he was assaulted and robbed. 
    4    The applicant punched the victim with his closed fist in the face. He hit him about eight times and demanded money. The victim threw his wallet containing $150 cash at the prisoner, and the three males including the prisoner and the co-offenders, Simon Haigh and Frederick Johns, assaulted the victim, punching him and kicking him in the ribs whilst he was on the ground. 
    5    That assault and robbery was all done pursuant to a plan made at the applicant's house by the applicant and his co-offenders, whereby one of the girls would lead the victim into the park, and the other males would assault and rob him. In a recorded interview on 16 February 1996 at Hay Police Station the applicant admitted the plan and that he punched the victim in the mouth and again on the nose, but claimed that the victim begged him to take his money. The applicant said both the co-offenders assaulted the victim by pulling his hair and punching him and claimed that the amount taken was only $70, of which he received $10. 
    6    His Honour correctly described the offence as ""a serious assault on a defenceless victim"" and noted that he had been set up by three males pursuant to a plan to rob him. The offence was committed late at night and the victim sustained serious injuries requiring stitches and treatment. 
    7    The applicant was born on 27 March 1976 and was aged almost 20 at the time of the offence. He is now aged 23½ years. He is single but has a 3 year old daughter who lives with her mother in Melbourne. The child has suffered from a brain tumour and the applicant visits her regularly. He has generally lived in Hay with his parents or on properties in that area where he has been working. He has for a number of years had an estranged relationship with his father, but shortly before sentencing the relationship had improved to a degree. He left school in Year 7 and when employed he has engaged in farm or seasonal work, but there have been significant periods of unemployment. 
    8    Some of the adjournments to which I will shortly refer were to enable him to obtain, or to demonstrate an ability to maintain, employment. At the time of sentencing he had been working as a timber cutter for some three months and it appeared that his employer was prepared to continue to employ him. 
    9    He had a history of alcohol abuse and use of illegal drugs, particularly cannabis, and was affected by both on the night of the offence. It appears that he had made some effort to curb this substance abuse but he was still inclined to binge drink about once a month. 
    10    He had a number of previous convictions going back to 1992 for offences such as dishonesty, larceny, make and use false instruments, break enter and steal. On 11 May 1994 at the Hay Local Court he had been sentenced to perform 40 hours community service for break, enter and steal and enter land with intent. On 18 August 1994, in the same Court he had been placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 18 months on charges of break enter and steal and attempt to break enter and steal. He was brought back before the Court for breach of this recognizance relating to supervision and non payment of compensation on 24 August 1995 when the recognizance was renewed for a further period of 12 months. Consequently, this recognizance was current at the time of the instant offence.  
    11    Then, on 7 August 1995, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 4 months imprisonment on a number of charges; namely escape police custody, two counts of larceny, three counts of make false instrument, eight counts of use a false instrument and goods in custody. He had completed that sentence prior to the commission of the offence. After the commission of this offence but before he was sentenced, he had further convictions in the Hay Local Court; on 19 June 1996, for low range prescribed concentration of alcohol, on 8 April 1997, for four counts of make false instrument, four counts of use false instrument and stealing, and on 15 June 1997, for malicious damage. 
    12    Two grounds of appeal were argued on the applicant's behalf. It is convenient if I take them in reverse order, and so I deal firstly with the submission that his Honour imposed a sentence which demonstrated erroneous disparity with the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, Simon Haigh. I interpose that the other alleged co-offender, Frederick Johns, had not been apprehended or dealt with at the time the applicant was sentenced. 
    13    Simon Haigh pleaded guilty in the Local Court, was committed for sentence and dealt with by his Honour Judge Nash in the District Court at Deniliquin on 7 November 1996. His circumstances were very different to those of the applicant. The sentencing judge on that occasion found that Haigh was not involved in the planning of the offence and did not initiate the attack on the victim, and that he was not the person who actually took the money from the victim, although he was involved in the vicious physical assault whilst he was on the ground and he did share in the proceeds. Moreover, although Haigh had a previous record, it was much less than the applicant's; his only convictions being for stealing, which charge had been dismissed pursuant to s 565A of the Crimes Act, and a drink driving conviction. He pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, whereas the applicant, having been arrested on 16 February 1996, did not plead guilty at committal in December 1996 and only did so when arraigned on 25 March 1997 in the Hay District Court. Haigh promptly offered to give evidence against the co-offenders and did in fact give evidence against this applicant at the committal. Judge Nash sentenced Haigh to 400 hours community service, and it is submitted that the applicant's sentence was disproportionate to that and such as to lead to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part, having regard to the principles laid down in Lowe v The Queen (1994) 154 CLR 586 and other cases.  
    14    Having regard to the significant differences to which I have drawn attention in relation to their respective degrees of involvement in the planning and commission of the offence, their prior records, Haigh's offer to give, and actually giving, evidence in the committal, and his much earlier plea of guilty, I am not satisfied that there is such a discrepancy as should give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance and this ground is not made out. 
    15    The other ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in not taking into account ""the inordinate delay"" between the entry of the plea of guilty and the imposition of the sentence. To put this ground in context it is necessary to refer to the history of the matter. The offence was committed on the night of 13/14 February 1996 and the applicant was arrested and charged on 16 February, and released on bail. On 5 September 1996 he was arrested on other matters and refused bail but again released on bail on 2 October 1996. The committal hearing was heard on 5 December 1996 and he was committed for trial. He was arraigned at Hay District Court on 25 March 1997, and pleaded guilty. The facts were tendered and the applicant gave evidence. The matter was then adjourned until later that week, so that witnesses could be called on the applicant's behalf. On 27 March, further evidence on behalf of the applicant was called including an affidavit tendered by the applicant offering to co-operate with police in relation to one of the females allegedly involved. The matter was stood over so that the police in charge could consider the offer to co-operate. On that occasion the applicant's solicitor indicated that he would be seeking a Griffiths remand but his Honour indicated that he considered it a matter for a full time custodial sentence, and although he was prepared to grant an adjournment, he would not impose terms which might indicate that he was contemplating a Griffiths remand. It was adjourned to the end of the year at Wagga Wagga, but was ultimately re-listed at Albury in November 1997. 
    16    On 17 November 1997, Detective Semple gave evidence concerning the offer that had been made by the applicant to assist police. His evidence was to the effect that there had been no attempt by the applicant to assist in ascertaining the whereabouts of the co-offender Johns until that morning, and in the meantime the police had received information the previous week of the latter's whereabouts from another source, and that in relation to the offer to give evidence against one of the females involved, that evidence was not regarded as useful as it was not corroborated by the victim. The matter was adjourned, primarily it would seem, on the application of the applicant so that he could complete the order for community service that he had been given some 3½ years earlier in May of 1994, and in respect of which there was still 14½ hours outstanding. Mr Button on behalf of the applicant submitted that all the applicant's solicitor was seeking was an adjournment to the end of that week so that this could be completed, but in the meantime the applicant had been charged with assault which was to be heard on 1 December in the Local Court and not unnaturally his Honour felt it desirable to await the outcome of that case before proceeding to sentence him. 
    17    The matter was accordingly adjourned until 6 March 1998 at Albury. On this occasion, further evidence was given on behalf of the applicant but he was not at that time in employment and the matter was adjourned so that he could adduce further evidence to show his bona fides and his ability to find and hold a job. It was adjourned to 17 June 1998 at Dubbo. On that occasion an up-to-date Pre-Sentence Report which the applicant's solicitor wanted was not available and the applicant sought an adjournment so that such updated report could be obtained. The Crown opposed the adjournment, as it had in March 1998, but it was granted. Later that day an inadequate Pre-Sentence Report was received. The matter was adjourned to 7 August 1998 at Sydney, on which occasion the applicant was sentenced. 
    18    It follows that from plea to sentence a period of 16½ months elapsed. No reliance is placed on the delay from arrest to sentence which was nearly 2 years and 6 months. During the whole of that period the applicant was on bail except for one month (September / October 1996), when bail was refused, apparently in relation to other matters. All adjournments were either at the request of the applicant's solicitor to call additional evidence, to enable him to complete community service or to demonstrate his ability to hold employment and obtain further Pre-Sentence Reports so that such reports would be more favourable, whilst that of 27 March 1997 was to ascertain the views of the police as to his offer to give evidence against a possible co-offender. There were other issues raised at times such as the unavailability of updated Pre-Sentence Reports and matters of that nature, and on one occasion the exhibits were lost for some time but then found, but overall, it can fairly be said that all the adjournments were to aid the applicant's case on sentence and to enable him to present himself in a better light to the sentencing judge.  
    19    We were referred to the well known and often quoted passage from R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 where Street CJ said that: 
     
      
       
       "" ... where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - ""  
       
      
      
     and that, 
      
       
       "" ... at times these considerations can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner."" 
       
      
     
     
      
     To the same effect are passages in 
       
     Mill v The Queen 
      (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64 to 66 and  
     R v Harrison 
      (1990) 48 A Crim R 197, but they were cases where the delay was due to the prisoner being sentenced in another state for similar offences.  
      
    20    On the other hand, it was pointed out in R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297 at 300 that Todd has not been viewed as an authority for the proposition that whenever there is a stale offence or substantial delay leniency should necessarily be extended. In R v King (unreported - CCA - 24 February 1998), the principle of Todd was held to be not applicable in relation to the sentencing for murder at a time when there could be no uncertainty as to the sentence the prisoner would receive if found guilty because of the provisions of s 19 of the Crimes Act as it then stood. 
    21    The subject was further considered in R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121 at [16] where Wood CJ at CL said:  
     
      
       
       ""The reason why delay is to be taken into account in sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which the person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach."" 
       
      
      
    22    That was not a case where the applicant had been arrested and spent a long time awaiting sentence, nor was it a case where he had shown any commitment to rehabilitation, but was a case where there had been an inordinate delay of 4½ years between the time of the commission of the offence to the time he was charged.  
    23    Finally, in R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267, the offence (wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm) had been committed on 4 October 1995, and the sentencing proceedings had commenced on 20 February 1998. There were a number of delays, partly due to the unavailability of the applicant's counsel on one day and an application by the applicant to withdraw his plea of guilty. The sentence was imposed on 11 September 1998. Simpson J said at [21]:  
     
      
       
       ""The delay between the commencement and sentencing is therefore somewhat unusual. While the principles stated in  
       Todd 
        do not purport to vary according to the proper allocation of responsibility for the delay, it is more difficult for an applicant who properly bears that responsibility to call them in aid."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    24    In that case the Court considered there was merit in the ground when taken in conjunction with other grounds, but it may not have been sufficient by itself. 
    25    In the present case, the applicant's rehabilitation in the meantime was taken into account by the sentencing judge, and he was not left in any suspense because his Honour made it clear from the first day that he was contemplating a full time custodial sentence and the applicant should not expect anything less notwithstanding the various adjournments. That only leaves the third relevant factor; namely, the need for understanding and flexibility. Unlike Blanco, there was no delay in the arrest, the delay was not nearly as substantial as in Todd, Mill, V or King and, as the applicant bears the substantial responsibility for the delay, it is more difficult for him to call in aid the principle in Todd. As he enjoyed the benefit of the delay by being able to demonstrate a significant degree of rehabilitation in the meantime and received credit for such rehabilitation, I am not satisfied that he was in the circumstances of this case entitled to any further credit on account of the delay itself, and this ground is not made out. 
    26    The sentence in my view is well within the guidelines laid down in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [162]-[165]. That was a case of armed robbery, whereas this is a case of robbery in company, but both offences arise under the same section and carry the same maximum penalty. There are variations from the criteria set out in that guideline judgment but, some of those variations are favourable to the applicant and some are unfavourable, and they balance each other out. 
    27    In my view, the sentence was within the permissible range. I would therefore, grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentence. 
    28    SPERLING J: I agree. 
    29    DUNFORD J: The order will be as I have indicated.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    HIS HONOUR: By summons dated 25 May 1999 the plaintiffs, Pasquale Barbaro, Guiseppe Barbaro and Franceco Catanzariti sought orders against the Director of Public Prosecutions that two warrants issued under the Listening Devices Act, 1984 (the Act) were void and, in the alternative, that the evidence obtained pursuant to each of such warrants was inadmissible in criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs currently pending in the Local Court at Griffith. The warrants in question were styled ST 97/263(b) and ST 97/286(a) and were dated 24 November 1997 and 15 December 1997 respectively. 
     
      
    2    On 23 August 1999 the plaintiffs filed an Amended Summons in which relief identical to that sought in the original summons was claimed but in which the Commissioner of Police was joined as an additional defendant. When the matter was called on for hearing the plaintiffs sought to file a Further Amended Summons and to discontinue the proceedings as against the Director of Public Prosecutions. This was consented to, subject to later argument as to certain costs. 
     
      
    3    The Further Amended Summons claimed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. A declaration that the warrant styled ST 97/286(a) and issued by Dowd J on 15 December 1997 is void. 
        
       
       
        
        2. An Order quashing warrant styled ST 97/286(a). 
        
       
       
        
        3. A declaration that the use of a listening device by Michael Nanai on or after 15 December 1997 was not authorised by warrant styled ST 97/286(a), a warrant issued by Dowd J on 15 December 1997."" 
        
       
       
      and other consequential relief. 
       
      
    4    During the course of argument senior counsel for the plaintiffs by way of alternative relief sought a declaration that warrant ST 97/286(a) did not authorise the use of a listening device at any time after 15 December 1997. The warrant, the subject of the proceedings, was obtained for the purposes of gathering evidence against the plaintiffs each of whom stands charged with an offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that between 2 November 1997 and 21 December 1997 they did an act to pervert the course of justice. Guiseppe Barbaro also stands charged with an offence under s 323(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, namely influencing a witness on or about 13 December 1997. 
     
      
      THE FACTS 
       
      
    5    On 15 December 1997 warrant ST 97/286(a) was issued by Dowd J on an application made by Detective Senior Constable Jobson on behalf of Detective Senior Constable Littame. The warrant was in the following form:

         The Honourable Justice DOWD"" 
        
       
      
    6    Later on the same day Sergeant O'Hearn of the Special Technical Investigations Branch of the New South Wales Police Service fitted two listening devices (the devices) to Michael Nanai (Nanai) at the Griffith Detective Office. One of the devices was a transmitter, the other a recorder. Later on that evening Sergeant O'Hearn operated the devices and they were used to transmit, listen to and record a private conversation between Nanai and another person. Later on the same evening the devices were removed from Nanai by Sergeant O'Hearn. 
     
      
    7    At about 5.45pm on 19 December 1997 Senior Constable Kerman, also of the Special Investigation Branch of the New South Wales Police Service, fitted two devices to Nanai at the Griffith Detective Office, one a transmitter, the other a tape recorder. Shortly thereafter he activated both devices and they were later used to transmit, listen to and record private conversations. Later that same evening Senior Constable Kerman removed the devices from Nanai. 
     
      
    8    At about 5.30pm on 20 December 1997 Senior Constable Stylianou, another officer of the Special Technical Investigation Branch of the New South Wales Police Service, fitted two devices to Nanai at the Detectives Office at Griffith police station. Again, one of the devices was a transmitter, the other was a tape recorder. The devices were activated by Senior Constable Stylianou shortly after 6.30pm and de-activated by him shortly after 8pm. They were re-activated by him shortly before 10.45pm and then used to transmit, listen to and record a private conversation. A littler later Senior Constable Stylianou de-activated the devices and they were removed from Nanai by him. 
     
      
    9    The police wish to use the evidentiary material gathered in the manner set out above in the prosecution of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs resist this on what ultimately became two bases, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That Nanai used the devices although not authorised to do so by warrant ST 97/286(a) of 15 December 1997 because Nanai was not named in the warrant as an authorised user of the devices. 
         
         
        2. The use of the devices by Nanai was outside the terms of the relevant warrant since no period was specified in the warrant during which it was to remain in force. 
        
       
      THE LEGISLATION 
       
      
    10    The Act imposes a prohibition on a person using a listening device to record or listen to a private conversation (s 5(1)). This is subject to certain exceptions, the relevant one being that set out in s 5(2) of the Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(2) Sub-section (1) does not apply to: 
         
         
         
        (a) the use of a listening device pursuant to a warrant granted under Pt 4."" 
        
       
      
    11    A listening device is defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any instrument, apparatus, equipment or device capable of being used to record or listen to a private conversation simultaneously with it taking place."" (s 3) 
        
       
      
    12    Part 4 (ss 15-21) of the Act deals with warrants. Section 16 provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) Upon application made by a person that the person suspects or believes: 
         
         
         
        (a) that a prescribed offence has been or is about to be or is likely to be committed, and 
         
         
         
        (b) that for the purpose of an investigation into that offence or of enabling evidence to be obtained of the commission of the offence or the identity of the offender, the use of a listening device is necessary,  
         
         
        an eligible Judge may, if satisfied there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion or belief, authorise by warrant, the use of the listening device."" 
        
       
      
    13    Section 16(2) specifies five criteria to which the eligible Judge shall have regard in determining whether a warrant should be granted. Provision is then made in s 16(3) in relation to the authorisation of entry onto premises for the purposes of installing and retrieving a listening device. 
     
      
    14    Section 16(4) prescribes those matters which are to be specified in the warrant: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall specify: 
         
         
         
        (a) the prescribed offence in respect of which the warrant is granted, 
         
         
         
        (b) where practical the name of any person whose private conversation may be recorded or listened to by the use of a listening device pursuant to the warrant,  
         
         
         
        (c) the period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the warrant is in force, 
         
         
         
        (d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf of that person,  
         
         
         
        (e) where practicable, the premises on which a listening device is to be installed, or the place at which a listening device is to be used, pursuant to the warrant, 
         
         
         
        (f) any conditions subject to which premises may be entered or a listening device may be used pursuant to the warrant, and  
         
         
         
        (g) the time within which the person authorised to use the listening device pursuant to the warrant is required to report pursuant to s 19 to an eligible Judge and the Attorney General."" 
        
       
      
    15    Whilst no form of warrant is prescribed, s 16(6A) provides that a warrant may be in or to the effect of the form set out in Schedule 2. 
     
      
       
      RELIEF SOUGHT 
       
      
    16    A warrant under the Act is issued under the hand of an eligible Judge (s 16(1)). An eligible Judge is one who has consented to be nominated by the Attorney General under s 3A(3) of the Act as an eligible Judge. Such a person has, in relation to any function conferred by the Act, the same protection and immunity as a judge of the Supreme Court has in relation to proceedings in the Supreme Court (s 3A(4)). Thus the person who issues a warrant under the Act does so as a designated person authorised as such to do so. 
     
      
    17    This statutory regime and the very nature of the warrant mark out its issue as different from an exercise of conventional judicial power. This was recognised in Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 100 per McHugh J where it was said that the issue of a warrant under the Victorian equivalent Act was far removed from the exercise of the judicial power of the Supreme Court and an administrative not a judicial act. Once so classified the person affected by the warrant may seek judicial review of it and have it declared void or set aside. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    18    The relief sought by the plaintiffs in the Further Amended Summons and in the course of argument is therefore within jurisdiction and properly framed. 
     
      
       
      CONSTRUCTION OF THE ACT 
       
      
    19    The right to integrity of property is axiomatic in our law. The claim to privacy of conversations is of more recent origin and recognition (see for example Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 141). The Act authorises intrusion into private property and permits an impingement on the privacy of the conversations of particular individuals. 
     
      
    20    A statute which has such an effect should be strictly construed (Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 141; Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Limited [1980] AC 952 at 997, 1008, 1017; Haynes v Attorney General (NSW), Supreme Court of NSW (unreported, 9 February 1996, James J)). However, it is important to bear in mind that ""a practical rather than an unduly technical view of challenges to warrants permitting intrusion into the property and privacy of those the subject of them"" should be taken (Ousley v The Queen, supra, at 141 per Kirby J), and that courts should ""not be over zealous to search for ambiguities or obscurities in words which on the face of them are plain"" (Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster, supra, at 1008). 
     
      
    21    It behoves those who wish to rely on warrants that permit intrusion into private property or impingement on private conversations to exercise a high degree of care in the preparation of the warrants they seek, so that on or from their faces they correctly and clearly specify those matters required by the relevant legislation. 
     
      
      ATTACKS ON THE WARRANT 
       
      
    22    The first provision of the Act relied on by the plaintiffs in their attack on the warrant is s 16(4)(d). It provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(4) A warrant granted by an eligible Judge under this section shall specify 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (d) the name of any person who may use a listening device pursuant to the warrant and the persons who may use the device on behalf of that person."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    23    The word ""shall"" should be given its ordinary mandatory or obligatory meaning, that is, it is the equivalent of ""must"". The section is in a form almost identical to s 4A(c) of the Listening Devices Act 1969 (Vic), in which the word ""must"" is used instead of the word ""shall"". The effect of the two words in the corresponding sections is however in my opinion the same. 
     
      
    24    Senior counsel for the plaintiffs argued that unless the warrant in the present case expressly stated on its face that Nanai was either the user or a person who may use the device on behalf of the user of the device, the requirements of s 16(4)(d) of the Act were not complied with. He argued that the warrant had to include Nanai's name in the list of persons that follows the words ""and on her behalf"" in par 2 of the warrant, if Nanai was to be authorised to use the devices. 
     
      
    25    Even if it be assumed that merely being the carrier of the devices, as Nanai was, constitutes use of such devices, in my opinion the warrant as issued was not in breach of s16(4)(d). If having the devices attached to his person for the purposes of recording or listening to certain private conversations constitutes use of the devices, then par 2 of the warrant makes it clear that Nanai was to use the devices. Not only is his name specified in the warrant but the actual nature of the activity to be undertaken by him, which on the assumption made above constitutes use, is also specified. 
     
      
    26    This is to be contrasted with the situation of those police officers whose names are referred to in the long list of names set out in par 2 of the warrant. Whether such officers would be activating, adjusting or monitoring the output from the listening device and tape recorder in question is not specified in the warrant, nor need it be. 
     
      
    27    The warrant in my opinion not only specifies Nanai's name but also specifies the nature of the role he is to undertake in elation to the devices. That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the first argument advanced by the plaintiffs in the attack upon the warrant. However, in my opinion, the attack upon the warrant based upon s 16(4)(d) fails for an additional reason, namely that Nanai did not within the meaning of that sub-section use the devices. 
     
      
    28    The word ""use"" is not defined in the statute. It must therefore bear its ordinary English meaning in the context in which it occurs. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that a number of steps were involved in gathering evidentiary material by means of a listening device. These were placement, activation, operation and consequent recording of private conversations. Senior counsel for the plaintiffs contended that each of these steps involved its ""use"" within the meaning of s 16(4)(d) as did its servicing, that is adjusting and ensuring that it operated effectively. 
     
      
    29    In s 16(4)(d) the word ""use"" is a verb. As a verb its ordinary meaning is to cause to act, put into operation, serve for a purpose or put to some purpose. The purpose to which the listening devices were to be put or which they were to serve was to record or listen to certain private conversations simultaneously with their taking place. Their use involved them being put into operation, that is their activation and the recording by them of a conversation or conversations. Before activation and recording occurred, a placement of the devices in particular premises, place or places, or on a particular person is required. However, the premises or places in which a listening device is installed are not part of its use, rather they are the circumstances in which the use is to take place. 
     
      
    30    The terms of s 16(4)(e), which speak of the premises ""on which"" and the place ""at which"" a device ""is to be used"", make a distinction between the premises and place on the one hand and the use of the device on the other. 
     
      
    31    I see no distinction in principle between premises, a place and a person in this regard. The premises or place is where the device is to be used. Each is the depository for the device. So too may a person be. In such a case he or she is where or on whom the device is installed, that is the depository for the device, the place or situation at or in which the device is to be used. That the person is capable of movement is not to the point. A car in which a listening device may be fitted is also movable, but the car in question does not use the device. 
     
      
    32    Nanai did not fit the devices to himself nor did he activate the devices, nor did he operate them. All of these things were done by police officers whose names were included as persons who may use the device on behalf of Constable Littame. Likewise Nanai did not record the conversations in which he took part nor did he cause them to be recorded on the tape recorder affixed to him or listened to or recorded at the listening post to which the transmitter was directed. In relation to the devices he was a mere carrier and in the circumstances I am of the opinion that this does not constitute use by him of the devices within the meaning of s 16(4)(d) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      AS TO SECTION 16(4)(c) 
       
      
    33    The second ground on which the plaintiffs seek to avoid the warrant styled ST 97/286(a) is that no period was specified in it during which it was to remain in force. This attack is based upon s 16(4)(c) of the Act: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(c) The period (being a period not exceeding 21 days) during which the warrant is in force."" 
        
       
      
    34    For present purposes the critical word in s 16(4)(c) is ""period"". The ordinary meaning of ""period"" connotes an interval of time. In order to determine what that interval is, it is necessary to know the event or circumstance which constitutes the beginning and the event or circumstance which constitutes the end. The interval between the two is properly described as a period. It is this which must be specified in the warrant. 
     
      
    35    That such a meaning was intended by the Legislature is to some extent supported by the provisions of Schedule 2 to the Act. Although the form set out in that schedule does not have to be used, the Act provides that a warrant under s 16 may be in or to the effect of the form set out in the schedule. That form provides for a number of matters including the period during which the warrant is to be in force and the period within which a report is to be made pursuant to s 19 of the Act to the Attorney General and to an eligible Judge. The relevant parts of the form of warrant set out in Schedule 2 of the Act are: 
     
      
       
        
        ""6. Fix the period ___ am on _________ 19__ until __ pm on 19__ (or as the case may be) as the period during which this warrant is to be in force. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Fix (period after event) as the period within which the person authorised to use the listening device pursuant to this warrant is required to report pursuant to s 19 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 to an eligible Judge and to the Attorney General."" 
        
       
      
    36    The period that the warrant is to remain in force is relevant not merely to the provisions of s 5(2)(a) of the Act, which permits the recording of private conversations in specified circumstances, but also to the reporting provisions in s 19 of the Act. In the instant case the time for reporting under s 19 of the Act was fixed as ""the period of 28 days after the expiry of this warrant."" 
     
      
    37    It was argued on behalf of the defendant that the date 4 January 1997 was clearly an error and was undoubtedly intended to be 4 January 1998. No argument to the contrary was advanced by senior counsel for the plaintiffs, indeed in the course of his submissions he conceded that the typing of the year 1997 ""was probably intended to read 1998"". Thus it is common ground that there was an error on the part of the person preparing the warrant and an oversight on the part of the designated person, that is the eligible Judge, who granted it. According to the argument of counsel for the defendant, his intention must have been to have the warrant cease to be in force on 4 January, 1998. 
     
      
    38    In this context it is relevant to recall what was said by Kirby J in Ousley v The Queen (supra at 144): 
     
      
       
        
        ""...the approach of strictness requires, for the protection of the fundamental rights involved, that a court should not be overly astute to sustain a warrant which, on its face, reveals relevant defects...But when a real defect can be demonstrated, courts err, rightly in my view, on the side defensive of the fundamental rights of the individual affected."" 
        
       
      
    39    However, senior counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted, correctly in my opinion, that the intention of the eligible Judge who issued the warrant is not relevant. He further submitted that the warrant must be good on its face in order to be valid. 
     
      
    40    Counsel for the defendant sought to meet this attack on the warrant by submitting that the words and figures ""until 4.30pm on 4 January 1997"" in par 3 of the warrant should be severed from the warrant. If this were done, so the argument ran, the warrant would have in it a definite starting point nominated and, by inference, a fixed end point, namely 12 midnight on 15 December 1997. However, if the words referred to above were deleted then par 3 of the warrant would read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Fix the period 4.30pm on 15 December 1997 as the period during which this warrant is to be in force"". 
        
       
      
    41    Such a construction of the warrant would involve it applying only at one instant in time. This is not a period and would not comply with the requirements of s 16(4)(c). Even if the deletions from par 3 of the warrant merely extended to the words and figures ""4.30pm on 4 January 1997"" (leaving the word ""until"" in place) there would still be a problem, because there is no specified end point on the face of the warrant and having regard to its nature I do not think that it is appropriate or open for the court to infer 12 midnight on 15 December 1997 into par 3 of the warrant as the time when it ceased to be in force. 
     
      
    42    In any event the argument on behalf of the defendant on this aspect of the case assumes that it is appropriate for the court to amend the warrant by deleting something which is included in it and by substituting for the portion deleted something that is not in the warrant. I do not think that the jurisdiction of the court extends to this. In this regard I agree with what was said by James J in Haynes v Attorney General for New South Wales (Supreme Court of New South Wales, unreported, 9 February 1996). 
     
      
    43    For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the warrant styled ST 97/286(a) does not comply with the requirements of s 16(4)(c) of the Act, and that as these provisions are mandatory the warrant is void as a consequence. 
     
      
    44    In my opinion a declaration should be made in accordance with par 1 of the plaintiffs' Further Amended Summons and an order should be made in accordance with par 2 of such Further Amended Summons. I make a declaration and order accordingly. 
     
      
    45    I order the defendant to pay half of the plaintiffs' costs.

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The appellant was convicted after trial on two counts: 
     
      
       
      (1) That he, between about 1 September 1996 and about 30 September 1996, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Hiroko Ohata and Toshimitsu Watanabe and other persons to import into Australia prohibited imports to which s233B of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth) applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin, being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. 
       
       
      (2) That he, on 17 January 1997, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did import into Australia prohibited imports to which s233B of the  
      Customs Act 
       applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin, being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. 
       
      
    2    On 17 January 1997, the appellant arrived in Sydney on a flight from Tokyo. He was detained by officers of the Australian Customs Service upon arrival. When he removed his clothing at the request of Customs officers he was found to be wearing a body pack around his waist, the compartments of which contained eighteen separate packages of white powder, later analysed and found to be heroin. Upon analysis and, on the basis of an admission made under s184 of the Evidence Act 1995, the total weight of pure heroin found on his body was 1,481.5 grams. This was slightly below the level identified in the Customs Act as a commercial quantity. It was at the very top of the range of a trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    3    Following his arrest, the appellant participated in a record of interview with police. During the course of that interview he informed police that he had travelled to Bangkok on the afternoon of 13 January 1997, where he was provided with a body pack containing the packages by a Mr Ohata. He returned to Tokyo, arriving there on 14 January. Upon arrival he removed the body pack at a toilet at a nearby railway station and gave it to his travelling companion, a Mr Sugahara. On the morning of 17 January the appellant met Sugahara at the railway station and was given the body pack. Once again he strapped it to his waist and boarded a flight to Sydney. The appellant further informed police that he was to receive 650,000 Japanese yen (approximately A$6,500) for his part in the importation. He denied any knowledge of the presence of heroin. He asserted on a number of occasions that he believed he was carrying a quantity of contraceptive pills. 
     
      
    4    During the course of this interview the appellant informed police that he had travelled to Australia in almost identical circumstances in September 1996. He indicated that he had flown from Tokyo to Bangkok on 20 September 1996 and left Bangkok on 23 September and arrived in Sydney on 24 September. Ohata had paid for the airline ticket and he indicated that he had a similar body pack as he had on the occasion on which he was apprehended. He indicated that when he arrived in Australia on that occasion he did as he was instructed to do by Mr Ohata. He had contacted Ohata and informed him of the name of his hotel and the room number. Ohata said that a Chinese man would come to pick up the package. That occurred. The Chinese man picked up the package and gave the appellant a sum of money which he first described as about A$6,000 and later as about A$6,500. He indicated that on both occasions he understood that what he was doing was illegal and that he was committing an offence. 
     
      
    5    He also indicated that on another occasion he accompanied Mr Watanabe to Australia at a time when he believed that Watanabe was carrying packets on his person. He also indicated that, at Ohata's request, he had picked up a package in Bangkok and carried it to New York in the United States of America. On that occasion also, he said, he believed he was carrying contraceptive pills. On that occasion he had also received something in the order of 600,000 yen. 
     
      
    6    The appellant indicated that he had been introduced to Mr Ohata by Mr Watanabe whom he described as a friend of his. With respect to the contraceptive pills he said in his record of interview that he had been told that it was difficult to obtain such pills in Australia and that they would be available from Bangkok. 
     
      
    7    The first ground of appeal on behalf of the appellant is that there was insufficient evidence to establish his guilt on the first count in the indictment. This was said to arise on the basis of three grounds which in the alternative, or cumulatively, are such as to justify the no evidence submission. These were: 
     
      
       
      (i) No evidence of the nature of the substance imported by the appellant; 
       
       
      (ii) No evidence of the purity of the substance and hence the quantity; 
       
      and 
       
       
       
      (iii) No evidence of any agreement to import occurring in Sydney as alleged in the indictment. 
       
      
    8    The evidence on this matter consisted of the admissions made by the appellant during the course of his record of interview, together with inferences from the circumstances of the occasion on which he was apprehended, the subject of the second count. 
     
      
    9    Mr Byrne SC, who appeared for the appellant in this Court, submitted that it was reasonably possible to draw an inference from the objective facts consistent with the appellant not having brought a trafficable quantity of heroin into Australia. He put forward three possible explanations. First, that it was known that in the illicit drug trade suppliers may ""rip off"" their customers by supplying innocuous powder. Secondly, the first overseas journey may have constituted ""a dummy run"" in order to test the trustworthiness and capacity of the appellant as a courier. Thirdly, the packages could have contained a substance other than heroin, including a substance believed to be prohibited, but which was not within one of the categories of prohibited substance in the schedules to the Customs Act. 
     
      
    10    No application was made at the close of the Crown case by counsel for the accused at the trial that there should be a verdict by direction on the basis that the Crown had failed to produce evidence of any essential element in the charge in count one. On this basis, leave is required under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952. I am not minded to grant leave on the basis that the submission has no substance. If the Court were to grant leave the result would be the same. 
     
      
    11    It was open to the jury to infer from the facts of the second occasion and the degree of similarity between the two occasions, that the substance imported on the first occasion was heroin, and that it was in excess of a trafficable quantity. The modus operandi of the two occasions is virtually identical. According to Mr Tamotsu’s admissions in the record of interview, the packaging was the same, the weight was about the same and the amount he was paid for the delivery and was to be paid for the delivery was about the same. 
     
      
    12    As the count was conspiracy rather than importation, on one view it does not matter whether or not there was any heroin imported on the first occasion. The essence of the offence is that of agreement rather than the carrying of that agreement into effect. 
     
      
    13    Plainly, the jury rejected his evidence that on the two occasions in question he believed he was carrying contraceptive pills which, apparently, he believed were difficult to obtain in Australia. Indeed, it appears that he believed that they were also difficult to obtain in the United States. The rejection of this evidence enabled the jury to conclude that he had the requisite intent with respect to the second count, and that he had the requisite knowledge of the nature of the commodity the subject of the conspiracy, with respect to the first count. 
     
      
    14    It was also submitted under this ground that the charge referred to an agreement to import occurring in Sydney. That is not precisely accurate. The indictment alleged that the appellant ""at Sydney...and elsewhere, did conspire...to import"". 
     
      
    15    I do not regard the location of an agreement as an essential element in a count of conspiracy. In any event, in my opinion, there was evidence of an agreement which was made in Sydney and elsewhere. The basic submission on behalf of the appellant was that the acts that were done in Sydney, pursuant to any agreement which might have existed, were done, and I quote from the written submissions, ""after the process of importation was complete and hence not directed towards the act of importation"". The act of importation occurred in Sydney, albeit at the airport. 
     
      
    16    More significantly, there was evidence of a prior arrangement amongst other co-conspirators, namely the arrangement by which the appellant would be met and the illegal shipment delivered. A co-conspirator, presumably Ohata, had contacted the person who was to pick up the delivery. There was evidence of a conspiracy occurring ""at Sydney and elsewhere"". Prior to the act of importation there was, it was open to the jury to infer, an arrangement for delivery in Sydney. In that regard the agreement was made in part in Sydney. The fact that no act of the appellant was involved at that stage does not preclude the conclusion that he was a member of a conspiracy which was in part made here. 
     
      
    17    The second ground of appeal was to the effect that evidence in relation to the first count should not have been admitted and left to the jury as relevant to the determination of the appellant's guilt on the second count. Similarly, it was submitted that evidence in relation to the second count should not have been admitted and left to the jury as relevant to the determination of the appellant's guilt on the first ground. It was submitted that directions that were given in this respect were inadequate. 
     
      
    18    For the reasons I have mentioned above, there was evidence of a character which would enable the jury to conclude that the requisite elements of the offence under the first count were made out in part on the basis of what happened on the second occasion. Those reasons are sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    19    The only substantive issue in respect to the second count was whether or not the appellant had knowledge of the nature of the substance he was carrying. He asserted in his record of interview that he thought he was carrying contraceptive pills as he had done on the previous occasion to Australia and, on one occasion, to the United States. 
     
      
    20    The appellant called in his case the head of the Department of Japanese and Korean Studies in the School of Asian Studies at the University of Sydney. That witness indicated that the contraceptive pill was not generally available in Japan, although doctors could prescribe it for medical reasons. The possibility that a cultural difference would explain what, to an Australian, would be a ridiculous proposition, was before the jury. It was a matter for the jury to assess. It was open to the jury to reject the appellant's assertion as to his state of knowledge. They plainly did so with respect to both counts. 
     
      
    21    Juries are entitled to determine that there are limits to the credulity of drug couriers. This Court should also make it clear that there are limits to the credulity of jurors. 
     
      
    22    I have already referred to the great degree of similarity between the two incidents. The Crown had given notice under s98 of the Evidence Act. His Honour made a ruling as to the admissibility of the evidence under ss98 and 100 of that Act. His Honour indicated that the coincidence evidence did have significant probative value. His Honour was correct that the similarities between the two occasions were overwhelming, with considerable probative value on the issue of knowledge. As his Honour concluded, reflecting the terminology of the statutory provision: 
     
      
       
        
        ""...the probative value of the tendency or coincidental evidence not merely outweighs its prejudicial effect but does so substantially."" 
        
       
      
    23    It was open to his Honour to so rule and I agree that the ruling was accurate. 
     
      
    24    For those reasons I would dismiss the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    25    The appellant also applies for leave to appeal against sentence. His Honour sentenced the appellant on the first count to seven years' imprisonment and on the second count to eleven and a half years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of seven and a half years. The sentences were to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    26    First, it was submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Secondly, it was submitted that his Honour erred in the application of the provisions of s16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Thirdly, the parity principle was invoked on the basis of the sentence of Mr Watanabe as varied in this Court in R v Sugahara and Watanabe (NSWCCA, 16 October 1998, unreported). 
     
      
    27    In his reasons on sentence his Honour indicated that with respect to the first count he would have imposed a sentence of fifteen years. He adjusted that sentence pursuant to s16G to ten years. He then gave credit for other matters of discount and reduced the sentence to seven years. With respect to the second count he indicated that an appropriate sentence would be sixteen years. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Making the adjustments necessary under s16G I believe that an appropriate overall sentence for that offence is eleven and a half years."" 
        
       
      
    28    He went on to indicate that by reason of s19AB of the Crimes Act (Cth) he should fix a single non-parole period, which he did, at seven and a half years. 
     
      
    29    The quantity involved in the importation on the second count was at the very top of the trafficable range. Inevitably, there will be an overlap between the sentences at the very top of the trafficable range and those at the bottom of the commercial quantity range. With respect to the second count, the sentence of eleven and a half years is not so obviously excessive as to justify the intervention of the court in the circumstances of this case. The period of seven years on the first count is clearly within the exercise of his Honour's discretion. 
     
      
    30    With respect to the first count, his Honour had given an express discount for reasons that he had outlined earlier in his judgment. Of particular significance, I assume, was the fact that the knowledge of the authorities about the importation was based entirely on the appellant's own admissions. Plainly, his Honour gave significant weight to this factor when sentencing on the first count. 
     
      
    31    In my opinion the court should not interfere with the sentence on either count on the basis that the sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    32    There is, however, one aspect of the comparison between the sentences his Honour imposed on the first and second count which is worthy of further consideration in conjunction with other matters to which I shall refer hereafter. 
     
      
    33    In his reasons on sentence on the first count, his Honour first applied a deduction under s16G and then reduced the sentence by a period of a further three years on grounds which his Honour referred to as ""by virtue of the matters I have mentioned"". Some of those grounds were not material to the second count, in particular, the fact that the authorities only discovered the offence by reason of a confession. Nevertheless, other aspects, including some of the subjective aspects to which his Honour referred and the offer of assistance, were material to both counts. 
     
      
    34    The structure of his Honour's reasons with respect to the second count made allowance for a s16G deduction from the head sentence. However, it made no other express allowance, unlike the structure of his Honour's reasons on the first count. 
     
      
    35    The second matter that the appellant puts with respect to sentence is that the s16G deduction should be one third, which is a customary rule of thumb with respect to this matter. However, this was only applied in the case of the first count. If the same one third had been applied in the case of the second count, then the deduction under s16G would have reduced the appropriate sentence from sixteen years to ten years and eight months, rather than eleven and a half years. 
     
      
    36    It is true, as counsel for the Crown submitted, that the one third rule of thumb must not be applied as if it were some form of rule of law. Variations from the percentage of the proportion applicable here (ie from thirty-three per cent to twenty-eight per cent) are acceptable and will not, in the normal course, require explanation. However, in a context where sentencing is occurring for two offences and an unexplained discrepancy in this respect occurs, the appellant could have a justifiable sense of grievance on the basis that in the absence of an explanation, he may have suffered from a mere miscalculation. It appears from the material before the Court that if there was a miscalculation it occurred in the course of the sentencing of Watanabe by his Honour O'Reilly DCJ, to which his Honour made reference during his reasons on sentence of the appellant. 
     
      
    37    The third matter relates to the issue of parity. His Honour had before him the sentences in the case of both Watanabe and Sugahara. Indeed his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The sentences imposed on Watanabe and Sugahara are of obvious relevance and I have derived assistance from the remarks of his Honour Judge O'Reilly."" 
        
       
      
    38    His Honour went on to say that the cases did differ. The others pleaded guilty. On the other hand, the quantity involved in their cases was slightly above the 1.5 kilogram cut-off point for a commercial quantity of heroin at 1,511.2 grams in the case of Watanabe and 1511.46 grams in the case of Sugahara. His Honour noted that the offence involving a commercial quantity carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, however, the minor difference in amount did not justify any significant discrepancy. His Honour also made reference to the differences in the subjective circumstances. More significantly, there is a difference in the degree of assistance offered by Watanabe. It was of a different kind in the sense that he participated in a controlled delivery, albeit not a successful one. The offer of assistance by the appellant in the present case was of a lower order of significance. This Court in Watanabe assessed his assistance as six months. I assess the appellant's as three months. 
     
      
    39    His Honour did, however, take into account, as he said, the sentences imposed on the two other couriers. In the present case, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was led into his offending by Watanabe. That is an overstatement of the position. The most that Watanabe did was to introduce the appellant to Ohata. It appears clearly from the judgment in the case of Sugahara and Watanabe that Watanabe was sentenced on the basis of being a courier, ie on the same basis as the appellant in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    40    The trial judge in the case of Watanabe had started off, as his Honour did in this case, with a sentence of sixteen years and after the s16G deduction he reduced that to eleven and a half years. That is a deduction of twenty-eight per cent. 
     
      
    41    In both cases the figures are identical to that employed by his Honour in the present case, including the failure to give a precise one-third deduction under s16G. 
     
      
    42    On appeal in this Court McInerney J, with whom I and Sperling J agreed, said that the eleven and a half years was excessive and after applying a deduction of one-third concluded that the appropriate sentence was ten and a half years. From this the court deducted a further period of six months from both the head sentence and the non-parole period for Watanabe's cooperation with the authorities. The court imposed a non-parole period of approximately two-thirds of the head sentence, being an amount of six and a half years, from which the six months for cooperation was deducted. 
     
      
    43    In the case of Watanabe the original head sentence was eleven and a half years with a non-parole period of seven years. In the present case the judge has fixed a head sentence of eleven and a half years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years. After his successful appeal, Watanabe's sentence was reduced to a head sentence of ten years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    44    Other than in the case of the higher level of assistance given by Watanabe, his plea of guilty and some differences in subjective considerations which do not appear to me to be of any significant magnitude, the appellant could feel a justifiable sense of grievance in having a sentence significantly greater than that of Watanabe. Combined with the other two factors I have mentioned above, ie the failure by his Honour to explicitly refer to any matters other than the s16G discount with respect to the second count and the application without explanation of a lower than customary s16G discount with respect to the second count only, in my view it is appropriate for this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    45    I would not interfere with the head sentence on the first count. Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      (2) Quash the sentence of the trial judge. 
       
       
      (3) Substitute sentence as follows: 
       
       
        
        (a) On the first count sentence the appellant to seven years' imprisonment commencing on 17 January 1997; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On the second count sentence the appellant to ten years and three months commencing on the same date, ie 17 January 1997; 
        
       
       
      (c) Fix a non-parole period of six years and three months. 
       
       
      Otherwise I would dismiss the appeal. 
       
      
    46    DUNFORD J: I agree. 
     
      
    47    HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    48    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are as I have indicated.

     R v Tony GIAM (No. 2) 
      
     HEADNOTE 
    This was a Crown appeal against sentence on the ground of inadequacy.The respondent was convicted by a jury on 6 counts of making false statements with intent to obtain an advantage contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, and 1 count that he being a director did cheat and defraud contrary to s 176A. On each of the 6 counts under s 178BB he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 9 months and on the count under s 176A and his Honour deferred passing sentence on the respondent entering into a recognisance in the sum of $1,000.00 to be of good behaviour for 5 years with further conditions relating to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and the curbing of his gambling habits. The combined overall effective sentences were therefore 2 years 9 months in custody followed by 2 years 3 months of conditional liberty under supervision for 2 years 3 months.The respondent appealed against the convictions on the 6 counts under s 178BB and this Court held those counts were bad for duplicity, allowed the appeal, and ordered a new trial: R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53. There was no appeal in respect of the counts under s 176A.The Director of Public Prosecutions thereupon instituted the present appeal.HELD:1. The former approach in sentencing for multiple offences whereby such sentences were structured so that the overall effective sentences were appropriate to the total criminality involved with less regard being had to the appropriateness of the individual sentences for the particular offences is likely to mask error and lead to anomalies, and should no longer be followed. Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; R v Thomas [1999] NSWCCA 168, followed.2. Notwithstanding that the Crown had not yet made a decision whether to proceed with a new trial of the respondent in relation to the 6 counts under s 178BB, it was appropriate for the Court to deal with this appeal. Ryan v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 1; R v Tolmie (1994) 72 A Crim R 416, referred to.3. Section 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 did not prevent the Court from taking into account that the convictions and sentences on the other 6 counts had been set aside.4. The Court did not need to rely on evidence of the upholding of the earlier appeal, as this was a matter of the Court's own record. Evidence Act 1995 s 144, considered.5. Although the appeal was not instituted until 10 months after the sentence was imposed, it was instituted promptly on the upholding of the earlier appeal, and there was no reason for the Court to decline to deal with it on its merits, because of any delay on the part of the Crown.6. In determining the appeal, the Court could not have regard to the conduct which formed the basis of the 6 counts under s 178BB.7. Having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the amount of money and breach of trust involved, the order for a recognisance was inadequate. R v Glenister [1980] 2 NSWLR 597; R v Pantano [1990] 49 A Crim R 328, applied.8. Having regard to the principles applicable to Crown appeals, the appropriate sentence would be imprisonment for a minimum term of 2 years with an additional term of 2 years.9. It was appropriate to give the respondent credit for the time spent in custody in respect of the other 6 counts and also the time spent by him on conditional liberty since the upholding of the earlier appeal. Accordingly, the minimum term would be reduced by 10 months and the additional term by 8 months. R v Niass (CCA - 16 November 1988); R v Webster - Jones (CCA - 11 May 1992), distinguished. R v Tolmie, followed. Order: Appeal allowed, the recognisance quashed, respondent sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 14 months with an additional term of 16 months.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60107/99 DUNFORD J HIDDEN J SMART AJ 
     
     FRIDAY, 26 NOVEMBER 1999 
     
     
     R v Tony GIAM (No. 2) 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge McGuire in the District Court at Sydney on 29 May 1998, following his conviction by a jury on a charge that he ""being a director did cheat and defraud"" contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 s 176A (""the Act""). That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years and his Honour deferred passing sentence on the respondent entering into a recognisance in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for 5 years with further conditions relating to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and the curbing of his gambling habit. 
    2    The respondent actually stood trial on 7 counts of which the subject charge was the seventh, the other six counts in the indictment being for making false statements with intent to obtain an advantage contrary to s 178BB of the Act, the maximum penalty for which offence is imprisonment for 5 years. 
    3    The jury found the respondent guilty on all 7 counts and on each of the other 6 counts, the Judge sentenced him to imprisonment for fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months, such sentences to be served concurrently, so that the overall effect of the sentences for all 7 counts was imprisonment for 2 years and 9 months followed by conditional liberty with supervision and conditions for a further 2 years and 3 months. 
    4    The respondent appealed to this Court against his conviction on the first 6 counts. Such appeal was heard on 10 March 1999 and judgment delivered on the same day, allowing the appeal, quashing the convictions for counts 1 to 6, and ordering a new trial, on the ground that the form of the first 6 counts was bad for duplicity: R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53. There was no appeal in respect of the seventh count. 
    5    The Court declined to interfere with the sentence imposed on the respondent for count 7, holding that it was not open to it to do so. Spigelman CJ said at [53]: 
     
      
       
       ""It is plain that his Honour took into account the totality of the criminality. The Appellant appeals from counts one to six only in circumstances where it is plain that his Honour has fashioned the sentence in a particular way to achieve a particular result. It is inconceivable that his Honour would have sentenced the Appellant to a recognizance only on the seventh count, if that had been the only charge."" 
       
      
      
     and at [57]: 
      
       
       ""The only way that the considerable inconvenience associated with a retrial could conceivably be avoided in such cases is if the Crown were to lodge an appeal against the sentence with respect to the count on which a conviction was entered, but no appeal is brought"". 
       
      
    6    On 15 March 1999 the Director of Public Prosecutions instituted the present appeal on the ground that the sentence for count 7 was inadequate, and the Notice of Appeal was served on the respondent on 16 March 1999. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    7    The respondent was an accountant. In conjunction with his brother, a solicitor, he became involved in the implementation of an arrangement whereby large sums of foreign investment moneys from a Japanese investor were available through company structures within Australia. The principal company vehicle for the overseas investor was Jason Property Management Pty Limited. 
    8    Credit facilities were extended to the companies by the State Bank of New South Wales. ""Set off"" arrangements were put in place, whereby there was a combined overall overdraft limit of all of the companies within the Jason Property Management group. 
    9    The Crown case at the trial was that by falsely representing to the bank that he was the secretary of Jason Property Management Pty Limited, the respondent arranged for the set off facility to be extended to other accounts which had no connection with the overseas investor or with the business for which Jason Property Management Pty Limited had been set up. These other accounts were in fact for the benefit of the respondent and his family. The respondent plundered these accounts to the tune of many millions of dollars, which were expended on hugely extravagant gambling and a lavish lifestyle. 
    10    The first 6 counts alleged false statements made between 22 September 1988 and 19 February 1991 (both dates inclusive) and the seventh count (the subject of this appeal) was that between 19 February and 14 October 1991 the respondent being a director of Jason Property Management Pty Limited did cheat and defraud the State Bank in its dealings with that company. 
    11    This he did by affixing the company's seal as director to a ""Security Over Deposit Agreement"" with the State Bank of New South Wales whereby he and members of his family and companies owned by him were able to obtain credit from the Bank against the company's account notwithstanding that he had no authority to execute the document or enter into the agreement on behalf of the company. At that time the respondent knew that he was putting the Bank at risk of financial loss due to his level of gambling. 
    12    The respondent agreed in his evidence that he had been gambling heavily for some time prior to entering into the ""Security Over Deposit Agreement"", and that he had relied upon his overdraft to live. There was evidence that he had told a business associate that he had lost close to $10 million in gambling, and that he was having problems with the bank in relation to his overdraft. 
    13    On 14 October 1991 an officer of the State Bank contacted the respondent when a shortfall of around $7 million of credit funds against debit funds was discovered. The respondent told this officer that $10 million would be forthcoming from another company. No money reached the bank, and the bank terminated the ""Security Over Deposit Agreement"". A settlement was reached with the bank whereby the respondent sold a number of assets. The ultimate loss to the bank was $1.7 million. 
    14    It has been common practice in this state for some years when sentencing offenders for multiple offences to structure the sentences so that the total overall effective sentences were appropriate to the total criminality involved with less regard being had to the appropriateness of the individual sentences for the particular offences: R v Holder and Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 per Street CJ, R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 466 per Hunt CJ at CL. That is undoubtedly what his Honour had in mind in structuring the sentences as he did. 
    15    The High Court has now pointed out that such an approach is likely to mask error, can lead to artificial claims of disparity between co-offences, otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences or result in an offender being doubly punished for the same act: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624. See also R v Thomas [1999] NSWCCA 168 at [14]. 
    16    The present case illustrates a further problem with the former approach also masking error in that the sentences for the lesser offences under s 178BB each carrying a maximum penalty of five years were disproportionate to the ""sentence"" for the more serious offence under s 176A carrying a maximum penalty of ten years; and the convictions (and sentences) for the lesser offences having been set aside, the remaining sentence for the more serious offence is prima facie inadequate for an offence of such gravity. As Spigelman CJ said in the passage quoted above in the respondent's conviction appeal, it is inconceivable that the respondent would have only received a recognisance on the seventh count if that had been the only charge. 
    17    At the time of the hearing of the present appeal (and presumably this is still the case) no decision had been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to re-indict the respondent on the matters subject to the first six counts in the original indictment, which would presumably now become 12 counts. The Director presumably had in mind the suggestion by the Chief Justice that the only way in which the considerable inconvenience of a new trial could be avoided would be by the bringing of this appeal. One suspects that if this appeal is determined first the Director's decision whether to run a new trial will take into account the result of the appeal. On the other hand, Mr Byrne SC on behalf of the respondent submitted that the Court should not hear this appeal until after either the Crown elects not to proceed with the new trial in respect of counts 1 to 6, or that new trial is held and the respondent, if convicted, is re-sentenced. 
    18    In my respectful opinion the approach suggested by the Chief Justice is appropriate, it is consistent with the dicta of the High Court in Ryan v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 1 particularly per Aickin J at 15, and is similar to what was done in R v Tolmie (1994) 72 A Crim R 416 where the Crown appealed in respect of sentences imposed cumulative to the sentences in respect of which the convictions had been set aside, on the ground that without the earlier sentences, the sentences appealed against were inadequate and the Crown appeal was heard without awaiting the outcome of the new trial; although this point does not appear to have been argued.  
    19    The Crown appeal for inadequacy on count 7 is before the Court and the Court should determine it now, dealing with it on its merits without speculating on what might or might not happen if there is a re-trial in respect of counts 1 to 6. At the same time it is important to bear in mind in determining such appeal that it is only count 7 that is before the Court, and we must be astute to ensure that we do not take into account the conduct which forms the basis of counts 1-6, as to do so would amount to sentencing the applicant for offences in respect of which he has not been convicted. 
    20    It was also submitted that in considering the appeal the Court could not have regard to the fact that the convictions and sentences on counts 1 to 6 have been set aside and reliance was placed on the provisions of s 12(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides that in no case shall any sentence be increased by reason of, or in consideration of any evidence which was not given at the trial. It was said that evidence of the setting aside of the convictions on counts 1 to 6 was, of necessity, evidence which was not given at the trial. Assuming for the moment that it is a matter of evidence, that is of course correct, but in my view as it was evidence which was not available at the trial, it would satisfy the tests for fresh evidence laid down in cases such as Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 and Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, and as it does not relate to the matters going to the commission of the offence or the personal circumstances of the respondent its admission is not prohibited by the provision of s 12(1); R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 at [84], R v J (1992) 64 A Crim R 441 at 448-9, Re Beldan; ex parte the Attorney-General (1986) 21 A Crim R 159 at 167.   
    21    But I am satisfied that the Court does not need to receive evidence of its own proceedings and the earlier conviction appeal and its outcome are matters of record in this Court. Section 144 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides that proof is not required about knowledge which is not reasonably open to question and is capable of verification by a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned, and that a judge may acquire knowledge of that kind in any way the judge thinks fit. We acquire knowledge of these matters by looking at the Court file and/or by reading the published Reasons for Judgment. 
    22    In any event the Court does not need to, and, for the reason referred to above, should not take into account the fact that the convictions and sentences on counts 1 to 6 have been set aside, but must confine its consideration to whether the release on recognisance granted in respect of count 7, standing alone, is an adequate sentence for the criminality involved in that single count.  
    23    It was also submitted that the Court should exercise the discretion which it undoubtedly has to dismiss the Crown appeal on account of the delay in bringing it, some 10 months after the sentence was imposed. But there is no time limit for Crown appeals under s 5D and the limit of 28 days provided for in s 10(1) in respect of appeals by convicted persons cannot be applied by analogy. In the present case there was a very good reason for the delay, namely that whilst the sentence on counts 1 to 6 stood, the Crown had no cause to appeal and the appeal was instituted promptly on those sentences being set aside. I am therefore satisfied that the Court should deal with the appeal on its merits. 
    24    The respondent was born on 9 June 1956 and was aged 43 at the time of sentence. He is a married man with two young children and retains the support of his wife. He has no previous convictions, appears to be a man of otherwise good character and the learned sentencing judge accepted that he was a man of industry prior to his fall from grace. He qualified as an accountant and was working as Administrative Manager of his brother's legal practice prior to his involvement with Jason Property Management Pty Limited. Following his arrest he endeavoured to set up business with two partners in a seafood trading company which became defunct due to his court matters. He then did casual work as a mortgage financier for a company until he was sentenced to imprisonment in May 1998. He was in custody from 22 May 1998 until 10 March 1999, a period of close to ten months.  
    25    Since his release he has been working as a roof tiler's labourer on a casual basis averaging four days a week and earning $100 per day. There is before the Court a reference from the employer describing him as ""hardworking, reliable and honest"". He and his wife have also been attending church regularly since his release. Following his incarceration his wife has returned to full time employment. During his imprisonment he completed a Gambling Awareness Course and since his release he has been assessed by Mr Simon Milton, Clinical Psychologist who conducts the Gambling Treatment Program at St Vincent's Hospital. Mr Milton commented that Mr Giam appears to have abstained from gambling for some time and that his current circumstances would prohibit or deter him from gambling but his resolve would be tested should he be successful in his future business ventures.  
    26    As already noted, most of the family assets were sold to pay off a substantial part of the money which had been fraudulently obtained from the bank. At the conclusion of the hearing we ordered a Pre-Sentence Report from the Probation and Parole Service and his probation officer advises that since his release from gaol he has complied with the requirements of his recognisance and been co-operative with his supervising officer. He has also indicated that his period in gaol has been a sobering experience and he is apprehensive of the prospect that a further period in gaol would again place his wife and young children under emotional and financial stress.  
    27    Notwithstanding these favourable subjective circumstances, the amount obtained by the respondent's fraud in the period the subject of the seventh count and as a result of the fraud practised by him was massive and it was used for gambling and for living an expensive lifestyle by himself and his family. Courts have drawn attention in the past to the seriousness of white collar crime, and offences under s 176A in particular, as it involves not only fraud but also breach of the trust involved in being a director of a company. Such offences call for significant sentences, particularly where the amount fraudulently obtained is large: R v Glenister [1980] 2 NSWLR 597, R v Pantano [1990] 49 A Crim R 328.  
    28    In view of the respondent's need for a significant period of conditional liberty under supervision to monitor and guard against his former gambling habits, I am satisfied that special circumstances exist for the purposes of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 and bearing in mind that, having regard to the principle of double jeopardy and that where Crown appeals succeed, the appropriate sentence is one which is at the bottom of the range, I consider that a proper sentence in this case would be imprisonment for a minimum term of 2 years with an additional term of 2 years.  
    29    The applicant has already served a term approaching 10 months in respect of counts 1 to 6, and although generally time served by way of sentence for convictions which have subsequently been set aside are not relevant to be taken into account in considering a proper sentence for another offence: R v Niass (CCA - 16 November 1988), R v Webster - Jones (CCA - 11 May 1992), there are exceptions to this principle, and in R v Tolmie supra, which in this respect is somewhat similar to the present case, credit was given for the time spent in custody serving the sentences which had subsequently been quashed. I therefore consider that the minimum term should be reduced by 10 months to allow for the time in custody already served, and similarly the additional term should be reduced by 8 months to take account of the time spent on conditional liberty under supervision since his release from custody in March this year. 
    30    I therefore propose that the Crown appeal be allowed, the order for the recognisance quashed, and in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 14 months to date from the day on which he goes into custody with an additional term of 16 months. The date on which the respondent will be eligible to be released on parole will be 14 months after the day on which he goes into custody. I would further order that on the expiration of the minimum term, the applicant be released on parole subject to the conditions contained in the Regulations and the further conditions that he place himself under the direction of the Probation and Parole Service and obey all reasonable directions of such service, particularly with regard to any course of rehabilitation or counselling with regard to gambling habit, and that he totally refrain from gambling and not enter any establishment used for gambling. 
    31    I further propose that a bench warrant issue for the arrest of the respondent, such warrant to lie in the office for 7 days, and in the event of the respondent surrendering himself to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre at Silverwater, or such other place as may be notified to him by the Department of Corrective Services within that time to serve the sentence, the warrant is not to be executed.

      REGINA v. FRANK PETER PETRINOVIC 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 19 July 1999, the prisoner pleaded guilty before me to one count of the murder of Ian Hagarty at Lurnea on 26 October 1997. It was common ground that that count embraced a crime of attempted robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon. 
    2   The Crown accepted that the plea was made on the basis of felony murder as is referred to in s.18 of the Crimes Act 1900 and conceded that on the facts it did not seek to rely on any of the intentional states necessary for murder referred to in that section. 
    3   On the hearing of the plea, I was provided by consent with the following statement of facts:- 
     
      
       
       ""At about 5.30 pm on Sunday 26 October 1997, the prisoner, Frank Petrinovic, and a co-offender, Mandie Jancek, drove to the vicinity of the Liquorland Bottle Shop, located at the corner of Hill Road and Reilly Street, Lurnea. Both the prisoner and Jancek travelled there in vehicle MOW-739, a 1983 Holden Commodore sedan owned by the prisoner. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner got out of the vehicle in Reilly Street. He put on a black balaclava and surgical gloves and armed himself with a loaded .32 calibre Argentina brand revolver. At the time he was also carrying a red plastic Grace Bros. shopping bag. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner walked into the Liquorland Bottle Shop through the Reilly Street entrance. He walked towards the cash register and confronted the two employees on duty, Ian Hagarty and Troy Stephens. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner ordered the two employees to the ground. Both complied. The prisoner stood over both employees and pointed the loaded revolver in their direction. The prisoner threw the Grace Bros. bag he was carrying behind the counter and said, 'fill up the bag'. Mr. Hagarty stood up and said, 'alright mate, I'll do it'. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point a struggle started between the prisoner and Mr. Hagarty. During the struggle, two shots were discharged from the revolver by the prisoner. One of the bullets struck Mr. Hagarty in the right side of the neck. The bullet partially severed the left pulmonary artery of the left lung and travelled through the left posterior rib cage. In the opinion of the forensic pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr. Hagarty, the death of Mr. Hagarty was caused by this gun shot wound. The second bullet did not enter Mr. Hagarty's body. It created a combined entry/exit wound. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Hagarty continued to struggle with the prisoner after the shots were fired, eventually taking the revolver off the prisoner and staggering away. He later collapsed in the driveway area. 
       
      
      
       
       Around this time, a number of the customers in the shop came to the aid of Mr. Hagarty. The prisoner was restrained by the customers in the driveway area. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point the co-offender Jancek entered the shop on foot and attempted to pull away the customers who were restraining the prisoner. She was unsuccessful and she left the shop. Jancek then returned a short time later driving vehicle MOW-739. She drove the vehicle into the bottle shop, and drove at the prisoner and the customers, narrowly missing a number of people. 
       
      
      
       
       This resulted in the prisoner breaking free of the customers for a short time. The prisoner attempted to get into the vehicle driven by Jancek, but was unable to do so. The prisoner then picked up a house brick and threatened the witnesses who were trying to detain him. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner ran out onto the footpath of Reilly Street where he was again restrained by customers until police arrived. The prisoner was taken into custody by police, together with the co-offender Jancek who was restrained by witnesses in the motor vehicle she was driving. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Hagarty was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital, but soon after died of his injuries. 
       
      
      
       
       Located at the scene was the loaded revolver used by the prisoner, the balaclava worn by the prisoner which was removed by one of the witnesses who tried to detain him, surgical gloves worn by the prisoner, and the Grace Bros. shopping bag. 
       
      
      
       
       A search was made of the vehicle owned by the prisoner. Located in the vehicle was a radio scanner which was set on the police channel for the Liverpool area, and a box of surgical gloves. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner was taken by police to Liverpool Police Station. Later he was taken to Liverpool Hospital where he was treated for injuries sustained by him at the scene. The prisoner was later returned to Liverpool Police Station where he was interviewed. The prisoner stated that he did not wish to comment about what had occurred."" 
       
      
    4   The detail of that statement was not in contest before me and I was provided with statements from the various witnesses to support it. I accept that statement as setting out the immediate factual context of the offence. 
    5   Subsequent to the entry of the plea, the sentencing proceedings were stood over to enable preparation of appropriate material by the Crown and preparation of relevant written submissions. When the matter came back before me, in addition to the two victim impact statements, which were provided to me during the plea and which I treated in accordance with s.23C of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the principles set out in Regina v. Previtera (1998) 94 A. Crim. R. 76, I was provided with two documents summarising the prisoner's appalling prior criminal record and also his gaol movements. Those documents are annexed to this judgment. They refer to the numerous previous armed robbery and other serious offences committed while the prisoner was on parole or while an escapee. The present offence was committed some four and a half months after the prisoner's release from custody and whilst he was on parole. 
    6   Although the documentation including the document provided to me setting out in extenso the prisoner's prior record refers to various different birth dates, I have been informed that the prisoner was born on 15 March 1960 and is thus presently 39 years old and will proceed on that basis. 
    7   I have been further informed that prior to his entry into an adult gaol at the age of 18, the prisoner had spent a considerable period of his life from the age of 10 onwards in institutions. 
    8   The annexed document headed ""Gaol movements"" calculates the prisoner's total time in custody not including the time in juvenile detention centres or institutions and their equivalents, as 17 years, 18 days, ie., the prisoner has been in gaol for almost all of his adult life and in institutions for the greater part of his life. His time at liberty has been almost entirely as an escapee or whilst on parole. 
    9   In addition to the material with which I was provided concerning the prisoner's prior record, I was referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 18 September 1990 in respect of three applications by him for leave to appeal against sentence, which applications were refused. In the judgment is set out at some length and in some detail the circumstances of the 12 offences of armed robbery, one offence of larceny of a motor vehicle, two offences of escape lawful custody, two of assaulting police in the execution of their duty, in respect of which the prisoner had been sentenced to a total head sentence of 14 years and a total non-parole period which expired only shortly prior to the commission of the present offence. 
    10   Although the prisoner pleaded guilty and is therefore entitled to the benefit of s.439 of the Crimes Act, that plea was entered but a week before trial in circumstances in which the prisoner was arrested at the scene of the crime which was witnessed by numerous persons, immediately after its commission. The case against him, in those circumstances, was entirely overwhelming. However, the Crown had sought to proceed on the basis the prisoner had an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm or was recklessly indifferent to human life up until shortly before the plea. 
    11   As soon as the Crown indicated its willingness to rely on felony murder to the exclusion of any intentional basis for the killing, the plea was offered. It is thus of significance as negating a deliberate killing and some, but very limited significance as reflecting in itself an element of contrition or remorse. Nonetheless, the trial itself would have involved some weeks of court time and the attendance of numerous witnesses had it proceeded. In that sense, there has been a saving to the community which at least reflects on the prisoner's part some consciousness for others from which he might benefit by way of showing some prospect of conformity with the requirements of society. 
    12   The prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf during which he expressed sorrow and contrition. I have no doubt that his expression of that before me in the witness box was genuinely felt. It accords with what he said to Dr. Westmore whose report of 19 August 1999 was in evidence and with the observations of Sue Jefferies, Clinical Nurse Consultant and Rhonda Danylenko, Department of Community Services, AOD Worker, both from the Corrections Health Service in their report dated 30 July 1999. I accept from that evidence rather than the plea that he has some degree of remorse for what he has done and some sorrow for the harm that he has caused. 
    13   I turn to the role in this offence of the prisoner's use of and addiction to drugs and his previous offences. 
    14   The reports to which I have referred and the prisoner's own evidence disclose that he had first started using heroin at the age of 18 at the time of his first gaol sentence. He has apparently been addicted to heroin or using methadone, except for some intervals whilst in gaol, over a period of 20 years. His evidence, which was in this regard corroborated by the observations of the authors of the Corrections Health Service report was, that at the time of his release from custody he had been advised to maintain a dosage of 80 mgs of methadone (having been maintaining a dosage of 50 mgs in gaol) but had, contrary to advice, restricted his dosage to 40 mgs, asserting an attempt to fight his addiction, but notwithstanding the advice he had received from AOD workers that a return to heroin use would mean a return to gaol and the provision to him of assistance by way of professional support and counselling, found himself unable to cope, returned to heroin and to his course of violent criminality. 
    15   The prisoner had used heroin three times on the day of the offence, on the last occasion about 15 minutes before going to Liquorland and had used that day a total of a gram to a gram and a half of heroin. In addition, he had told Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko, Dr. Westmore and Professor Starmer, with whose report as to the effects of the drugs I was also provided, that he had used about 100 to 120 milligrams of methadone syrup, had taken two Rohypnols and had drunk about half a bottle of Bourbon. The effects of these, according to Professor Starmer, would have been such that it was likely that his ability for clear logical reasoning would have been greatly reduced and his appreciation of the possible consequences of his actions also reduced. Professor Starmer stated that all those drugs have central nervous system depressant activity and therefore the cognitive and information processing functions would be expected to have been impaired. 
    16   Although on an issue of criminal liability intoxication might go to negate the formation of a specific criminal intent, in sentencing the question of whether it is a mitigating or aggravating feature depends upon the circumstances (see Regina v. Coleman (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 306 at 327). 
    17   It is quite apparent that this offence was committed whilst under the influence of drugs in order to obtain money for drugs. It was committed as the culmination of a long history of violent crime committed in the context of drug involvement just as had been the offences dealt with by this court on the applications for leave to appeal against sentence to which I have referred (see Regina v. Petrinovic (CCA, unreported 18 September 1990). Hunt, J. (as he then was), with whom Wood, J. (as he then was) and McInerney, J. agreed, said, at p.9:- 
     
      
       
       ""The citizens of this community are sick and tired of armed robberies conducted by criminals in order to feed their drug habits. The cost of the precautions which must be taken by banks and by other businesses dealing with cash is enormous, and that cost has necessarily been passed on to the whole community. More seriously, the violence so often involved and the fear inevitably engendered in staffs (sic) and in customers alike has aggravated the epidemic-like proportions of this crime wave engulfing the community. So far as I am concerned, this court will continue to support judges who recognise these serious crimes and who impose heavy sentences for them. The community expects it of the courts, and it is bitterly disappointed when undue leniency is shown by the courts because some thug cries that he has had an unhappy upbringing and promises that he will get rid of his drug habit, as has this applicant."" 
       
      
    18   Notwithstanding that the Crown did not seek to show that the prisoner deliberately became intoxicated to facilitate the commission of the offence, nonetheless I see no basis on which his crime is mitigated by the effects of the drugs on him. Nor do I see any basis on which his long term drug addiction could be regarded as mitigatory where, whenever he has been at liberty, in order to feed that addiction, he has resorted again and again to crimes of deliberately terrorising others, the appalling consequences of which, even if nothing went wrong, were likely to involve permanent effects on the victims. Importantly as here, such crimes in themselves, even if not committed in circumstances of drug intoxication, have the all too great potential to result in someone's death. Their fatal potential is reflected in the retention of the felony murder provision in s.18 of the Crimes Act. The whole purpose of the conduct involved in the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon is to pose a real threat of death to compel victims to hand over property. Where that death has been so caused there is little room to find the offence is any less culpable and good reason to consider it as at least as culpable as murder committed intentionally. 
    19   Having regard to these considerations and to the matters referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111 by the Chief Justice at 194 and 202, by Wood, CJ. at CL. at 273 and Simpson, J. at 344, I see no basis on which the prisoner's general involvement with drugs or his intoxication on this occasion should in the circumstances of this case be treated as mitigatory. They certainly do not render the objective circumstances of this offence less culpable. 
    20   The Crown submitted that the case called for the imposition of the maximum penalty.  
    21   The statutory scheme prescribing the maximum penalty has become complex. By virtue of s.19A, the maximum penalty for the crime of murder is penal servitude for life. Section 19A(2) provides that a person sentenced to penal servitude for life is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life. Part 11 of the Sentencing Act 1989 does not apply (s.13(c)) so that the provision under that Part of minimum and additional terms is unavailable. Section 19A(3) preserves the operation of s.442 which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than a statutory maximum. 
    22   Section 431A of the Crimes Act provides that a person is not liable to the punishment of penal servitude for life for any offence except for the offences of murder or certain offences under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. By s.431A(3) it is provided that where no penalty is otherwise provided for an offence that was formerly punishable by penal servitude for life, that offence is now to be punishable by penal servitude for 25 years. The section also refers to amendments made by the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 altering penalties for offences under the Act from penal servitude for life to penal servitude for 25 years. 
    23   In the event that a trial judge does not pass a sentence of life imprisonment for murder, the maximum sentence that might be passed in the exercise of discretion is at large and is not restricted by the greatest maximum now prescribed for other offences of 25 years.  
    24   The offence of attempted armed robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon, the foundational felony for the murder felony here is the aggravated form of the offence provided for by s.97 and is punishable by penal servitude for 25 years.  
    25   At the time of the commission of the present offence s.431B, which came into operation on 30 June 1996, applied. Section 431B, the history and nature of which is reviewed by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in ""Sentencing"" Report 79, provides for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the court on a person convicted of murder if the court ""is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"" (emphasis added). Section 431B(3) provides that nothing in s.431B(1) affects s.442, apparently preserving the discretion. But in the circumstances referred to in s.431B(1), there is no discretion but to impose the life sentence when one has regard to the language of the provision. The criteria appearing in s.431B(1) are those to which regard must be paid not whether the offence was in ""the worst class of case"" for which maximum penalties were reserved at common law (Ibbs v. The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447). The statutory criteria in s.431B were developed in the light of previous judicial pronouncements. 
    26   Prior to the enactment of s.431B and the provision of statutory criteria, the relevant test for the identification of a crime warranty the imposition of a life sentence under s.19A was expressed in Regina v. Twala (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994) in the judgment of Badgery-Parker, J. at 7:- 
     
      
       
       ""It must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."" 
       
      
    27   In Regina v. Garforth (CCA, unreported 31 March 1994), it was submitted that even absent continuing dangerousness as referred to in The Queen v. Veen (No. 1) (1979) 143 CLR 458, and where there may be prospects of rehabilitation, nevertheless, a life sentence can be appropriate and in that regard the court referred to:- 
     
      
       
       ""… those cases where the level of culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty."" 
       
      
    28   In the Second Reading Speech on the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Bill in 1995, the Attorney-General referred to that statement and described the provision as requiring the imposition of a sentence of penal servitude for life if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability ""in the commission of the offence"" is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met ""only"" through the imposition of that sentence. Otherwise he said s.442 provided for the exercise of a discretion to impose less than a life sentence. The Attorney-General and the drafting of the provision appear to have envisaged that it is the form the murder takes (ie., its factual circumstances) which is relevant. The Attorney-General said:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is appropriate to observe here that the offence of murder takes many and varied forms. It is difficult, if not impossible, to foresee every factual circumstance capable of constituting a murder which, on its face, demonstrates an extreme degree of criminality. We are not so prescient that we can confidently assert that there will never come a time when such a crime calls for something less than life imprisonment. It may well do so when the offender is a juvenile. For this reason the discretion to impose less than life remains, although it is a discretion which cannot be lightly exercised in the face of the principle expressed in the Bill."" 
       
      
    29   He had already said that the provision ""will mandate a life sentence for those offences to which the legislation applies and leave the community in no doubt of this Government's intention to remain tough on crime"". 
    30   When the successor to the Bill as originally introduced came before the Legislative Council on 17 April 1996, the Attorney-General reiterated his earlier observations, but added in the light of the report of the standing Committee on Law and Justice, a reference to an exemption for juveniles and a greater clarity to the role to be performed by s.442:- 
     
      
       
       ""Section 442 allows a sentencing judge to impose less than a life sentence in the exercise of his or her discretion. 
       
      
      
       
       The preservation of that discretion does no more than recognise the possibility that a murder, which, on its face, demonstrates an extreme degree of criminality, may nevertheless call for something less than life imprisonment. For this reason the discretion to impose less than life remains …"" 
       
      
    31   The provision plainly is intended to alter the common law applicable to sentencing for crimes for which a mere maximum is prescribed by the legislature. 
    32   Although the imposition of the sentence is described as lying in discretion, s.431B(1) on its face requires the imposition of the sentence in the event that the court is satisfied of the level of culpability therein expressed. 
    33   Considering what was said by the Attorney-General and the language used in s.431B(1), it appears that the section is meant to apply to the culpability involved in the commission of the crimes and that is not to be limited as defined merely by the immediate factual circumstances. 
    34   Even as to those, there is some doubt as to whether the relevant test requires the culpability of the factual circumstances of the individual offence, standing alone, to justify the imposition of penal servitude for life (see Regina v. Street (CCA, unreported 17 December 1996)). It is not necessary to resolve that matter here. 
    35   To ascertain the relevant culpability, in my view regard must be had to the criteria expressed in the section and the expression of them in Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 by the High Court when it dealt with the principle of proportionality and the appropriateness of a sentence passed to protect the community against recidivism where the prior record manifests a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. The court held that in those circumstances a more severe penalty may be warranted to serve the ends of retribution, deterrence and protection of society. It was held that it was legitimate to utilise the previous history to illuminate the moral culpability of the offender or as showing a dangerous propensity or a need to impose condign punishment to deter him and other offenders from committing similar offences. 
    36   Similarly, the purpose of sentencing has been expressed by Badgery-Parker, AJ. in Regina v. Dean Anthony & Michael Privett [1999] NSWSC 1076 when adopting what had been said by Allen, J. in Regina v. Camilleri (CCA, unreported 8 February 1990). His Honour quoted the following passage from that judgment:- 
     
      
       
       ""In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular crime it is always of importance to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. Unless that is done the other facts requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence cannot be given their rightful place. A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime in the sense that it should, having regard to the all the proved circumstances, accord with the general moral sense of the community. It should also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others. The purpose of that deterrence is to prevent the commission of such offences, and whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily subsidiary to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of punishment, that is the protection of the public. The fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society. Unless those basic principles of sentencing are adhered to, errors will occur."" 
       
      
    37   I consider that when regard is had to those principles on an evaluation of the particular facts and surrounding circumstances of the crime (in which I include other related crime or criminal record relevant in the sense referred to in Veen (No. 2) (supra)) and the conclusion reached that the level of culpability is such that the community's interests as so identified can only be met by the permanent deprivation of liberty then the maximum sentence is called for. 
    38   Here the Crown in the context of what had been said in Veen (No. 2) (supra) submitted that the very great heinousness to which Badgery-Parker, J. referred in Twala (supra) must be taken to include not only the actual manner in which the crime was committed, but also the antecedent criminal history of the offender. I accept that submission as applicable to s.431B criteria. 
    39   Some guidance may be gained from previous decisions for whether in these circumstances this case satisfies the statutory criteria even though they may have been given under the previous statutory or common law regime. 
    40   The offence of murder by reason of felony murder arising out of the use of a firearm in the course of an armed robbery is treated most seriously by the courts (see Regina v. Mills (Wood, J., unreported 2 June 1994). Here, as in Mills (supra), the prisoner had deliberately and consciously brought to the scene of the crime and presented to the deceased a weapon in a loaded state to commit an armed robbery and in circumstances where resistance or spontaneous or unwilled discharge of the weapon must, or should, have been in contemplation even in the prisoner's intoxicated state. Here the prisoner's record illustrates his familiarity with how the courts regard such conduct even without the fatal consequence. His crime was very grave indeed. 
    41   The suggestion that cases of felony murder such as this involve a lower level of culpability than cases of murder involving intention to kill and therefore should receive a lower level of sentence, has been rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Mills (CCA, unreported 3 April 1995). That rejection occurred in facts not unlike those in the present case. The court was of the view that in such circumstances such a case of murder involved a very high degree of seriousness. It did not, however, hold that such was the worst class of case. 
    42   But it is clear that there may be differing degrees of objective culpability even within felony murder (see Regina v. JB, Regina v. RJH [1999] NSWCCA 93). 
    43   In Regina v. Salameh [1999] NSWCCA 300, the Court of Criminal Appeal on an appeal against a re-determination of a life sentence to a sentence comprising a minimum term of 23 years and an additional term of the prisoner's natural life, considered the sentence in the context of circumstances not unlike the present. That offender had a prior record almost as appalling as that of the present prisoner and his circumstances had been assessed by the trial judge as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""The applicant's shocking criminal history and present background cause uncertainty in relation to the question of his rehabilitation. I believe there is a serious question as to the extent to which he would represent a danger to the community on being released to parole. On present indications there is a substantial basis for concluding that he will commit further crimes if he is released. This is not case of an uncharacteristic aberration. It is a case of an offender who has manifested a complete contempt of the courts and procedures of law in this country. In such a case retribution, deterrence and protection of society require that a more severe penalty is warranted than would ordinarily be the case."" 
       
      
    44   The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the sentence imposed by the trial judge applying the totality principle in accordance with what the High Court had said in The Queen v. Pearce (1998) 156 ALR 684. It was not suggested that that record was such that by application to the re-determination situation of the principles which now are expressed in s.431B, the appellant should be denied a determinate minimum term. 
    45   I have particular regard for the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment as provided for by s.19A, which removes forever the prospect of release, and what has been said in regard to that sentence in such cases as Garforth (supra); Regina v. Petrov (Hunt, CJ. at CL., unreported 12 November 1991); Regina v. Baker (CCA, unreported 20 September 1995) and Regina v. Rose (Levine, J., unreported 3 September 1998). 
    46   I have compared the circumstance of the present offence with those set out in the schedule of life sentences under s.19A with which I had been provided. The cases are not exhaustive but do embrace most of those where such a sentence has been passed. They include the sentences passed on John Wayne Glover, Rodney Francis Cameron, Malcolm George Baker, Maxwell Harold Trotter, Robert Mark Steele, Ivan Milat, Edwin Thomas Street, Richard William Leonard, Earl Heatley, Arthur Stanley Smith, Garry Zane Glasby and Lindsay Robert Rose. Most of these crimes involved multiple murders with a common factor or connection between the crimes such as would aggravate each (see Street (supra)). 
    47   Alternatively, they were crimes committed in circumstances of extreme callousness and depravity. They are to be contrasted with the crimes of murder for which sentences other than life imprisonment have been passed, an extensive schedule of which was also provided to me. I have also considered the sentence statistics from the Judicial Commission for what limited assistance they can give. 
    48   Even where, as here, the commission of the offence is attended by the circumstances and the appalling record I have referred to, and the position is such that, when considered in conjunction with the prisoner's drug addiction, the prospect of the prisoner ever being rehabilitated or, at least, being rehabilitated prior to, as Dr. Westmore put it, ""advancing years in and of themselves being … likely to reduce his overall risks of re-offending"" is limited, nonetheless, after considering in the way I have described the kinds of case for which the life penalty has been imposed, I am not satisfied , even before turning to the prisoner's subjective circumstances, that the prisoner's present crime meets the statutory criteria. 
    49   I accept that the life penalty is not reserved for those crimes where there is no possibility of rehabilitation (Garforth (supra)). 
    50   Having evaluated all relevant matters, I have concluded that this is not a case where the circumstances require the imposition of the sentence under s.431B(1). I am of the view that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met otherwise than by the imposition of that sentence in the context of the discretion that remains with me. I am therefore not satisfied of the matters of which I must be satisfied before passing the mandatory sentence. 
    51   I am of the view that the sentence that I will pass will be of such length that, even in the context of Dr. Westmore's observations, the purposes of sentencing referred to in the section and by the High Court in Veen (No. 2) (supra) will be served and that the statutory criteria can be met by a determinate sentence. 
    52   However, having regard to the prisoner's prior record in the sense referred to in Veen (No. 2) (supra), together with the fact that the armed robbery offence he was committing was itself an offence which approached the worst class of case for such offences, even putting aside its fatal consequences, and to the fact that a life has been taken in this way make it necessary, notwithstanding the prisoner's subjective circumstances to which I will turn in a moment, to pass on the prisoner a sentence of great severity. 
    53   I note also that it would appear likely, because of the prisoner's record of escapes and breaches of parole, that whilst in custody he will be detained in circumstances of strict security for a substantial portion of his sentence. Whilst this may be onerous for him, nonetheless, it arises because of his own actions and although regard must be had to that matter, it cannot itself or in combination with the other subjective circumstances, reduce the length of the sentence that must be passed to such a point that the sentence would become unduly disproportionate to the extreme gravity of his crime. 
    54   I turn to matters personal to the prisoner. His incarceration history as summarised by Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko commenced with his entry to a boys' home at the age of 10½, the Juvenile Justice System at age 14 and to adult gaols at age 18 when he acquired his heroin dependence. He has had very little experience with any other community life or with personal relationships. 
    55   He had told Dr. Westmore that during the 10 years prior to his release from custody shortly before committing this offence, he had been on methadone and about four to six weeks after his release started re-using heroin, having formed his association with the prisoner Jancek. 
    56   I take the following material from the unchallenged recitation of the prisoner's prior circumstances in the report of Dr. Westmore. 
    57   He had initially turned to cannabis at 15 and heroin at 18. He had also tried numerous other illegal substances. He has been unable, despite a number of attempts, to achieve any degree of rehabilitation, notwithstanding his attending the WHO's Programme and having been involved in gaol programmes for many years. 
    58   He was born in Yugoslavia and came to Australia with his family at the age of one year. His parents separated when he was aged 10 or 11 years. His father took him back to Yugoslavia against his mother's wishes and she had disappeared when he and his father returned to Australia. He lived at that time with his father but his father did not send him to school. His mother, with whom he has lately resumed some contact, lives in Newcastle and he has siblings with whom he has a poor relationship except with his younger brother. 
    59   Dr. Westmore, after referring to the prisoner's father not sending him to school, continues:- 
     
      
       
       ""Welfare agencies became involved and Mr. Petrinovic was initially placed into the care of family friends who were unkind and possibly abused him. He ran away from that home and was then cared for by a prostitute and her boyfriend. The police caught him and he was put into a boys' home for two years. At that time he could not return to his father because the welfare authorities would not allow this and his mother did not want him. 
       
      
      
       
       He was then placed into another institution for two years because there was nowhere else for him to go. He ran away to Kings Cross where he met another young person and they went to Tamworth where the young person had lived. 
       
      
      
       
       In Tamworth Mr. Petrinovic and the young person broke into garages, they were caught and Mr. Petrinovic was placed back into a boys' home for nine months. He was aged 14½ at this time. 
       
      
      
       
       His mother than agreed to take him back provided he got a job and he then worked with a carpenter until the age of 18. He lived at some stage in Bathurst with the carpenter and his family and he worked successfully there until work ran out and he returned to Sydney. 
       
      
      
       
       Back in Sydney he engaged in a break and enter matter and was sent to prison for 12 months and it was at that time that he started using heroin. 
       
      
      
       
       On his release he was breaking and entering homes to get money to provide for his heroin habit and he then served another nine months in prison, being released in April 1982. 
       
      
      
       
       He returned to prison in January 1983 for two armed robberies, he did four years and escaped from custody once during that sentence. He was then out of prison for four and a half months before being detained again for a series of armed robberies, he received a sentence of 10 years. He was then out of prison again for four and a half months before the current matter occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       I asked him about education and he said he attended first form and possibly second form, he is literate. I enquired about employment and he said he worked with the carpenter between the ages of 14½ and 18 but he has held no other employment. He has held some short term relationships and he has some prison tattoos."" 
       
      
    60   Dr. Westmore detected no psychosis but concluded his report:- 
     
      
       
       ""This 39 year old man has, from the history, clearly led a life of extreme deprivation. He has been institutionalised for most of his life, this occurred after his parents separated when he was aged 10 or 11 years. The initial disappearance of his mother and later her rejection of him would have been extremely traumatic for this man when he was a child. Mr. Petrinovic's father also appears to have had some difficulties and that man failed to make Mr. Petrinovic attend school which attracted the attention of the welfare authorities. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Petrinovic has had a severely restricted education and a very limited work history. The most stable period of his life appears to have occurred between the ages of 14½ and 18 when he was working with a carpenter and living for a period with that man and his family. 
       
      
      
       
       At the age of 18 while in custody he was introduced to the drug heroin, he developed a habit which extended up until the most recent incident. While serving a term of imprisonment which lasted 10 years he commenced methadone and he continued methadone on his release from custody but he was unable to remain heroin free. The incident before the court at the time occurred as a direct consequence of this man's heroin addiction, his possession of a firearm and perhaps to some extent a degree of polydrug intoxication. 
       
      
      
       
       During my meeting with him he appeared to be a subdued, despondent man with a restricted affect. He spoke spontaneously about his feelings of sadness regarding the death of the deceased and he talked about his life in a rather hopeless way. 
       
      
      
       
       He no doubt suffers a degree of institutionalisation having been incarcerated for such an extended period of time. He is unskilled and he has had a very limited experience with employment. I am uncertain what 'pre-release support' this man had before his discharge back into the community or what support was available to him in the months leading up to this offence but in many ways looking at his life history one could almost have predicted that this man would have experienced further difficulties when he returned to the community. His deprived background, his lack of education and opportunity, his heroin habit, his history of offending all placed him in the high risk category of being unable to cope, adjust or survive back in the community. 
       
      
      
       
       He is resigned to facing an extremely long sentence and he appeared to accept this as being an inevitable part of the sequence of events which followed the death of Mr. Hagarty. 
       
      
      
       
       This man obviously is unlikely to be released for a number of years and while it is too early to predict his re-offending risk at this time, one can say that advancing years in and of themselves are likely to reduce his overall risks of re-offending. Hopefully during his incarceration he will receive some drug counselling and eventually become methadone free."" 
       
      
    61   Even accepting, as I do, that the prisoner's childhood was deprived, and that in the circumstances his addiction could hardly be described as a considered matter of personal choice, nonetheless it appears to me that at best one can say that the prospect of recidivism is high and that there is little, if any, prospect of rehabilitation except in the sense spoken of by Dr. Westmore. The sentence I intend to impose will involve retribution, deterrence and protection for a period so long that Dr. Westmore's observation cannot, from a view this remote, be predicted as likely to be incorrect. 
    62   This is a man for whom there is little prospect and against whom, because of the matters to which I have referred, the community is entitled to have protection, in the light of his addiction and the record of the crimes he has committed in feeding that addiction. This is not to say that record is to be used to aggravate the sentence. But it is to say one can find little room for leniency that might otherwise have been compassionately extended where the community is put at such risk and where a crime so grave, as involves the taking of a human life, particularly in circumstances so serious as this armed robbery, has been committed. There is a necessity to deter him and others and to protect the community against his demonstrated dangerous propensity. 
    63   It would be appropriate since the sentence I will impose already reflects the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole, that it be dated from the day on which the prisoner returned to custody, 26 October 1997 in accordance with the principle stated in Regina v. Kaiva (CCA, unreported 9 November 1998). 
    64   I also consider that the length of the sentence and the obvious necessity that the prisoner should be under supervision for a very long while, if on parole after serving such a long custodial period, constitutes special circumstances in that a longer than usual additional term will be required and I am of the view that a lengthy additional term in this case is appropriate as a continuing sanction. 
    65   Regulation 10A of the Sentencing (General) Regulation 1996 provides that terms or conditions of parole orders must not require the offender to be subject to supervision for a period of more than three years after the date of release but that the Board may, in the case of a serious offender, vary the term or condition so as to extend the period of supervision for a further period of up to three years, once only. Such a condition will become a condition of parole pursuant to Regulation 10 and as a consequence, supervision will be provided pursuant to Regulation 11. 
    66   Thus up to six years of supervision may be provided, however, the additional term does not exist solely for the purpose of the provision of supervision. Indeed, an additional term should reflect those elements referred to by the High Court in Regina v. Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 and may well include, in addition to a period for which supervision is prescribed, a further period during which the offender remains subject to the sanction of return to custody so as to reinforce rehabilitation and to provide protection, albeit of a more limited kind than that provided for by custody, to the community. At this time I would consider both the availability of that sanction and the extended period of supervision to be most important matters. 
    67   Having regard to all the above circumstances, I am of the view that a total sentence of 27 years penal servitude with a minimum term of 20 years is called for.  
    68   Mr. Petrinovic you are sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum term of 20 years to date from 26 October 1997 and to expire on 25 October 2017. There will be an additional term thereafter of seven years to date from 26 October 2017 and to expire on 25 October 2024. The earliest date on which the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole is 25 October 2017.

      70052/97 - REGINA v David John WRIGHT 
      
     
     
      
     SENTENCE1    HER HONOUR: On 23 August 1999 the prisoner, David John Wright, was arraigned on an indictment charging him with the murder of Geoffrey Compton at Riverwood on 16 October 1996. To this indictment he entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Compton which was accepted in full discharge of the indictment. I am informed that the basis upon which the plea was accepted was one of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. It is upon this basis that the prisoner will be sentenced.2    On the evening of 16 October 1996 Geoffrey Compton was drinking at the Riverwood Inn, Riverwood. It appears that he was intoxicated and his behaviour towards a number of patrons of the hotel was disruptive. At about 9.30pm the prisoner became involved in a verbal altercation with the deceased. The prisoner did not initiate this incident. It led to the two of them leaving the hotel and going outside to the carpark where they started fighting. At one point the deceased was seen to be holding the prisoner in a headlock and punching him about the head. During this fight the prisoner stabbed the deceased with a knife which he, the prisoner, was carrying. The deceased suffered four stab wounds, one to the ear, two small wounds to the groin area, and the fatal wound, a 20 millimetre wound to the heart. It was while the prisoner was seen to be being held in the headlock that other patrons came over and separated the two. The prisoner walked off in the direction of Bonds Road. It was not clear at that time that the deceased had received a fatal injury. Patrons of the hotel held the deceased over a car bonnet in the immediate aftermath of the fight and attempted to calm him.3    At the time of his death Geoffrey Compton was aged 23 years. He was the father of an infant boy, Brett. He came from a very close family who have been devastated by his loss. I have received victim impact statements prepared by Dawn Compton, his mother, Michael O'Driscoll, his stepfather, Bernadette Le-Anne Compton, his sister, and Darren Compton, his 11 year old nephew. The court extends its sympathy to the Compton family who have suffered the tragic loss of a son, brother and uncle who was much loved and who formed an important part of family life.4    I note the approach adopted to the receipt of statements pursuant to  
     
      
      s 23C(3) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986 by Hunt CJ at CL in  
      Regina v Previtera 
       (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. I have applied that approach in the instant case. 
      
    5    The prisoner was aged 31 at the date of the offence and is now 34. He appears to have had a relatively unremarkable childhood. He was raised in a family where there was some conflict between both parents but they made an attempt to keep this from him. He was particularly close to his mother. When he was a young man his parents separated and his mother moved to Queensland where she remarried. The marriage was an unhappy one characterised by violence towards her. The prisoner has shown a caring concern for his mother. When she decided to leave her second husband he helped her move back to Sydney. In 1986 she suffered a disabling stroke and the prisoner has been endeavouring to look after her since that crisis.6    The prisoner is described as having had a normal psychosocial development not characterised by any problems in engaging in social relationships.7    He left school in Year 9 and commenced working with Eastway Wire Works doing welding work. He was only 14 years and 10 months at this time. He left that employment for a better job at Scanlons Sweets where he worked for three years. At the age of 18 he obtained employment with the Sydney City Council. He started off as a street sweeper but progressed to become a mechanical plant operator. He enjoyed his job, he made friends and remained with the council for nearly nine years. This employment came to an end in early 1991 when he was imprisoned following his conviction on a charge of robbery with wounding.8    The prisoner was released from custody in 1993. Prior to release he had been working with Hearne Body Works under the day-release work program. He appears to have been a good employee and the firm offered him full-time employment upon his release. He remained in that employment until the end of 1994. He left Hearne Body Works to work as a nurses aid in a nursing home. Following this he was employed by Linfox as a truck driver. While engaged in this employment he was hospitalised following an injury to his foot. This was in late 1995.9    The prisoner did not resume employment after discharge from hospital. He was unemployed at the date of the offence. I accept that the prisoner has generally been an adaptable and hard working individual.10    The prisoner met his first girlfriend, Dorothy, when he was 14 years old. They were later to form a defacto relationship and lived together for 17 years. They have two children, Garry who is 17 and Corey aged 5. The prisoner maintains a close relationship with Corey. He sees less of Garry who is presently seen to be making his own way in life.11    It appears that when the prisoner was aged about 24 he and a friend experimented by taking some liquid amphetamine. The prisoner had not previously used this drug although he was a regular user of marijuana. While under the influence of the amphetamine he committed the offence of robbery with wounding. I have been furnished with some material concerning that offence. It occurred on 30 September 1990 and involved the robbery at knife point of the proprietor of a milk bar in Cabramatta. In the course of the robbery one of the victims took hold of the prisoner and sustained a laceration to his mouth area and to his right index finger. On 24 May 1991 the prisoner was sentenced to an overall sentence of three years penal servitude comprising a minimum term of two years and three months and an additional term of nine months by the presiding judge at the Liverpool District Court.12    Among the materials before me is a report of Dr Robert Lewin dated 6 May 1991 which appears to have been before the court at the sentence hearing on the robbery matter. Dr Lewin detailed the prisoner's account of long term problem marijuana use. Otherwise, the doctor detected no signs of an antisocial personality. He had regard to the prisoner's background of stable employment and relationship and considered that it was unlikely that the prisoner would re-offend.13    Following his release from custody in 1993 the prisoner encountered a number of difficulties. Dorothy had become involved in a relationship with another man while he was in custody. The couple made attempts to preserve their relationship but ultimately they separated in 1996. Dorothy now lives with the other man. The break up in the relationship with Dorothy occurred only a matter of months after the prisoner's mother suffered her stroke. There is evidence before me which I accept that the prisoner was profoundly affected by both incidents.14    Not long after his release from prison, at a time when the prisoner and Dorothy were fighting over her affair, he moved out of home for a while into accommodation with some male friends. It was at this time of crisis in his life that he commenced using heroin. He appears to have been a heroin user for a period of four yours. Ultimately he decided to enter the Langton Clinic detoxification program. He was motivated to overcome his drug problem in order to properly care for his mother. On first admission to the Langton Clinic he left following the detoxification phase without completing the after care component. He subsequently sought re-admission as soon as the mandatory ""ten day re-admission turnaround"" period had passed, and successfully completed the program some two weeks prior to the commission of the present offence.15    The prisoner told Dr Devlin, psychologist, that while on remand he had been abusing various prescription medications. At the time Dr Devlin assessed him he presented as despondent and gave a history of suicidal thoughts. He described himself as being depressed and complained of poor sleep and generalised anxiety. He was suffering obsessive thoughts in relation to the offence.16    On 24 September 1996 the prisoner was the victim of an assault. He had been spending time with a woman named Petina. Her boyfriend became jealous, believing that the two were having a sexual relationship. It appears that the boyfriend made threats on several occasions to the prisoner, saying, among other things, ""I know where you live"". Ultimately the boyfriend is said to have carried out the threat and to have struck the prisoner across the face with a crowbar. Details of the prisoner's injuries are set out in the notes of the St George Hospital which were tendered on the prisoner's behalf. The prisoner's assailant smashed the headlights of his car and warned him to stay away from Petina. It was after this incident that the prisoner started to carry a knife as a means of protection.17    On the day of the killing the prisoner was drinking alcohol in the company of some other men. I have been assisted by a report prepared by Assistant Professor Starmer, pharmacologist, concerning the probable level of his alcohol consumption. The Professor based his opinion on the statements of the various witnesses who were present at the hotel on that evening and the prisoner’s account. It is not necessary to detail the contents of the Professor's report. Suffice to say I accept his opinion that the prisoner was at the time of the killing grossly affected by alcohol. The prisoner does not have a history of alcohol abuse. His consumption on this occasion was, I accept, uncharacteristic.18    The prisoner gave an account to Dr Devlin that he had few memories of the night of the offence. He was not able to recall any verbal altercations with the deceased prior to the fatal fight. He says that as he was leaving the hotel the deceased followed him to the door. They arrived at the door simultaneously and he, the prisoner, became frightened. Once outside he recalled the deceased had grabbed him and placed him in a headlock and was punching him in the vicinity of the jaw and the head. Dr Devlin said this in her report: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... it is quite possible that he was hypervigilant to the potential for serious harm being done to him and that the attack brought about memories associated with the previous assault and that he overreacted as a result."" 
        
       
      
    19    Dr Devlin was cross-examined at some length. I was impressed with her. Her report was based upon two interviews with the prisoner. In total she had spent about five hours with him. She had gone back on the second occasion with a list of questions to take up with the prisoner. She struck me as a careful and thorough psychologist. Her qualifications are impressive and include a background in policing. She assessed the prisoner as having been frank in his interviews with her and I accept that assessment.20    Dr Devlin considered that during the fight with the deceased the prisoner had what she described as ""an exaggerated sense of danger"". I accept this evidence and propose to approach the sentencing of the prisoner upon this basis. It was Dr Devlin's view that the prisoner's exaggerated fears for his safety, arising out of the earlier attack, made the present offence qualitatively different to the earlier robbery matter.21    Generally, it was Dr Devlin's opinion that the prisoner presents a greater threat to himself than to others. He was severely depressed in her view and suicidal when she spoke to him. She assessed the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation in these terms: ""(they) are reasonably good if he can get some psychological assistance, psychiatric assistance, or something of that nature specifically targeting relapse prevention"".22    The prisoner is presently involved in a relationship with Sarah-Jayne Van Sydam. Prior to being taken into custody on remand the two were living together. Ms Van Sydam comments on her observations of the prisoner's concerns about his mother's illness. She describes the prisoner as being generally responsible in the conduct of his family life.23    A letter from the prisoner's mother, Mrs Maralyn Lowe, attests to him as a devoted and caring son. Dr Grahame Browne, a Fairfield general practitioner who has been treating the prisoner, described him in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""David presents as an anxious but friendly young man interested in progressing with his life. He is afraid of being attacked in gaol and worries about his mother's poor health. He has developed a stable, loving relationship and his drug dependency problem is well managed."" 
        
       
      
    24    It is to be noted that whilst in custody on remand following his arrest in relation to this matter the prisoner was assaulted. He was apparently hit on the head from behind. He was not able to say with what he was hit. He lost consciousness for a period. He was examined by medical staff attached to the Corrections Health Service who observed lacerations to his scalp and several areas of contusion involving the left forearm, right index finger, right ribs and upper lip. He was placed in protective custody following that assault.25    I was referred to a number of cases involving the sentencing of offenders for manslaughter: Regina v Taouk (unreported, CCA, 20 March 1992); Regina v Azar (1991) 56 A Crim R 414; Regina v Owen (unreported, CCA, 5 June 1996); Regina v Sofokleous (unreported, CCA, 13 December 1993); Regina v Bryant (unreported, CCA, 26 June 1999) and Regina v Lamb (unreported, Hidden J, 20 March 1998).26    In Regina v Blacklidge (unreported, CCA, 12 December 1995) his Honour Gleeson CJ in a judgment, with which Grove J and Ireland J agreed, observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.” 
        
       
       
      
    27    I must have regard to the consideration that the unlawful taking of a human life is always to be viewed as a serious crime. The respect for and protection of human life is a primary objective of our system of criminal justice; R v MacDonald (unreported, NSWCCA, 12 December 1995).28    I accept that the prisoner was not the aggressor at the commencement of the incident which led to the death of the deceased. The accounts of the witnesses Peter McCaw and Adrian Newman suggest that the deceased in his intoxicated state was harassing a number of patrons of the hotel. It appears from Mr McCaw's statement that the deceased was being somewhat aggressive towards the prisoner during a verbal exchange inside the hotel. Marc Jones, another patron, attempted to reason with the deceased and was abused by him. The witness Dean Velovich described the deceased as being aggressive and drunk at the time of the incident. On his account there had been verbal altercations between the prisoner and the deceased on several occasions inside the hotel. In each instance it was the deceased who commenced the incident. Mr Velovich had on one occasion taken the deceased aside and unsuccessfully sought to quieten him down.29    In the light of the evidence of Dr Devlin I accept that the prisoner had, in the weeks prior to this incident, taken to carrying a knife for the purposes of his own protection. Notwithstanding the earlier robbery offence, in the light of the evidence of Dr Devlin, and having regard to the prisoner's background of stable employment and relationships, I am prepared to accept that he is not a person generally given to violence.30    Notwithstanding the circumstance that the prisoner had taken to arming himself with a knife for reasons of self protection, the fact that the offence was carried out with a knife remains a matter of aggravation: Regina v Azar; Regina v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58.31    I take into account the prisoner's plea of guilty.32    I consider that the present offence occurred spontaneously against a background involving the prisoner being grossly affected by alcohol. The circumstance that he was not a regular drinker to my mind means that the alcohol intoxication does not aggravate the offence.33    I consider the offence is mitigated by my acceptance that the prisoner was not the aggressor and that he entertained genuine, if exaggerated, fears for his safety following the assault upon him weeks earlier by a person armed with a crowbar.34    Notwithstanding the prisoner's criminal record I am of the view that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.35    I was invited to find special circumstances within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1987 arising out of the evidence of Dr Devlin as to the prisoner's need for professional support in the nature of counselling targeting relapse prevention. The Crown joined in this submission commending it as an appropriate course in the light of that evidence. I do find special circumstances justify a departure from the statutory relationship between minimum and additional terms.36    The prisoner was arrested on 18 October 1996. He was refused bail and remained in custody until his release on bail granted by a Justice of this Court on 26 March 1997. I remanded him in custody on 23 August 1999 when he entered his plea. I propose back-dating the sentence which I impose to 23 August 1999. I consider that an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case is one of seven years comprising a minimum term of four years and an additional term of three years. I intend reducing this to take into account the period of five months and eight days already served on remand in relation to this offence alone.37    David John Wright, I sentence you to serve a minimum term of three years and six months and twenty-two days penal servitude to commence on 23 August 1999 and to expire on 16 March 2003. I impose an additional term to commence on 17 March 2003 and to expire on 13 March 2006.
